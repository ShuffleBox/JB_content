00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
This is KOTORadio, episode 480 for August 22nd, 2022.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,720
Hey good buddy, welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,920
at the art and the business, the software development, and the world of technology.

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,720
I, a man trapped in time, my name is Chris, and I am joined by my time lord, Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,720
Hello Mike.

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,440
So now I have to ask you which doctor you think I would be, so you're going to do this?

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,040
We're turning into a Facebook quiz now.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,960
No, I think you're actually the time traveler in TNG that shows up and like puts his hands

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,000
on the equipment and then makes the machines like go crazy, and then the machine has super

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,080
warp speeds and all that.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
I think you're that guy.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,640
At least you didn't say I'm hardcore Fenton Mudd, so I'll take it.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,360
No, but I would like to know what you did to Wesley, so there is that.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
He's fine.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,680
He's hanging out with the Klingons, he's having a great time.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,680
My homie Takuvma is taking good care of him, it's all good.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,600
Oh good, good, good, good, hanging out, hanging out.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,000
But not hanging out with you, because you're going to be at TCGCon Tampa.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,320
I am.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,540
That mana tapping monkey is back on my back, known as Magic the Gathering.

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,440
It's uh, oh did I fall off the wagon hard.

22
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
You know what, I like it.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
It's properly nerdy.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,200
I think it's good for you, you know.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,080
I've already done a commander event, and I'm going this week again to, I think it's commander

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
again.

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,840
Which as someone who hasn't really played Magic in like 10 years other than Arena, that's

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,080
some crazy diabolical politicking stuff for folks who don't know.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,600
It's a weird multiplayer format, but it's both competitive and cray cray.

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,440
So yeah, a lot of fun TCGCon.

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,120
I will be there at least Saturday, I might go Sunday, depending on how fast I get my

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,680
ass kicked.

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Pretty good.

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
If you're in the area, come say hi.

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,320
I will be wearing something super nerdy.

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,200
Really this is the first one they're doing in Tampa, and the ticket prices reflect that.

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,400
It's very affordable, surprisingly so.

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,040
So yeah, I figured why not.

39
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,400
I live literally like it's like a 30 minute drive or less, so.

40
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,040
Oh, that's great.

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
That's great.

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
I'm jealous.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,080
I have been like in an event drought, and the events that I have been like that have

44
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,480
been made possible, like that I have been invited to, I guess, the words are hard today.

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,880
Just haven't really worked out, haven't been practical, so good for you.

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Get out there.

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,800
Go say hi to Mike in Tampa, if you're in the Tampa area.

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
I'm jelly.

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
I'd love to go.

50
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
I bet the weather is going to be great.

51
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,360
I bet you'll get your butt kicked.

52
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
That'd be great to watch.

53
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
I'm sure.

54
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,720
I was going to say for you, it's watching me get stomped, but yeah, did you ever play

55
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
magic?

56
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
No, I never got sucked in.

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
I don't know.

58
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,360
Maybe I was just maybe I got sucked into other stuff, but magic I somehow managed to avoid

59
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
that in Pokemon.

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,720
I managed to avoid both of those somehow.

61
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,280
Yeah, that's probably for the best.

62
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,680
I even got my kid into it.

63
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
Yeah, I would.

64
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
I would.

65
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
I mean, let's be honest.

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
I would too, right?

67
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Because that's fun.

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,960
He also helps me sort the cards because, you know, child labor is the best kind of labor.

69
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
That is.

70
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Yeah, they can.

71
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
You know what?

72
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
I know.

73
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
I know about it for a fact.

74
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
They can be good at card sorting.

75
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,600
No, I won't tell you how I know, but I know for a fact.

76
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,000
Nick knows for a fact that he ain't kidding around no more.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
He's got S to do.

78
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Things have changed around.

79
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,160
He says, Hey, Chris and Michael, I want to say cheers to Chris.

80
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,040
I don't remember exactly when I started listening to JB, but it was somewhere in 2012 or so.

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,760
So it's been 10 years for sure.

82
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,080
So thanks for all the shows.

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,120
Well, thank you for listening.

84
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,400
Now onto the main topic.

85
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,080
I was doing some catching up on Coder Radio recently, and I stumbled on your discussion

86
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,080
about Mac OS and Windows stealing Linux desktop users.

87
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,160
Well, I'm a recent six months or so Windows convert after 10 years of exclusive Linux

88
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,160
desktop use.

89
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,320
So I wanted to chime in.

90
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,460
I guess I'm older now.

91
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,440
And while in 2012 I was a student, nowadays I have a day job with responsibilities.

92
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,180
So I really like my machines to just sort of be appliances.

93
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,560
You turn it on, runs, does what I want.

94
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
That's it.

95
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,800
And honestly, desktop Linux become too much of a hassle for me.

96
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,840
As stupid as this might sound to some, Windows is the ultimate LTS.

97
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,280
If you apply some basic best practices like having a backup and not running from sites

98
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,160
with pictures of naked ladies, it just runs.

99
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,680
Everything works because everything is written with Windows in mind.

100
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,440
Further, besides WSL, I think Redmond has got two more things that might snare some

101
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,680
Linux users.

102
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,840
One is this new Windows terminal.

103
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,840
Well, things good.

104
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,360
Also, did you know SSH is installed and on by default now?

105
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,920
You fire it up and you can SSH into Windows like it was a Linux box.

106
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,520
The other thing I hear nobody mentioning is Hyper-V. Nowadays, we all have pretty beefy

107
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,480
machines, so why not run VMs?

108
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,160
Hyper-V is no problem for anybody that ever had to run Vert Manager.

109
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,560
Its ultimate killer feature, though, is dynamic memory management that just works, meaning

110
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,080
VMs do not use all the memory you allocate to them, but just what they need right now.

111
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,760
I could run two, three, four Linux VMs daily and not even worry about memory at all.

112
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,120
I know it's possible to do these kinds of things with KVM, but I just never managed

113
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
to get it right.

114
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,600
Here, it's just a checkbox.

115
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Do I find all of this problematic?

116
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
No.

117
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
No.

118
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,960
Now that I don't run Linux, I run way more Linux.

119
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,360
I have various Linux machines where I can tinker when time permits and I use VMs daily

120
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,580
for critical things like backups.

121
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,080
And yeah, I am eyeing those damn MacBooks.

122
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
It might just be a matter of time.

123
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Best regards.

124
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,720
Of course you are.

125
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,440
You know, the only thing that strikes me about this, Nick, but otherwise I totally feel where

126
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,800
you're coming from, is you might still be in the honeymoon period.

127
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,000
You know, six months with Windows usually takes about a year, I find, with a Windows

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Insta.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,840
For your registry to be completely polluted, yes.

130
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,740
Well, and just to start getting a little tired, you know, of the way Microsoft does things.

131
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,740
Just that.

132
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,040
But I do remember when we tried Windows 10 for the show, which feels like ages ago, though,

133
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,640
I do remember very much having what he said in here where, like, everything's just built

134
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,500
for Windows.

135
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,880
It's like, you just, you can get anything.

136
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,120
There's every application, even like the esoteric free software stuff, is built for Windows.

137
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,040
So like, and it's, there's only one Windows, really.

138
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,480
So it's not like you, you know, you don't have to worry about devs and RPMs.

139
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,480
There's just the Windows build and everything supports Windows.

140
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
It's so nice.

141
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
That's so nice.

142
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,520
As a Linux user, that, you don't always have that experience.

143
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,640
It's pretty common these days.

144
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Sure.

145
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:41,480
I mean, it's, I don't know, I sort of feel like the Linux app compatibility stuff is

146
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,480
kind of better than Mac at this point.

147
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Hmm.

148
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:51,400
Because if you care about like games, I guess, because still no viable proton for Mac.

149
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,760
I know people have sent me the link every time I say that, but that is a hell of a lot

150
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
of work.

151
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
All right.

152
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,040
Our next email comes in from Christopher and he's dropping some Glad Whale bombs.

153
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
He says, hi guys.

154
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,680
I've been a show member since you returned and I'm glad I have the opportunity to support

155
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
you.

156
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Well, thank you, sir.

157
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Hmm.

158
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,720
Just thinking about how damn thankful I am for our members this morning, so thank you.

159
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,040
He goes on to say your take on Malcolm Gladwell is spot on in Coder 478.

160
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,960
I see him as a bit of a bomb thrower who enjoys intellectually tossing incendiary statements

161
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,160
and watching the carnage of sociopaths abandoning their own thoughts and beliefs without critically

162
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,320
analyzing what he's actually saying.

163
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,040
What Gladwell is really saying against remote work is that work is a cult and you must stay

164
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,960
in the compound.

165
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,360
I like that he's like, he says Gladwell is playing like 40 chess here.

166
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,280
I like that he just went for it.

167
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,640
That's pretty, pretty hardcore.

168
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
Yeah.

169
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
I mean, I don't know.

170
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,040
I, I can't say that I'm super aligned with how colorful this opinion is, but I definitely

171
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
agree with the facts.

172
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
I love it.

173
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
I don't know if I do agree.

174
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,880
I think Gladwell does believe what he was saying.

175
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,560
So quick recap for those that didn't hear it.

176
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,120
We played a clip of Malcolm Gladwell, author, podcaster who said, you know, don't you want

177
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,520
to be a part of something?

178
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,820
Don't you want to be your best you?

179
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,480
Don't you want to do your best work of your life?

180
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,040
Well, then you have to come into the office.

181
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,680
That was basically his position.

182
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
I don't know.

183
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,080
I mean, I, I guess I, I guess I don't agree with you that I sort of feel like he, he says

184
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,440
things like most people that align to his incentives and to his fear group.

185
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,400
And uh, I mean, I have read all his things in favor of working in a cafe or in a, I think

186
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,080
it was like a pub that played some kind of cool rock music that he liked.

187
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Right.

188
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,560
So I don't know, you know, it's people tend to just pitch their own book, right?

189
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,880
I, well, here's my thought and I hate to be this guy, but maybe he's not a digital native,

190
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
right?

191
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,720
Maybe he's not fully aware of all the tooling available to remote workers these days because

192
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,200
really the best stuff is not used by most, by most organizations.

193
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,600
They're sort of like during the pandemic, we got to this new minimum quality bar, which

194
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,840
was way better than it was before the pandemic.

195
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,580
Like before the pandemic, most people didn't have cameras.

196
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,800
Their wifi couldn't handle video conferencing.

197
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
It was horrible.

198
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Right.

199
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,000
And we got to this new bar, but that bar is basically zoom, right?

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,080
And you know, a Mac book camera and uh, air pod microphones.

201
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,440
I don't know, I mean, I think for tech workers in particular and developers, I mean, some

202
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,240
of the, the, uh, joint coding stuff or whatever we call that pair programming stuff in VS

203
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,040
code is really in a very short amount of time has become incredibly impressive.

204
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,420
See, I think that's just it.

205
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,480
I think that's the difference between a successful remote work culture and the picture that Malcolm

206
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
Gladwell was painting.

207
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,540
Malcolm Gladwell, I think is painting the picture of the organization that doesn't take

208
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,040
advantages of things like pair programming.

209
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,240
But organizations like yours that are nimbler, uh, more up to speed on the tooling, more

210
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,920
adaptable, more accommodating because of your size, you can employ things like VS code pair

211
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,960
programming extensions that would take years to make their way into an enterprise, right?

212
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,880
And that's, I think Malcolm's insight is the older school way of doing things.

213
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:13,240
This zoom level of quality for remote work, not your version, which is, is much more dynamic.

214
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
It's just much more collaborative.

215
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
Well, it's also asynchronous by default, right?

216
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,600
That, that, I mean, for me, you know, cause I've gone back and forth on the remote thing,

217
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,400
having to just give up on the idea that things are going to happen at the same time every

218
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,600
day.

219
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,200
Once I made that sort of mental shift, a lot of my, let's say irritation as you know, the

220
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,280
guy who wants the company went away, not expecting like, okay, it's 10 o'clock.

221
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Where the hell is he?

222
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Right?

223
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Like that kind of thing.

224
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
There's a downside, right?

225
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,160
And the downside of that is people do get used to it.

226
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,560
And occasionally you're going to have to literally not aggressively, but you're going to have

227
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,360
to do the old fashioned thing of just like call someone on their phone, even though they're

228
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,640
not online, which I don't know why that feels super rude, but I feel like the culture has

229
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,480
changed so much that just out of like calling someone about saying, Hey, you have a minute

230
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,800
for a call feels like super intrusive, but that's, that's like the, the, the, you know,

231
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
the emergency move.

232
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Right.

233
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
That's right.

234
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Yeah.

235
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,880
That's like a text ahead of time, like, Hey man, you got a second, like that's like, there

236
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
must be something wrong.

237
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
What is it?

238
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
What's wrong?

239
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
What's wrong?

240
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Right.

241
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Right.

242
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Yeah.

243
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
That's, that's, I don't know.

244
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,080
I mean, I would also add, and I don't want to hit this too hard, that I think a lot of

245
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,360
this, uh, particularly for one, I think there's probably a generational component here too,

246
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
right?

247
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,800
You know, older generations like that are at the top of these large enterprises, basically

248
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,880
boomers, probably it's just a lot of change for them, right?

249
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,000
They've been in, think about this, if you're in your sixties or even early seventies and

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,320
these kids today are asked kids today in their forties and thirties are asking you to change

251
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
what you've been doing.

252
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
It was good for you.

253
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Good for your dad.

254
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,560
I think you'd fight and let's not leave, let's not ignore the Larry Ellison thing here of

255
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
ego.

256
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:10,640
A lot of these guys are, see themselves as like Kings and there's, and it's true that

257
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,920
it certainly is appealing to walk into a place and like, it's your domain, right?

258
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,240
I would, uh, these are all my people everywhere.

259
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,880
These fluorescent lights touch is my kingdom.

260
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,840
I would point you to what does look quite a bit like a penis, the Salesforce tower.

261
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,800
I think I could just leave that one where it is, right?

262
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
It's literally their castle.

263
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Yeah.

264
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,240
It's literally something else too, but it's a very phallic castle.

265
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
All right.

266
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,240
So Jacob writes in kind of like with the context of, Oh, I think everybody's, everybody's feeling

267
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,680
a little subscription exhausted, but, uh, he says this is probably one of the most thoughtfully

268
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,080
written reason explanations for a transition to subscription model.

269
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,800
He says, I'm also super glad I bought the app early because I'm grandfathered in.

270
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,240
This is a big transition we've been seeing in the Apple ecosystem.

271
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,420
This move to subscription.

272
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,260
And now I think one of the most famous independent apps, one of the most famous modern independent

273
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,640
apps on the Apple platforms is pixel mater.

274
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,400
I don't know if you've ever tried it, but it Photoshop wishes it was this good.

275
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,820
I don't believe that I have, I use something called acorn for that.

276
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,440
And honestly, uh, the GIMP, so, you know, they took a lot of what makes Photoshop great

277
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,820
and they just, they worked on that and then, but they built it in the era of metal and

278
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,500
modern Apple APIs.

279
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,900
So they built something kind of for the Apple Silicon era and it's accelerated throughout.

280
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,640
It's just, it's one of those apps I'd love to have on Linux, but they, they really point

281
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,420
out and you know, this is true.

282
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:52,900
The core issue is, and they have a great visual they'll have linked in the show notes with

283
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:59,220
the traditional type of model, your sales are really when you have a big new version

284
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,120
and then you have a massive sales drop off, which will be the length of the development

285
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,260
window and then you have a smaller but noticeable spike in sales when it's when it's time for

286
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,260
an upgrade.

287
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,480
But the revenue is never quite what the original sales was because for most people they're

288
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,220
just buying the upgrade price.

289
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,780
Meanwhile, the baseline cost to run your business, especially these days are always going up.

290
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,740
So the revenue kind of Peters off over time as people buy discounted upgrades.

291
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,380
Meanwhile, base costs going up.

292
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,140
The other thing they point out, and I'm curious to know your thoughts on this specifically.

293
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,660
One of the other issues with the upfront development paid model is they are essentially incentivized

294
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,280
to hold features back to make releases big enough to get people to pay for them.

295
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,660
So they'll sit, they'll hold a feature for a couple of months just to make it, you know,

296
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,660
a good a good set of features that encourage you to upgrade.

297
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,060
They have no way to do discounts via the app store.

298
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,420
This is a classic one, so they have that problem as well.

299
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:05,020
There's no way to do proper trial on the IOS devices, so, you know, a lot of these typical

300
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,900
issues combined with low price pressure on mobile devices for an app that is now, I don't

301
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:16,980
know, 10 years old with a team of independent developers working on it full time and they've

302
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,080
been living on one time payments.

303
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,260
They actually make a really solid case for subscriptions.

304
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,180
I have to give it a think, though, because I'm an occasional user when I'm on an iPad.

305
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,620
I do use it on an iPad from time to time.

306
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,900
If I'm on a Mac for more than a couple of days, I generally install it because one of

307
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,420
the things I love about it is the damn thing opens up Photoshop files like a champ.

308
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,420
So it's like, oh, great.

309
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,580
This is an opportunity for me to get, you know, some of my old graphics and get them

310
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:47,300
out of a Photoshop format, and that's a huge opportunity, and it has a really slick web

311
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,660
support, you know, where you can export files like PNGs and WebPs and JPEGs specifically

312
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,620
encoded for web pages, like it's got a great tool for that.

313
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,700
I just I think it's a really nice tool, but honestly, I use it sparingly once every few

314
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:10,860
months and the pricing, albeit seeming fair, is five dollars per month or twenty four dollars

315
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,460
per year or fifty five dollars for a lifetime license.

316
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,660
Paging paid users will be grandfathered in for free.

317
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,260
It's pretty good.

318
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,740
It's pretty generous.

319
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,140
I'd like to know what you think.

320
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:29,540
You know, I think we've been talking about independent app pricing and just generally

321
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:34,380
making money off software products for 13, 12 years, something like that.

322
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,820
It's been a while.

323
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,660
And unfortunately, this is where we've landed, right?

324
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,660
The predictions we made have come true in weird ways.

325
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:52,260
I think maybe the aspect of this is they need to make enough money to be sustainable.

326
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,160
And people are not, how can I say, acculturated to spending a hundred, two hundred dollars

327
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,580
on a piece of software once a year anymore.

328
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,100
So you get nickel and dimed with subscriptions, which sometimes cost more, ironically.

329
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:10,300
I can't see myself launching a product now that wasn't a type of either renewable or

330
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:16,260
subscription or like an annual license that somehow didn't work once you didn't pay the

331
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,260
license.

332
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,740
Part of that is because a modern piece of software that's going to command any decent

333
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,520
amount of revenue these days almost certainly has some sort of server component, which is

334
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,400
an ongoing cost that you have to maintain.

335
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,460
It probably has integrations with things like Google Work or I guess in this case they must

336
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,260
maintain Photoshop compatibility, right?

337
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,440
Well every time Photoshop in this case changes, I'm sure the Pixelmator folks have to go ahead

338
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,460
and fix it, right?

339
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,780
They got to change their software.

340
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,860
And dozens of other formats, no doubt.

341
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,860
Right.

342
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,220
And if they integrate, I don't know this piece of software, but I know like Alice, for instance,

343
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,140
if when Google decides they're going to pretend like they give a crap about privacy and just

344
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,940
make it ever so slightly harder to refresh auth tokens, they did this like a year ago.

345
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,100
That's just a cost I have to absorb and then like the redeployment for every single instance.

346
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,580
So I get it.

347
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,580
I don't...

348
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,820
I mean, I agree with Jacob that this kind of sucks, but part of a little bit of a devil's

349
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,600
advocate here is the user expectations of everything just kind of working together and

350
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,100
all your stuff being in the cloud, it just makes it more expensive.

351
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,740
I mean, think about...

352
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,060
I always come back to this because I just think it's really funny.

353
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,180
Facebook's bad day where they pissed off Tim Cook, right?

354
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:39,220
And he just shut down all the internal Facebook iOS apps with the stroke of a key.

355
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,340
That's what's up, right?

356
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,260
That's another form of dependency, another form of maintenance cost.

357
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,940
You have to keep your stuff in compliance with all these third party things now.

358
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,260
Pixelmator, if it's a Mac app, I would bet my hat that it's at least notarized.

359
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,860
If it's on the App Store, it certainly is, right?

360
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:01,460
So that's, again, got to keep in compliance, got to keep updating to the new OS, if Apple

361
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,700
changes their mind because it's Tuesday and they say it's privacy, but they want to be

362
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,000
the only one to sell ads on iOS, you have to change something potentially.

363
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,540
So I mean, it's tough.

364
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,820
It's tough out there these days.

365
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,820
Yeah.

366
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,400
And it makes me think the subscriptions aren't going away, right?

367
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,720
Because this is a clear advantage for them in a development model.

368
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,380
It's going to make it sustainable and predictable from a revenue standpoint for them.

369
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,780
And so then I start thinking, all right, well, in arguably, the subscription model does make

370
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,420
sense for some types of services and apps and media and whatnot.

371
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:46,720
So it's like, well, then it seems like the job really falls on me now to just be more

372
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,860
vigilant than I have in any other point in my lifetime about managing my subscriptions

373
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,460
and my family's subscriptions.

374
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,740
Because like Circus Freak points out in our Matrix chat room, you can have family members

375
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:03,700
like my kids or my mom, I've looked at their subscriptions, thankfully, iOS makes it pretty

376
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,460
easy to review.

377
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,020
And I've seen $99 a year for a video editor that they wanted to use one time for a family

378
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,440
video that they haven't used for six months.

379
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,300
And all kinds of just absolutely outrageous, totally scam subscriptions that I can't believe

380
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Apple lets in.

381
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,860
So they need to be better about that to make the market feel more comfortable about this.

382
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,820
I need to be more vigilant about it because it's easy to get subscription creep.

383
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:35,340
And then those of us who have a subscription like the QA membership and Jupiter party,

384
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,380
like I've got to always be working to make that subscription more valuable.

385
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,220
You can't just create it and then leave it there.

386
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,940
And that's the lesson I'm internalizing right now.

387
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,320
And it's like, okay, so now we've got a whole other list of projects to just bring more

388
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,580
features to our member feeds because if I'm going to ask for a subscription revenue, I

389
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,580
got to keep it competitive.

390
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,580
I got to keep adding stuff to it.

391
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,580
I got to keep creating value.

392
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,860
And I think that's something that's going to make the difference between the successful

393
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,900
programs and failures and successful developers and failed developers.

394
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,680
One other model that I meant to mention a couple of weeks ago, but I forgot.

395
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:13,740
So I use OmniGraffle quite a bit, which is like a really pretty Mac, what would you call

396
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,740
it?

397
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,740
A diagramming tool?

398
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,740
Yeah.

399
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,420
Sort of like the Visio Kin, but maybe a little bit easier and not quite as hardcore, maybe.

400
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
Not quite as hardcore.

401
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,460
So if you download some of the extensions, it gets wild.

402
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,220
And there's an iPad app, but I generally use it on the Mac because big screen complicated

403
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,220
systems.

404
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,220
Yay.

405
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,220
And they will sell this piece of software to you in one of two ways.

406
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,060
One way is a annual or monthly subscription.

407
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,940
The other way is straight up.

408
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,100
And I've never bought the regular version, I use the pro versions, 250 bucks.

409
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:54,100
But if you buy the straight up, what happens is to use their kind of cloud syncing system,

410
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,540
you have to subscribe to that.

411
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,940
So what they've effectively done, and I think this is actually...

412
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,980
I was annoyed when I first saw it, but then I'm thinking about it and having a little

413
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,300
empathy as a fellow kind of independent developer.

414
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,540
The cloud service is an ongoing maintenance cost and potential, I guess, they have to

415
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,000
maintain security servers, whatever.

416
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,160
So they're just breaking that out and charging for that.

417
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,260
That's not the craziest thing.

418
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,400
The other thing I should add, if you do the subscription, which they definitely want you

419
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,100
to do, you also get the iOS version.

420
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,420
If you do the traditional, you only get the Mac OS version.

421
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,420
Yeah, I guess I see what you're saying.

422
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:36,220
Yeah, I also, but I look at those kinds of things and I go, could they have just used

423
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,300
iCloud and then not charged me?

424
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,700
But all right, I'm sure they want to do more things than what iCloud will allow.

425
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,500
And you're right, it is a reasonable revenue stream.

426
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,460
Clearly though, this is a topic that people are still adjusting to.

427
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,620
I'd like to hear your thoughts out there, coder.show slash contact, or boost it in with

428
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,340
a new podcast app, or tell me in person.

429
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:02,740
The meetups cometh, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting the West Coast road tour made

430
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,220
possible by Linode.

431
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,500
It is another Linode on the road event.

432
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,340
I just had a call with Linode last week, I think it was Thursday.

433
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:15,820
There's some new swag that they're going to be including that they haven't really got

434
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,140
out there much because there hasn't been many events.

435
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,020
We have a new shirt design that we're working on for the trip that we'll be giving out.

436
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,180
And then we're also going to do geocaches and we'll stash some of that stuff along the

437
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
way.

438
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,540
So even if you can't make it to a meetup but you're in the area, you might be able to find

439
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540
the geocache.

440
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,100
So we got some fun stuff as well as a matrix room to help coordinate it all.

441
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,000
We'll have links to all of that in the show notes, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

442
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,260
For that, it's coming up real soon now.

443
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:49,020
Linode.com slash Coder, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and go there

444
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,020
to support the show.

445
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,940
I love Linode, it's fast, reliable cloud hosting with the best support in the business.

446
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,020
Right there, real humans every day, all day when you need them.

447
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,460
Linode's how we run everything we've built for the last few years.

448
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,500
It's how we are building our new website right now.

449
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,600
Yeah, it's on Linode.

450
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,300
We walk what we talk here.

451
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,700
We really do love hosting everything on Linode.

452
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,940
They are super fast.

453
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,680
They have 11 data centers around the world and they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers

454
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,680
who just want to upsell you and lock you in all the time.

455
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,660
It just is a no brainer.

456
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,260
And on top of all of that, with all of the data centers to choose from, with object storage,

457
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,060
with all of their great features like VLAN support, the ability to provision things using

458
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,620
things like Ansible and Kubernetes, we can deploy infrastructure as we need.

459
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,900
And it has been something to watch this team go.

460
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,380
Our community with Brent and Alex building this website has been incredible.

461
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,540
And the infrastructure they deploy in one day would have taken me a month or two to

462
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,120
deploy just, you know, a few years ago.

463
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,500
You really have to try it out because it just takes your flexibility, your agility, your

464
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,140
reach to a whole other level.

465
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,500
You can play at a level that you would think would cost you thousands of dollars a month

466
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,900
and they have systems that start at $5 a month.

467
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,020
You go to linode.com slash coder and you get a hundred dollar credit on top of that.

468
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,340
I just think it's such a great opportunity to try something, build something, put it

469
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,020
in production for a bit, see how it does.

470
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,340
A hundred dollars, you can really kick the tires.

471
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,340
Go support the show.

472
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,040
Try it out for yourself, linode.com slash coder.

473
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,860
One more time, it's linode.com slash coder.

474
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Oh, it's almost here and I'm not talking about fall.

475
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,780
I'm talking about dot net seven.

476
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,100
And you know, Mr. Dominic, I remember a time when dot net was just brand new.

477
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,860
I really do too.

478
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
It's so sad.

479
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,460
When our ASP was like her Coca-Cola classic.

480
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,800
Oh man.

481
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,140
Remember how everything was active for a while?

482
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,140
Active everything.

483
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
Yes.

484
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,660
I have wild security holes.

485
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,900
We move forward a little bit, just a little bit forward in time to a dot net seven preview

486
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,460
seven, which came out just a few days ago as we record this here podcast.

487
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,300
Yeah, there's some, there's some good stuff in here.

488
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,680
Couple things of note.

489
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:12,860
If you are a Xamarin slash Maui developer, you can be really excited to wait.

490
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:19,300
No dot net seven for you yet because Maui is the project curse in time to constantly

491
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
be behind.

492
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,300
I think it's Xamarin.

493
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,200
No, Xamarin is, so it's weird.

494
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,140
So Maui is based on Xamarin.

495
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,140
I think it's Mooey.

496
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,140
Mooey?

497
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
I'm sorry.

498
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,140
I'm sorry.

499
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,900
I don't even, you totally made me lose track.

500
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
All right.

501
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Yeah.

502
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
So, but there are some good features at dot net seven.

503
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,380
The usual crowing about performance and portability.

504
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,860
Great work, Microsoft.

505
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,660
Nicely done.

506
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Simplified rate limiting.

507
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,580
Rate limiting is, so this is obviously for like the server side stuff, right?

508
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
Like ASP.

509
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,900
Rate limiting is a pain in the butt on all platforms.

510
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,380
So simplifying it sounds good.

511
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,900
I looked at the codes and the samples they put up.

512
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
Very magical.

513
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,020
We'll see.

514
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,140
I like it.

515
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:11,540
The one that really got me was this minimal API enhancement section and I put it in quotes

516
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,540
in the doc.

517
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,540
Yeah.

518
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,100
Because basically I guess they have listened to people making fun of C sharp for being

519
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,980
somewhat verbose compared to say your, you know, your pythons of the world.

520
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:29,220
And they're effectively making the API calls just a lot cleaner and simpler for your API's,

521
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,220
right?

522
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,660
So again, this would be like you're writing a rest service or something like that.

523
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,300
On the back end.

524
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,300
It's boring.

525
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,260
Like if you think about it, it's okay, you have the type of, but I, I found the examples

526
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:46,100
they gave versus the the old style of doing it very readable and oddly pythonic.

527
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,740
Yes, I'm, I'm using that cause I coined it last week.

528
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,740
I'll take it.

529
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,260
I think this is a great use.

530
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,420
And I don't know.

531
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:58,460
It made me not want to install windows 11, but Hey, you could.NET's cross platform.

532
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,900
You can open VS code on any platform and do this.

533
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,180
So this is just a preview.

534
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:09,300
I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on it still, still the thorn in the lion's paw of Microsoft

535
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,220
is God damn Maui.

536
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,700
It's just this thing has been taking so long and it's a crazy ambitious plan, right?

537
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,180
It's a, it's another flavor of right once run everywhere.

538
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:25,420
But if they actually pull that off and they can actually hit these performance metrics

539
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:33,980
across platforms with, you know, reasonable variances, that is going to be pretty substantial.

540
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,700
There's a bunch of stuff about blazer too, and this, I don't care about blazer.

541
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:43,140
I very skeptical of blazer cause you know, anytime you try to avoid JavaScript and HTML

542
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,480
and CSS, you just make more pain for yourself.

543
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,660
Just embrace our JavaScript overlords and move on.

544
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,340
Now don't send any pictures to your kid's pediatrician though.

545
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,340
Oh boy.

546
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,340
Oh boy.

547
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,220
Um, that's a little tease.

548
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,060
So before we get there, do you agree with the statement, the areas of Microsoft that

549
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:08,060
really seem to be executing just continuously for years is this.NET and I would include

550
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,340
just sort of the Linux area in general, the people that are creating some of the tools

551
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,700
that they're releasing as free software, those projects, they're consistently performing

552
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,700
on them, right?

553
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:24,580
Just for years now, I feel like there is some aspects of Microsoft that are waning and teetering

554
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,580
a bit.

555
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,580
Office.

556
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,580
Yeah.

557
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,900
But this feels like an area that has just remained, just solid performers just executing

558
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,980
nonstop.

559
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:38,780
You know, I know this isn't the most pro Microsoft audience in the world, but a couple of years

560
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:44,660
ago they had the goal of we will make.NET platform agnostic and it will be one.NET

561
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,980
and they certainly had some, they had a journey there, right?

562
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,060
We had.NET Core, we had all that crap.

563
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:56,420
It's basically, if you're using all the modern stuff, it is the.NET standard, which is now

564
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
just.NET.

565
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,460
It's, they got it.

566
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,900
The, with the one crazy hook hiccup of Maui, but-

567
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,660
We'll see how 7.0 final goes, but doesn't it feel like they've really hit their stride?

568
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:14,140
I think if they pull this off, and the reason I keep harping on Maui is because the missing

569
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,340
piece has always been the front end, but at this juncture, I mean, some of the performance

570
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:27,700
benchmarks that they're claiming, so who knows, in this.NET 7 preview, it's significantly,

571
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:33,340
it's vast and even compared to like.NET 6.

572
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:39,660
So if, I don't know, our dark matter devs out there, in five to six years, when you

573
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,940
guys can upgrade to.NET 7, will you be happy?

574
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,940
I mean, I would bet.

575
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,240
I'd like to know.

576
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,380
It feels to me like if these teams continue to execute, the Azure teams continue to execute,

577
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,020
this is Microsoft's game to lose right here.

578
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,660
Google is just really falling apart.

579
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,100
They just don't execute anymore.

580
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,780
We're about to get there, so I'll give more context.

581
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,380
You know, Apple is focused on Swift and their platform, right?

582
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,980
It's a different game they're playing.

583
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:14,700
Microsoft is playing the entire market game, enterprise, individual developers, independent

584
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,460
open source developers, you know, they have moments where they do things like they suspend

585
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,620
the account of a free software developer who created TornadoCache and everybody goes, ooh,

586
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,700
maybe that's a sign, but that's not really blowing it, right?

587
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,260
Most people said, ah, that's for criminals anyways, who cares, and they moved on without

588
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,580
giving it another thought, unfortunately.

589
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,780
It really feels like this is Microsoft's game to lose at this point.

590
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:41,060
.NET is just a part of that, but one of their strongest parts of that strategy.

591
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,060
I'm impressed to see it.

592
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,800
Okay, let's talk about this Google thing, because it's what our chat room is talking

593
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,020
about right now as we record, because last night, I think it was, an article came out

594
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,720
in the New York Times about a dad who sent photos from his Android device of his baby's

595
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:03,320
groin to a doctor, you know, doing like telemedicine, which is becoming super common, and then Google

596
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:09,020
disabled his account and reported him to the police because their CSAM scanner flagged

597
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,300
him for child porn.

598
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,460
It took about two days after he took the pictures, and then Mark's phone made a notification

599
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,460
noise.

600
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,300
His account had been disabled due to harmful content that was in, quote, a severe violation

601
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,700
of Google's policies and might be illegal.

602
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,300
Then he had a, quote, learn more link that led to a possible list of reasons, you've

603
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,380
seen these Google help pages, I'm sure, and one of the many reasons on the page was, quote,

604
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,380
sexual abuse and exploitation.

605
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,100
It took the dad, Mark, a little bit to even figure it out, because he didn't think of

606
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,340
this right at first, but then he realized, oh God, a couple of days ago, I did take those

607
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,220
pictures and Google probably thinks that was porn.

608
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:52,860
This led to an investigation into the dad, and I'm not sure, probably by the time this

609
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:58,940
episode comes out, we'll have some resolution, but as we record, he still doesn't have access

610
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:06,100
to his Google account, even though he's been cleared by the police, and all he did was

611
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,900
take pictures of his kid with his own device, but because he uses Google Photos and they're

612
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:17,400
scanning your photos, they detected this, and consider this, too, right?

613
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:24,720
In this situation, this wasn't a picture that matched a preexisting model out there, right?

614
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,900
These photos were unique.

615
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,860
There was no hash in any law enforcement database for these pictures of his kids growing, and

616
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,140
Google still found them, so they're looking at everyone's stuff, and they're not just

617
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:43,420
looking for preexisting images, they're looking at each individual picture, all of your stuff,

618
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,740
and they're throwing their various models at it, which appear to be very accurate.

619
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:54,900
I would say classified as intended, but context matters in these situations, and it just happened

620
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
automatically.

621
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,700
All he did wrong was use an Android device, and let's be honest, we know it won't be very

622
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,700
long until this is the same situation on iOS.

623
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,700
It almost was.

624
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,500
It wasn't in this last OS release, and they postponed it.

625
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,180
You and I are both dads, but this just drives me crazy.

626
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:18,020
Oh, this one, I just a few months ago had a conversation with a friend who, she just

627
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:24,180
had a child not so long ago, and she's like, oh, I sent a cute picture of him on the bathtub

628
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,180
to my mom.

629
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,180
I said, just do not do that again.

630
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,180
Don't.

631
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:33,140
And yeah, this is literally the reason why I told her not to do that, right?

632
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,820
I said, you don't understand everything, which then she thought I was a tinfoil maniac, but

633
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:47,660
yeah, I would say, I mean, I read some of the responses to this, which I thought were

634
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:54,160
chilling, to be honest with you, that, well, the classifier worked, and there was a human

635
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,420
review, and the human review referred it to the police, who, without saying anything,

636
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,980
started an investigation, pulled all his account information, including apparently some, I

637
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:10,900
guess, intimate photos of some woman or something, and yeah, that's fine.

638
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,420
He didn't get charged.

639
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,420
So that worked, right?

640
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,420
The system worked.

641
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,420
But think about that.

642
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:22,020
His entire life was now just on a bunch of San Francisco detectives' desks, or San Diego

643
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,020
detectives.

644
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,260
Well, and this also, these pictures got forwarded to a team internally at Google, and so the

645
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,540
police are looking at his kid's crotch, a team of people at Google are looking at his

646
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,500
kid's crotch, and all he did was telemedicine.

647
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,800
Well, not only that, but they pulled not just the stuff off his phone, they pulled his entire

648
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,940
Google account, emails, possibly text arguments, because the police got a warrant.

649
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:49,540
By the way, the fact that an automated flag can be used to trigger probable cause for

650
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,320
a hyperinvasive warrant is just...

651
00:35:52,320 --> 00:36:00,100
That then gives them your entire Google account, your search history, all of his location history,

652
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,500
all of his messages, all of his Google Docs were all given over to law enforcement because

653
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,020
of this process, automatically.

654
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
And these were not...

655
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:14,780
So the CSAM promise was that there would be hashed photos that are known to the authorities

656
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,180
to be child pornography.

657
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,420
This was not that, right?

658
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,780
This was using machine learning to basically...

659
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:28,780
Just like hot dog, not hot dog, right, Silicon Valley from the HBO show.

660
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,900
So there are more...

661
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:36,400
Now it's hard because you can't say, well, don't police this, but this kind of seems

662
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,620
like a wild overreach.

663
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,420
It's chilling the more we talk about it.

664
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:47,260
It's just absolutely chilling because an accidental triggering of this process then invokes a

665
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:53,300
discovery process which could find all kinds of things potentially that you never thought

666
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,300
would be public.

667
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,340
And I don't know, it's just, this is super chilling.

668
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,540
This feels like a deal breaker for me, I have to be honest with you.

669
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:07,860
Google Photos is such a remarkable product, but my God, and there's so much other metadata

670
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,540
in those photos, including the faces of your family.

671
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:14,980
Like I have a family member who's never been on social media ever.

672
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:22,580
He's just, his late 60s never has ever created...

673
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,900
I don't even know if he has a Google account.

674
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,820
I know he has a Microsoft account, but I don't know if he has a Google account.

675
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,460
And so in theory, he would have no social media footprint except for family members

676
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,180
have taken pictures of him and put them on social media and we've uploaded them to our

677
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,500
Google Photos and tagged his name and we, on the backend, Google can build a network

678
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,180
of all of the different people who have that person's face in their photo library.

679
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:50,740
Well, the interesting thing was in this case, just to bring it just particularly, well,

680
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,260
the police cleared him and said it was a misunderstanding.

681
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:58,260
So good on the police for not just like, I mean, I'm sure this guy was horrified, right?

682
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,420
Because you've got the full weight of the government and you're accused of something

683
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,420
heinous.

684
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,420
So it's...

685
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,020
Could you imagine, could you imagine how wrecked his life was for a period of time?

686
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,020
Oh yeah.

687
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,700
Persona and Agrata, right?

688
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,980
But Google still wouldn't give him his account back.

689
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,980
Right.

690
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,780
It just destroyed all his data.

691
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
Yeah.

692
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,140
So what do you do?

693
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,260
Because the other problem is, is like, what happens if your kid does this?

694
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
You know, that your kids are screwing around.

695
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,660
I had a situation, I can't remember if I'd mentioned it on the show or not, but my daughter

696
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:34,740
recently was looped in because her watch has a phone number and she was looped in to a

697
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:40,180
text message thread with other kids in her school during summer break about causing harm

698
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,300
to another student.

699
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,660
My red alert alarm goes off immediately, like now she's involved in a text message thread

700
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:52,420
where kids are joking about causing harm to another student and all my daughter did was

701
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,420
just get automatically looped in and they just won't stop and they won't stop and you

702
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,260
know, of course it gets reported.

703
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,060
And that kind of stuff could also just automatically get scanned and flagged.

704
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:05,900
And it just feels like there's so many ways to accidentally get drawn in to where now

705
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,220
your entire account contents get handed over.

706
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:13,420
And the only way to really kind of prevent this sort of thing is to opt out of the legitimately

707
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,660
nice to have features like Google Maps, because they also gave us the entire location history

708
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,900
and Google Photos and your photos are for some of us the most precious thing we own.

709
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,100
So there's another version of this.

710
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,260
Oddly enough, I think it was the Wall Street Journal that published this story.

711
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:35,740
The IRS in that new wonderful bill that everybody's so excited about is putting aside a ton of

712
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:43,060
money for machine learning and social media analysis to try to catch tax cheats.

713
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,180
But what is a tax sheet?

714
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,580
What if let's say your grandma dies or you know, you inherit some money and you like

715
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,220
buy a car.

716
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,220
Same thing.

717
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,340
Well, this is an anomalous thing.

718
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,060
You said you only made, you know, $30,000.

719
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,460
How did you buy that, whatever, right, just Chevy, who cares?

720
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,760
That's where we're going with this.

721
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,180
Everything is going to be analyzed against some model.

722
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,780
I mean, I could think about how to write this model right now.

723
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:16,700
Okay, I have a single dad who makes, you know, say $100,000 or claims to make 50.

724
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:22,060
He lives in this zip code, average cost of living plus incidentals.

725
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:26,580
He should have this type of profile on let's say, Insta, Facebook, whatever.

726
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,900
Oh, this dude looks like he's more in that hundred, 105, 110 bracket than 50.

727
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,220
Look at this picture of a Tesla.

728
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,280
You know, we've identified a Tesla in this guy's photo feed.

729
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,620
And you could automate this.

730
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,580
Let's trigger, because if you've ever been audited, they start with a paper audit, right?

731
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,620
They just say, show us documentation.

732
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:50,820
And then they escalate up to a real audit and then a potentially criminal charge.

733
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,380
That seems real scary.

734
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,400
I'm just saying.

735
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,600
And we've privatized it.

736
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
We've privatized it.

737
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,060
It's going to be contracted out, right?

738
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,020
This is the most beautiful thing about it is all this information.

739
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:08,660
It's all packaged up and beautifully delivered to the state automatically through this process.

740
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,840
But it wasn't the state that collected the information, right?

741
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,420
It's so beautiful.

742
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,500
It's just both parties get to wipe their hands of any responsibility there.

743
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
I did my part.

744
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Oh, I'm doing my part.

745
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,940
So the same law and the reason I'm dunking on this law is because I'm not trying to be

746
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,300
political, I'm just saying there's a lot of bad in this law.

747
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,880
Welcome to unfiltered.

748
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,220
Someone in Congress decided maybe it would be a good idea if the Defense Department,

749
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,820
who isn't supposed to spy on American citizens, certainly not in the country, would have to

750
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,660
disclose when they purchased the data from data brokers of American citizens.

751
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,660
What an idea.

752
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,340
The fact that they're routinely doing that, we didn't break the Fourth Amendment.

753
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,620
I don't know how the hell they got the data, but we didn't break the Fourth Amendment.

754
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,620
Right.

755
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,260
They got the product from a private organization.

756
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,980
Hey, they're a contractor.

757
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,460
They went through the whole vetting process.

758
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:02,340
They're in the, they have an, what is it, the NIA, I forgot the code, but the government

759
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,580
classification code.

760
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,500
So that's fine, right?

761
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,500
It's totally cool.

762
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,500
What Fourth Amendment?

763
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,740
By the way, you know who was already doing that?

764
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,860
The IRS.

765
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,460
Now they want to automate it further and do it themselves with machine learning.

766
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,260
Can I just say that this is what happens when people learn about this crap that Google's

767
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,920
doing and Apple will be doing soon and Microsoft too, I'm sure, if not already.

768
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,500
This is, this is, this is like you're two steps away from like this conversation we're

769
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,100
having now.

770
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:34,260
This is what happens because you start to realize, holy crap, this entire system is

771
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:40,100
just designed to really take advantage of me if I make one mistake and I can't help

772
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,940
but think the only thing one can do, and yet I'm not doing it, even though I try, the only

773
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,620
thing you can do is not participate.

774
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,780
Go listen to self-hosted.

775
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,980
I just, just one last point on this and then we probably should move off the unfiltered

776
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,980
stuff.

777
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:59,340
They, they justified all of this crap, all of this crap that it's now evolved into with

778
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,500
two main things.

779
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:07,580
The classic, but think of the children, which I'm sympathetic to, but they didn't stop at,

780
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:12,740
you know, protecting children and goddamn 9 11.

781
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:20,540
If you, if you were to take a guy from, let's say the seventies, even at the height of protest

782
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:26,620
and tell him how much surveillance is just routinely done in a mass way on American citizens,

783
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:32,100
they probably wouldn't believe you because that sounds a lot like, ah, the Soviet Union.

784
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:38,340
My last thing on this is really shame on Google because yet another tool they've built that

785
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:43,660
is hostile to the user and pro establishment and I, what I mean by that is they could have

786
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:49,060
built this thing where maybe the offender is presumed innocent and maybe there is a

787
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,580
little bit more of a check and balances before like the kid's crotch is showed to a team

788
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,820
of people at different agencies.

789
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:01,020
Maybe the per maybe the person could be presumed innocent, but they never do that.

790
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,100
Same with YouTube, right?

791
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,680
This episode will get flagged.

792
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,860
Every single live stream does.

793
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,340
I didn't play anything copyrighted, but it will get, I've had my own voice.

794
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,340
I've literally had my voice in the intros get flagged.

795
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,180
They assume I'm guilty by default.

796
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,940
All their tooling always does.

797
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,620
They assume I'm in the wrong.

798
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,680
They're minimizing their legal liability.

799
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:28,140
It gets to the core of these giant mega rich corporations that have dumped on the market

800
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:34,060
to get incredible market share have never built out the support department that even

801
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:39,800
comes even just a tiny percentage, a tiny fraction of the size of their actual user

802
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,940
base.

803
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:45,100
They're trying to become Kings without having any support.

804
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:50,340
And so you get a situation where this guy, this guy might get his account back now that

805
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,020
the New York fricking times wrote about it, but otherwise he'd be SOL.

806
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,020
He's not.

807
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,020
He's not.

808
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,020
So Google, it's just their policy.

809
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:01,260
There've been, according to the reporter in the times there is have, she was on Twitter

810
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,260
elaborating.

811
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,220
They're having other cases, it almost exactly like this.

812
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,260
And Google's policy is once you're flagged, you're flagged.

813
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,140
Well, of course this isn't the first one.

814
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,180
Of course this isn't my God.

815
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,020
I wonder how many other lives they've completely destroyed with this.

816
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:20,040
What if it was his Google work account, just like take his whole business offline.

817
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,100
What if the guy was in the process of a divorce, right?

818
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,620
And his ex wife tried to leverage this against him during the divorce proceedings.

819
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:31,260
Like, what if this, I mean, imagine if this kind of investigation leaked public for somebody

820
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:36,380
who's, you know, in a, in a public position or something like just, it could destroy someone's

821
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,380
life or career.

822
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,660
It would destroy his life.

823
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,020
And we're just not even hearing about it.

824
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,700
And they, all of these, all these systems just assume that the person is guilty by default

825
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,220
because it's the least amount of work.

826
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,580
It's the least amount of cost.

827
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,100
It's the least amount of friction with law enforcement policy.

828
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,180
And it doesn't require a support department.

829
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,420
We're the product, right?

830
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,240
We are the product, not the customer.

831
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,180
But I sure can't wait for that new pixel.

832
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,620
All right, and, and by the way, if you don't, we've been pretty harshing on Google.

833
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,020
If you don't think Apple and Microsoft do stuff like this, Apple to a lesser degree,

834
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,620
but they're going to, Google's probably just the best at it.

835
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:10,260
And Facebook, Facebook's already doing this at large scale.

836
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,260
Yeah.

837
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,020
But if you pay in rubles, you're fine.

838
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,860
Tailscale.com slash coder.

839
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:23,340
Tailscale is a zero config VPN and installs on any device in minutes and it manages your

840
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,900
firewall rules, it'll take care of your double nets and your devices connect directly to

841
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:34,220
each other using a mesh network protected by a WireGuard's noise protocol.

842
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,800
That's it right there.

843
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,300
That's the concept, but it is a game changer.

844
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,140
And I, I don't know, I don't think, uh, I don't think I know the term cause I was never

845
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,420
really into like a band before they got popular, but that's how I feel with Tailscale right

846
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,420
now.

847
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,420
So I think you know what I mean, right?

848
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,120
Like I feel like I was into Tailscale just a little bit before it got popular and now

849
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:58,460
I see folks talking about the way Tailscale changes the way they work all the time.

850
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:02,060
And I'm like, yeah, I know, I know, I've been telling people about it.

851
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,980
I hope they went to tailscale.com slash coder.

852
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,060
I don't know, but you can, you can support the show and you can try it out.

853
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:13,540
Tailscale allows you to build a flat network protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

854
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,540
And it even supports DNS.

855
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,460
So if you want to throw a DNS server in that flat network, you can start resolving machines

856
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,940
by their name.

857
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:25,180
They've also recently introduced Tailscale SSH, which allows you to establish an SSH

858
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:30,820
connection between your devices on the Tailscale network and you can control access with the

859
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,740
built in ACL controls in Tailscale.

860
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:38,220
You don't have to manage SSH keys and you can authenticate the SSH connection using

861
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,220
WireGuard.

862
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,020
The whole thing is mind blowing.

863
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,420
I'm going to play with it this weekend, get everything all ready for the road trip coming

864
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,940
up because I've already got all my devices in Tailscale.

865
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,740
So yeah, I'm going to take advantage of this.

866
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:54,340
I use Tailscale to maintain my kids computers, my friends, my family and my work systems.

867
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,540
It's so great because you can also share a single node with somebody and I find that

868
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,820
really useful, really super useful.

869
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,900
And I've just no longer have any inbound ports on my firewalls.

870
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,460
I've just turned them all off.

871
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:11,840
They're all off now, guys, guys, no inbound traffic at all.

872
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,500
That's the way it should be.

873
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,740
Tailscale made that possible.

874
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,900
Just a game changer, game changer.

875
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,460
You want your, you want your game changed?

876
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,980
You want to know what that actually means?

877
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,820
People say it all the time.

878
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,820
What does it actually mean?

879
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,820
Go find out.

880
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,900
Tailscale.com slash coder.

881
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,900
I mean it.

882
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,900
I love it.

883
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,380
Tailscale.com slash coder.

884
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,940
Well let's talk about a little development.

885
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:37,780
I don't know, maybe some programming, something related to coding because I need to change

886
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,780
the subject.

887
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,780
Okay.

888
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,780
So are we coding a bunker?

889
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,780
No.

890
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:47,700
So, so I have been for a while now using Ionic again, which for folks who don't know, Ionic

891
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:55,080
is a cross-platform mobile webby framework, I want to say.

892
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:02,000
It's really more of a collection of stuff, but that focuses on web-based mobile development.

893
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,620
There's three flavors of it, React, Vue, and the good one, Angular.

894
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:15,300
So I'm of course using Angular because I am not a heathen nor a Facebook fan.

895
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,540
And I'd just like to talk about it a little bit because it's pretty cool.

896
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:22,700
It is totally TypeScript-y, a lot of really cool native plugins.

897
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,380
If you've ever done PhoneGap development, God rest its soul.

898
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,380
Oh yeah.

899
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:33,000
You know that PhoneGap became Cordova and the folks at Ionic have come out with an open

900
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,740
source project called Capacitor, which is compatible with Cordova, but in many ways

901
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,900
better, mostly in the ways of performance.

902
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,460
It is really neat.

903
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:51,460
This kind of development methodology of doing basically web views, but having hooks into

904
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:56,220
native APIs and into native hardware functionality is so much better.

905
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:02,380
If you did this like five years ago, it was pretty jank, but today it is so good.

906
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:06,380
I mean, I was surprised I was able to get Bluetooth connections working easily.

907
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,740
I was able to write a small custom thing for a scanner.

908
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,300
So low level stuff.

909
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:15,660
Low level stuff, as long as the lords of Cupertino actually allow it natively.

910
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,780
Yeah, of course.

911
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,860
And then you have to write a TypeScript wrapper, or it could be JavaScript, right, and hook

912
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,320
it in and register the component.

913
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:29,380
If you've done Angular before, same kind of idea, just Capacitor.

914
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:33,840
If you've ever done like extension development or even like a mod for a game or like Minecraft,

915
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:38,180
it's the same idea of you write your little thing, you put it in, you got to register

916
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:43,480
it with the application, rebuild the whole thing so it builds it in and huzzah.

917
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,820
So they're taking this a step further.

918
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:50,340
And I think they have two things that are interesting, AppFlow, which I'm currently

919
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,200
doing a trial of.

920
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:59,220
It's kind of a build in the cloud solution for all your horrific code signing needs.

921
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,380
I have some feelings about it.

922
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:09,660
One thing that I do like is if you have a very small, only HTML, JavaScript, CSS change,

923
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,940
you can actually deploy that without going through the App Store.

924
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,820
Are they creating build environments for you?

925
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,380
Yeah, that's what they're doing.

926
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,380
Yeah.

927
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,260
You still have to upload like a signing key.

928
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,660
But once you upload it, you know, the keys expire, I think like once a year, something

929
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,660
like that.

930
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,100
Wow, the infrastructure to do that must be super impressive.

931
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,140
Well, they're also charging for it, right?

932
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,460
Of course, I bet.

933
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,660
The bill is not that bad, actually.

934
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:40,740
But it was big enough that it's something I actually had to think about right before

935
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,340
I like, ah, sure.

936
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:48,260
So the deal with this is if it's just a web change, you can basically deploy it.

937
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,800
Now, you have to comply with Apple's rules.

938
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,640
So there's some gray area of like, how big of a change is it?

939
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,200
But for all, like, if it's a, oh, my God, we had a typo on our about page, something

940
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,940
like that, right in our app, you can change it.

941
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,420
Anything that needs a native integration, unfortunately, has to go through the App Store.

942
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:12,380
They also support, which I thought was really interesting, using this AppFlow system as

943
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:17,160
basically your own little private test flight, but like the old test flight, where you just

944
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,660
have like your client or your small internal team.

945
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:26,580
And you're sending bills or just updating the build for the tester silently on the app.

946
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,180
That is super cool.

947
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:33,460
I can't tell you how many Trello tickets or back in the bad old days, Jira tickets, I've

948
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,460
had open.

949
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,860
And after like an hour of walking through on the phone with the dude, it was like, hey,

950
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,180
man, did you get the build from like three days ago?

951
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,180
Oh, no, I'm on the old build.

952
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,180
Sorry, man.

953
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,180
Yeah, dude.

954
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,180
Well, we changed the API.

955
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,780
So you got to, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever, right?

956
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:52,520
So that's just freaking peachy.

957
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:58,940
The other thing I'm just starting to evaluate that I have kind of, I have some fee-fees

958
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,940
about portals.

959
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,940
They call it portals.

960
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,060
So I'm just going to read their little press clipping.

961
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,700
Micro front ends for mobile portals.

962
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,820
Micro front ends allow multiple teams to build, test and ship in parallel with hyper focused

963
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:16,520
embedded web experience in your React native Android or iOS apps.

964
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:22,500
So basically, let's say you have an iOS team, an Android team, you have a basically native

965
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:28,460
app, right, more or less, but you just want some stupid like checkout views or, you know,

966
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,300
some kind of registration view and you want it to be uniform and you want to spend a lot

967
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,020
of time developing it twice.

968
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:39,820
You could just develop it in one of these portal web views, install this portal SDK

969
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:47,160
and it would be taken by either platform and intelligently remapped to the default type

970
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,160
of controls.

971
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,620
Oh, man, that sounds like the promised land.

972
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,340
Well, it reminds me of those, what did Google call them?

973
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,340
Like the little applets?

974
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:59,500
I know it wasn't applets, but you didn't have to download the whole app kind of thing.

975
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,500
Yeah.

976
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Like this, like the snap apps.

977
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,500
Snap app.

978
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,500
Yeah.

979
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,500
Yeah.

980
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Is that what it was?

981
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,220
I know both Apple and Google were experimenting with this, but Google was first.

982
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,220
I can't remember.

983
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:13,060
I never really, I've seen like a couple of them, but like they're app sheets essentially.

984
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,060
App sheets.

985
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,540
No, I think it was sheets.

986
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,300
I think it was called sheets.

987
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:26,140
So the interesting thing about this is you can apparently, and I've done some testing,

988
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:34,140
it seems to work, use capacitor plugins in the portal view, even if the Xcode project

989
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,460
is not built for capacitor.

990
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:47,020
So even if you're golden Mac book, drinking tea out of a bowl, Swift developers have no

991
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:51,860
idea and will not add that filthy, filthy capacitor dot framework to their project.

992
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,860
Of course.

993
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,260
You don't need their permission anymore.

994
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:02,460
Tell them, put your feet off the desk, stop it hippie, we'll do this on the web.

995
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,460
I like that.

996
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:07,820
I still firmly believe that the web technologies are going to consume everything much like

997
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,900
the Borg.

998
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:18,780
What I don't buy right now is that Apple is not going to stop this because it seems in

999
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:24,860
theory that you could tie these two things together and implement functionality after

1000
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:29,580
you've passed app review that would have not been reviewed.

1001
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:34,900
And I guess if it's significant enough would technically violate the terms.

1002
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,700
I could totally see what you're saying, but it feels like that ship has sailed.

1003
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:44,140
There are so many apps now where even the settings pane, they're all web views, but

1004
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,900
you don't even really know.

1005
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:51,040
In fact, like the whole Uber UI, both for eats and the app, they can add and remove

1006
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,440
elements from the UI on the backend.

1007
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,060
I think Marco does this with overcast as well, as well as other apps, obviously here's a

1008
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,060
couple of web views.

1009
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,020
So it kind of feels like that ship has sailed already.

1010
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,500
Like there's no going back now, but this has taken it to whole other levels.

1011
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,020
I could see what you're saying, but well, one ionic is not super huge, right?

1012
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:13,340
So will Apple notice and my impression of kind of chatting with the community on their

1013
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:18,900
forums is ionic is really, really loved by like people like me, right?

1014
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,220
People who develop internal line of business apps for other companies.

1015
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:26,300
I am very tempted because I need an app that can scan my magic, the gathering cards and

1016
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:30,980
put them in an inventory for me, of course, which obviously needs to be updated all the

1017
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,780
time and it needs deep native integration, right?

1018
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,260
And it needs to be highly secure.

1019
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,140
I'm talking end to end encryption here.

1020
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,100
Oh my God.

1021
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:44,900
You don't get to know how many, how many dark rituals I did today and they were dark, Chris.

1022
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,700
Google knows and the FBI is on their way, but yeah, you took a photo with your Android

1023
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,700
phone so they know.

1024
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:55,020
I took a photo of a hot dog and Google made a horrible, horrible mistake.

1025
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,660
That model needed a little more training.

1026
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,660
You know what?

1027
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,660
That's not funny.

1028
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,660
That poor bastard has, I'm sorry.

1029
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,660
I went backwards with that poor bastard.

1030
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,660
Wow.

1031
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,660
Yeah.

1032
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,660
I don't know.

1033
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,660
I think this kind of thing is the future.

1034
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,860
Like you asked me about Maui.

1035
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:10,820
Every time someone wants to bet against the web, they basically just get B slapped.

1036
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:11,820
Yeah.

1037
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,820
Why wouldn't it be the web?

1038
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,380
Didn't NASA just send up something that was, you know, like rust and C plus plus under

1039
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:19,580
the hood, but the front end was basically react JS.

1040
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,860
And when does the absolutely best technology win?

1041
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,180
You know, when does that happen?

1042
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:28,300
Like I'm not saying this web stuff isn't the best technology, but you might argue like

1043
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,740
the native applications using native controls.

1044
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,740
That's the best.

1045
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:35,980
It's okay for iOS users, but you know, when does that ever win?

1046
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,900
The general computing platform always wins.

1047
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,240
It always does because that's the one everybody can write to.

1048
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,660
It's the one everybody gets access to.

1049
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,500
It's the most accessible.

1050
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,940
It's the great, it's the great neutralizer.

1051
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:51,060
Well also like, you know, VHS beat beta, right?

1052
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:54,060
It's a little skewed and I'd be curious for people who are doing more consumer facing

1053
00:57:54,060 --> 00:58:00,020
applications because in my little corner of the world, like double native, are you doing

1054
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:04,580
a Kotlin app or Java app and a, you know, I guess Swift could be Objective-C though

1055
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:08,460
app isn't going to happen.

1056
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,460
No one's paying.

1057
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:16,380
No, no project manager or product manager is going to authorize, you know, a six figure

1058
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:19,340
budget for their internal one app.

1059
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,940
They may authorize stuff like that for like an entire suite of apps with a backing, you

1060
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:27,340
know, backend service and databases and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1061
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,340
I don't know.

1062
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:32,380
Like all of my customers are, you know, the non-Alice ones, right?

1063
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,260
The ones who are doing like mobile projects.

1064
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:38,300
It's all this web stuff, either that or it's like Xamarin.

1065
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:44,340
And I, and God damn it, Chris, just, you know, I'm already sad because, you know, I started

1066
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,340
the morning on Twitter, morning sun yet again.

1067
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,340
Oh yeah.

1068
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,340
Yeah.

1069
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,340
Yeah.

1070
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,580
You thought we'd get away with not mentioning the death of our dearly departed son, Sun

1071
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,580
Microsystems.

1072
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:58,700
I felt the need to correct that before I got the email or to be, Oh my God, your son died.

1073
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:04,900
No, not my son, the son, son, Java Duke.

1074
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:05,900
So I don't know.

1075
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:09,620
I'd be, I'd be curious to hear from you, those of you who are riding that Marco train and

1076
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:14,460
trying to do like a very tasteful, thoughtful direct to consumer apps.

1077
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,460
Does it have to be Swift?

1078
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,460
Does it have to be Kotlin?

1079
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:21,700
Although I've seen Android apps and you guys are not doing great.

1080
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,700
Can it be a web app?

1081
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,700
Am I wrong?

1082
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:29,060
Am I too deep in the dark matter developer, enterprising crap?

1083
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,060
I'd like to know.

1084
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:34,540
Coder dot show slash contact or boosted in with a new podcasting app.

1085
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:38,940
So let's get through a couple of these cause it's just about the end of the show.

1086
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,860
And so something that we're doing on the other shows, we'll eventually be doing it here on

1087
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,580
Coder too, as we've set a 2000 sat limit to get on the show.

1088
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,540
And then going forward, we may make further adjustments, but I wanted to say something

1089
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:56,540
really briefly, even though I know we're going kind of long, the boosts represent a fundamental

1090
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:00,060
paradigm shift for podcasting super quickly.

1091
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:04,420
If you're a YouTuber and you make content on YouTube that the algorithm likes and promotes,

1092
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,900
there's a built in path to revenue.

1093
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:11,860
It's a captured path where you're dancing for the algorithm, but there's a built in

1094
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,060
way to monetize.

1095
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,300
There's a model for YouTube.

1096
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,300
There's no model.

1097
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,260
There's no built in path for podcasting.

1098
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:22,900
So every podcaster comes up with their own bespoke approach to try to monetize and make

1099
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,900
revenue so that way they can do their passion.

1100
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,740
And whenever you get serious about something, you need to do it full time because of the

1101
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,580
amount of focus and attention it requires.

1102
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:37,220
And what you're seeing right now is podcasters are flocking to dynamically inserted ads.

1103
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:41,380
I got a note from Optimus Gray who said he was listening to an English spoken podcast

1104
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:45,260
and he got a dynamically inserted ad in Spanish and they're just never really a great fit

1105
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,260
for the show.

1106
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:52,580
We're also seeing a massive consolidation with Spotify, Apple, Google, and Libsyn who

1107
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:57,420
are trying to centralize podcast advertising and drive their rates way down, which is also

1108
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,940
going to starve the podcast industry.

1109
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:05,180
And podcasters are acquiescing to these pressures because there is no model to follow.

1110
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,180
There is no real light at the end of the tunnel.

1111
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:12,340
You have to create your business from whole cloth.

1112
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:18,020
And so the issue with all of these platforms, Libsyn, Spotify, Apple, Google, is the incentive

1113
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:22,620
is to please the platform provider and operator, their algorithm or whatever they have, not

1114
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,660
the audience.

1115
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,300
The audience isn't the customer.

1116
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:32,740
Boosts represent a fundamental shift for podcasting because it is a truly, and I mean truly on

1117
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:38,020
the technical sense, a truly decentralized no middleman network that's all based on free

1118
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:45,340
software that's built into the podcast app that specifically rewards the creator when

1119
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:49,300
they create something of value that the audience enjoys.

1120
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:54,700
So it's a fundamentally structured incentive system tilted towards the audience because

1121
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,100
the creator gets rewarded when the audience creates good content for them.

1122
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:04,180
Not for the algorithm, not for Spotify's front page, but for the audience.

1123
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:07,560
And Boosts represent the first time in 15 years of podcasting that there could actually

1124
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:12,140
be a built-in path to revenue for podcast that rewards content creators based on the

1125
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:22,560
quality of their content with no middlemen taking a skiff, tilting the wheels of content.

1126
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,220
It's a massive fundamental shift.

1127
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:28,620
So we are trying to figure out how to incorporate them in a way that doesn't like, you know,

1128
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,960
add 20 minutes to the show.

1129
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:37,700
But at the same time, they represent possibly a savior to the medium that is undergoing

1130
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:43,140
right now extreme centralization pressures that I don't go on about as much as I probably

1131
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:46,780
should because of the existential threat, but I know how much it drives everybody crazy

1132
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,940
and I just try to contain that in office hours.

1133
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:53,260
But that is the context in which we find ourselves in the Boost era.

1134
01:02:53,260 --> 01:03:01,340
And so your support via memberships and your support via Boosts are building a pathway

1135
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:07,380
that I'm not even exaggerating, this is not overstating the situation, could literally

1136
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,220
save independent podcasting.

1137
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:13,160
So with that, let's read a couple of these before we get out of here.

1138
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:20,620
And I want to start with our over 9,000 Boost from Bronzewig.

1139
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:25,340
With 9001 sats Chris and Mike, I wonder what you guys think about this Android initiative

1140
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,540
and I took a look at it.

1141
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:34,500
And Google is going all in on green versus blue bubbles, they've produced a video to

1142
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:39,520
shame Apple even the green bubble versus the blue bubble.

1143
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,520
Why is this a thing?

1144
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,900
See, Apple uses SMS and MMS.

1145
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,020
You remember that technology from the 90s?

1146
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:48,460
Anytime their customers want to communicate with someone outside Apple sphere, limiting

1147
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:52,900
them to low res video, no encryption and no red receipts.

1148
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,840
You know that that old tech from the 90s and the whole thing.

1149
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:01,860
It's this whole this whole pitch to shame to have the the public shame Apple to fix

1150
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:03,300
their texting.

1151
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:08,940
Ironically, though, it seems to be backfiring a bit because people don't like RCS that have

1152
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,680
gotten it.

1153
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,680
This is dumb.

1154
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:17,300
I mean, you know, it's a competitive market.

1155
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,780
I message is really, really good.

1156
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,140
I know people don't like it when I say that.

1157
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,180
You know what I like about it?

1158
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,220
I message bypasses the carriers.

1159
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:28,020
Yep, that's what's good about it.

1160
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:29,020
That's why it's better.

1161
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:31,180
RCS is dependent on the carriers.

1162
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,100
And I'm sorry, I that's just not a solution.

1163
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,460
I think that's better for the market.

1164
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:39,060
Yeah, they're not the most innovative fast moving lot over there at the carriers.

1165
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,580
Yeah.

1166
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,580
So I don't know.

1167
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:42,580
I think this is sour grapes.

1168
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:44,220
I get why they're doing it.

1169
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:48,180
I message lock in and we've gotten the emails I don't want to jump into the whole blue green

1170
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:49,180
bubbles thing again.

1171
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:54,700
Yeah, you know, I message lock in a strong it's a problem because like I will be buying

1172
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:57,400
an iPhone every two years for the rest of my life now.

1173
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,400
I agree.

1174
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,580
And can I be ignorant now this next boost is to educate myself user 77 nine probably

1175
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:07,940
need to set your username and fountain they boosted in with 2022 sats and this is me being

1176
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:08,940
completely ignorant.

1177
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:13,980
I've never I've never used a computer sold out of the EU I've never used you know I don't

1178
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,060
know this but he says the EU is glorious.

1179
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:19,380
You get four spaces in Python two in JavaScript.

1180
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:23,780
Is there some is spacing done differently in the EU than it is in the States?

1181
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:26,420
Is this is this a thing?

1182
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,420
What is he talking about?

1183
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:31,140
I think he's just saying the EU is glorious because we kept dunking on it last week.

1184
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,140
You're right.

1185
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,620
They're two separate things.

1186
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,620
Two separate things.

1187
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:35,620
Okay.

1188
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,620
So you're Yeah, well you have to use Yeah.

1189
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:38,620
Okay.

1190
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:39,620
All right.

1191
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,620
Good on you.

1192
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:41,620
You should post your VM RC.

1193
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,260
I wasn't even gonna read the part about them.

1194
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,940
I'm so sick of hearing about them.

1195
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,780
So let's see Chris Chris is an e-max user.

1196
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:52,620
That's all that tells you one thing that hasn't come up and the whole VIM discussion.

1197
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:55,300
I don't think oh maybe it did but I'm just reiterating because I think this is the most

1198
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,300
important point.

1199
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,300
Don't do it.

1200
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:02,460
The value in learning VIM is those key bindings are everywhere.

1201
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:05,780
You know like our even our hedge doc our collaborative markdown.

1202
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:10,340
You can put it in you can put it in VIM mode and you can use the I key bindings to move

1203
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,480
around the dock.

1204
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,480
It's just everywhere.

1205
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,480
Right.

1206
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,480
It's like the M1 Mac.

1207
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,480
It's the obvious better product.

1208
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,480
Yeah.

1209
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,480
Okay.

1210
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:24,100
Oh Kyron aka lower third boosted in with a row of ducks.

1211
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:28,980
And he says following up on the we asked him remember he said it's a real Mario and Luigi

1212
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:32,620
situation which I forgot that I wanted to steal that and use that so this was a nice

1213
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,620
reminder.

1214
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,620
Nice.

1215
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:38,680
He says to try and describe what a Mario and Luigi situation would actually really put

1216
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,220
me in a real Mario and Luigi situation.

1217
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,620
It's not nefarious but it sure is something.

1218
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,260
Keep up the good work.

1219
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:51,160
And here is an honorable mention for Sun Microsystems and Java Duke gone but never forgotten.

1220
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,220
Certainly not on this show.

1221
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:53,220
Every week.

1222
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,220
We're we're more.

1223
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,220
Yeah.

1224
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,660
We're keeping it alive man.

1225
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:58,660
We're keeping it alive.

1226
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,660
All right.

1227
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:07,420
And then a baller here in our parts CB boosted in on like a boosting rampage that I'm a big

1228
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:13,820
fan of with forty three thousand seven hundred and seventy sats because I'm a back home baller

1229
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,380
if I want something I just holler.

1230
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:19,240
He says several months ago the company I've worked for had completely stalled out.

1231
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:23,060
There was no sales no money coming in and no paycheck.

1232
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:27,060
I've worked at this job for nearly a decade as a senior lead developer for the last five

1233
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:28,860
years.

1234
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:32,700
In that time I managed to exercise everything Microsoft from the company.

1235
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:36,820
The previous senior dev had written a good portion of the software in C sharp targeting

1236
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:40,900
Windows which is crazy when you realize we make computer vision based software.

1237
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:45,160
So I got rid of everything Microsoft 100 percent Linux after I was done.

1238
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,420
He continues with another five thousand seven hundred and fourteen sats.

1239
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:54,900
So I'm now out of a job been firing off my CV like mad with zero replies.

1240
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:59,660
I took Mike's advice for a few months and I kind of took a grassroots approach contacted

1241
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:00,660
local companies.

1242
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,700
I got me a few interviews but no job.

1243
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,700
All right.

1244
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,820
Well that's that's some good progress right there.

1245
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,500
I like that that's the Mike recommendation.

1246
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,700
I completely agree with that.

1247
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,240
Go go with the local companies.

1248
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,240
Start there.

1249
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,240
Yeah.

1250
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,060
He says the only company that gave me an offer is a pure Microsoft shop.

1251
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:22,460
I'm talking Windows, Teams, Outlook, Visual Studio, Sharp, Azure, Azure DevOps.

1252
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,460
I had a minor extensional crisis when I found all this out.

1253
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:34,140
Did I commit some sort of genocide in a past life to deserve this?

1254
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,220
I'm also surprised I didn't get any other offers.

1255
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:40,700
I feel as though there's only a few senior roles available but I'm quote overqualified

1256
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,380
for most regular dev roles.

1257
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,700
We just had our boy.

1258
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:47,140
My wife is out on maternity leave so it's the worst possible time to be without income.

1259
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:51,180
I have a job now but with a huge Microsoft catch.

1260
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,980
I guess this is a challenge to my ideals.

1261
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,420
Do you stand your ground or do you feed your family?

1262
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:58,140
Well I'm feeding my family but at least I use Linux at home.

1263
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:04,120
You know I think CB, God I know this is easy for me to say but if I was in your position

1264
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:09,540
I think I would try to take this as an opportunity to just live the Microsoft life for a while.

1265
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:14,820
When I was acquired by Linux Academy, can you imagine that change from going from like

1266
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:20,620
a small team of four or five in a tiny little small LLC to then joining a company of hundreds

1267
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:25,300
of people that had VC funding that was growing like crazy and so I had to just have a mind

1268
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,300
shift.

1269
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:31,340
I went this isn't what I envisioned but this is also an opportunity for me to get reacquainted

1270
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:38,060
with this world and I learned so much with that mindset and I think I'm better at the

1271
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:42,200
independent thing now because of it just like I think you might be better at the Linux thing

1272
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,580
after you've really lived the other way for a while so you truly understand what it's

1273
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:49,220
good and bad at and then you can approach it from a real honest angle which is really

1274
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,620
what's going to be valuable in the market.

1275
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:54,220
For sure yeah and congrats on the baby boy.

1276
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:59,820
The other thing is if you actually do this for a couple years you can now pitch yourself

1277
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:05,900
to whatever your next gig is your next job is as I'm a Microsoft expert I'm a Linux expert

1278
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:12,380
and you can basically be the guy who can bridge those two worlds and there are a lot of places

1279
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:17,660
because Microsoft is just giving you those Azure credits man they're just the first 20

1280
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:18,940
hits are free.

1281
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:25,140
I have a feeling if you can just meditate on you know the glory that is vBasic I know

1282
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:31,820
you're doing C sharp but I thought it was funny for a couple years you're probably going

1283
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:35,180
to be in a super strong position and you're plus your little boy is going to need a lot

1284
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:36,180
of food.

1285
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,580
Yeah they get they just eat more they just eat more and more.

1286
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:43,780
And my understanding of as a divorce man I can tell you wives do not like it when there's

1287
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:44,780
no money.

1288
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:50,620
That's true too that is that is also true CB had to also come in with 2000 sats just

1289
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:51,620
to kind of.

1290
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:52,620
This is where it loses me.

1291
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,620
Yeah.

1292
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:59,380
I want to give my thoughts on Orville I think it does well because it is a TNG clone every

1293
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:04,540
other new show nowadays is always trying to be like the big reveal a big twist generate

1294
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:08,540
social media buzz drive engagement etc.

1295
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:12,700
The Orville is predictable straightforward cookie cutter based stories and I love it.

1296
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:16,420
It's bright it's colorful the characters the characters are passionate and positive and

1297
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:17,420
look out for each other.

1298
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,420
They get excited about things like first contact.

1299
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:23,420
I agree with some of that I saw this boost last night when I was preparing the show and

1300
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:26,460
I thought all right honey let's watch some Orville.

1301
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:34,780
And so I watched the episode where their federation is trying to strike an alliance with a patriarchal

1302
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:37,020
arcal society that hates men.

1303
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:42,580
And so they have the captain and all of the men pretend like they just do grunt work.

1304
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:48,420
And so for 45 minutes of the show they lie to this other species about the role of men

1305
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:52,780
in there in the human society and the entire time you're just smacking your forehead going

1306
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:53,780
why are they lying to them.

1307
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:57,180
How is this treaty treaty going to work if they sign the treaty and then there's a big

1308
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:01,660
reveal that surprise actually men have a role in society.

1309
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:02,660
How is this going to work.

1310
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:05,100
And I'm just the entire time like this doesn't make any sense.

1311
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,640
This is clearly not going to work.

1312
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,880
And now that episode still has really good moments in it.

1313
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:14,500
But every single time I watch the Orville I go to my I'm saying out loud like this doesn't

1314
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:20,740
make any sense or like they do things that are really kind of dark like the doctor pressures

1315
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:23,660
the robot into changing himself and it's twisted.

1316
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:27,880
And it's like if you take yourself out of the character it's it's a twisted dark thing

1317
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,880
to watch.

1318
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,580
I'm just constantly I have that experience when I watch the Orville.

1319
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,700
I have yet to watch it.

1320
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:38,660
I did watch I started to watch the first episode seemed OK but I will put this on my list.

1321
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:41,140
I mean I'm watching it slowly.

1322
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:47,620
It is there are I say also good moments in the show and as the seasons go on it gets

1323
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:48,980
better.

1324
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:51,560
Every time with the Orville the first few episodes of the season I'm a little shaky

1325
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,940
on and by the end of the season I'm like oh I'd like some more of that.

1326
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:58,580
That's how it goes every single time we're discovery it's the opposite first couple episodes

1327
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,580
of the season.

1328
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:03,640
I'm like OK you got me midway or by the end I'm like this damn show.

1329
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,620
These were who the hell writes this thing right.

1330
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:06,620
They lose me.

1331
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:11,420
So at least it has that he goes on to CB goes on to say with another 2001 sets the Orville

1332
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:15,860
isn't perfect but it was the best until strange new worlds came along.

1333
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,980
I like both shows and that's allowed right.

1334
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:20,460
Yeah I think that is allowed.

1335
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:26,380
And then our last boost just came in from George or banks with four thousand four hundred

1336
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,700
and forty four sets.

1337
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:28,700
Here's how it goes.

1338
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,820
Hey hey hey you've got to pay more stats if you're going to infringe on my copyright.

1339
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:32,820
I know right.

1340
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:33,820
Hey I know.

1341
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:36,860
Actually George or is pretty funny too is pretty good though I like it.

1342
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:39,100
Star Wars then the Orville then Star Trek.

1343
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,100
Fight me Trekkies.

1344
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,100
Yeah.

1345
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:42,100
I like that.

1346
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,100
I would reverse that.

1347
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,100
I would reverse that.

1348
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,100
What are you doing.

1349
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,100
You got a minute.

1350
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:51,460
I'm going to take this guy Mr. Quackers boosted with a row of ducks saying thanks.

1351
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:56,340
Cospe and also boosted in and asked if we've tried to Google's GitHub alternative which

1352
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:02,860
I have to admit I have no because they're going to kill my next show bother or like

1353
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:03,860
to.

1354
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:04,860
Yeah.

1355
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:05,940
Or they'll have me arrested for writing some book.

1356
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:06,940
I don't know.

1357
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:07,940
Oh yeah.

1358
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:08,940
That's the dark twist now.

1359
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:12,760
There's always that you're you know you take the wrong picture and oh God I would get so

1360
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,960
screwed if my business account got actually because I know you put this on YouTube.

1361
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:20,940
It was totally the right decision to kill ways and reader and I apologize for ever criticizing

1362
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:21,940
Google.

1363
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:22,940
Oh no.

1364
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:23,940
Oh God.

1365
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:24,940
I hope they don't kill ways.

1366
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:25,940
Don't say that.

1367
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:26,940
They already killed ways.

1368
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:27,940
No.

1369
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:28,940
Oh I'm thinking wave.

1370
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:29,940
It's so dead.

1371
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:30,940
I can't remember the name anymore.

1372
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:31,940
Yeah.

1373
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:35,720
The traumas inflicted on us by a company that pretends to be a kindergarten but is really

1374
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,140
a billion multi-billion dollar behemoth.

1375
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,500
But they've got rainbow colors in their logo.

1376
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,840
And there'll be really nice to you if they invite you to their Chelsea office and let

1377
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:48,580
you play with Legos and give you lots and lots of coffee.

1378
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:55,140
They put socially accurate and I'd say prescient art on their website.

1379
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,300
So they've got to be good.

1380
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:02,940
By the way my new TV is a Google TV and I'm very aware that it is definitely listening

1381
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:06,660
to my son be extremely aggressive in Mario Tennis.

1382
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:07,660
All right.

1383
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:12,100
If you'd like to send us a boost go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

1384
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,140
I like Fountain.

1385
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:16,660
They're building in Podverse into our website.

1386
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:17,660
It's great.

1387
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:19,780
Castamatic is fantastic as well.

1388
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,780
They all work.

1389
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:21,780
You just need one.

1390
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:25,740
You can also just grab Breeze and not even not even switch podcast apps.

1391
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:29,540
It's all listed newpodcastapps.com.

1392
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:32,460
Mr. Dominic is there anywhere you'd like to send the good people before it gets?

1393
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,460
Of course.

1394
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:37,140
I'd like to send everyone to at Duminico on Twitter and for George Roribinx may the light

1395
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,780
of Kalish sends you on a better path.

1396
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:40,780
Yeah.

1397
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:41,780
You know what.

1398
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:45,780
I like invoking the name of Kalish on people upon people right.

1399
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:48,580
It works really well at the bank too.

1400
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,580
They love it.

1401
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:53,500
Well the wrath of Kalish be upon your head and your family.

1402
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,500
Sir this is a Wendy's.

1403
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,500
All right.
