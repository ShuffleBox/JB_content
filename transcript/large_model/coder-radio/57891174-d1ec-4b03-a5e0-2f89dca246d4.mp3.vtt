00:00.000 --> 00:15.600
This is KOTORadio, episode 473 for July 4th, 2022.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.160
Hello friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:19.160 --> 00:25.080
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.080 --> 00:31.560
My name is Chris and joining us in his flag-themed outfit, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:31.560 --> 00:32.560
That's right.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.040
Chris, can we hear that eagle soar?

00:34.040 --> 00:35.040
We got an eagle.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.040
You sure I should let it out, Mike?

00:36.040 --> 00:37.040
You sure?

00:37.040 --> 00:38.040
Let it out.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.040
Let it out.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.040
That's right.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.040
I'm putting down the tea, picking up the coffee.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.960
Look at the way it goes.

00:43.960 --> 00:44.960
Look at that.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.840
I can't remember other British things.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.840
Hold on.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.120
I think it just stole someone's hot dog.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.120
Oh.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.120
Yes.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.120
No.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.120
Geez.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.960
Well, we just ruined their Independence Day.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.440
So yeah, it's a holiday here in the States.

00:56.440 --> 00:57.440
Yes.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.160
Of course, by the time you're hearing, it's over.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.200
We have that whole time delay.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.920
That's kind of the reasons we always just do a show, because by the time you're hearing

01:02.920 --> 01:04.680
this, your holiday is over.

01:04.680 --> 01:07.220
So here we are for you.

01:07.220 --> 01:13.520
I got to say, I have a little bit of, I don't know, slash envy, slash impressed.

01:13.520 --> 01:14.520
I don't know.

01:14.520 --> 01:15.680
You have become like a grill master.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.400
I didn't even realize you owned a grill.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.280
And then you know how I stalk you on Twitter, as I do.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.680
And as one of everyone.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.040
And I'm just seeing all kinds of goodies all the time.

01:25.040 --> 01:28.640
I mean, grilled ribs, grilled corn on the cob.

01:28.640 --> 01:29.640
Those ribs were not me.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.640
But it's funny you mentioned ribs, Chris.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.640
Yeah.

01:32.640 --> 01:36.520
Are you flying down or teleporting via LadyJuice, my serial network?

01:36.520 --> 01:38.920
I mean, if I need to for ribs, I probably could.

01:38.920 --> 01:43.720
There are going to be barbecue ribs, a couple of hot dogs, because we have some children

01:43.720 --> 01:50.080
that have not experienced or embraced the glory that is ribs, which great.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.080
More for dad.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.080
Not a problem.

01:52.080 --> 02:00.080
But ribs there, paired with some Redwood Empire bourbon, as well as some Mexican corn, again,

02:00.080 --> 02:01.080
on the grill.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.080
Oh, my.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.080
Yes.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.960
And French fries, because little kids exist.

02:05.960 --> 02:06.960
But yeah.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.320
That sounds like a lot of fun.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.320
That's nice.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.320
That's nice.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.320
There will be a picture.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.480
Don't worry.

02:12.480 --> 02:17.800
I don't generally see you get like, you know, a three or four head day start on the show.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.900
But this is a special week.

02:19.900 --> 02:24.240
You got a jumpstart, and I think I think there's one man that deserves credit for it.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.240
It can only be one.

02:25.240 --> 02:29.040
And of course, it is the Egon Egon has written into the show again.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.120
He says, Hi, guys.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.480
This is Egon.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.080
As I've told you before, the joy of listening to Mike and Chris chat about the art and business

02:35.080 --> 02:39.900
of software development and the world of technology is the weekly highlight of my commute.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.960
But episode 471 was special.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.600
Birthday drunk, freshly engaged Mike is the best kind of Mike.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.400
I love his vibes.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.000
Coder Radio is the most informative, entertaining tech podcast I know.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.020
But when you started to talk about me and to me, the joy of listening to your show raised

02:57.020 --> 02:59.720
like an Apple stock since 2019.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.680
Damn.

03:01.680 --> 03:06.160
Now it's time for me to give back to the greatest show on Earth, apart from being a Coder QA

03:06.160 --> 03:07.640
member for the first hour.

03:07.640 --> 03:10.260
But of course, a first hour Coder QA member.

03:10.260 --> 03:11.400
That is impressive.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.560
Now it is time for me to give back to the greatest show on Earth, apart from being a

03:14.560 --> 03:20.000
Coder QA member, I will do I henceforth apply for one of the following positions on the

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Coder Radio team.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
All right.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Get ready.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.560
The official Coder Radio mascot or 90 percent Coder Radio Jesus without the 100 percent

03:29.560 --> 03:31.000
because he doesn't want to get nailed on to things.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.320
So he wants to be the 90 percent Coder Jesus or president of the German speaking Coder

03:36.320 --> 03:38.000
Radio chapter in Europe.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.720
I'll be waiting for your answers with great anticipation.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.720
The Egon.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.680
This is a tough call.

03:43.680 --> 03:47.560
I think Egon is probably qualified for any of these three positions for sure.

03:47.560 --> 03:53.360
And also, I am concerned about the size of the organization just growing and growing.

03:53.360 --> 03:58.040
And so I feel like there may be room to collapse a couple of these positions and just give

03:58.040 --> 03:59.560
more work to Egon.

03:59.560 --> 04:03.840
I feel like he could just do all three, although I have to say the German aspect of it is very

04:03.840 --> 04:09.580
intriguing to me because I failed to tweet this, but I do often grill brats and various

04:09.580 --> 04:11.380
other types of German sausages.

04:11.380 --> 04:12.380
There's that.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.380
Yeah.

04:13.380 --> 04:14.640
I would probably be aware of that.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.640
Yeah.

04:15.640 --> 04:16.640
The radio mascot.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.640
I think that's that's probably pretty good.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.600
The Coder Jesus one is tricky.

04:19.600 --> 04:20.600
That's tricky.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.600
I see.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.840
I think he'd be more like a Coder John the Baptist, right?

04:23.840 --> 04:25.320
He's like spreading the word.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.320
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.320
That's exact.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.320
Yeah.

04:29.320 --> 04:30.320
All right.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.440
So why don't we go ahead and give approval since we're having our little production meeting

04:32.440 --> 04:37.520
now to Egon being the official Coder Radio mascot and the president of the German speaking

04:37.520 --> 04:39.680
Coder Radio chapter of Europe.

04:39.680 --> 04:45.740
And we will revisit his exact status in the actual order of the Church of Coder Radio.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.400
But it's definitely high up there.

04:47.400 --> 04:48.400
That's for sure.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.400
Right.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.400
Incredible work, Egon.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.400
Keep it up.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.360
And also, Gary gets a little point in the chat room for managing to mention Snow Leopard

04:54.360 --> 04:56.640
less than three minutes into the episode.

04:56.640 --> 05:00.720
We've got some trains so well.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.720
Nicely done chat room.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.800
You know what?

05:02.800 --> 05:03.800
They know how to make you happy.

05:03.800 --> 05:09.280
Wait, can Egon like wear a Snow Leopard themed outfit with maybe like an adium watch?

05:09.280 --> 05:10.280
We can make this work.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.440
I feel like this is going a different direction.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.080
Like this is a different thing.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.120
So that's a different podcast, I think.

05:17.120 --> 05:23.280
You know, I want to just put one more word out there for the London meetup because I

05:23.280 --> 05:24.280
won't be there.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.840
And I want to make that clear.

05:26.840 --> 05:30.160
But Alex from Self Hosted is going to be there as well as a bunch of community members.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.680
And I feel like this could be the proto meetup.

05:33.680 --> 05:39.240
I've been looking to get over in the London area forever, and it'd be great to bring a

05:39.240 --> 05:41.880
few members of the crew over there and do a meetup.

05:41.880 --> 05:45.520
And so this is sort of like the scouting mission, right?

05:45.520 --> 05:50.760
We're sending over the early scouts to go over and discover the territory.

05:50.760 --> 05:55.400
So meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, they've got a venue, they got a date.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
It's getting solid.

05:56.400 --> 06:01.020
And an obligatory plug for the new J.B. Meetups Matrix space.

06:01.020 --> 06:06.040
This is an area where we are organizing physical meetups and virtual meetups.

06:06.040 --> 06:10.520
We have a London Colony meetup chat room, a Pacific Northwest Colony, a Mumble Colony.

06:10.520 --> 06:13.120
I could see the Mumble ones for virtual events.

06:13.120 --> 06:17.760
I could see us doing a California one because we have a California road trip coming up soon.

06:17.760 --> 06:23.880
I could see us doing one in Raleigh, Florida one, you know, Florida Man community chat

06:23.880 --> 06:24.880
room.

06:24.880 --> 06:25.880
Yeah, I haven't come to Florida.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.160
Yeah, one day I would like to.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.840
I mean, I have been.

06:28.840 --> 06:29.840
I have been.

06:29.840 --> 06:34.920
The nice thing about doing a meetup in Florida, if you do it near Orlando in particular or

06:34.920 --> 06:39.440
even Tampa works good, is that the whole economy, other than Disney, which I don't know if the

06:39.440 --> 06:44.120
governor has his way, we're going to just like send some cats in to catch the mouse,

06:44.120 --> 06:47.360
is basically geared towards this exact thing, right?

06:47.360 --> 06:51.820
It's all like people come in, they do their thing, they leave.

06:51.820 --> 06:52.820
We pay no income tax.

06:52.820 --> 06:54.920
We tax the **** out of you while you're here.

06:54.920 --> 06:55.920
It's amazing.

06:55.920 --> 06:56.920
Really good stuff.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.960
I was surprised by Raleigh.

06:58.960 --> 07:03.080
There is a lot of industry in Raleigh and that I realized is kind of part of it is if

07:03.080 --> 07:07.120
you can do meetups around where there's some big industry buildings where they have offices,

07:07.120 --> 07:09.320
you get a lot of listeners that show up.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.000
It's kind of funny how that works.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah, I wouldn't mind going to Raleigh this time.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Oh, yeah.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Be good.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
I you know, I was it was funny.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.360
I was going to go to Linux Fest Southeast or right.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.360
Mm hmm.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.360
Southeast Linux Fest.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.360
Yeah, thank you.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.360
That's the one.

07:22.360 --> 07:26.040
And apparently it either didn't happen or happened early this year or I for some reason

07:26.040 --> 07:27.040
thought it was early.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.240
I don't know, man.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.480
That was crazy.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.480
I wanted to go.

07:30.480 --> 07:34.000
And then I think I saw like my buddy Noah chatting in Telegram or something that it

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
was live right then.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I was like, oh, what?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Oh, yeah.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Well, Emma told me because she's like, are you coming to any events this year?

07:40.000 --> 07:44.320
Yeah, I'm going to go to self and she's like, but I'm we're here now.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.320
What are you talking about?

07:45.320 --> 07:46.320
Yeah.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.320
Yeah.

07:47.320 --> 07:48.880
This it's you know, I got to get back.

07:48.880 --> 07:52.360
There used to be a good app and I can't remember what it was to track like all the upcoming

07:52.360 --> 07:53.720
events for a given topic.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.560
And I guess I don't know if it's gone.

07:55.560 --> 07:59.400
It's funny how some events are they're pretty clever.

07:59.400 --> 08:03.240
They reach out to media with an email that says, hey, just so you know, this is the details

08:03.240 --> 08:04.240
about our event.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.720
If you get a chance to mention on there, that'd be great.

08:05.720 --> 08:09.400
But just want you to be aware of what's going on because they realize, hey, you know, they

08:09.400 --> 08:11.040
probably talk to hundreds of thousands of people.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.360
So if we tell them then they could tell hundreds of thousands of people.

08:14.360 --> 08:20.320
But then other events just don't think that way and they don't reach out and they don't

08:20.320 --> 08:22.360
try to like get coverage.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.780
And I think it hurts their growth a little bit.

08:24.780 --> 08:26.680
It's sort of an echo chamber thing, too, I suppose.

08:26.680 --> 08:27.680
Yeah.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.720
Well, it sucks to for local events that don't really maybe know how to do the outreach.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.320
And I've had it so many times where I realize like there was literally something in Tampa

08:35.320 --> 08:39.960
that would have been cool for me to go, like maybe do an interview for the show or something,

08:39.960 --> 08:42.880
you know, some kind of like because we have a lot of weird like infosec stuff because

08:42.880 --> 08:45.640
we have a big military base here.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.780
And just like they don't they don't publish anything.

08:48.780 --> 08:54.160
And they're surprised when all their events are super duper small.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.880
Linode.com slash coder.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.860
Go there to get one hundred dollars and 60 day credit on a new account.

08:58.860 --> 09:02.000
And it's just a great way to support the show while you learn something.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.920
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.760
You got to try it for your next project.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.400
Maybe it could be the back end for your business.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.680
That's what I do.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.400
Maybe it's just a personal site.

09:10.400 --> 09:14.100
You know, maybe you got a portfolio, maybe you got a blog you want to put there.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.200
Maybe you want your own personal peer tube instance.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.200
It's actually great for that.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.040
And then you can use their object storage back end for the video storage, which is killer.

09:21.040 --> 09:25.320
But if you need like a high performance application, well, they've got you covered there, too.

09:25.320 --> 09:29.040
They got MVME storage, PCI beautiful MVE storage.

09:29.040 --> 09:32.240
They got their own ISP connections.

09:32.240 --> 09:36.580
So they have just screaming 40 gigabit connections coming into these machines.

09:36.580 --> 09:40.680
And of course, they've got processors with AMD, epic CPUs and 11 data centers around

09:40.680 --> 09:41.680
the world.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.320
So you're going to find something near you or your customers.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.060
Linode's been doing this for nearly 19 years.

09:47.060 --> 09:51.000
Crazy cats got started in 2003 because they just saw where Linux was going.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.280
They saw where the technology could take them.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.280
I can resonate with that.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.280
I think you might, too.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.200
And I think you'll see it throughout the service.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.560
And then if you ever get any trouble, you'll find that they have the best service.

10:00.560 --> 10:06.080
You know, somehow those hyperscalers can make billions and billions and billions of dollars,

10:06.080 --> 10:09.340
but they can't do simple support.

10:09.340 --> 10:10.980
Maybe there's something special to it.

10:10.980 --> 10:12.400
Maybe it's not so simple.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.960
Maybe Linode just has it figured out after nearly 19 years.

10:14.960 --> 10:19.760
Either way, go try it for yourself and find out, support the show and get $100.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.120
Go try out my host.

10:21.120 --> 10:25.800
I wouldn't host our applications anywhere else, and I think you'll feel the same way.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.040
Linode.com slash coder.

10:28.040 --> 10:34.720
All right, Mr. Dominic, let's talk about your Linux 2022 toolbox.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.240
Actually, let's issue a challenge.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.800
Your ad read just inspired me.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.400
All right, give it to me.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.320
Use the Linode code.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.720
Use their managed, I think it's Postgres thing.

10:44.720 --> 10:45.720
Yeah.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.560
I think they do a couple, but I think it's Postgres and MySQL for sure.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.080
Yeah, and they got Mongo, too.

10:49.080 --> 10:52.040
They got Mongo, Postgres, and MySQL.

10:52.040 --> 10:56.520
Build, you have to be in the US, blah, blah, blah, the same caveats I always put on it.

10:56.520 --> 11:02.720
I, for some reason, have a spare dev one because I think I entered some alcoholic fugue state

11:02.720 --> 11:06.240
where I just started ordering dev ones.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.560
Yes.

11:07.560 --> 11:08.960
See this is why it used to be a video show.

11:08.960 --> 11:13.840
Your face is priceless right now, like it's amazing.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.720
I almost did a spit take on the mixer.

11:15.720 --> 11:16.720
I legitimately-

11:16.720 --> 11:17.720
That would have been amazing.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.560
I'm watching your reactions to the nonsense.

11:19.560 --> 11:20.560
It's amazing.

11:20.560 --> 11:25.400
You're just like, the sad part is Chris knows that this is 100% definitely true.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.320
Oh yeah, of course, of course, yeah.

11:27.320 --> 11:32.840
So tell you what, the winner who could make me the best web application, not just me,

11:32.840 --> 11:40.320
like post it publicly, whatever, that tracks all the dev slash community events in the

11:40.320 --> 11:44.760
States, particularly focusing on the Northwest and the Southeast, like that's where we are.

11:44.760 --> 11:49.680
A nice format where you can add it to your calendar with links to sign up so that next

11:49.680 --> 11:54.960
time there's an event that makes sense for either Chris or I to go to, we can just not

11:54.960 --> 11:59.600
screw it up and actually know about it, unlike this yourself, which is my fault.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.040
A Linux community event tracker.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
Yeah.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.360
I mean, it'd be cool if you could just sign up for an email every time there's one added

12:05.360 --> 12:06.360
or something.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.360
Yeah.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.360
Or a calendar ICS feed.

12:08.360 --> 12:12.820
You know, I know the Portland area has one specifically for Portland, but we need something

12:12.820 --> 12:13.820
for our reporter.

12:13.820 --> 12:17.120
There's a bunch for like, even meetup.com does something like it.

12:17.120 --> 12:21.560
But first of all, their filters are, their filters are just awful, but I'm thinking someone

12:21.560 --> 12:25.860
who knows, you know, knows the show, knows the JB community, and this could be something

12:25.860 --> 12:30.440
useful for other hosts or other even just community members sign up for have better

12:30.440 --> 12:31.440
meetups.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.440
We could put our stuff on there.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.080
I'm surprised this doesn't exist.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.080
I haven't found it.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.640
If it, I mean, if it exists, then you know, all bets are off, but I haven't found it.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.120
Yeah, no, I have not either.

12:39.120 --> 12:43.800
I, like I said, I know of like the, the one in Portland, which I think is actually open

12:43.800 --> 12:44.800
source.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.800
Oh yeah.

12:45.800 --> 12:46.800
It has to be open source.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.800
Right?

12:47.800 --> 12:48.800
Like that's the caveat.

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
Open source on GitHub.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.800
GPL it if you want.

12:50.800 --> 12:51.800
Oh yeah.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.280
Calligator is what they call it.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.280
Calligator.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.280
That's terrible.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.280
Yeah.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.520
Well, you know, you could fork that.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.520
Yeah.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.120
It's Portland's tech calendar, calligator.org.

13:01.120 --> 13:05.160
And it is a collection of all of the events.

13:05.160 --> 13:10.800
Like here's some data engineering Q and a night, uh, software engineering beyond bootcamp,

13:10.800 --> 13:13.760
mentorship Saturdays, just different events, including they'll have their Linux.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.760
Yeah.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.720
Community events on there and whatnot.

13:16.720 --> 13:17.720
Someone could look at that.

13:17.720 --> 13:18.720
I'll put a link in the show notes.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.880
Maybe somebody could get started there.

13:19.880 --> 13:24.200
You know, I will say the, uh, young man, I didn't, I didn't feature him cause he was

13:24.200 --> 13:28.440
a underage and I just, you know, but who made me, or maybe he was 17, 18.

13:28.440 --> 13:34.000
I don't remember who made me the snow leopard GTK theme did in fact, I guess his gazelle.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.520
I'm just saying I always pay, I always pay my bets.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.320
So that's great.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.640
Oh, right.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.640
Okay.

13:40.640 --> 13:45.760
So you've updated your Linux toolbox for 2020 and you've got some, you know, you've been

13:45.760 --> 13:49.480
playing around some new hardware, certain software has been discontinued.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.280
Some software I think has become more prominent.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.280
Tell me a little bit about it.

13:52.280 --> 13:53.280
Yeah.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.480
So, um, you know, for, for you hardcore Linux heads, I think a lot of this is going to be

13:56.480 --> 14:02.260
like lay doi, but kind of, I've been using the Mac a lot and I still have not been able

14:02.260 --> 14:08.440
to move my, this is kind of sideways, but my, uh, like audio production stuff.

14:08.440 --> 14:12.200
I don't do a lot of it like Chris, but I do enough that it's annoying, but you could like

14:12.200 --> 14:14.080
Photoshop workflow onto Linux.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.120
Although I am learning the gimp.

14:16.120 --> 14:20.840
Also it seems that, uh, old Adobe has plans to make a web version of Photoshop.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.600
There's also photo P which I don't know if you ever tried that.

14:23.600 --> 14:30.560
I don't know that one photo P like P E a, it is like Photoshop seven in the web browser.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.560
It's not bad actually.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.320
Oh, that actually would be perfect.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.320
And it opens and saves.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.880
I think it saves, but I know it opens PSD files too.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.760
So there's something interesting.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.760
So that would be super good.

14:40.760 --> 14:41.760
Yeah.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.760
I don't do a ton of it.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.200
It's always like, you know what, when you're working with a designer on a product, they're

14:44.200 --> 14:47.760
all, they hate cutting assets and they always want to hand you just a photo set up file.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.760
Right.

14:48.760 --> 14:49.760
And they're just like, here you go.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.760
Yes.

14:50.760 --> 14:51.760
Yes.

14:51.760 --> 14:52.760
Totally.

14:52.760 --> 14:53.760
All right.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.760
So yeah, Rob, I'm just going to run through the list.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.760
Some of this is obvious vs code.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.760
Why?

14:56.760 --> 14:57.760
Because I'm a developer and I don't like to pay for things.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.520
And also Microsoft has thrown just a stupid amount of investment vs code.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.520
It's really good.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.520
We all know that everybody has their preferences.

15:04.520 --> 15:05.520
Move on.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.520
Melt.

15:06.520 --> 15:07.520
I really like melt.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.640
Thank you for putting melt in here.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.280
I don't understand what's wrong with meld.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.600
It's a, it's a gooey dipping tool.

15:13.600 --> 15:18.920
It's comparable to the popular Mac app kaleidoscope, which is also a gooey giving tool, except

15:18.920 --> 15:19.920
meld is free.

15:19.920 --> 15:25.280
It's an almost every app store on Linux that I could think of that runs gnome.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.800
I don't know, man.

15:26.800 --> 15:32.200
It gifts my like merge conflicts or various versions of documents really quickly, really

15:32.200 --> 15:33.200
visually.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.840
You can customize it to a point.

15:34.840 --> 15:39.800
It's one of those tools that I use a lot and just works.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.320
Sounds super boring.

15:41.320 --> 15:47.480
I like it better than the vs code diff tool, mostly because I like having it side by side

15:47.480 --> 15:51.080
with the colorized, uh, like colors, the different versions, right?

15:51.080 --> 15:55.040
Like, you know, blue is whatever colors you pick, but like mine is blue and red.

15:55.040 --> 15:59.400
So I could see like, okay, we have this three way merge, you know, where the hell did we

15:59.400 --> 16:00.500
go wrong?

16:00.500 --> 16:05.800
The next one is color picker, which is again, super simple, but this, my post is really

16:05.800 --> 16:09.960
targeting people coming from the Mac Mac has the, what is the digital cuddle color meter.

16:09.960 --> 16:10.960
Is that right?

16:10.960 --> 16:11.960
Is that what they call it?

16:11.960 --> 16:13.440
I mean, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.440
Yeah.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.640
This is a better version of that, believe it or not.

16:15.640 --> 16:19.440
This is a case where the Linux alternative is in fact like more full featured, easier

16:19.440 --> 16:22.400
to use and makes a lot more sense for what you're doing.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.400
So it's great.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.600
You can put a droplet or a pipette or whatever they call that anywhere on your screen and

16:27.600 --> 16:32.680
it will get you the color of that item in various formats.

16:32.680 --> 16:36.720
Super useful if you're doing something for a client and you know, they just got to have

16:36.720 --> 16:38.240
their shade of blue, right?

16:38.240 --> 16:43.320
But no one wants to give you a hex code or RGB code for it because they don't know it.

16:43.320 --> 16:47.040
My next one up, I use this damn thing every day on every operating system.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.040
Postman.

16:48.040 --> 16:53.240
If you don't know what Postman is and you either write API calls or you use API calls,

16:53.240 --> 16:54.240
it's free.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.240
Go download it.

16:55.240 --> 16:58.400
You can download it from the Electron app, but it will make your life a hundred times

16:58.400 --> 17:03.080
easier than just having to like curl, test your requests or, you know, have some giant

17:03.080 --> 17:05.480
document of like request samples.

17:05.480 --> 17:06.480
You can save them.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.480
You can group them.

17:07.480 --> 17:12.000
You can have collections for like, I have it by client mostly, but I have it by project

17:12.000 --> 17:14.340
if it's for our internal stuff.

17:14.340 --> 17:15.340
Really good.

17:15.340 --> 17:19.140
You can also do variable, like variable values.

17:19.140 --> 17:22.680
So like if you're on one machine, the API key can be this, if you're on another machine

17:22.680 --> 17:24.080
it can be that.

17:24.080 --> 17:25.760
Super cool stuff.

17:25.760 --> 17:26.960
Really useful.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.840
There is a paid option, which I do pay for.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.280
Getting some love in the chat room too.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.280
Oh yeah.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.280
You got to check out the Postman.

17:33.280 --> 17:37.480
Hammerless says it's one of the Electron apps that doesn't feel like an Electron app.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.560
It does exactly what it says on the tin, right?

17:39.560 --> 17:40.560
It just works.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.560
Tabby Terminal.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.560
All right.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.360
So this is one where I decided to bitch at somebody.

17:45.360 --> 17:49.400
I don't know why Zach and company at Warp Terminal seem to be wanting to duck the when

17:49.400 --> 17:51.640
is it coming to Linux question.

17:51.640 --> 17:52.640
Actually I have a suspicion.

17:52.640 --> 17:53.640
Can I fry some bacon?

17:53.640 --> 17:54.640
Yeah.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.640
You want some?

17:55.640 --> 17:56.640
All right.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.720
So Warp Terminal, we covered it a couple of weeks ago or a month ago.

17:58.720 --> 17:59.720
You can look it up.

17:59.720 --> 18:00.980
We'll put it in the show notes.

18:00.980 --> 18:05.440
They keep making mouth noises about like a web-based version of it because they want

18:05.440 --> 18:08.440
this whole like remote teamwork and they have a lot of features for that.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.000
I have a feeling they're going to do the web before they do Linux.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
I just do.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.280
And that to me is a big mistake.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.400
And then Linux users can go run it in a web browser.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.560
They're not going to, right?

18:17.560 --> 18:19.360
Or they'll do some like they package it, right?

18:19.360 --> 18:20.860
But whatever.

18:20.860 --> 18:26.460
So I've decided to go to a web-based terminal called Tappy.

18:26.460 --> 18:30.440
I will say this is the one where I like it over G Terminal.

18:30.440 --> 18:34.040
It has some better auto-completion, some more configurability.

18:34.040 --> 18:37.560
If you're on Mac and you haven't tried Warp, I know they have the weird thing where you

18:37.560 --> 18:43.280
have to log in with GitHub, but unless you're like super worried about that, they don't

18:43.280 --> 18:44.760
track what you do in the terminal.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.400
You can turn all that stuff off.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.360
It is really good.

18:49.360 --> 18:56.200
I'm Tappy for now, but I would be going back to them if they could get on Linux since other

18:56.200 --> 19:00.960
than this kind of production stuff, I'm basically daily driving.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.480
So yeah, what did I miss?

19:02.480 --> 19:03.680
I know I'm missing stuff.

19:03.680 --> 19:04.680
You think so?

19:04.680 --> 19:05.680
It's funny.

19:05.680 --> 19:10.300
I can forget that I'm on the dev one sometimes because I'm really just living in like terminal

19:10.300 --> 19:14.440
windows tiled all over the place and VS code.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.440
That's so nice.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.480
It's so clean.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.800
It's so portable, that setup.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.600
Like you could run that on anything, really.

19:20.600 --> 19:21.600
That's a great place to be.

19:21.600 --> 19:25.920
I mean, you got all the obvious things like, of course, chat apps and whatnot.

19:25.920 --> 19:26.920
Yeah.

19:26.920 --> 19:32.000
I didn't put like, you know, Lutris in there because I was kind of, you know, I will give

19:32.000 --> 19:38.400
the Linux machine over the Mac, like most of my Steam library seems to work relatively

19:38.400 --> 19:39.400
well.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.400
Yeah.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.400
Oh, it's way better.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.400
It's way better.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.400
And it's pretty neat.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.400
It's only a 16 gig machine, too.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.400
I was surprised.

19:45.400 --> 19:49.640
It's a time where if you want a game and you want a good developer workstation, Linux makes

19:49.640 --> 19:54.040
a lot more sense than the Mac and the Mac is in such a bad gaming position right now.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.380
I'll toss in one bonus app.

19:56.380 --> 20:01.920
If you like me end up with multiple browsers to either test things in different browsers

20:01.920 --> 20:06.040
or for different account reasons, there is an app that I've mentioned maybe once before

20:06.040 --> 20:07.040
on the show.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.140
Maybe it's called Junction.

20:09.140 --> 20:11.200
And it's like Bumper on Mac OS.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.540
It lets you choose the browser a link opens in.

20:14.540 --> 20:15.540
So you click a link.

20:15.540 --> 20:16.540
Oh, that's cool.

20:16.540 --> 20:17.540
Yeah.

20:17.540 --> 20:20.560
And this little pop up overlay that lists your browsers, you know, just icons or whatever

20:20.560 --> 20:22.720
browser auto detects on your system.

20:22.720 --> 20:26.360
You tap that browser and then that browser launches with the URL.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.360
That's super cool.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.360
Yeah.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.560
I use this a surprising amount.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.480
I just there's some things I use Chrome for, some things I use Firefox, some things Edge

20:34.480 --> 20:35.920
even good on Web.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.040
So you mentioned Edge.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.700
I had Edge in here and I took it out because I was afraid that the whole thing would be

20:40.700 --> 20:43.680
overshadowed by Edge 8.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.440
I am living in Edge now.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.560
You know, but are you really?

20:47.560 --> 20:52.400
It is the easiest way for me to sync all my insanely long passwords.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.400
And I still have to let Google authenticate with the authenticator app, everything, but

20:56.400 --> 20:57.400
it runs everywhere.

20:57.400 --> 21:01.200
I mean, if it works for you, you know, I have Edge in a couple of spots because for whatever

21:01.200 --> 21:06.200
reason, some of these apps we use for remote shows and stuff just use considerably less

21:06.200 --> 21:08.480
CPU and Edge than they do Chrome or Firefox.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.700
I don't know what they're doing.

21:10.700 --> 21:15.040
So I end up reluctantly using Edge quite a bit for that sort of stuff.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.720
I wonder how many people are using Linux and Edge at the same time.

21:18.720 --> 21:24.040
But you know, it's like, well, yeah, yeah, officer, I did have a drink or two, but listen,

21:24.040 --> 21:26.960
my grandma died and I was running Edge.

21:26.960 --> 21:27.960
Yeah.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.260
Oh, I see.

21:29.260 --> 21:30.260
It's been a rough day.

21:30.260 --> 21:31.260
I see.

21:31.260 --> 21:35.480
So obviously your Discord chat was taunting you and in your despair.

21:35.480 --> 21:36.480
I see.

21:36.480 --> 21:37.480
Okay.

21:37.480 --> 21:38.480
All right.

21:38.480 --> 21:43.200
So one of the things we're reluctantly using, how has Copilot gone for you so far?

21:43.200 --> 21:45.240
I know you signed up for the GitHub Copilot.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.240
You're now a paying user.

21:46.240 --> 21:53.600
Yeah, that was, I got to stop doing stuff like that.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.520
It's really, I mean, it's great for system 76.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.520
And content, content.

21:58.520 --> 21:59.520
And content.

21:59.520 --> 22:03.560
But we need to raise our ad rates, all right.

22:03.560 --> 22:08.880
So Copilot, we're going to do this like a nice corporate performance review.

22:08.880 --> 22:09.880
Performance.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.320
Damn, things fast.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.320
I was surprised.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.120
Like it figures it out quick, you mean?

22:14.120 --> 22:15.120
Yeah.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.400
Well, well, it's fast.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.240
It's fast like a drunk driver's fast.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.920
Like it's pretty quick, but it ain't going anywhere good.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.720
That's a little, I mean, languages.

22:24.720 --> 22:25.720
So this is all right.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.640
I'm just going to do the bad stuff first.

22:27.640 --> 22:34.120
If you are writing relatively mainstream Python, Copilot is amazing.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.700
For Python, it's amazing.

22:35.700 --> 22:39.280
I'm struggling to understand what you just said, because it sounded like what you just

22:39.280 --> 22:45.020
said is if you're writing Python, Copilot works really well, which is just, that's hard

22:45.020 --> 22:46.520
for me to wrap my head around.

22:46.520 --> 22:51.280
And then I started thinking, is that because maybe all of the open source software they

22:51.280 --> 22:53.360
fed this thing was mostly Python?

22:53.360 --> 22:55.160
I think that's what it is, right.

22:55.160 --> 23:00.600
It's a, you know, when I say mainstream Python, I'm talking about like basic, you know, I'm

23:00.600 --> 23:05.400
parsing data, blah, blah, blah, rendering a webpage, doing some ginger stuff.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.000
That all works pretty good.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.360
Some of the suggestions are definitely questionable, but you know, if you are a junior dev and

23:12.360 --> 23:19.000
need a little handholding and you're writing, let's just say a Django app, I think it would

23:19.000 --> 23:21.880
be helpful or at least not harmful.

23:21.880 --> 23:25.880
It has some interesting ideas on HTML and CSS.

23:25.880 --> 23:32.240
Now, that's not my strongest suit, so I don't know if it's, I have a very old school way

23:32.240 --> 23:36.160
of doing things on the front end.

23:36.160 --> 23:40.440
I doubt that because I'm doing Angular TypeScript right now, which I know isn't the newest thing,

23:40.440 --> 23:43.860
but it's also not like, you know, straight up jQuery, right?

23:43.860 --> 23:51.800
It gets really convinced once you do something, like once you take one of its suggestions,

23:51.800 --> 23:55.440
it gets real sure you want that like 20 other times.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.040
It gets an attaboy and it really responds.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.920
Yeah, which can become annoying.

24:00.920 --> 24:06.160
I have some concerns that weren't really my concerns, but then I got hammered enough on

24:06.160 --> 24:16.480
the DMs and on the telegrams that I'm not sure that this isn't going to open up like

24:16.480 --> 24:22.440
potential just, you know, they used to say PHP was bad because like all the kids didn't

24:22.440 --> 24:25.760
know what they were doing, we're just writing PHP and copy off stack overflow.

24:25.760 --> 24:29.080
Well this is like without even having to hit control C, control V, right?

24:29.080 --> 24:30.080
This is pretty bad.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.520
Yeah, and it could be for everything.

24:31.520 --> 24:37.160
So if you're using fast API, it seems pretty confused, but that's because fast API is a

24:37.160 --> 24:42.180
Python framework that West turned me on to a while ago, is much newer, much less popular

24:42.180 --> 24:45.000
and frankly not that supported, right?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.320
Yeah, it probably wasn't in the data set as much.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.800
Right, where if you're using Django or Flask, it's like, okay, I get you.

24:50.800 --> 24:55.880
Or honestly, like if you're writing a Python command line app, that's your guy.

24:55.880 --> 25:00.500
He's there for you, like a good neighbor, copilots there.

25:00.500 --> 25:04.280
Like a drunk neighbor, copilots there.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.880
If he's grilling, he might give you food though.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.880
That's true.

25:07.880 --> 25:08.880
Yeah.

25:08.880 --> 25:09.880
That's kind of nice.

25:09.880 --> 25:10.880
I'm going to keep it up for the year though.

25:10.880 --> 25:11.880
I'm going to use it.

25:11.880 --> 25:17.840
I'm going to keep using it for non-client internal stuff because I don't want to get

25:17.840 --> 25:18.840
sued.

25:18.840 --> 25:24.280
So that's the way to kind of walk that line, is nothing you're going to ship to any client.

25:24.280 --> 25:29.120
Yeah, the Telegram freedom beard scared me enough that I was like, all right.

25:29.120 --> 25:34.320
Which I would say if you're a freedom beard on Telegram, did you forget about IRC or whatever?

25:34.320 --> 25:39.080
The argument they made that you'll get sued and your client will get sued for the GPL,

25:39.080 --> 25:40.160
I don't think so.

25:40.160 --> 25:45.600
That seems cray-cray, but I guess it's possible.

25:45.600 --> 25:52.400
My concern would be like copilot generates some crazy proprietary thing or more likely,

25:52.400 --> 25:57.600
my actual concern was copilot basically generates a bunch of security holes, right?

25:57.600 --> 26:02.080
Because it takes the most popular, which might be the most naive and crappy way to do things.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.080
All right.

26:03.080 --> 26:04.080
Interesting.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.680
Well, I'll be curious to circle back and see how it's going.

26:06.680 --> 26:07.680
Yeah.

26:07.680 --> 26:12.800
I'm going to try it with some either Minecraft mod development or some light game development

26:12.800 --> 26:15.240
because I'm doing that project with my kid I talked about last week.

26:15.240 --> 26:20.720
So that's, I want to see how it does on something that's not like web dev.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.960
I definitely get the feeling that like, this is one of those things, right, where it's

26:23.960 --> 26:27.800
like when you're on Twitter and you see the people tweeting about doing dev, you know

26:27.800 --> 26:34.040
half those dudes who are talking about hardcore hacking are like JavaScript developers.

26:34.040 --> 26:36.000
Tailscale.com slash coder.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.840
Go there to get a personal account for up to 20 devices for free.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.760
And of course, your support in the show.

26:41.760 --> 26:42.760
Tailscale is a game changer.

26:42.760 --> 26:48.360
It's a zero config VPN, installs on any device in minutes, manages your firewall rules, navigates

26:48.360 --> 26:51.040
your dub gnats, and it'll work from anywhere.

26:51.040 --> 26:56.320
And of course, devices connect directly in a mesh network using WireGuard's noise protocol.

26:56.320 --> 27:00.120
You build up, then you have static IPs for all your machines.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.840
It's so handy.

27:01.840 --> 27:07.600
Literally, last night, laying in bed, realizing I had screwed something up for the LUP show

27:07.600 --> 27:08.600
notes.

27:08.600 --> 27:13.360
I should just go to bed, but you know what, it was really important, and I was already

27:13.360 --> 27:14.360
home.

27:14.360 --> 27:17.560
And I knew thousands of people would be confused if I didn't go make this correction.

27:17.560 --> 27:23.000
So I pop on my laptop, by the time my Wi-Fi is connected, my tailscale connection's up.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
And I'm SSHed into a server, and I'm fixing things.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.320
Within minutes.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.120
It's such a peace of mind.

27:29.120 --> 27:33.740
It really was the missing piece for how I run my networks.

27:33.740 --> 27:37.920
And I've also been able to turn off all the inbound ports on my firewalls now.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.960
So my firewalls are like pristine, man.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.480
It's Fort Knox up in here because it's tailscale.

27:43.480 --> 27:44.480
It's so great.

27:44.480 --> 27:48.680
I got in everything from my Arch boxes, my Nix boxes, my Pi's, my iPad, I mean, you name

27:48.680 --> 27:49.680
it, man.

27:49.680 --> 27:51.000
I got tailscale on it.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.540
Every device is connected to a mesh network with static VPNs.

27:54.540 --> 27:56.240
It's so great.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.440
They're always on.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.640
So they're always available.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.640
And they're smart about how they route the traffic.

28:01.640 --> 28:05.360
Go try it yourself for free for up to 20 devices and support the show.

28:05.360 --> 28:09.200
It's tailscale.com slash coder.

28:09.200 --> 28:16.320
Okay, so we thought to stay in theme with the fact that it is Independence Day today.

28:16.320 --> 28:21.360
We should probably talk about why you and I originally went independent, independent

28:21.360 --> 28:24.400
agents so many years ago.

28:24.400 --> 28:28.120
And I thought maybe we should try to capture this before I completely forget it.

28:28.120 --> 28:33.120
Because once I suggested this idea, I really started struggling remembering the history

28:33.120 --> 28:38.080
of everything because I've gotten so far from it that I really can't remember life before

28:38.080 --> 28:39.080
this way now.

28:39.080 --> 28:43.520
So I'm probably properly broken for ever working in a company, I would imagine.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.000
Yeah, I would think so.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.060
Let's start with you.

28:46.060 --> 28:49.520
So what was it?

28:49.520 --> 28:51.880
Did you start on a career trajectory like I did?

28:51.880 --> 28:57.100
Like I went into the traditional nine to five world first and then did a course correction.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.100
Is that the case for you?

28:58.100 --> 29:00.800
Or did you always just go like, I'm not doing that.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.200
I'm doing my own thing.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.560
It was kind of the opposite for me, right?

29:03.560 --> 29:08.320
Because when I was in school, I did a lot of Java applet work, but that was effectively

29:08.320 --> 29:09.880
what we would call now freelancing.

29:09.880 --> 29:10.880
Yeah.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.840
But it was they just called it, you know, contracts, part time, whatever.

29:13.840 --> 29:17.780
Basically, they don't pay payroll tax because they're bricks.

29:17.780 --> 29:22.520
Then the iPhone came and I did a lot of web and iOS stuff for a long time.

29:22.520 --> 29:26.620
I got like when we talked about this a long time ago, but I was on a contract that was

29:26.620 --> 29:31.280
like a job, but then I was supposed to convert over.

29:31.280 --> 29:35.400
I think I may have actually converted over for like a month and then it was a startup.

29:35.400 --> 29:39.240
They had some severe financial issues and that did not last.

29:39.240 --> 29:43.440
So I was in this position where I literally left the place, went downstairs because it's

29:43.440 --> 29:44.440
New York.

29:44.440 --> 29:49.200
So there's like a bar in the basement and went to the pub and it was just like, okay,

29:49.200 --> 29:51.040
well, nothing has literally changed.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.040
I just lost a client.

29:52.040 --> 29:56.880
You know, we got to remember this is like the big, this is right before the App Store

29:56.880 --> 29:57.880
gold rush.

29:57.880 --> 30:02.160
And then the App Store gold rush happened and I never looked back really.

30:02.160 --> 30:05.280
Every once in a while I'll be like, ah, I'm getting older.

30:05.280 --> 30:10.920
You know, I'm not, you know, I'm doing very different things than I used to do now.

30:10.920 --> 30:14.160
But yeah, I don't see myself looking back.

30:14.160 --> 30:18.120
I definitely think if you're going to do it super young, like I think your way is probably

30:18.120 --> 30:21.340
the more traditional, safer way if you're going to do it the way I did.

30:21.340 --> 30:25.040
You want to be on the new hotness because otherwise you're going to get trounced by

30:25.040 --> 30:29.040
the contractors and freelancers who actually have, you know, experience.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.040
So yeah.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.040
Yeah.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.040
Yeah, definitely.

30:32.040 --> 30:40.080
I had a real interesting looking back at it path because I got initially my very first

30:40.080 --> 30:46.080
job was actually at a school district, which is surprisingly bureaucratic and complicated

30:46.080 --> 30:50.040
in, in how pay works and I was part of a union and all of that.

30:50.040 --> 30:57.320
And then I left and I went into a private bank, which was its own kind of bureaucrat

30:57.320 --> 31:03.680
sort of run organization and had, you know, 700, 800 ish employees.

31:03.680 --> 31:06.360
And maybe, maybe by the time I left a thousand, I don't know.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.520
And then I went and did small startup companies.

31:08.520 --> 31:13.360
I worked for a company called Dream Dinners, which was one of the very first meal order

31:13.360 --> 31:14.360
services.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.360
Oh, neat.

31:15.360 --> 31:19.080
Only because it was so early, you'd go to the website, which was all of course a PHP

31:19.080 --> 31:21.000
app, which I ran the backend for.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.840
You'd put your order in, but then you would go to one of the franchise locations and assemble

31:24.840 --> 31:28.280
the meals yourself and then like cart them home.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.880
Like they didn't deliver them.

31:29.880 --> 31:33.440
They hadn't figured like the two side, oh, you would go, wait, you the customer?

31:33.440 --> 31:34.440
Yeah.

31:34.440 --> 31:35.440
You would go, you would go.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.440
That's awesome.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.440
Yeah.

31:37.440 --> 31:42.260
So of course we had a bunch of franchise locations and then they brought in some quote unquote

31:42.260 --> 31:47.520
experts from Starbucks and an expert from Boeing and the company went into the toilet

31:47.520 --> 31:48.520
immediately.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:49.760 --> 31:55.640
Where is the convert on the Venn diagram of Starbucks executives and Boeing executives?

31:55.640 --> 31:58.500
I guess they both like to fuel things locally.

31:58.500 --> 32:03.720
They looked at as two icons of industry, of course, Seattle, right, right.

32:03.720 --> 32:08.360
And the, and the, the two gals, the two co-owners that ran dream dinners really idolized this

32:08.360 --> 32:09.680
other gal that worked at Starbucks.

32:09.680 --> 32:13.920
Of course, Starbucks had fired her, but so they picked her up.

32:13.920 --> 32:18.480
And then of course, Boeing laid this guy off and they picked him up and they just really

32:18.480 --> 32:22.060
just ran things differently and the whole thing fell apart.

32:22.060 --> 32:25.860
And it was about at that point where I had kind of walked the whole spectrum and of course

32:25.860 --> 32:26.860
I'm shortening.

32:26.860 --> 32:31.640
There's a lot of little other jobs in there of where I realized I can hate working for

32:31.640 --> 32:32.640
somebody else.

32:32.640 --> 32:33.640
It drives me crazy.

32:33.640 --> 32:36.200
I can't stand their pandemic, pandemic priorities.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.760
I can't, I can't understand most of their motivations.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.400
I lose motivation working for them.

32:42.400 --> 32:47.400
I typically, I typically just, it doesn't work out longterm.

32:47.400 --> 32:51.760
And I was looking at that math and thinking to myself, I'm like, you know, I could just

32:51.760 --> 32:54.000
take a handful of clients and I could just do this.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.960
I mean, really, it's not, it's not that big of a deal, which of course little did I know,

32:59.960 --> 33:05.560
doing independent IT contracting with a handful of selected clients, which was great money

33:05.560 --> 33:12.640
transformed into podcasting as I kept trying to refine the podcast and I kept trying to

33:12.640 --> 33:15.320
figure like, what could we do to make them sound better?

33:15.320 --> 33:17.440
What could I do to make the content better?

33:17.440 --> 33:21.080
What do I have to do in order to make the show good enough for somebody to want to spend

33:21.080 --> 33:22.860
their time listening?

33:22.860 --> 33:27.120
And everything kept coming to, well, I need to spend more time on the podcast and less

33:27.120 --> 33:29.460
time consulting.

33:29.460 --> 33:33.900
And so it just sort of consumed everything and I just sort of worked over time to make

33:33.900 --> 33:35.840
it possible to do this full time.

33:35.840 --> 33:42.560
And then about a decade into it, we decided, okay, let's try combining with a larger organization

33:42.560 --> 33:46.200
that has a similar goal set as ours, but has a much bigger budget.

33:46.200 --> 33:51.400
You know, like for me too, man, I was so burned out because I just didn't have anybody doing

33:51.400 --> 33:52.400
marketing.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.760
I didn't have anybody doing this or that, right?

33:53.760 --> 33:57.680
There's when you join a large organization, all of a sudden you get all these resources

33:57.680 --> 34:00.520
and I got health insurance right before I ended up in the hospital.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.520
So that was nice.

34:02.520 --> 34:07.960
And I learned at that point what it's like to be in a VC backed business, a couple of

34:07.960 --> 34:12.720
them because then they are acquired by a cloud guru, but I also learned a very valuable lesson

34:12.720 --> 34:19.160
that the kind of dedication that these podcasts require can't happen in an organization where

34:19.160 --> 34:21.500
the podcasts are not ultimately the end product.

34:21.500 --> 34:25.560
So if the end product is anything but the podcast, there's just no way the organization

34:25.560 --> 34:29.160
will be as focused and prioritized to serve the podcast as they need to be.

34:29.160 --> 34:30.160
That makes sense.

34:30.160 --> 34:34.080
And in order to make them competitive, they need that kind of dedication and focus.

34:34.080 --> 34:39.140
And so that's when I realized it wasn't going to work as part of a larger organization.

34:39.140 --> 34:43.160
That's when we began the process of making JB independent again.

34:43.160 --> 34:48.520
And now it's kind of like I'm in a middle ground where I kind of miss some of that stuff.

34:48.520 --> 34:53.860
I was caveching before the show started that for the last two days we've had tech issues.

34:53.860 --> 34:57.560
After years of great stability, we've started having some tech issues as the machines are

34:57.560 --> 34:59.240
getting older.

34:59.240 --> 35:03.240
And you know, I'm the guy that's in here to do something else and all of a sudden I realized

35:03.240 --> 35:07.600
the computer's broken and now I've gone back 15 years in time and now I'm doing tech support

35:07.600 --> 35:08.600
for myself.

35:08.600 --> 35:14.360
And that kind of stuff, you know, in the past we had like a full team of people so there'd

35:14.360 --> 35:17.120
be somebody in here that could do that and that's all right.

35:17.120 --> 35:21.860
It's not the same but ultimately I think the shows are better for it so the product's better

35:21.860 --> 35:22.860
for it.

35:22.860 --> 35:27.420
And our core team is, you know, you know the people that are around now.

35:27.420 --> 35:28.420
They're great.

35:28.420 --> 35:31.060
They're the best team we've ever had.

35:31.060 --> 35:32.960
So that all worked out.

35:32.960 --> 35:38.480
I'm kind of figuring out a health insurance thing and I'm in process of it right now which

35:38.480 --> 35:39.480
could be great.

35:39.480 --> 35:42.060
That'd be a nice relief because I haven't really had anything before so I'm getting

35:42.060 --> 35:44.480
close to having that all sorted out.

35:44.480 --> 35:50.360
It's been a long journey but I think ultimately it was about figuring out what works for me

35:50.360 --> 35:57.560
and how I can work best and also understanding that and maybe it's in part because I've been

35:57.560 --> 36:02.920
diagnosed with ADD but like I have to be working on something that matters to me and if I'm

36:02.920 --> 36:06.560
working on something that matters to me I can just work endlessly on it and if I'm working

36:06.560 --> 36:11.160
on something that doesn't matter to me not only do I have to like really stay on myself

36:11.160 --> 36:16.160
to like keep going and keep getting the job done but I screw stuff up.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.720
I just don't pay attention to the details.

36:18.720 --> 36:23.700
I miss things not intentionally but because I'm just not laser focused on it but when

36:23.700 --> 36:26.400
I'm laser focused on it I become hyper aware of attention.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.900
I have a hyper attention to detail.

36:28.900 --> 36:32.280
So it's just a big flip in realizing how I work too and then trying to build something

36:32.280 --> 36:33.280
around that.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.280
Who knows?

36:34.280 --> 36:36.760
The next couple of years are probably going to be pretty wild.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.320
Something else is probably going to change.

36:38.320 --> 36:45.320
Yeah what's funny is when I first started going indie my goal was to be a game dev company.

36:45.320 --> 36:50.680
I still every once in a while try to do it but my crusty old Coco's 2D Objective-C code

36:50.680 --> 36:53.280
just doesn't cut it today.

36:53.280 --> 36:56.120
Things have changed so much but maybe one day.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.120
One day.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.120
Time to get skilled up in metal.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.120
Metal!

36:59.120 --> 37:00.120
I'm sorry what?

37:00.120 --> 37:01.120
Yeah right.

37:01.120 --> 37:06.680
But what's funny too is I can sense that there is another shift coming and in part because

37:06.680 --> 37:10.160
I think there's so many macro economic shifts happening and I think budgets are going to

37:10.160 --> 37:13.760
get reallocated and I think everything's going to go through a repricing.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.760
Everything.

37:14.760 --> 37:15.760
Everything.

37:15.760 --> 37:19.920
And so I feel like that inevitably is going to have some sort of knock-on effect to what

37:19.920 --> 37:22.160
I do but it just is too early to tell.

37:22.160 --> 37:26.240
So it's sort of just like you just go into it knowing that there's kind of a storm down

37:26.240 --> 37:29.960
the road and you just kind of hope you're going to drive through it.

37:29.960 --> 37:34.280
Yeah this is going to be a hell of a year or two year period I think.

37:34.280 --> 37:35.280
Yeah or more.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.280
Yeah.

37:36.280 --> 37:37.280
Hmm.

37:37.280 --> 37:41.480
So it's tough to say but you know I guess part of it is you learn to shift.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.920
You learn to kind of tuck and roll I suppose because look at you right.

37:44.920 --> 37:48.880
Started you want to do game development ended up writing the App Store away for a while

37:48.880 --> 37:53.160
and now you're really you're probably writing more back-end applications and you know.

37:53.160 --> 37:57.780
Well yeah mostly back-end I would say yeah definitely mostly back-end but like this line

37:57.780 --> 38:00.320
of business applications almost all back-end right.

38:00.320 --> 38:04.160
Yeah it's not funny and it's it's each time it's a tuck and roll right.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.000
And sometimes it's just stuff out of your control.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.960
It's jumping out of a moving car.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.200
Yeah right.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.420
Very much so.

38:13.420 --> 38:19.120
System 76 dot com slash specials yep our friends at system 76 are back they have a fourth of

39:22.000 --> 39:23.760
It is the best keyboard I've ever used.

39:23.760 --> 39:28.120
So many great systems over at system 76 and they're born to run Linux and they're better

39:28.120 --> 39:29.120
than ever.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.440
So go take advantage of their 4th of July sale.

39:31.440 --> 39:35.760

39:35.760 --> 39:40.560
So to get the special to get that tool kit the sticker and the scroll go to system 76

39:40.560 --> 39:45.380
dot com slash specials and when you're checking out tell them the coder program sent you say

39:45.380 --> 39:48.960
hi from Mike and Chris would you say hi to our friends over there.

39:48.960 --> 39:54.840
System 76 dot com slash specials.

39:54.840 --> 40:01.960
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you but what you can boost for your podcast.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.840
All right so logic came in with 500 sats four days ago.

40:04.840 --> 40:10.200
He says let's get some resources posted over on matrix need to get more people in matrix.

40:10.200 --> 40:14.700
I owe Mike an account although I have accounts disabled so I have to figure out if I have

40:14.700 --> 40:19.360
to turn accounts on and then create you an account or if I can create them but have them

40:19.360 --> 40:21.280
disabled for the public.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.760
And of course there's no like UI to manage any of this.

40:23.760 --> 40:26.560
I mean there's some projects out there but it runs on Linux.

40:26.560 --> 40:27.720
What do you buy.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.360
But the matrix room is beginning to organize.

40:30.360 --> 40:32.780
I think they're going to come looking for it soon.

40:32.780 --> 40:41.080
So just FYI on that you better watch out Oh a guy one boosted in 120 sats look I'm giving

40:41.080 --> 40:44.620
you the last sats I earned from promoted clips and shows on fountain.

40:44.620 --> 40:47.160
This is a new thing they're doing now where they're giving away sats to help people boost

40:47.160 --> 40:50.680
when you listen to promoted clips actually says he likes it a lot.

40:50.680 --> 40:55.440
It feels like marbles when I was a kid.

40:55.440 --> 40:56.440
That's pretty great.

40:56.440 --> 40:57.440
That's pretty good.

40:57.440 --> 40:58.760
Keep up the incredible work.

40:58.760 --> 41:02.720
Maybe I will get enough sats to send a tribute to my much loved 6502 processor.

41:02.720 --> 41:09.360
The classic the classic says you might become a member to user and boosted in 225 sats four

41:09.360 --> 41:10.360
days ago.

41:10.360 --> 41:15.400
But Vim guys it's still a solid choice today especially with Neo Vim.

41:15.400 --> 41:19.940
No surprise it's listed as one of the most loved ideas in the stack flow in the stack

41:19.940 --> 41:22.360
overflow developer survey speaking of.

41:22.360 --> 41:23.880
Have you thought about reviewing that survey.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.080
This year we didn't do it.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.080
We didn't do it.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.080
We've done it.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.080
We've done it almost every other year.

41:28.080 --> 41:31.460
You know that survey kind of I'm getting done with it getting done with it because it's

41:31.460 --> 41:32.460
always like JavaScript.

41:32.460 --> 41:33.880
It's like always number one.

41:33.880 --> 41:34.880
Yeah.

41:34.880 --> 41:38.160
Unless he means the ideas and they're always kind of the same to ran.

41:38.160 --> 41:39.980
What's it going to be.

41:39.980 --> 41:43.320
People who are lying and saying they're using like Emacs and Vim who are really mostly using

41:43.320 --> 41:48.680
VSCode you know people actually using Emacs and Vim and a bunch of folks using JetBrains

41:48.680 --> 41:50.960
and Visual Studio right.

41:50.960 --> 41:56.000
So I don't know it's it's I don't know did we ever actually talk about it but the reason

41:56.000 --> 42:00.760
I didn't even like put it in the show notes maybe we did talk about it was it it's just

42:00.760 --> 42:04.360
kind of the same for the last several years right.

42:04.360 --> 42:08.600
The last shakeup was really the app store stuff when Objective C shot up the thing and

42:08.600 --> 42:11.000
then Swift came and there was a bit of a jumble.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.320
Yeah otherwise it's kind of just been more of the same Linux doing great.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.320
That's all I care about.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.320
Yeah.

42:15.320 --> 42:16.320
Linux is fine.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.320
It's gaining share.

42:17.320 --> 42:18.320
Yeah.

42:18.320 --> 42:19.320
Yep.

42:19.320 --> 42:23.520
Dave Jones boosted in four days ago with two thousand one hundred and twelve sats.

42:23.520 --> 42:27.120
He says yeah he's all on board with the rope coin could call it RBC.

42:27.120 --> 42:31.160
You know we could get a you know a crap coin out there that we pump and dump with robes

42:31.160 --> 42:37.120
and then if you have like a thousand of them then you could turn them in for a robe or

42:37.120 --> 42:38.120
something like that.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.120
We'll have to figure it out.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.120
We'll have to because definitely.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.120
I love it.

42:41.120 --> 42:44.560
There's there's there's a real like tokenomics to a good scam we'll definitely have to figure

42:44.560 --> 42:45.560
it out.

42:45.560 --> 42:48.800
Don't don't want to miss out on that club three thousand boosted in two hundred twenty

42:48.800 --> 42:49.800
five sats.

42:49.800 --> 42:54.080
Chris you had a good opportunity to tell Mike some of the privacy technologies like coin

42:54.080 --> 42:56.160
join and lightning.

42:56.160 --> 42:59.840
The transactions are visible but it's difficult to trace the addresses to their owners if

42:59.840 --> 43:03.280
they're regularly doing coin joins and spreading them with lightning.

43:03.280 --> 43:07.920
Also with 50 percent of Bitcoin and lightning nodes behind Tor and in different countries

43:07.920 --> 43:10.600
it's going to be difficult for anyone to stop the Bitcoin network.

43:10.600 --> 43:13.640
You see you say something bad about the Bitcoin and somebody is going to come at you.

43:13.640 --> 43:17.400
I didn't you know I you know pleb I don't really tend to argue on this stuff because

43:17.400 --> 43:20.240
I feel like history will will tell us what happens.

43:20.240 --> 43:21.760
Time will tell.

43:21.760 --> 43:27.600
You know the coins I want to be careful the coins are still looking for their killer app

43:27.600 --> 43:28.600
right.

43:28.600 --> 43:30.200
I didn't say block chain.

43:30.200 --> 43:34.080
You know I think block chain is going to be a thing that lots of banks and financial institutions

43:34.080 --> 43:39.280
use but I'm not sure that we're going to see like the I keep going back to it but like

43:39.280 --> 43:45.040
the indie rent you know the indie opportunities there because I think block chain it's slow

43:45.040 --> 43:51.320
it's resource intensive and it has certain attack vectors if it's not of a certain size

43:51.320 --> 43:56.920
of a network and I don't think there's a lot of compelling use cases for block chain outside

43:56.920 --> 43:57.920
of Bitcoin.

43:57.920 --> 44:02.460
I think it's pretty much the one and the only real value and use case I see there long term

44:02.460 --> 44:06.960
is a hard money that is all accountable you know we're all twenty one million of them

44:06.960 --> 44:13.120
are and they are all unique and scarce and it's a store of value because of that.

44:13.120 --> 44:17.360
People love that scarcity thing outside of that like the NFT marketplace is completely

44:17.360 --> 44:18.800
crashed right.

44:18.800 --> 44:22.680
All this stuff just seems like it's totally in the tank and I think we're really seeing

44:22.680 --> 44:24.720
a dot com kind of clean out.

44:24.720 --> 44:25.720
That's what I was going to say.

44:25.720 --> 44:29.400
Yeah you'll see some projects survive but I think for the most part a lot of this stuff

44:29.400 --> 44:31.560
is going to get washed away.

44:31.560 --> 44:34.640
This is I mean it's going to be a couple of years we're going to go through the cycle

44:34.640 --> 44:35.640
again right.

44:35.640 --> 44:40.760
I mean you could even see the VCs are pulling back and I read something just wonderful in

44:40.760 --> 44:43.600
the New York Times this morning.

44:43.600 --> 44:49.280
Apparently Uber didn't realize they weren't making money because they're in a panic it

44:49.280 --> 44:54.920
seems over according to this op-ed because oh we make no money and there's not like drunk

44:54.920 --> 44:56.560
VC money anymore.

44:56.560 --> 45:01.960
So what are we going to do and the answer is this is like my revenge from 2012 right

45:01.960 --> 45:07.440
like the point of a business is to like that number in Excel needs to be black not red.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.360
They're going to have to clean house.

45:09.360 --> 45:12.280
Yeah we're going to see like the fall of the stupid business models.

45:12.280 --> 45:15.240
Now Uber is a bad example Uber is not going to fall right they have too much money too

45:15.240 --> 45:20.020
much momentum but I think it's healthy to be honest I think it's a healthy purge.

45:20.020 --> 45:24.400
It probably is it probably is and I think my prediction since I love to make them in

45:24.400 --> 45:30.460
the show apparently is that in a couple of years after some regulation has settled it'll

45:30.460 --> 45:35.640
go it'll shake out like this you're going to have Bitcoin and maybe a couple of other

45:35.640 --> 45:41.780
cryptos and those will be called digital assets and then all the junk is going to be crypto

45:41.780 --> 45:45.640
and that's going to be the stuff that's just sort of like in this early stage that isn't

45:45.640 --> 45:50.800
properly regulated and isn't ever going to be of any serious value and the stuff that

45:50.800 --> 45:55.720
we take serious the culture will just shift to calling them digital assets they're digital

45:55.720 --> 45:56.720
assets.

45:56.720 --> 46:02.080
You could see like MTG arena like going to a crypto model right and then allowing like

46:02.080 --> 46:06.480
easier car trading and stuff like that but I love it but me makes a lot of sense to me

46:06.480 --> 46:10.960
but yeah I will promise they can solve all that problem without going to crypto sorry

46:10.960 --> 46:14.320
but yeah that's just it right there's there's good I think that's there's going to have

46:14.320 --> 46:20.760
to be a process of I guess people trying it and failing and then realize you know we could

46:20.760 --> 46:27.680
just use a database and what the problem is in what case is the SQL query more resource

46:27.680 --> 46:31.320
intensive and slower than putting this on the blockchain if I'm like literally doing

46:31.320 --> 46:35.840
card trading or something like that and the answer is almost done or I can't think of

46:35.840 --> 46:36.840
one so.

46:36.840 --> 46:40.880
All right the golden dragon boosted in two days ago with a row of ducks two thousand

46:40.880 --> 46:46.240
two hundred and twenty two sets I'm a duck D.U.K. duck loaded with talent because I'm

46:46.240 --> 46:52.000
wary of anything that can use licensing against its users like Copilot it seems super bad

46:52.000 --> 46:56.840
that an A.I. can just grift code from users to sell time to move to another get instance

46:56.840 --> 47:03.280
perhaps no no I mean OK so that this is one one of my great pains in life is that I'm

47:03.280 --> 47:08.040
not using GitHub because I have to do a bunch of manual crap that I wouldn't have to if

47:08.040 --> 47:12.920
I was just fully on GitHub I keep trying it I keep coming back but I think during this

47:12.920 --> 47:16.920
what I consider I think we'll be calling it like a winter for tech did we give it a name

47:16.920 --> 47:22.640
or boy it sure feels like it is it's going to yeah heck winter I'm looking to cut cost

47:22.640 --> 47:26.440
and I know they're not a sponsor anymore but D.O. you got a low those drop prices are killing

47:26.440 --> 47:35.640
me especially the backups you know you know this whole Copilot thing I was on hacker news

47:35.640 --> 47:42.140
and they have this GitHub Copilot search it's both a copilot both impressive but not nearly

47:42.140 --> 47:46.840
as impressive it's like a Roomba right it sure it's like that was super cool but like

47:46.840 --> 47:51.780
I don't know man I have cats and dogs and like the Roomba can't do the job by itself

47:51.780 --> 47:56.760
it just can't that's Copilot and and actually I would say the Roomba is far more impressive

47:56.760 --> 48:02.120
and far more confident than Copilot it's like this hand wringing this pearl clutching it's

48:02.120 --> 48:07.460
just quite using it first before you say it's the end of open source and it's going to dominate

48:07.460 --> 48:12.640
the world and Microsoft's going to all murder away it's just not going to happen I mean

48:12.640 --> 48:18.520
it it's it's really like clippy dude it's clippy forget it's clippy for code that's

48:18.520 --> 48:24.120
what it is as a man who keeps rewriting clippy and calling it Alice over and over again it's

48:24.120 --> 48:30.240
clippy all right the golden dragon double boosted in with a nice message for you another

48:30.240 --> 48:37.200
row of ducks double boost because you both are super awesome and this is becoming a

48:37.200 --> 48:42.760
favorite weekly podcast amongst the few I listen to thanks golden dragon becoming well

48:42.760 --> 48:47.840
you know he actually emailed in too because he you told him last week to DM you for some

48:47.840 --> 48:52.840
Python but did I did I did yes but then he doesn't use Twitter you know they're they're

48:52.840 --> 48:56.000
out there he did email I got him we got hooked up I got to respond to him again actually

48:56.000 --> 49:04.240
look at you guys look at you guys Lima three boosted in with 4,720 sats three days ago

49:04.240 --> 49:08.120
is why has it taken me so long to start listening to this podcast I listen to a number of other

49:08.120 --> 49:13.300
JB shows which I love I'm a sys admin by trade but a coder by education maybe you could

49:13.300 --> 49:17.280
throw a short segment into office hours to do a quick run through all the JB shows to

49:17.280 --> 49:23.320
help spread the word and so you don't have to guess oh for the numbers 4,720 is because

49:23.320 --> 49:28.680
4472 was my first episode based on the episode number keep it up that's clever you know we've

49:28.680 --> 49:32.320
been doing the show for a while and so I think as a result it just doesn't come up much on

49:32.320 --> 49:36.720
the other shows but we should try to mention him or I'm I really walk that line of try

49:36.720 --> 49:41.680
not to do too many self plugs but also making sure people know it's out there I mean like

49:41.680 --> 49:44.760
once a year you have me come on the Linux shows and I just troll people although now

49:44.760 --> 49:55.680
I can't I'm one of these damn hippies now kpok kpok ppok is this dude wait can I help

49:55.680 --> 50:02.800
kpok if you need help if you need help with the right of ascension against your evil Klingon

50:02.800 --> 50:08.400
brothers I am here for you I will shave my head Picard style it totally does sound like

50:08.400 --> 50:13.820
a Klingon name that's so great yeah so 473 sats three days ago he said this is a future

50:13.820 --> 50:18.880
episode number club booze I'm donating sats to the next episode number thanks for the

50:18.880 --> 50:24.840
weekly dose of code and related entertainment keep up the good work boys well thank you

50:24.840 --> 50:29.080
that's a great that's a great idea we also we got a big old like across a couple of

50:29.080 --> 50:35.520
boosts thank you boost from wine deer 20,100 sats damn dude yeah you know what he gets

50:35.520 --> 50:43.680
I think he deserves the baller boost for that he's the baller of this episode he's our back

50:43.680 --> 50:49.100
home baller he's our baller in these parts it's an SNL reference we also got a thousand

50:49.100 --> 50:54.160
sats from LT guy five thanks everybody oh I remember that that's Tina Fey yeah it was

50:54.160 --> 50:58.320
a it's a good the girl the girls are back from college right and they're like yeah and

50:58.320 --> 51:03.000
their moms are spoiling them and stuff on this out of them it's it's a great skit it's

51:03.000 --> 51:07.360
actually a pretty good video it's surprisingly good so there you go thank you everybody for

51:07.360 --> 51:10.840
boosting in if you'd like to send us a boost you can get a new podcast app at new podcast

51:10.840 --> 51:14.920
apps calm I've been using fountain FM and you do earn some sats in there with some of

51:14.920 --> 51:18.380
those supported clips so I'll have a link in the show notes if you want to try that

51:18.380 --> 51:24.880
out and there's also boost CLI and breeze both of which don't require switching podcast

51:24.880 --> 51:30.560
apps who CLI is obviously a command-line client and breeze is a separate app that you get

51:30.560 --> 51:36.260
at be our easy dot technology and you know we should think soon about maybe later this

51:36.260 --> 51:40.860
week recording a special for our members because our coder QA crew is out there and it is time

51:40.860 --> 51:45.040
for their coder Lee report it is it is time we should do it this week yeah maybe Thursday

51:45.040 --> 51:48.360
for I'll chat with you after we we wrap up here but that's a great way to support the

51:48.360 --> 51:52.800
show and you get an ad-free version of the show you get the coder Lee report little extra

51:52.800 --> 51:59.600
bonus show and soon you'll have a second feed option for the live stream coder QA dot co

51:59.600 --> 52:04.040
oh no I know watch out right mr. Dominic is there anywhere you want to send the people

52:04.040 --> 52:09.760
ah you know what go to Dominic m.com I I might actually manage another blog post this week

52:09.760 --> 52:14.960
because I've been putting torturing I mean I would say testing but uh I've been told

52:14.960 --> 52:21.640
that uh apparently they didn't expect me to have a prohibition style party inappropriate

52:21.640 --> 52:28.280
juggling at HP dev ones and now I see that uh Carl has new laptops for me to use his

52:28.280 --> 52:34.920
coasters so I'm just very busy definitely definitely I I've also requested a purple

52:34.920 --> 52:39.520
themed Thalia that doesn't seem to be in the offing so you know there is a very very special

52:39.520 --> 52:44.280
edition Thalia I've heard I've seen it yeah there I wonder if they'll ever sell it because

52:44.280 --> 52:51.600
you know I need a new OBS machine and wouldn't that be cool let me spend thousands of dollars

52:51.600 --> 52:56.120
no way right no way that's why this I'm that's why this iMac Pro is still hitting here sitting

52:56.120 --> 53:00.560
here it's literally for OBS cuz I keep going with doing that video thing we talk about

53:00.560 --> 53:07.120
every few months and one I can't sell this damn computer for some reason no one wants

53:07.120 --> 53:14.720
to buy an iMac it has an Intel but it's also like kind of the ideal production machine

53:14.720 --> 53:21.040
for the level of like you know just twitch production I would be doing so yeah yeah it's

53:21.040 --> 53:27.040
good enough it really is it's fine but then it's Mac and I'd really like to do it on Linux

53:27.040 --> 53:31.200
but then I'm like do I want to spend tons of money on another Thalia or something and

53:31.200 --> 53:35.360
the answer is no this is where I'm at right now this is where I'm at I got to figure all

53:35.360 --> 53:40.760
this out because my OBS machine now that we're doing video streaming into Jupiter tube it's

53:40.760 --> 53:47.460
barely hanging on yeah sure barely so you know we built it to do audio streaming right

53:47.460 --> 53:52.280
so yep well once you add video everything just and I want to do video of like my so

53:52.280 --> 53:56.300
I want to go like full like I'm learning from the 14 year old that like apparently they

53:56.300 --> 54:00.600
have to see your face and a little square on the bottom of the screen oh yeah yeah and

54:00.600 --> 54:05.240
you have to screen cap and you have to make sure you turn off notifications oh yeah because

54:05.240 --> 54:13.480
that IMS should get in a lot of trouble yeah oh we know we do all right how is Leo Laporte

54:13.480 --> 54:16.640
these days you know I think they're doing great over there I think they're doing just

54:16.640 --> 54:22.760
fine I love Leo actually all right you can follow the show at Coder Radio show like you

54:22.760 --> 54:26.280
can watch the video playback Jupiter tube if you want to do that and links to what we

54:26.280 --> 54:31.360
talked about today thems are over at Coder dot show slash four seven three you'll find

54:31.360 --> 54:35.160
our contact form over there send us in some emails if I've missed your email you probably

54:35.160 --> 54:41.000
need to send in again there's that but we'd also love to have a good full mailbag a real

54:41.000 --> 54:46.600
thick mailbag next week so go over to Coder dot show slash contact or send in a boost

54:46.600 --> 54:51.120
with a new podcast app those are also a great part of the show and that's it oh I guess

54:51.120 --> 54:58.880
I'll live we do the show live on Mondays at noon Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern so you can come

54:58.880 --> 55:03.280
over and join us at JB live TV we also stream it over at Jupiter dot tube and then we got

55:03.280 --> 55:07.800
the chat room going up there on the screens and you can interact with us in real time

55:07.800 --> 55:11.680
and give us feedback right then there in the chat room suppose that's probably like that's

55:11.680 --> 55:17.600
peak connectivity radio should have figured that one out so Monday noon Pacific 3 p.m.

55:17.600 --> 55:21.200
Eastern for that if you'd like or just get the RSS feed and you get it Wednesdays when
