00:00.000 --> 00:15.800
This is Coder Radio, episode 402 for February 22nd, 2021.

00:15.800 --> 00:20.100
Hello friends and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.100 --> 00:25.080
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.080 --> 00:32.560
Now running for nearly 402 years, my name is Chris and joining us every single week

00:32.560 --> 00:39.160
perched in the perfect podcast position, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.160
Hello Mike.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.160
Hello, sir.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.160
When the Jar Jar does it, it's legal.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.560
Oh, I get a shiver down my spine.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.560
It's legal?

00:45.560 --> 00:46.560
That wasn't my best Jar Jar voice.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.560
I'm going to take that again.

00:47.560 --> 00:48.560
Missa back bitch.

00:48.560 --> 00:49.560
Oh, well.

00:49.560 --> 00:50.560
Right off the top.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.560
Here we go.

00:51.560 --> 01:02.960
One of those episodes right off the top, send your angry emails to WestPain at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.680
I thought we were starting those to Alan still.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.880
You know, Alan doesn't take the bait.

01:06.880 --> 01:10.060
Alan's like, yeah, whatever, Mike, just yeah, that's true.

01:10.060 --> 01:12.360
You know, as you know, he still wants to make everybody happy.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.360
I know.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.360
Wes is always helping.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.360
We love Wes.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.360
Wes is great.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.360
He's helping right now.

01:17.360 --> 01:18.360
He's helping right now.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.280
As we, as we fixed your, cause you had, okay.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.600
Surprise topic, Chris.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.600
Okay.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.600
Why are you moving my cheese again and changing our recording technology?

01:26.600 --> 01:29.800
Listen, you know, I'm going to be real gentle with you, darling.

01:29.800 --> 01:33.360
You know, I appreciate that you're sensitive to this kind of stuff.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.920
I hate this kind of stuff.

01:34.920 --> 01:35.920
You know, I know.

01:35.920 --> 01:36.920
You know how I get.

01:36.920 --> 01:37.920
I know.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.920
That's why I understand.

01:38.920 --> 01:39.920
That's why we're testing it real good.

01:39.920 --> 01:40.920
I promise.

01:40.920 --> 01:41.920
Wes was right.

01:41.920 --> 01:42.920
But you know how Wes gets.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.720
He finds real good stuff sometimes.

01:44.720 --> 01:45.840
Get out of here.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.120
Why can't we just run like Skype?

01:48.120 --> 01:50.720
Isn't that what we started with, with Skype?

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
I think so.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.760
I think it was Skype.

01:53.760 --> 01:54.760
That was awful.

01:54.760 --> 01:55.760
That was bad.

01:55.760 --> 01:56.760
I know.

01:56.760 --> 01:57.760
I know.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.720
You know, every now and then there's new tools that come along.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.840
Tools that are not trapped in a web browser.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.720
Tools that are dedicated apps on the desktop that solve problems.

02:05.720 --> 02:06.720
Wait a minute.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.720
Wait a minute.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.720
Desktop apps?

02:08.720 --> 02:09.720
Yeah.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.720
Can we run on Linux?

02:10.720 --> 02:11.720
Yes.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.720
Of course.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.720
Mac?

02:13.720 --> 02:14.720
Yep.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.720
Windows?

02:15.720 --> 02:16.720
Yep.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.720
Even iOS and Android.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.720
Mm-hmm.

02:18.720 --> 02:19.720
What about FreeBSD?

02:19.720 --> 02:20.720
FreeBSD.

02:20.720 --> 02:21.720
FreeBSD.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.720
Of course.

02:22.720 --> 02:23.720
I thought you were running Windows 10.

02:23.720 --> 02:25.200
How is that journey going still?

02:25.200 --> 02:27.000
Are you still in the Windows 10 land?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.160
I've been doing a lot of.NET development and yeah.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.160
Yeah?

02:31.160 --> 02:33.200
You just want to jump right into this?

02:33.200 --> 02:34.200
You want to do this?

02:34.200 --> 02:36.800
I think if I ask you for a few weeks straight, eventually we're going to get to the point

02:36.800 --> 02:38.360
where Windows is really starting to grade on you.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.160
And I don't know if it's this week or if it's next.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.320
I'll put it this way.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.360
Visual Studio is a dream come true.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.360
Yeah.

02:45.360 --> 02:49.280
And if the entire operating system were like Visual Studio.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.280
Yeah.

02:50.280 --> 02:51.280
Right.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.280
It would be great.

02:52.280 --> 02:53.280
Alas, it's not.

02:53.280 --> 02:59.720
See, what I want is Mac OS without the creepy, you know, I'm going to tell you what you can

02:59.720 --> 03:04.360
and can't run on your computer stuff with Visual Studio.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.800
And please don't send me Visual Studio for Mac.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.880
That's just rebranded mono developer Xamarin Studio.

03:09.880 --> 03:10.880
No.

03:10.880 --> 03:11.880
We've been there.

03:11.880 --> 03:12.880
We've done that.

03:12.880 --> 03:13.880
But like Windows 10, it's...

03:13.880 --> 03:14.880
Okay.

03:14.880 --> 03:15.880
You do this to yourself.

03:15.880 --> 03:16.880
All right.

03:16.880 --> 03:23.040
32 gigs of RAM does not go nearly as far on Windows 10 as it does on POP or Mac OS.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.040
I completely agree.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.320
And I'm not even like saying the Apple Silicon magic.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.320
No, I'm not trolling.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.320
Right.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.260
It just doesn't get you the same distance.

03:30.260 --> 03:33.620
Like when people have Windows boxes with 32 gigs of RAM, I understand why.

03:33.620 --> 03:39.640
So I bought this Lenovo ThinkPad, a Yoga X360, I bought it on a President's Day sale.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.080
And it's a lovely piece of hardware.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.080
I love it.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.080
It's great.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.680
I finally get the ThinkPad love.

03:44.680 --> 03:45.680
You all were right.

03:45.680 --> 03:50.080
But I did not know that I needed more memory.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.680
And I really need more memory.

03:51.680 --> 03:52.680
Yeah.

03:52.680 --> 03:53.760
It's slow.

03:53.760 --> 03:58.440
Like my typing seems laggy in Visual Studio.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.700
Yikes.

03:59.700 --> 04:05.040
It says I'm only consuming like 60% of the RAM, but somehow things just sort of like

04:05.040 --> 04:06.040
the start menu.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.520
I hit the Windows key and it's delayed.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.760
I don't get it.

04:09.760 --> 04:14.120
Like Mac OS is fine and does not have these problems.

04:14.120 --> 04:19.680
Well, isn't this kind of the problem with the Windows OEM model is that there's no one

04:19.680 --> 04:24.120
that says this is the minimum bar that these applications.

04:24.120 --> 04:27.280
I'm just going to play devil's advocate because I don't think I actually believe this.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.780
But let's get in the headspace of Apple for a minute.

04:29.780 --> 04:34.300
They have a pro user work group that validates these different machines can run different

04:34.300 --> 04:38.560
workloads and they won't ship a MacBook Pro that can't do a certain kind of workload.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.420
I'm not trying to defend Apple here.

04:40.420 --> 04:42.520
This just seems to be my observation from the outside.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.560
I think you could probably say the same kind of thing for system 76.

04:46.560 --> 04:50.560
They're going to sell a laptop at a certain category of user and they won't sell a laptop

04:50.560 --> 04:54.680
that can't meet the certain requirements that they have with and they're looking at it from

04:54.680 --> 04:58.020
an application level, an OS level and a hardware level.

04:58.020 --> 05:05.480
But Lenovo, not so much because somebody else who buys that yoga that has 16 gigs of RAM

05:05.480 --> 05:11.160
and say they're only running Edge and Outlook, it's going to be completely sufficient.

05:11.160 --> 05:15.740
So Lenovo doesn't really have like this kind of baseline that they're going to guarantee

05:15.740 --> 05:16.780
is going to work well.

05:16.780 --> 05:22.320
They're just kind of targeting a real rough demographic, I feel like I don't know.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.320
This is not a cheap machine.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.320
True.

05:24.320 --> 05:30.080
I mean, granted, it's last year's model and granted I got it on sale, but it's I don't

05:30.080 --> 05:31.080
know.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.080
I mean, I have my lemur.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.080
Is it a lemur?

05:33.080 --> 05:34.080
Is it a darter?

05:34.080 --> 05:35.120
I always messed it up.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.040
You mean lemur.

05:37.040 --> 05:41.320
Lemur from Carle de Shell at System76.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.320
Rochelle.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.320
Rochelle from Paris.

05:43.320 --> 05:44.320
Sorry, Carle.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.320
So sorry.

05:45.320 --> 05:54.000
And it's like, granted, the battery life, not great, but it's fast and I don't feel

05:54.000 --> 05:56.640
like PyCharm is lagging behind.

05:56.640 --> 06:03.040
The Mac is literally the platonic ideal of perfection because of Apple Silicon.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.800
I have nowhere to go from that statement.

06:05.800 --> 06:06.800
It's bold.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.040
It seems like 16 gigs of RAM should be enough to me.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.680
Well, my diagnosis is then that the paper cuts are beginning to set in already.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.720
Well, it's just annoying.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.680
But like Visual Studio is a masterpiece.

06:17.680 --> 06:23.440
Now devil's advocate, maybe the things I like about Visual Studio are just so heavy and

06:23.440 --> 06:28.400
so memory intensive that that's actually what's causing me issues.

06:28.400 --> 06:32.840
Anybody who's trying to run a workload like that is going to have performance issues.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.440
Like if you were trying to do Premiere right now, you'd be having you'd be having the same

06:35.440 --> 06:36.440
problems, my friend.

06:36.440 --> 06:40.000
Not with my Xeons, baby.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.760
So having said that, I solve all problems being the Democrat that I am, which is ironic

06:45.760 --> 06:48.000
because we don't talk about that anymore.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.320
I bought a very or a somewhat expensive Lenovo monitor.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.320
Oh, really?

06:53.320 --> 06:56.480
It has a built in camera and mic, huh?

06:56.480 --> 07:02.560
Because I am going to hook up the Thaleo again as my daily driver.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.560
Good call.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.320
I saw pictures on your Twitter of the Thaleo opener.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.360
Are you swapping out components again?

07:09.360 --> 07:13.200
Los Siento, Carl Los Siento.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.440
I may be modifying the fan to make it quiet.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.840
You have one of the early models, and I think that's an area that I have.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.400
I have one of the first models that has the it's a little loud.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.720
I mean, we did the decibel test with a year and a half and I was like, Mike, you can't

07:25.720 --> 07:26.720
use that to podcast.

07:26.720 --> 07:31.080
You're like, Mike, go get your Mac and shut up and just pretend like you're running Linux

07:31.080 --> 07:32.560
because we need the clicks.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
It's no good.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
It's no good.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.480
Like right now, I'm an iMac Pro and you know what you're not hearing?

07:37.480 --> 07:40.200
The iMac Pro because it I'm not even sure it has fans.

07:40.200 --> 07:44.280
I mean, I know it does, but yeah, I think they've come on twice.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.800
Having said that, you should totally buy a Thaleo.

07:45.800 --> 07:50.880
The new ones do not do what mine does because they I guess they fixed it.

07:50.880 --> 07:55.720
I am elated to hear that you're coming over to the workstation master race.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.280
I think it is the superior performance choice.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.760
I would watch the term master race these days.

08:00.760 --> 08:04.040
I'm just just saying, yeah, but I'm labeling you, not me.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.040
So fine.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.160
Oh, so I'm the Nazi.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.160
Great.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.180
I am blonde hair and blue eyes.

08:09.180 --> 08:10.180
Let's just keep going.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.760
I need that as a soundboard clip.

08:11.760 --> 08:12.760
Just pointing that out.

08:12.760 --> 08:17.120
Anyways, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

08:17.120 --> 08:19.440
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

08:19.440 --> 08:20.440
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

08:20.440 --> 08:21.440
All right, fair enough.

08:21.440 --> 08:27.220
I actually I was on Newegg and for a for a lull I was looking at the price of video cards.

08:27.220 --> 08:35.400
I don't know if you've gone down this rabbit hole, but it's comical, it's comical like a modern video card.

08:35.400 --> 08:40.180
If it's in stock, a great deal would be seven hundred dollars right now.

08:40.180 --> 08:41.800
It's ridiculous.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.040
It's so bad that Nvidia is coming up with this cockamamie scheme where they're going

08:45.040 --> 08:50.200
to have mining only cards and then they're going to artificially limit the gaming cards

08:50.200 --> 08:54.160
so that when they do mining workloads, they're cut in half via the driver.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.160
Wait, this is real.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.160
Yeah.

08:56.160 --> 09:00.880
This is such a like using the software driver to limit the hardware.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.640
It really pushes my buttons.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.680
AMD is having trouble making theirs.

09:04.680 --> 09:07.720
There's a global chip shortage that's impacting everybody.

09:07.720 --> 09:12.400
So I was looking at it and I thought this is just not the time to try to upgrade my

09:12.400 --> 09:13.400
workstation.

09:13.400 --> 09:17.560
But, you know, that'll be my next thing by the end of the year is I'm going to try to

09:17.560 --> 09:20.820
refresh my desktop workstation into something that's pretty powerful and I'm going to start

09:20.820 --> 09:23.440
with a high refresh rate monitor and work my way out from there.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.920
I decided I guess I don't get it.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.880
Why are they discouraging people from buying their cards?

09:28.880 --> 09:33.440
They are having a hard time making enough to meet demand.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.620
Gamers aren't getting access to these cards.

09:35.620 --> 09:38.620
That has a knock on stagnation effect for the rest of the gaming industry.

09:38.620 --> 09:45.160
But also, it means that neither customer is satisfied, neither the miner who wants to

09:45.160 --> 09:49.140
mine some cryptocurrency, nor the gamer is satisfied.

09:49.140 --> 09:53.080
And you have a bunch of miners who when they can are buying up a whole bunch of these cards.

09:53.080 --> 09:55.120
Yeah, but their money's good, too, right?

09:55.120 --> 09:56.120
I know.

09:56.120 --> 10:00.320
And here's the worst part, Mike, is these mining only cards can't be used for gaming

10:00.320 --> 10:01.440
later on.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.760
So when the miners move on, they just go in the landfill.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.800
They're not going to go on like eBay.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.000
This seems like the dumbest way to solve this problem possible.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.280
I think Nvidia realized that they're going to have a problem, that you'd have the use

10:12.280 --> 10:17.440
market come along and dump a whole bunch of cards in a year or two undercutting their

10:17.440 --> 10:18.740
market price.

10:18.740 --> 10:23.840
And so they decided to make this move, which is just it's cold.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.760
You know, it's a cold move.

10:25.760 --> 10:29.920
And you know that that driver limitation is going to get bypassed in under a month.

10:29.920 --> 10:34.920
As I say, you know, there's like 15 guys in Eastern Europe ready to get around that at

10:34.920 --> 10:35.920
any point.

10:35.920 --> 10:36.920
You know it.

10:36.920 --> 10:37.920
And you know, they're sitting there in their coders.

10:37.920 --> 10:38.920
Oh, Jesus.

10:38.920 --> 10:39.920
Go ahead, Chris.

10:39.920 --> 10:40.920
I'm muting.

10:40.920 --> 10:47.400
I'm muting because I know I'm not supposed to swear on the show anymore.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.400
Just do it.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.280
Well, you know, time is running out for the coder.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.280
That's right.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.320
The Coder Radio robe.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.120
It's almost it's almost gone, folks.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.760
At the end of the month, eleven fifty nine p.m., we're done.

10:58.760 --> 10:59.760
It's true.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.100
It's you know what you could say.

11:01.100 --> 11:08.400
This is the final countdown for the coder.

11:08.400 --> 11:17.920
OK, the fact that you made this happen just drives me crazy and the fact that every single

11:17.920 --> 11:22.840
day on Twitter, someone has to tell me, hey, Mike, hope you're having a good day.

11:22.840 --> 11:23.840
Look what I just bought.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.760
I mean, at least you're getting a robe out of the deal.

11:26.760 --> 11:32.360
I even bought one myself because I I sincerely didn't believe that this would be successful.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.960
The only way is through, Mike.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.400
It's the only way out.

11:35.400 --> 11:36.400
I get it.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.400
This is the battle of the bulge.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.360
I just have to shoot and shoot and shoot and like fight.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.460
Right.

11:41.460 --> 11:42.960
And you know, we'll see.

11:42.960 --> 11:47.800
We'll see what happens because I can't guarantee that the robe is gone forever, but I think

11:47.800 --> 11:48.800
this is the only one.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.800
I don't know.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.080
You know, so this is a special moment in Coder Radio history right now.

11:52.080 --> 11:57.520
If everybody who has tweeted at me has actually bought a robe, we should never stop selling

11:57.520 --> 11:58.520
rooms.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.520
I know.

11:59.520 --> 12:00.520
I know.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.520
You know, I know.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.520
Unless they're lying.

12:02.520 --> 12:06.480
But I don't think we've even I don't think we've crossed the 150 mark yet.

12:06.480 --> 12:07.480
I don't think so.

12:07.480 --> 12:11.800
That's you know, but it's all it would really take to make this viable, assuming we don't

12:11.800 --> 12:13.440
die in the international shipping.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.080
If the international shipping ends up being half the cost of the robe, I'm going to have

12:16.080 --> 12:17.080
a problem.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.320
But we'll find out.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.360
The Coder dot shop and then the next thing I'm going to tackle after this is figuring

12:22.360 --> 12:25.520
out how to do multiple sizes and colors for some other swag item.

12:25.520 --> 12:30.840
Can I recommend just this is just me trying to help the audience for the same people in

12:30.840 --> 12:34.320
the audience, which I know there's only five of you left.

12:34.320 --> 12:38.240
There is a poster, a Coder Radio 400 poster.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.240
Mine came today, actually.

12:39.240 --> 12:42.640
Oh, do you know if we did a video show, do you know what my backdrop is?

12:42.640 --> 12:43.640
The last one.

12:43.640 --> 12:48.920
It's the 300 poster framed, the old one with the green Emacs logo.

12:48.920 --> 12:52.600
Yeah, this one looks really sharp with the new logo.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.600
Really happy with it.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.440
I'm going to get it framed and I'm going to put it up on the wall in the studio.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.920
I'll have to do the same just out of pure jealousy.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.800
But you know what I will always do now?

12:59.800 --> 13:00.800
Hmm.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.200
So, you know, I'm starting an OnlyFans, right?

13:02.200 --> 13:03.200
I've been waiting.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.720
Hey, the fact that you laugh, you know what I'm saying?

13:07.720 --> 13:08.720
I'm waiting.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.520
You know, I've been thinking this is the way to go.

13:10.520 --> 13:14.040
I'm thinking, you know, we have the Coderly report, right?

13:14.040 --> 13:15.040
Yeah, yeah.

13:15.040 --> 13:20.360
This is the only fans where I dress in the Coder robe and I code in whatever language

13:20.360 --> 13:25.680
the audience picks, which I can already see the PHP coming because many people have tweeted

13:25.680 --> 13:27.880
it at me because I tweeted this idea out.

13:27.880 --> 13:35.400
So just so I'm clear, what would be the product would be, would be you, a grown man in a robe,

13:35.400 --> 13:38.240
complaining that people keep choosing PHP over and over again and then having people

13:38.240 --> 13:39.240
pay for that.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.680
Well, it doesn't have to be PHP.

13:40.680 --> 13:45.280
I mean, if there are particular status in the audience, they could be vBasic.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.960
I mean, vB6.

13:46.960 --> 13:47.960
I mean, I don't know.

13:47.960 --> 13:48.960
Okay.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.440
I actually think now I think I'd pay for that myself, actually.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.440
Now I see what you're saying.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.840
I know for a fact Wes would get in there because he did this to me for free.

13:54.840 --> 13:55.840
Right.

13:55.840 --> 13:56.840
About a year ago.

13:56.840 --> 13:57.840
Yeah.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.280
I think this is something we should do.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.640
So please comment on the show if you would like to torture me.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.560
This could be a new platform for developers to raise money for their project.

14:05.560 --> 14:09.360
Yeah, it's going to be me and a bunch of dancing girls, let's say.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.360
Right.

14:10.360 --> 14:13.320
And you know what I love about it is everyone's wearing a robe.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.880
Yes, I will wear the damn robe, okay?

14:15.880 --> 14:17.840
So go get it now, thecoder.shop.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.680
I will never forgive the audience for the robe.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.040
I'm just letting them know.

14:21.040 --> 14:25.160
This really is, they're the ones that encouraged me, you know, with the emails.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.160
How did this?

14:26.160 --> 14:27.160
You know what?

14:27.160 --> 14:28.160
Let's just move on.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.160
Okay.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.160
All right.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.160
All right.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.160
The robe is a thing for me.

14:32.160 --> 14:33.600
The robe is very triggered by the robe.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.600
Let's just keep going.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.680
It'll be a thing, but we'll heal and we'll move forward.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.960
I'm willing, of course, to make money off the robe.

14:41.960 --> 14:51.120
All right, well, it is a special time to mention that a Cloud Guru has a 20% off business plans

14:51.120 --> 14:52.920
promotion going right now.

14:52.920 --> 14:57.280
If you use the promo code SPRINGINTOCLOUD21, you'll save for your whole team.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.840
You know the cloud's growing.

14:58.840 --> 15:03.680
In fact, 82% of companies have ramped up their investment in cloud computing as a response

15:03.680 --> 15:04.960
to the pandemic.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.920
So a Cloud Guru has a spring sale right now.

15:06.920 --> 15:10.560
It's the perfect time to plant the seeds for your digital transformation.

15:10.560 --> 15:14.360
Fast-track into the cloud with the most effective and comprehensive cloud training platform

15:14.360 --> 15:15.360
out there.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.360
That's a cloudguru.com.

15:16.360 --> 15:20.160
You go over there and use the promo code SPRINGINTOCLOUD21.

15:20.160 --> 15:26.640
96% of customers saw improved results within six months when they surveyed 400 users.

15:26.640 --> 15:31.960
SPRINGINTOCLOUD21 at a cloudguru.com.

15:31.960 --> 15:32.960
We have some email.

15:32.960 --> 15:33.960
Should we do email?

15:33.960 --> 15:34.960
Maybe we should do email.

15:34.960 --> 15:35.960
That might be best.

15:35.960 --> 15:36.960
Can you send me a robe email?

15:36.960 --> 15:38.960
I don't know, actually.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.720
No, the first one's actually about keyboards.

15:41.720 --> 15:42.720
That's classic.

15:42.720 --> 15:43.720
That should make you feel better.

15:43.720 --> 15:44.720
All right, fine.

15:44.720 --> 15:45.720
Notjohn writes in.

15:45.720 --> 15:49.480
He says, can we get an update on the Keychron mechanical keyboard that Chris ordered?

15:49.480 --> 15:53.760
They're on my short list of options, but I hear they're a bit tall and usually require

15:53.760 --> 15:56.700
a wrist rest.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.920
So I have the Keychron right here.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.400
I've talked about it a little bit on the show.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.280
It's been a few weeks, though, so it's not a bad time to update.

16:03.280 --> 16:13.040
It's the Keychron K3, and it's just this tiny little 65% keyboard, and it's USB-C or Bluetooth,

16:13.040 --> 16:15.840
and it has really low profile keys.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.920
And they even sell a little baggie that I have linked in the show notes.

16:18.920 --> 16:22.600
This is a perfect portable keyboard to go in your bag.

16:22.600 --> 16:26.760
This would have a no impact on my bag, weight or really size.

16:26.760 --> 16:30.320
It's lower profile than a normal keyboard, so you have to be comfortable with that.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.600
The lighting options are really cool, and it has a switch to move between Mac mode or

16:33.600 --> 16:36.360
Windows and Linux mode.

16:36.360 --> 16:40.880
And I'll link to an iMore review, which I pretty much agree right up and down with their

16:40.880 --> 16:43.000
entire review over there.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.840
I think it was Christine Chan that wrote this.

16:45.840 --> 16:49.760
Essentially because of their low profile keys, it's a little bit harder to swap out some

16:49.760 --> 16:53.420
of the keys on this than a typical mechanical keyboard.

16:53.420 --> 16:55.700
So that's a bit of a downside, but it's lightweight.

16:55.700 --> 16:59.340
It's compact as heck, and it does have hot swappable keys if you need to.

16:59.340 --> 17:05.480
It has Bluetooth connectivity or USB-C, and it has a lot of nice backlighting options.

17:05.480 --> 17:12.200
It's gray for the keys with kind of a soft glow white that comes through the keycaps.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.200
I like that part a lot.

17:13.200 --> 17:17.800
And then the other thing I'm a big fan of is some of the other keys like Tab and Capslock

17:17.800 --> 17:19.720
and Shift and Enter.

17:19.720 --> 17:20.820
They're a darker gray.

17:20.820 --> 17:21.820
They stand out more.

17:21.820 --> 17:23.000
It's a different color.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.480
And then the Escape key is red.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.400
It comes with a different key, but I like it red, and I have it lit up.

17:27.400 --> 17:31.040
So it looks like the Escape keys, like the abort key on a spaceship or something.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.040
It types real good.

17:32.040 --> 17:36.480
I mean, this is me kind of banging on it.

17:36.480 --> 17:41.540
And I think it's a great keyboard, but because it is so low profile, it's not quite as satisfying

17:41.540 --> 17:44.720
to type on as I would ultimately like.

17:44.720 --> 17:49.800
If I was buying this to work with an iPad or another sort of ultra portable machine,

17:49.800 --> 17:51.480
I'd be very happy with this.

17:51.480 --> 17:55.600
And because I'm using it here in the studio in a kind of a tight space, it works tremendously

17:55.600 --> 17:56.600
well.

17:56.600 --> 18:01.480
So if I was going to get a Keychron for myself at home today, I actually would be a little

18:01.480 --> 18:07.920
bit boring and I'd probably go with the K6, which is about a similar size, doesn't look

18:07.920 --> 18:12.960
quite as modern, but has a more traditional depth and size of a keyboard.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.960
It's not quite as thin.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.960
That's the Keychron K6 wireless mechanical keyboard.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.800
That'd be probably the route I'd go instead of this one.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.560
I don't know if I'd buy this one again, but that's just for my use case.

18:22.560 --> 18:27.040
If I was throwing this in a bag, absolutely this would be the one I'd get again.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.040
And I really like it.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.100
It's been a nice improvement from what's in here.

18:30.100 --> 18:34.080
So I will link to both of those, the K6 and the K3 in the show notes.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.680
The K3 is sold out right now.

18:37.680 --> 18:41.540
Keychron man, they have travel pouches, they have wood wrist rest.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.400
I don't feel like this needs a wrist rest.

18:43.400 --> 18:48.180
In fact, if anything, I'd say this is lower down to the desk than most keyboards are.

18:48.180 --> 18:49.520
So I like it a lot.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.520
You're super fancy.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.040
I still like my WASD code keyboard.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.040
Yeah.

18:54.040 --> 18:57.200
Yeah, we actually have had people write in too with good comments about that.

18:57.200 --> 19:02.240
Yeah, I like the little one, but it's not as little as your mini, but we're ultra slim

19:02.240 --> 19:03.240
rather.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.240
And it lights up really cool.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.560
I really like the way it lights up.

19:05.560 --> 19:11.320
Anti-hacker Mike wrote in and he has been in a situation and I'd love to hear what you

19:11.320 --> 19:12.320
think about this.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.720
He says, hey guys, love the show as usual.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.280
I can't, oh here, this is great.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.400
He says, I cannot wait to be listening to it comfortably in the coder.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.560
There it is.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.560
Good job.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.560
Mike, what are you doing?

19:22.560 --> 19:23.560
He worked it in.

19:23.560 --> 19:24.560
He worked it in.

19:24.560 --> 19:28.280
We've talked about security a few times here on the show, but he wanted to get our views

19:28.280 --> 19:32.080
on a controversial practice that he has seen on the rise.

19:32.080 --> 19:36.800
He says he's referring to the idea of bug bounties, but not bug bounties like you know

19:36.800 --> 19:40.360
it, where a company basically invites people to hack them and then pays the hacker for

19:40.360 --> 19:44.960
what they find, which is common, you know, Apple and Google and Microsoft and lots of

19:44.960 --> 19:47.200
companies, there's bug bounty that do that.

19:47.200 --> 19:52.520
It seems, anti-hacker Mike writes, that it's becoming an entire career for people where

19:52.520 --> 19:57.360
they essentially bang on stuff and then they come emailing.

19:57.360 --> 20:02.400
He says this all seems well and good until it happened to my web service.

20:02.400 --> 20:09.240
Yeah, a hacker was able to find a small hole in our security and then was able to exploit

20:09.240 --> 20:10.240
it.

20:10.240 --> 20:14.320
He emailed us with screenshots asking to be paid for finding this bug.

20:14.320 --> 20:20.360
While it sounded like a question, it didn't really feel like a choice.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.640
It felt more like blackmail.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.880
Extortion is the word you're looking for, but yeah.

20:24.880 --> 20:29.280
Yeah, he goes on to say we did end up agreeing to hire him to test the whole site and then

20:29.280 --> 20:30.800
report his findings.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.200
He did, and then we fixed those issues.

20:33.200 --> 20:39.160
But then, a couple of months later, he came back saying he'd found more things and that

20:39.160 --> 20:41.680
we'd have to pay him again to see them.

20:41.680 --> 20:45.200
I can't help but see this as anything other than a hustle.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.720
We haven't agreed to anything yet, so I'm not sure what will happen next, but what are

20:48.720 --> 20:50.240
your views on this type of practice?

20:50.240 --> 20:56.600
On one hand, it is a service, but on the other hand, it feels forced and not morally right.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.600
What are your thoughts?

20:57.600 --> 21:02.480
Gather round, children, and let Uncle Mike tell you about New Jersey for a few minutes.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.880
Oh my gosh, that's amazing.

21:04.880 --> 21:05.880
I understand.

21:05.880 --> 21:09.120
I think last week we had a nice conversation about Texas.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.120
Yep.

21:10.120 --> 21:12.160
Well, it's time to talk about Jersey.

21:12.160 --> 21:14.200
Tell us a little bit, Mike.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.920
I want to make sure we have our glossary of terms.

21:16.920 --> 21:17.920
Okay.

21:17.920 --> 21:18.920
Extortion.

21:18.920 --> 21:19.920
Uh-huh.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.720
Give me money or I will do something bad to you.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.360
Blackmail.

21:25.360 --> 21:30.560
Give me money or I will share information damaging to you.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.080
Protection racket.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.200
Give me money or I will hurt you.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.200
Right.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.920
Usually it's phrased as, hey, that's a nice website you got there.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.240
Be a shame if all the user data got leaked.

21:41.240 --> 21:42.240
Right.

21:42.240 --> 21:48.280
Now, I am a pretty mild-mannered guy, which, I mean, Chris has hundreds of hours of evidence

21:48.280 --> 21:51.180
to the contrary, but, you know, we just got to let that go.

21:51.180 --> 21:56.640
The first thing you learn when you're in preschool in New Jersey is if somebody shoves you on

21:56.640 --> 22:02.600
the playground, even if they're right, you punch them in the face, no matter what.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.160
You never admit fault.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.240
Chris knows this from dealing with me.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.400
You're sorry only transactionally, right?

22:08.400 --> 22:10.280
You're never really sorry.

22:10.280 --> 22:15.400
Because your mistake in this case, what's the listener's name again?

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
Anti-hacker Mike.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.400
All right.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.400
I'm calling you Vinny.

22:18.400 --> 22:24.120
Vinny, your mistake is you paid this jerk, and jerk is the modified.

22:24.120 --> 22:27.320
You know, we need to do a New Jersey feed of the show where I can say what I really

22:27.320 --> 22:28.320
think.

22:28.320 --> 22:29.320
Right.

22:29.320 --> 22:30.800
This guy's never going to leave you alone until you get even.

22:30.800 --> 22:34.480
Now, I'm not telling you to break any laws because we don't do that on Jupiter broadcasting.

22:34.480 --> 22:38.040
We do that on Telegram in encrypted chats.

22:38.040 --> 22:41.500
I'm telling you, you got taken for a sucker.

22:41.500 --> 22:42.500
He came to you.

22:42.500 --> 22:46.120
You paid him, which was not smart.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.080
Now he's coming back for more money.

22:48.080 --> 22:51.080
This is this is mafia tactics right here.

22:51.080 --> 22:53.560
This is the same bullshit people try to pull all the time.

22:53.560 --> 22:55.360
Do you know how many?

22:55.360 --> 22:57.560
Okay, let's go back to classic coder.

22:57.560 --> 23:01.240
I got sued for code journal when it hit the top of the app store.

23:01.240 --> 23:04.560
Like I think it was literally like eight times.

23:04.560 --> 23:08.680
One of the lawsuits, my favorite one, was because I had syntax highlighting.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.840
Remember when that came after podcasts for like playlists?

23:10.840 --> 23:11.840
Yeah.

23:11.840 --> 23:12.840
What was it?

23:12.840 --> 23:15.880
I also got hit with the in app purchase one.

23:15.880 --> 23:16.880
What the hell?

23:16.880 --> 23:17.880
What was the name of that company?

23:17.880 --> 23:18.880
Wow.

23:18.880 --> 23:19.880
That was forever ago.

23:19.880 --> 23:20.880
I remember that.

23:20.880 --> 23:21.880
What the hell was it?

23:21.880 --> 23:22.880
I don't remember now.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.880
But whatever.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.480
These are like gangster tactics.

23:25.480 --> 23:30.280
And the mistake you made, Mike, I won't call you Vinny because that was kind of mean, is

23:30.280 --> 23:31.280
you gave in.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.400
Yes, you may have legitimate issues.

23:34.400 --> 23:39.520
But this person, the way you have at least described him or her, is not behaving like

23:39.520 --> 23:41.160
a security professional.

23:41.160 --> 23:46.080
They're behaving like honestly, like a damn gangster.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.760
Like they're extorting you.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.760
Yeah.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.280
And the minute you lay down to extortion, you're done.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.280
And I've made the mistake.

23:52.280 --> 23:57.280
I have settled lawsuits for bullshit patent stuff that I didn't need to settle.

23:57.280 --> 23:58.280
And you know what?

23:58.280 --> 24:04.100
If I could go back in time 10 years, I would tell younger Mike, you know, eff them.

24:04.100 --> 24:05.100
Don't pay a thing.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.100
Fight, fight, fight.

24:06.100 --> 24:09.640
Because let me tell you, all these jerks are paper tigers.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.000
And what are they going to do?

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
They're going to write a mean tweet.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.760
They're going to write a mean blog post about you.

24:13.760 --> 24:14.760
Who cares?

24:14.760 --> 24:16.700
People can say whatever they want about you.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.960
This is straight extortion.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.440
Don't give in to it.

24:20.440 --> 24:26.320
And if the guy doesn't leave you alone, honestly, call the FBI and tell him you're doing it.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.800
Because this is a crime.

24:27.800 --> 24:32.080
I know some people in the infosec world will say I'm being too harsh, but this is bullshit.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.600
Yeah, I think you could get him for breaking and entering at this point.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.000
You could get him for for felon abuse.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
What is it?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
The 1980?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Mm hmm.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
What the hell?

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
You know the law better than I do.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
The telecom?

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
No, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Right.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.240
That he did not have consent.

24:46.240 --> 24:52.620
So there are real security professionals have get consent to do penetration testing.

24:52.620 --> 24:53.620
That's exactly right.

24:53.620 --> 24:54.620
This is bull.

24:54.620 --> 24:56.060
You're being extorted.

24:56.060 --> 24:57.060
Even if he's right.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.060
You don't lay down to this.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.060
Yeah.

24:59.060 --> 25:00.060
You could.

25:00.060 --> 25:01.060
You definitely should be talking to a lawyer.

25:01.060 --> 25:02.600
There's no there's no doubt about it.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.680
Yeah, I would be talking to a lawyer and the district's attorney at this point.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.320
I this is nonsense.

25:07.320 --> 25:08.760
You don't have to put up with this.

25:08.760 --> 25:12.440
And then at the same time, you could engage with a legitimate firm to start, you know,

25:12.440 --> 25:16.880
helping protect and investigate so that if he does leak something, but a legitimate firm

25:16.880 --> 25:19.680
would not do this without your consent.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.680
Right.

25:20.680 --> 25:21.680
Absolutely.

25:21.680 --> 25:22.680
You're being attacked.

25:22.680 --> 25:25.780
I have been the sales engineer in those calls and we get stuff signed.

25:25.780 --> 25:29.200
You get stuff signed off before you begin any of this for legal reasons.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.440
And I have been on that end of the transaction.

25:31.440 --> 25:34.080
And by the way, I've been the customer for this stuff.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.960
One of the things that is in the contract from the security firm nondisclosure.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.580
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

25:39.580 --> 25:45.120
So the security engineer who finds a flaw in your system, you know, trademark New Jersey

25:45.120 --> 25:47.160
has to keep their damn mouth shut.

25:47.160 --> 25:48.680
They can never say anything.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.640
Once you sign on the dotted line, you you know, you agree to the terms and in there

25:51.640 --> 25:53.880
is going to be a nondisclosure.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.980
It's absolutely part of the standard practice.

25:55.980 --> 26:00.240
And that's why I say you could engage with a firm now and have them start proactively

26:00.240 --> 26:01.240
working on this.

26:01.240 --> 26:05.580
So that way, what this guy knows is an outdated set of information while you pursue legal

26:05.580 --> 26:06.580
options here.

26:06.580 --> 26:11.840
I mean, it's a hell of a situation because, first of all, it angers me because it delegitimizes

26:11.840 --> 26:15.800
an area of I.T. that I think is critically important and something I used to act I used

26:15.800 --> 26:17.600
to I used to do work in.

26:17.600 --> 26:20.880
And, you know, I took it really seriously.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.240
And so that makes me angry.

26:22.240 --> 26:28.040
But additionally, on top of that, like you could see how people could just stay home,

26:28.040 --> 26:34.520
do nothing and just poke at WordPress websites and then extort small businesses for money

26:34.520 --> 26:35.520
all day long.

26:35.520 --> 26:39.720
I am going to say one thing, but like the MadBotter.com is a old WordPress website that

26:39.720 --> 26:41.720
has nothing of value on it.

26:41.720 --> 26:42.720
So.

26:42.720 --> 26:43.720
Well, absolutely.

26:43.720 --> 26:47.240
But, you know, you go into like some mom and pop hair salon or some shop that has.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.360
Well, and they've got their customer info in WordPress.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.360
That's a mistake.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.920
And I think you could scare people enough.

26:52.920 --> 26:57.520
People don't understand that a compromised website on their GoDaddy colo doesn't mean

26:57.520 --> 27:02.200
that their credit card point of sales app at their local LAN has been compromised.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.980
They don't get the difference there.

27:03.980 --> 27:06.480
If you come in and say, I've owned your website and I've defaced it.

27:06.480 --> 27:08.000
Now I have access to your customer records.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
They would believe you.

27:09.000 --> 27:15.180
Well, that's why the I mean, I know I'm on pretty aggressive ground here, but I I consider

27:15.180 --> 27:18.480
this stuff extortion, especially when it's small businesses.

27:18.480 --> 27:23.440
I've never gotten the pentest thing because I mean, this is maybe too inside baseball

27:23.440 --> 27:27.600
for me, but we're required to do audits and I have to hire them anyway.

27:27.600 --> 27:32.960
It puts you this way, but the professionals, when they find something, don't threaten you

27:32.960 --> 27:33.960
with it.

27:33.960 --> 27:34.960
Right.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.240
And they actually fix it for you most of the time.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.240
Yeah.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.240
That's how you know this guy's not legit.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.720
This guy's not legit.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.320
You're being taken for a ride.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.420
This is like, I don't know.

27:43.420 --> 27:46.400
I mean, go watch the movie The Untouchables.

27:46.400 --> 27:51.200
This is the guy who goes to the bar during prohibition that's selling soda.

27:51.200 --> 27:54.680
And then when the guy won't buy his illegal beer from Canada, puts a bomb under it and

27:54.680 --> 27:56.440
kills the little girl.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.920
That's a that's a deep Sean Connery reference.

27:58.920 --> 27:59.920
Sean Connery.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.920
Oh, let's can we pour one out for the only true James Bond?

28:02.920 --> 28:07.960
But yeah, seriously, Mike, do not lay down to this.

28:07.960 --> 28:08.960
Yeah.

28:08.960 --> 28:11.880
And that is the most New Jersey way I can put this right.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.080
And I don't care what he says.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.080
Let him say.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.820
Let him say what he's going to say.

28:15.820 --> 28:16.820
This is you.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.880
You are the victim of extortion and it's time to not be a victim.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.000
You got to fight back.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.440
It's no different than if you give in to ransomware, just enables them as well.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.680
It's a exactly, exactly.

28:26.680 --> 28:27.680
It's a bad racket.

28:27.680 --> 28:28.680
You got me all fired up.

28:28.680 --> 28:29.680
All right.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.040
Well, Timer Mike writes in different Mike, my brothers.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.880
Yeah, they're all coming together today.

28:33.880 --> 28:37.200
He when he was listening to the last episode, I mentioned that I was still having an ongoing

28:37.200 --> 28:44.440
battle with RSI and he realized that he has adopted techniques in general to sort of mitigate

28:44.440 --> 28:45.440
and manage this.

28:45.440 --> 28:49.880
He also picked up on you mentioning that you use a Pomodoro timer app when you're on Gnome

28:49.880 --> 28:50.880
Shell.

28:50.880 --> 28:53.840
He said, I'm not really sure when I came across the technique, but it's become a regular part

28:53.840 --> 28:56.440
of my development process for the last 10 years.

28:56.440 --> 29:00.000
I imagine Mike can have a detailed definition of the process for Pomodoro, but for me, this

29:00.000 --> 29:01.800
is how I use it.

29:01.800 --> 29:08.280
I try to distill my tasks into simple sentences that can be definitively marked as done when

29:08.280 --> 29:09.700
they are in fact done.

29:09.700 --> 29:16.140
So like an example would be account record update when Cognito user is updated and sentence

29:16.140 --> 29:21.000
tasks should just be completable in 30 minutes to an hour and no more than two hours long.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.960
I try to keep to this, but I often lean towards the two to three hour side of things and work

29:25.960 --> 29:31.480
time comprises of 25 minute focus, distraction free efforts, followed by five minutes of

29:31.480 --> 29:33.740
something entirely different.

29:33.740 --> 29:37.300
This is where I've been able to improve my RSI health significantly, giving my hands

29:37.300 --> 29:41.560
and body a five minute break from behind the computer seems to make all of the difference

29:41.560 --> 29:43.120
in the world.

29:43.120 --> 29:47.120
When I'm under time pressure, I'll sometimes abandon my break and keep cranking.

29:47.120 --> 29:52.260
When I do this for long, I inevitably find that my hands and forearms become sore.

29:52.260 --> 29:58.080
Over the last year, I started creating a to do today sheet where I list out my distilled

29:58.080 --> 30:00.560
tasks along with the day's date.

30:00.560 --> 30:04.600
I use the leftover space as a doodle pad for ideas and notes.

30:04.600 --> 30:09.480
And at the end of the day or often at the start of the next, I make a journal entry

30:09.480 --> 30:13.880
on the back of the sheet, summarizing my thoughts on the work that was done and what needs attention

30:13.880 --> 30:14.880
next.

30:14.880 --> 30:19.840
I now have a year's worth of these sheets and I fill that with a three ring binder.

30:19.840 --> 30:24.240
I doubt I will ever go through and read every one of those sheets.

30:24.240 --> 30:28.880
But when you work with intangible goods like software, it's nice to see a stack of something

30:28.880 --> 30:31.040
accomplished in the real world.

30:31.040 --> 30:34.180
I've tried various software timers over the years and they've all had something that

30:34.180 --> 30:37.420
made them difficult to stick with.

30:37.420 --> 30:41.200
When I start blaming those timers for not allowing the technique to work, I decided

30:41.200 --> 30:44.860
just to toss them and go old school kitchen timer from Amazon.

30:44.860 --> 30:50.720
It's not great, but it doesn't crash nor does it stop ticking when my OS crashes and I need

30:50.720 --> 30:51.720
to reboot.

30:51.720 --> 30:57.520
I think there might be a J.B. Swag opportunity for the quote, coder countdown put me down

30:57.520 --> 30:58.520
for three.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.520
God damn, no.

30:59.520 --> 31:00.520
I congrats on 400 shows.

31:00.520 --> 31:05.720
What do you think of that, a coder countdown, it's, you know, I think that's something

31:05.720 --> 31:06.720
right there.

31:06.720 --> 31:10.640
He ought to call himself Merch Mike because I think he's onto something.

31:10.640 --> 31:11.960
This is interesting.

31:11.960 --> 31:16.320
I have been experimenting with a daily brain dump at the end of every workday of what I

31:16.320 --> 31:19.240
think my to do's are for the next day.

31:19.240 --> 31:22.860
And I've actually found what works best is just a text document on my computer that I

31:22.860 --> 31:25.920
just leave running that I just leave up on my screen.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.280
So the next day I come in, it's right there.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.280
Get out of town.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.280
We do the same thing.

31:29.280 --> 31:33.880
I have just like a little text document that I pop open on my desktop and that's it.

31:33.880 --> 31:39.280
I have from time to time done the physical, write it down on a piece of paper, and I do

31:39.280 --> 31:40.280
like that.

31:40.280 --> 31:41.800
And then I would cross off something when I got it done.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.200
I like that crossing off thing.

31:44.200 --> 31:49.900
There is something to when you work on an intangible good to have a tangible good that

31:49.900 --> 31:55.480
represents some accomplished work does feel good because there are every now and then

31:55.480 --> 31:57.040
there's days that I have.

31:57.040 --> 32:02.160
There are always off air days where I feel like I lost an entire day to slack and telegram

32:02.160 --> 32:06.080
and email and I feel gross at the end of the day.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.760
Like what have I done with my day?

32:07.760 --> 32:10.640
Like every day all my time is so precious.

32:10.640 --> 32:15.240
I have so little time to get the stuff done and then I spend an entire day replying to

32:15.240 --> 32:20.320
people and I have nothing to show for it at all.

32:20.320 --> 32:25.000
And so that's where having it, I can look back at a to do list and go, oh no, that's

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
right.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.440
I did fix that issue we were having in the studio and I did get so and so contacted about

32:30.440 --> 32:34.040
this and I can look at the list of things I actually accomplished.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.960
And then while I'm thinking about it, okay, but I still need to get all this done.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.480
That's when I do the brain dump for the next day doc.

32:39.480 --> 32:43.440
I could definitely see extending this though and taking some of these breaks that Mike's

32:43.440 --> 32:47.960
talking about here, doing like a focus 25 minute session and then taking a break.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.360
I do need to play around with that a little bit I think.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.920
Pomodoro will change your life.

32:51.920 --> 32:52.920
Yeah.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.440
I've been doing it for years now.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.560
Little bit of an error here, Mike.

32:56.560 --> 33:01.920
I no longer use the Gnome Pomodoro app because Gnome extensions are fundamentally broken

33:01.920 --> 33:04.000
because Gnome extensions are poorly engineered.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.280
Hey guys, sorry about that.

33:06.280 --> 33:10.360
I keep doing that and I'm sure Eric's pissed off.

33:10.360 --> 33:15.080
I do it on my iPhone because I actually once sold a Pomodoro app and I still have an old

33:15.080 --> 33:19.880
copy of it that I have made run and do not currently sell and it works much better than

33:19.880 --> 33:20.880
Gnome extensions.

33:20.880 --> 33:24.480
Chris, did I miss anything I wanted to insult today?

33:24.480 --> 33:25.480
I don't think so.

33:25.480 --> 33:29.040
I mean, you could, I mean we could throw shade at Chrome or Android.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.520
We haven't done that in a while.

33:30.520 --> 33:31.520
No, you know what?

33:31.520 --> 33:34.400
We don't throw shit at Android because Google, no, I feel like Fuchsia is going to do it

33:34.400 --> 33:35.400
for us.

33:35.400 --> 33:40.760
I feel like Chrome OS overtaking Mac OS, like just like dunked mercilessly on Android.

33:40.760 --> 33:41.760
Oh right.

33:41.760 --> 33:46.480
I mean, somehow Google is its own worst enemy in like the weirdest way.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.480
Yeah.

33:47.480 --> 33:52.600
That Chrome OS becoming the second largest OS is kind of remarkable audience.

33:52.600 --> 33:58.360
This is how it happens when my kid's not here and we no longer have structure to the show.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.880
I have a bone to pick with you.

33:59.880 --> 34:00.880
Oh, all right.

34:00.880 --> 34:01.880
With the audience or with me?

34:01.880 --> 34:02.880
You personally.

34:02.880 --> 34:03.880
Oh, okay.

34:03.880 --> 34:04.880
All right, good.

34:04.880 --> 34:05.880
Okay.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.080
All of the audience, the rogue thing, guys, if he makes a timer, we might take another

34:08.080 --> 34:11.120
couple of month hiatus here because I don't know if I can take it.

34:11.120 --> 34:14.120
You guys got to stop.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.880
Martini glasses, sure.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.280
Coffee cups, yes.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.080
I've noticed certain Linux commentators.

34:20.080 --> 34:27.400
I'm not going to name names, Chris, Chris, Chris, counting Chrome OS as desktop Linux.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.400
Is that what I heard?

34:28.400 --> 34:29.400
What I thought I heard?

34:29.400 --> 34:30.400
Hmm.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.400
I may have in some context.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.800
I kind of waffle on that.

34:32.800 --> 34:35.040
You're a little pussy footed on that.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.040
I could say.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.120
I mean, what do you what do you consider?

34:38.120 --> 34:40.160
It's Gentoo under the hood.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.160
Is it Gentoo?

34:41.160 --> 34:42.160
I mean, I know you can run devs.

34:42.160 --> 34:43.160
I mean, yeah.

34:43.160 --> 34:45.880
And you can run some Linux desktop apps as well now.

34:45.880 --> 34:46.880
Gooey ones.

34:46.880 --> 34:47.880
I know.

34:47.880 --> 34:52.760
But it feels like when people used to claim Android installs as Linux installs.

34:52.760 --> 34:53.760
Oh, yeah.

34:53.760 --> 34:54.760
Yeah, maybe.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.760
Yeah.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.760
Like it.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.400
Here's the problem.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.400
Here's the thing, Mike.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.040
It's like what what slice of Linux are we talking about?

35:02.040 --> 35:04.160
Are we talking about like desktop Linux?

35:04.160 --> 35:07.400
Because then, yeah, I don't think it's actually fair to count Chrome OS at all, actually.

35:07.400 --> 35:09.440
Oh, we're talking desktop Linux, right?

35:09.440 --> 35:10.440
Servers Linux wins, right?

35:10.440 --> 35:11.440
IOT Linux wins.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.760
I sell everything on servers and IOT is Linux.

35:13.760 --> 35:14.760
Fine.

35:14.760 --> 35:15.760
I'm with you.

35:15.760 --> 35:21.200
I change my wallpaper background every 30 minutes and that feels like a problem.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.240
Oh, man.

35:22.240 --> 35:31.720
You know, it's I feel like Chrome OS is it's closer to a Linux machine than Mac OS is to

35:31.720 --> 35:32.720
a Unix workstation.

35:32.720 --> 35:33.720
What?

35:33.720 --> 35:34.720
You got a vape pen there?

35:34.720 --> 35:36.580
I think you're nuts.

35:36.580 --> 35:37.580
Are you joking?

35:37.580 --> 35:40.180
No, no, because you can get a Linux command line.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.360
You can run Linux, gooey applications.

35:42.360 --> 35:45.720
That itself is based on Linux and it runs a Linux kernel.

35:45.720 --> 35:46.720
Hang on.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.040
You said Unix, not Linux.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.040
Right.

35:49.040 --> 35:54.440
Yeah, because like Mac OS, while it has it has a BSD user land, it has its own wackadoodle

35:54.440 --> 35:55.440
kernel.

35:55.440 --> 35:58.000
It doesn't have the entire BSD user land.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.660
It has its own init manager, whereas everything on the Chrome OS side, it's Linux kernel.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.120
It's an open source init manager.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.920
It's got the Linux user land and it runs Linux desktop applications.

36:07.920 --> 36:12.400
And they're even converting the sucker to a Wayland based display system.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.400
So it's like.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.640
Yes, because Wayland was always a good idea.

36:15.640 --> 36:20.440
My point is, it's a lot of the Linux stack there where the Mac is their own proprietary

36:20.440 --> 36:24.200
UI, a good portion of the BSD user land and their own kernel.

36:24.200 --> 36:32.000
Hey, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, let's take a breath, OK?

36:32.000 --> 36:34.280
First of all, the Mac kernel is amazing.

36:34.280 --> 36:36.920
Darwin is amazing.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.760
You're fundamentally wrong in every possible way here.

36:39.760 --> 36:40.760
All right.

36:40.760 --> 36:44.680
Yes, the Mac user land is a little schizophrenic.

36:44.680 --> 36:49.520
It sometimes thinks it's an iPad and doesn't know what it's doing.

36:49.520 --> 36:56.320
Like for instance, I was texting a person and it decided that it forgot who she was

36:56.320 --> 37:01.400
at some point in iMessage and sent me the same notification 10 times on my phone because

37:01.400 --> 37:02.840
I sent it from my iMac.

37:02.840 --> 37:03.840
Sure.

37:03.840 --> 37:10.080
Still, I would say Mac is more BSD than Chrome is Linux or Chrome OS is Linux, I should say.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.080
I don't know, man.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.080
I don't know.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.080
Have you seen BSD?

37:13.080 --> 37:14.080
Yeah.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.080
Yeah, it's great.

37:16.080 --> 37:20.040
I mean, we know people who run BSD and they pretty much won Windows 7, is my understanding.

37:20.040 --> 37:21.040
You would be correct.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.040
You would be correct.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.040
I would be correct.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.600
I know I'm correct.

37:24.600 --> 37:27.360
So I don't know.

37:27.360 --> 37:32.600
I mean, I think we should all run Pop OS and Carl, I don't know why I'm in love with Carl

37:32.600 --> 37:33.600
today.

37:33.600 --> 37:34.600
I don't know.

37:34.600 --> 37:38.200
All I want to do is change my background every 30 minutes and not have my OS crash.

37:38.200 --> 37:39.960
He's got your back, you know, because-

37:39.960 --> 37:40.960
He really doesn't.

37:40.960 --> 37:41.960
This one issue-

37:41.960 --> 37:46.280
His team's making their stuff in Rust and TypeScript, so you should be happy hunky dory

37:46.280 --> 37:47.280
there.

37:47.280 --> 37:50.440
I was with you on Rust and I'm judging them harshly on TypeScript.

37:50.440 --> 37:51.440
Oh, hell, okay.

37:51.440 --> 37:55.680
I thought it was a, I thought it showed a progressive move on their part.

37:55.680 --> 38:00.200
I think, and I don't mean this to be flamey and I know some people will read into it and

38:00.200 --> 38:01.680
it'll be controversial.

38:01.680 --> 38:07.560
I think the gnome team should just apologize for extensions, RM tack R the entire repo

38:07.560 --> 38:09.160
and start over with KDE.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.160
Oh God.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.440
And I don't mean it to be controversial.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.720
No, of course not.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.720
No, not, no, obviously not.

38:15.720 --> 38:19.280
Again, Noble pain on Twitter is where you want to send your feedback.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.280
Right.

38:20.280 --> 38:22.280
Or Alan at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.280
Alan never replies.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.280
Alan's no fun.

38:24.280 --> 38:25.280
It's because he's smart.

38:25.280 --> 38:26.280
He knows.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.280
He's on Windows 7.

38:27.280 --> 38:33.840
He doesn't even, he can't even get the messages.

38:33.840 --> 38:39.680
Linode.com slash coder, go there to support the show and get a $100 60 day credit.

38:39.680 --> 38:44.200
Now I got to check this, Mike, are you slipping a hundred, a hundred dollars into this?

38:44.200 --> 38:45.200
That doesn't seem real.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.200
How can they afford to do that?

38:46.200 --> 38:47.560
I thought it was just a champagne room.

38:47.560 --> 38:48.560
I'm sorry.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.560
Nope.

38:49.560 --> 38:50.560
It's true though.

38:50.560 --> 38:54.440
$100 in, uh, in account credits for 60 days when you create a new account at Linode.com

38:54.440 --> 38:55.440
slash coder.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.160
I spent everything up on Linode now.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.160
Like everything.

38:58.160 --> 39:01.640
If it's a game server for my kids or if it's the backend infrastructure for a community

39:01.640 --> 39:05.560
chat system, I spin it up on Linode.

39:05.560 --> 39:10.400
One of the things that we run right now is a piece of software that has replaced Google

39:10.400 --> 39:12.640
docs for me completely.

39:12.640 --> 39:13.640
It's coming along.

39:13.640 --> 39:16.760
It's had a few name changes, but I really like where they're, where they're going with

39:16.760 --> 39:17.760
it.

39:17.760 --> 39:18.760
It's called hedge doc.

39:18.760 --> 39:24.220
It's a self hostable real time collaborative text editing Markdown editor.

39:24.220 --> 39:28.080
It's like everything I needed in Google docs, but it specializes in Markdown and you can

39:28.080 --> 39:29.560
host it yourself.

39:29.560 --> 39:31.280
That's something that we put up on Linode.

39:31.280 --> 39:36.700
So our team has a URL they go to, and that's where our hedge doc instances and it works

39:36.700 --> 39:37.920
great for that.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.920
When we're done with this, we're going to upload these files to a system running on

39:40.920 --> 39:44.540
Linode that our editor drew will download it from, and when he's done, he'll submit

39:44.540 --> 39:48.920
it back up to a Linode system that will encode it and then publish it out to the web.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.520
We do all of that on Linode.

39:50.520 --> 39:54.280
So if you're if you're brand new and you just want to get started, Linode has great plans

39:54.280 --> 39:57.960
that are totally accessible price wise and UI wise.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.840
You can get started right away or if you really know what you're doing and you can mix and

40:01.840 --> 40:05.840
match different technologies like their object storage and their cloud firewall and of course

40:05.840 --> 40:11.400
their GPU or dedicated CPU systems, you could really build an infrastructure that's just

40:11.400 --> 40:13.800
unmatchable to anything you could have done years ago.

40:13.800 --> 40:19.160
Linode has been around since 2003, so they have followed this market very closely.

40:19.160 --> 40:22.320
But they were in this, I think, before we were calling this cloud computing, right?

40:22.320 --> 40:23.600
They started before AWS.

40:23.600 --> 40:29.040
They started before Google or any of the enterprise cloud providers got into this.

40:29.040 --> 40:33.000
Because of that, they've been able to really focus on a few things and do them extremely

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
well.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.680
And they're 30 to 50 percent less in cost than the other enterprise cloud providers

40:37.680 --> 40:42.040
while still having incredibly great network connections because they've been in this.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.160
They can network.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.660
They've been in this for a long time.

40:44.660 --> 40:50.040
They know how to serve this up for an end user and make it super accessible.

40:50.040 --> 40:53.600
They know how to check all of those boxes and do it really well.

40:53.600 --> 40:57.360
And they're my server provider of choice because of that and a lot of other reasons.

40:57.360 --> 40:58.760
But I encourage you to just go check it out.

40:58.760 --> 41:02.040
There's only so much I can really tell you in the show.

41:02.040 --> 41:04.620
For the rest, you just got to take a little time and try it.

41:04.620 --> 41:07.320
And that's why they're making this $100 offer right now.

41:07.320 --> 41:12.820
Go to linode.com slash coder, go over there, sign up, support the show and just try some

41:12.820 --> 41:14.160
of it out and see what I've been talking about.

41:14.160 --> 41:15.160
See what you can do.

41:15.160 --> 41:18.640
You can deploy it for infrastructure that's client facing or for back end stuff for yourself

41:18.640 --> 41:19.640
or your community.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.840
And they have 11 data centers to choose from.

41:21.840 --> 41:25.300
So you can find something that's close to whoever is going to be using the system.

41:25.300 --> 41:29.680
Try it out at linode.com slash coder.

41:29.680 --> 41:33.380
I just want you to know the monsters that listen to the show live have been tweeting

41:33.380 --> 41:36.640
me purchasing coder robes.

41:36.640 --> 41:38.800
You know what, Robbros, I appreciate you out there.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.640
I need you this week, Robbros.

41:40.640 --> 41:46.440
I hate every single one of you with a passion that only equals the memory leakage of Swift

41:46.440 --> 41:51.040
versus Objective-C. I completely made that up, but most of you don't write Swift and

41:51.040 --> 41:53.880
I could have totally passed that off as a fact.

41:53.880 --> 41:56.240
Robros includes ladies and also children.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.960
Robros also includes dogs.

41:57.960 --> 41:59.800
That'd be amazing.

41:59.800 --> 42:04.360
So maybe before we get out of here, maybe we should impart people with some wisdom.

42:04.360 --> 42:09.680
You found a really good article about starting a niche, finding your niche and starting in

42:09.680 --> 42:10.680
one.

42:10.680 --> 42:12.640
And we will link to this in the show notes.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.400
It's it's wow.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.660
This is the week of mics.

42:15.660 --> 42:17.680
It's also written by a guy named Michael.

42:17.680 --> 42:18.680
So many of us.

42:18.680 --> 42:19.680
We are leeching.

42:19.680 --> 42:20.800
This is getting weird, man.

42:20.800 --> 42:24.160
This is the like the third or fourth mic-ception.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.160
That's wild.

42:25.160 --> 42:30.500
But anyways, he starts with the most popular products don't become mass or popular overnight.

42:30.500 --> 42:31.640
It's a process.

42:31.640 --> 42:36.640
Usually their popularity is uneven and they're known in some niches, but not very popular

42:36.640 --> 42:37.640
in other niches.

42:37.640 --> 42:41.200
When you start a product, sometimes you know that niche already and you can easily define

42:41.200 --> 42:42.880
and target that customer.

42:42.880 --> 42:45.300
But in many cases, you just don't know.

42:45.300 --> 42:51.460
And you try to find the niche and the miraculous niche market fit that will work for your product.

42:51.460 --> 42:55.480
One of the most common mistakes is to ignore niches and just try to attract all kinds of

42:55.480 --> 42:58.520
customers going just for that general customer.

42:58.520 --> 43:03.600
But I tell you, it's essential to find one or two ponds to start from and then expand

43:03.600 --> 43:07.680
to the other larger, more promising lakes and oceans later.

43:07.680 --> 43:12.560
And then what Michael does is he goes through here and lays out some classic technologies

43:12.560 --> 43:17.120
that started as strange niche products, but now are huge.

43:17.120 --> 43:24.120
The telegraph, the telephone, the photograph, the car, the radio, the radio was immediately

43:24.120 --> 43:26.320
adopted by the British Royal Navy.

43:26.320 --> 43:30.100
They thought the radio could speed up communication between ships and they were right.

43:30.100 --> 43:34.040
Really, it took a lot longer until others adopted the radio.

43:34.040 --> 43:36.600
So radio was introduced in 1895.

43:36.600 --> 43:42.720
In 1912, the Titanic sent a distress signal, but the radios were turned off on the closest

43:42.720 --> 43:45.560
ships because they just simply weren't using them back then.

43:45.560 --> 43:47.600
Well, they didn't have the Windows Vista patch.

43:47.600 --> 43:48.600
Yeah.

43:48.600 --> 43:49.600
Yeah.

43:49.600 --> 43:52.660
Which meant you had to reboot or else your router and radio service were down.

43:52.660 --> 43:54.360
With apologies to Paul Thoreau.

43:54.360 --> 44:00.160
VisiCalc also, you know, Excel's predecessor that launched in 1979, classic, first adopted

44:00.160 --> 44:05.800
by accountants, businessmen and analysts joined the party much later on.

44:05.800 --> 44:10.760
Accountants saw the value right away in VisiCalc, but the others in the business stack took

44:10.760 --> 44:15.900
a lot longer before they realized what spreadsheets would be used for now.

44:15.900 --> 44:18.060
Now entire companies run off of Excel.

44:18.060 --> 44:21.360
And I thought this just, it really was a really wise article that you found.

44:21.360 --> 44:25.440
I set it aside to read it and I read the whole thing and he really makes the case for how

44:25.440 --> 44:27.260
you have to find a niche.

44:27.260 --> 44:29.280
You have to focus on it.

44:29.280 --> 44:31.260
He says, how do you find that niche?

44:31.260 --> 44:34.760
You can use Conway's law, which you can look that up, but he said it's only a partially

44:34.760 --> 44:35.760
a joke.

44:35.760 --> 44:39.560
You review a couple of the alternatives, you look at what you know best, you select that,

44:39.560 --> 44:41.820
and then you execute as best as you can.

44:41.820 --> 44:47.180
In a way, startups are kind of like an experimentation facility that hypothesizes, executes, and

44:47.180 --> 44:48.840
then measures their results.

44:48.840 --> 44:51.400
And the startups that are successful are the ones that find the right niche.

44:51.400 --> 44:55.080
I mean, I have the sense just from doing this for, has it been 400 years yet?

44:55.080 --> 44:56.560
I mean, are we older than the country?

44:56.560 --> 44:57.560
Right.

44:57.560 --> 45:01.200
No, actually, if you check, if you look at the map this week, it's 402 years.

45:01.200 --> 45:02.200
True.

45:02.200 --> 45:06.880
And I believe that the title should be payment required because I know my HTTP error codes.

45:06.880 --> 45:09.760
And by the way, people are going to look at that and they're going to go, what?

45:09.760 --> 45:14.600
No, they're going to look at it and they're going to buy a poster.

45:14.600 --> 45:15.880
You understand what I said?

45:15.880 --> 45:19.680
And more importantly, what I did not say, no, but seriously, buy a robe.

45:19.680 --> 45:22.240
It'd be a shame for something to happen.

45:22.240 --> 45:24.160
You should buy a robe just to be careful.

45:24.160 --> 45:26.360
Let me explain something to you.

45:26.360 --> 45:29.280
The Thaleo has been a flight simulator for a long time.

45:29.280 --> 45:31.900
I have been working on drones for a long time.

45:31.900 --> 45:37.860
There may or may not be some sort of interference with the robes where there are chips in them.

45:37.860 --> 45:42.440
And then one day you're all going to get painted with the worst possible thing I could think

45:42.440 --> 45:44.720
of, Swift stickers.

45:44.720 --> 45:50.000
I have to say a supply chain attack on the robes would be the ultimate long troll.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
That would be pretty good.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
You know what?

45:52.000 --> 45:55.300
The problem is you have weirdly aligned my incentives with yours.

45:55.300 --> 45:59.600
Even though I don't think it's a secret that the robes, I thought you were joking and I'm

45:59.600 --> 46:02.480
really surprised that there are actually robes.

46:02.480 --> 46:06.200
I say this every week because I'm not over it.

46:06.200 --> 46:07.200
Like I got to be honest.

46:07.200 --> 46:09.600
I, what were you smoking?

46:09.600 --> 46:10.600
Inspiration.

46:10.600 --> 46:13.000
You know, the creative inspiration.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.320
You did give us a hint at your niche there a little bit, you know?

46:16.320 --> 46:17.320
I did.

46:17.320 --> 46:21.520
How long did, I mean that, that going back to that point, that wasn't just an obvious

46:21.520 --> 46:25.000
for, I mean, it seems like it took you multiple years of getting screwed at different things

46:25.000 --> 46:27.800
before you kind of landed on that niche for a while.

46:27.800 --> 46:28.800
Aviation niche.

46:28.800 --> 46:29.800
Yeah.

46:29.800 --> 46:33.000
So this is the thing where longtime listeners are going to be like, I heard it before.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.200
In the beginning, Chris, in the beginning, there was darkness.

46:37.200 --> 46:38.520
Four hundred years ago.

46:38.520 --> 46:42.480
And then, you know, a guy named, oh my God, I can't remember the guy's name who created

46:42.480 --> 46:44.400
Java and I feel like a jerk.

46:44.400 --> 46:45.400
Gosling?

46:45.400 --> 46:46.400
Gosling.

46:46.400 --> 46:47.400
Right?

46:47.400 --> 46:48.400
Oh, I'm right.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.400
Gosling.

46:49.400 --> 46:52.040
I wrote Java applets because I needed money.

46:52.040 --> 46:54.420
That's a good reason to do anything.

46:54.420 --> 46:59.760
And then the iPhone came out and I had a Dutch uncle who helped me because I was still young

46:59.760 --> 47:05.600
enough to need help and bought me a very cheap MacBook.

47:05.600 --> 47:08.940
I'm not denigrating, but he, he, he hates Apple.

47:08.940 --> 47:10.320
He still hates Apple to this day.

47:10.320 --> 47:11.880
Got like the base model.

47:11.880 --> 47:13.520
He got like the MacBook, right?

47:13.520 --> 47:15.640
It was like whatever.

47:15.640 --> 47:18.700
And this is, we're going back a long time, so whatever, it's not even like comparable

47:18.700 --> 47:19.700
to it.

47:19.700 --> 47:23.640
Like my MacBook Air could like buy and sell this MacBook four hundred times without using

47:23.640 --> 47:24.640
like one core.

47:24.640 --> 47:25.640
Right.

47:25.640 --> 47:27.600
Are we like talking like early, like the first Intel kind of thing?

47:27.600 --> 47:29.880
I think we might be second or third.

47:29.880 --> 47:32.880
No, I think it's second.

47:32.880 --> 47:36.520
Those early Airs were, they were a special kind of slow.

47:36.520 --> 47:37.520
Yeah.

47:37.520 --> 47:38.520
Yeah.

47:38.520 --> 47:43.720
I had a Dell that I was running Ubuntu on at the time and it was bad.

47:43.720 --> 47:46.240
Like until snow leopard came out, it was bad.

47:46.240 --> 47:48.520
I mean, it was just not a good mission.

47:48.520 --> 47:53.280
I cannot believe you just got a snow leopard mention and I just can't believe you till

47:53.280 --> 47:59.080
the day I die where you sell the company again, whichever, you know, either way, I think they're

47:59.080 --> 48:00.280
going to be about the same.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.280
So same.

48:01.280 --> 48:02.280
Yeah.

48:02.280 --> 48:03.280
I don't think you'll ever.

48:03.280 --> 48:04.280
Yeah.

48:04.280 --> 48:05.880
So yeah, I came up in the, uh, the iPhone app gold rush.

48:05.880 --> 48:08.600
I did the code journal thing later on the Mac app store.

48:08.600 --> 48:12.920
That was kind of how I got this guy with the good hair's attention.

48:12.920 --> 48:15.880
And then how long, how long did I ride the iPhone ride for?

48:15.880 --> 48:17.160
Cause you were around for that.

48:17.160 --> 48:20.840
I mean, for as long as you possibly could, I went down hard though.

48:20.840 --> 48:21.840
I messed up.

48:21.840 --> 48:22.840
I, I held on too long.

48:22.840 --> 48:23.840
Yeah.

48:23.840 --> 48:24.840
Yeah.

48:24.840 --> 48:25.840
Yeah.

48:25.840 --> 48:26.840
I mean, I, I mean, have you ever fully let go?

48:26.840 --> 48:27.840
Let's be honest.

48:27.840 --> 48:30.880
When Swift came out, I think, I mean, I think you have it on tape.

48:30.880 --> 48:32.520
I'm pretty sure I let go.

48:32.520 --> 48:33.520
Yeah, that's for sure.

48:33.520 --> 48:34.520
Yeah.

48:34.520 --> 48:35.520
That was rough.

48:35.520 --> 48:36.520
Yeah.

48:36.520 --> 48:37.520
I was pretty upset.

48:37.520 --> 48:40.440
Then there was the, the price bottom dropped out of the market when that's the thing that

48:40.440 --> 48:46.600
is a little bit distant now is it wasn't the norm for an app to be a dollar 99 or to use

48:46.600 --> 48:47.600
a subscription.

48:47.600 --> 48:48.600
Well, right.

48:48.600 --> 48:49.760
When I, when I started, right.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.160
It was totally reasonable.

48:52.160 --> 48:58.080
Like code journal was originally like 10 bucks and then I put it to five, but like that was

48:58.080 --> 49:02.120
cheap and I did it on purpose because I was trying to get like attention, right?

49:02.120 --> 49:04.720
Like I was trying to, for my consulting business.

49:04.720 --> 49:06.880
But like people were selling iPhone apps.

49:06.880 --> 49:10.720
I mean, I think most of our listeners will not believe this, but people were selling

49:10.720 --> 49:12.600
iPhone apps for like 20 bucks.

49:12.600 --> 49:13.600
Yeah.

49:13.600 --> 49:16.480
Like it was just like, it was a real, it was a thing.

49:16.480 --> 49:18.720
I remember there was no one app purchase.

49:18.720 --> 49:25.680
There was no, I ads, there was no, like it was a piece of software and then that changed.

49:25.680 --> 49:29.480
If you really want to know, you can listen to all my moaning and complaining on the back

49:29.480 --> 49:31.640
catalog because I, I, yeah, right.

49:31.640 --> 49:35.280
I went through that like, Oh, I lost 40 grand on windows eight.

49:35.280 --> 49:36.280
Yeah.

49:36.280 --> 49:37.280
Oh yeah.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.280
Windows eight.

49:38.280 --> 49:39.280
I admire your restraint and not mentioning that.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.520
Oh, you know, I got it.

49:40.520 --> 49:42.280
I got a jab at you in episode 400.

49:42.280 --> 49:44.680
So I thought I just good for a little while.

49:44.680 --> 49:48.760
And then I tried to do all the cross platform stuff to lower consulting prices.

49:48.760 --> 49:52.600
Did you discover the current that there are not current, but the, the, cause you know,

49:52.600 --> 49:56.840
there was some bot time in there and then you really did focus in on aerospace for awhile.

49:56.840 --> 50:00.560
Did you land on that niche by networking at events?

50:00.560 --> 50:01.560
Kind of.

50:01.560 --> 50:05.680
So this is where, where I have to love up a brother Chris here.

50:05.680 --> 50:09.000
So the first aerospace client came from you, right?

50:09.000 --> 50:10.360
From the show.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.700
It's one of your Linux hippies who doesn't really run Linux.

50:12.700 --> 50:14.500
They bought a Thalia and put windows on it.

50:14.500 --> 50:18.800
So sorry, Carl, Carl, it's been a rough, it's been a rough night for you, Carl.

50:18.800 --> 50:20.600
I don't know what to say.

50:20.600 --> 50:21.600
Sorry, man.

50:21.600 --> 50:23.760
I mean, the other day he's still selling the box.

50:23.760 --> 50:27.640
So yeah, he still sells, sold a thread ripper unit for a amount of money that I could have

50:27.640 --> 50:28.680
bought a car for.

50:28.680 --> 50:31.120
So you know, whatever.

50:31.120 --> 50:35.760
And then yeah, then it was events that they recommended and it turned out, and it took

50:35.760 --> 50:39.280
me a long time to figure this out, like longer than it should have, cause you're right.

50:39.280 --> 50:46.340
I was in love with the whole consumer facing software idea that this niche is people are

50:46.340 --> 50:52.300
willing to pay for stuff and like not fight you about a, you know, $4,000 bill.

50:52.300 --> 50:53.300
They just pay.

50:53.300 --> 50:54.300
Yeah.

50:54.300 --> 50:56.120
They're, they're willing to pay consulting fees that actually pay your bills.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.120
Right.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.120
And like you have to travel.

50:58.120 --> 51:03.640
I mean, COVID, COVID is, I can't say it's messed things up cause we're still up year

51:03.640 --> 51:09.260
over year, but it's, I am very good at podcasting.

51:09.260 --> 51:13.040
No comment necessary, Chris, cause I know I'm terrible.

51:13.040 --> 51:15.560
I am very good at trade shows.

51:15.560 --> 51:19.760
I'm very bad at phone sales and zoom calls and email, which you would think I would be

51:19.760 --> 51:22.680
able to do zoom calls cause it's just like podcasting.

51:22.680 --> 51:26.520
But I had a zoom call and I know, I know he listens, but another listener of the show

51:26.520 --> 51:31.840
who's also a fellow podcaster who I won't name because I don't have permission wants

51:31.840 --> 51:34.920
to hire us for a job.

51:34.920 --> 51:38.720
And I find something disorienting about zoom.

51:38.720 --> 51:39.720
Yeah.

51:39.720 --> 51:41.360
Like I'm, I feel like I'm confused.

51:41.360 --> 51:46.960
I feel like I don't know what I'm doing, but on a podcast or in person, I'm totally cool.

51:46.960 --> 51:47.960
Right.

51:47.960 --> 51:48.960
Like I'm, I'm fine.

51:48.960 --> 51:49.960
I got it.

51:49.960 --> 51:50.960
Not a problem.

51:50.960 --> 51:54.440
I have a similar phenomenon that I experienced and I don't know exactly what it is.

51:54.440 --> 51:59.640
I find zoom calls to be kind of exhausting, not to sound like a wimp, but yes, no, I mean,

51:59.640 --> 52:00.880
I need coffee afterwards.

52:00.880 --> 52:01.880
I'm like tired.

52:01.880 --> 52:02.880
Yeah.

52:02.880 --> 52:05.280
I got a caffeinate before and I got a caffeinate afterwards.

52:05.280 --> 52:12.360
Where here I have literally been live for two hours and 26 minutes and I feel great.

52:12.360 --> 52:15.600
I've been on the live stream for two hours and 30 minutes and I'm totally fine right

52:15.600 --> 52:16.600
now.

52:16.600 --> 52:17.600
Yeah.

52:17.600 --> 52:21.040
I don't know why it's a different, it's a different muscle and it totally is exhausting.

52:21.040 --> 52:24.240
And I, I, I have a couple of times even.

52:24.240 --> 52:29.800
I will admit to convincing the participant to let me call them instead.

52:29.800 --> 52:30.800
And I do a little bit.

52:30.800 --> 52:31.800
Well, I do a lot better.

52:31.800 --> 52:35.120
I feel like over the phone even than I do on a zoom call because I get up and I walk

52:35.120 --> 52:40.360
around and I put like, or you know, earphones on wireless ear pods and I walk around and

52:40.360 --> 52:44.640
I, I gestate like a moron and I, I wouldn't gestate.

52:44.640 --> 52:45.640
Is that the right term?

52:45.640 --> 52:46.640
I don't think so.

52:46.640 --> 52:47.640
Gesture.

52:47.640 --> 52:49.880
And oh, I thought you were pregnant for a minute there.

52:49.880 --> 52:50.880
Yeah, I do.

52:50.880 --> 52:52.920
I gestate ideas like a moron.

52:52.920 --> 52:57.600
I gestate ideas like a moron, but I gesture around and I walk and I pace.

52:57.600 --> 52:58.600
That's exactly what I do.

52:58.600 --> 52:59.880
I pace on speakerphone.

52:59.880 --> 53:00.880
Yeah.

53:00.880 --> 53:01.880
Yes.

53:01.880 --> 53:04.880
And when that's taken away from me, it's, it's, yeah, I'm not as effective.

53:04.880 --> 53:11.040
I was, the reason why I asked is I was having a quasi meeting this morning and we were going

53:11.040 --> 53:16.160
through like sources and material and we were looking at it and like we have, we have a

53:16.160 --> 53:19.580
lot of great people that we know in the community over the years.

53:19.580 --> 53:23.640
And I'm, so I'm not taking away from that, but we haven't really added to the list this

53:23.640 --> 53:24.640
year.

53:24.640 --> 53:28.700
Like our little black book of people, we can, we can email up and say, Hey, tell me the

53:28.700 --> 53:32.760
insight scoop on this hasn't really expanded.

53:32.760 --> 53:35.600
And that's the first time ever that we haven't added people to that list.

53:35.600 --> 53:38.400
You just had like a guy from NASA on, on like Saturday.

53:38.400 --> 53:39.520
Yeah, that was great.

53:39.520 --> 53:41.400
I know that's the, I was going to say, that's the exception.

53:41.400 --> 53:44.400
I was going to say like, come on man, what are you talking about?

53:44.400 --> 53:47.080
That, that, so that was a nice feather in the cap for sure.

53:47.080 --> 53:52.320
But the networking has just dropped off like in terms of what it typically would be, you

53:52.320 --> 53:57.900
know, where I was getting at is if you look at like Alex on self-hosted, he came on board

53:57.900 --> 54:03.160
because I met him at a Linux fest in Texas and we started discussing like our shared

54:03.160 --> 54:07.800
interest on stuff and realized we had a bit of a chemistry and you know, hit it off.

54:07.800 --> 54:12.260
And then he became, you know, he became one of my co-hosts and I just haven't had that

54:12.260 --> 54:13.260
for a while.

54:13.260 --> 54:15.840
I don't mean to bring it back to that again, but I just was wondering if that was pretty

54:15.840 --> 54:19.160
influential on how you got to where you're at right now or where you had been.

54:19.160 --> 54:20.960
I don't know if you're still focusing much on aerospace.

54:20.960 --> 54:21.960
Is that still the case?

54:21.960 --> 54:26.760
Uh, well, I mean, might as well open the kimono all the way, I guess.

54:26.760 --> 54:29.200
Ooh, hello, sir.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.520
You mean the robe, open the robe all the way.

54:31.520 --> 54:39.320
I am aware that I'm getting money off these robes, but at some point dignity matters more.

54:39.320 --> 54:40.320
I know, I know, I know.

54:40.320 --> 54:41.320
Don't worry.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.320
We'll do a mug soon.

54:42.320 --> 54:46.280
You know, I have to tell you the odds of me not loving this robe and wearing it all the

54:46.280 --> 54:47.280
time are zero.

54:47.280 --> 54:48.280
Cause you know what?

54:48.280 --> 54:49.280
I am going to love this robe, right?

54:49.280 --> 54:53.760
I'm going to be like, there will be some tweets of me in the robe with nothing else that will

54:53.760 --> 54:56.200
probably get me banned for a couple of days from Twitter.

54:56.200 --> 54:57.200
Right?

54:57.200 --> 54:58.200
Like that's gonna get you canceled.

54:58.200 --> 55:01.960
I'm going to get, ah, listen, my ex-wife would love to cancel me.

55:01.960 --> 55:02.960
It's all right.

55:02.960 --> 55:04.360
I already, there's already a bunch of them.

55:04.360 --> 55:09.000
Ooh, got the bell, the bell, bell and Carl are getting a lot of work today.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.320
You know, it's a good, that's how, you know, it's a good episode.

55:11.320 --> 55:13.600
Hey Carl, where's my keyboard, right?

55:13.600 --> 55:15.760
He's not going to talk to me anymore.

55:15.760 --> 55:16.760
We should work out a deal.

55:16.760 --> 55:22.000
I'm saying because I think we could sell some keyboards, you know, you know, it's no robe,

55:22.000 --> 55:23.600
but he's going to pack in a robe.

55:23.600 --> 55:24.600
Carl don't do it.

55:24.600 --> 55:25.600
Yeah.

55:25.600 --> 55:26.600
Bundle.

55:26.600 --> 55:27.600
Right.

55:27.600 --> 55:28.600
There you go.

55:28.600 --> 55:29.960
What would you do if system 76 stole your robe idea and just like through their little

55:29.960 --> 55:31.800
robot Zoe, right?

55:31.800 --> 55:32.800
That's Zoe.

55:32.800 --> 55:36.120
It's their robot, the character that they developed for the Thalia.

55:36.120 --> 55:37.120
They should do that.

55:37.120 --> 55:39.740
No, honestly, the world needs more robes.

55:39.740 --> 55:40.740
They should do it.

55:40.740 --> 55:41.740
They should work the idea.

55:41.740 --> 55:45.360
No, the world needs more COVID vaccines, green energy.

55:45.360 --> 55:46.360
Yeah.

55:46.360 --> 55:47.760
But like number four on that list, right?

55:47.760 --> 55:48.760
It's robes, right?

55:48.760 --> 55:52.760
I mean, I can keep you on for another five hours telling you things before.

55:52.760 --> 55:53.760
That's what you want to do.

55:53.760 --> 55:55.840
And I don't even remember the question you asked me.

55:55.840 --> 55:56.840
Hold on.

55:56.840 --> 55:59.520
Cause we were getting to the Komodo about, so I asked you if you're still focusing on

55:59.520 --> 56:05.560
the aerospace or yes, but we accidentally, cause that's how things happen, fell into

56:05.560 --> 56:08.520
food production because of COVID.

56:08.520 --> 56:16.760
So it turns out we had a person reach out to us doing food production over in Canada.

56:16.760 --> 56:20.680
And it turns out that they reached out before like COVID was a thing, right?

56:20.680 --> 56:23.320
But I also live in the state of Florida.

56:23.320 --> 56:28.680
For those who don't know, Florida is famous for alligators, Florida man and Disney world,

56:28.680 --> 56:34.500
but also like a tremendous amount of agriculture, like a shocking amount of agriculture.

56:34.500 --> 56:39.440
But COVID, when you have a bunch of workers living in basically barracks, uh, that's

56:39.440 --> 56:41.120
a problem, right?

56:41.120 --> 56:47.600
Because one guy or girl gets, or one guy or gal gets COVID and potentially 50 of them

56:47.600 --> 56:51.280
have it and your entire farm is, uh, screwed.

56:51.280 --> 56:52.280
Of course.

56:52.280 --> 56:57.280
If you can embed, God damn it, Python, sure.

56:57.280 --> 56:58.280
Ruby is better.

56:58.280 --> 57:05.680
If you can embed Python into, uh, let's say IOT devices and you can run a Python flask,

57:05.680 --> 57:12.880
big web servers, and you can have like smart.net based UWP tablet apps for the form.

57:12.880 --> 57:16.240
I'm going to use the word Foreman, but all these different companies have different names,

57:16.240 --> 57:17.240
but like supervisors.

57:17.240 --> 57:18.240
Yeah.

57:18.240 --> 57:23.560
It turns out you can basically minimize your manual labor, therefore your risk of COVID

57:23.560 --> 57:26.560
exposure while keeping your crop yield up.

57:26.560 --> 57:28.360
And I don't want to get too much into agriculture.

57:28.360 --> 57:34.200
One I've had to learn a lot about it in the last year, but it's one of those things that,

57:34.200 --> 57:37.160
you know, Chris, I'm sure you go to the grocery store, you buy some lettuce, you buy some

57:37.160 --> 57:40.120
strawberries, you know, raspberries, raspberries.

57:40.120 --> 57:41.120
Okay.

57:41.120 --> 57:42.120
Well, we're, we're, we're based in plant city.

57:42.120 --> 57:47.080
So strawberries are the main crop, but, uh, we actually have the strawberry festival,

57:47.080 --> 57:48.440
believe it or not.

57:48.440 --> 57:49.600
You don't think anything of it, right?

57:49.600 --> 57:52.660
But there's actually hundreds of people working on that farm, right?

57:52.660 --> 57:55.600
Our whole shtick now is we're minimizing that work.

57:55.600 --> 57:58.800
So basically on the aviation side, we're killing people on the other side.

57:58.800 --> 57:59.800
We're feeding people.

57:59.800 --> 58:00.800
So I don't know where that leaves me.

58:00.800 --> 58:04.440
I mean, I got to tell you when, when, when I die, St. Peter is going to be like, I don't

58:04.440 --> 58:05.440
know, man.

58:05.440 --> 58:06.440
Got a lot of stuff here.

58:06.440 --> 58:07.440
Yeah.

58:07.440 --> 58:08.440
Yeah.

58:08.440 --> 58:10.360
You know, so you can point, you know, you can say, Oh, I answered some questions on

58:10.360 --> 58:11.360
a podcast.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.400
That might, that might've been some good, like I told the truth.

58:13.400 --> 58:16.160
He's like, yeah, you weren't supposed to do that either though.

58:16.160 --> 58:17.160
So

58:17.160 --> 58:25.080
Datadog.com slash CoderRadio, this episode is sponsored by Datadog, the unified monitoring

58:25.080 --> 58:29.440
analytics platform for comprehensive visibility into your entire stack.

58:29.440 --> 58:32.720
If you have on-premises, if you have cloud, if you have a hybrid, something in between,

58:32.720 --> 58:38.660
maybe multiple clouds, get a unified view into all of it, quickly analyze the performance

58:38.660 --> 58:43.260
of your Linux servers in real time and get dashboards that you can move around and build

58:43.260 --> 58:45.800
to get the information that you need.

58:45.800 --> 58:49.960
If you're creating an application, if you're trying to monitor something in production,

58:49.960 --> 58:53.680
wouldn't it be nice to have analytics that are easy to understand and share with your

58:53.680 --> 58:54.680
team.

58:54.680 --> 58:57.000
So that way you can communicate your needs to them.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.400
That's what Datadog does for you.

58:58.400 --> 59:02.520
And they help you troubleshoot issues in seconds with these unified metrics and traces and

59:02.520 --> 59:03.680
logs.

59:03.680 --> 59:08.920
You can look at all of the environment in one snapshot, look inside a container, look

59:08.920 --> 59:12.600
at the Linux server and look at the application performance as well.

59:12.600 --> 59:17.140
And then additionally, they have over 400 integrations, just turnkey integrations to

59:17.140 --> 59:20.120
get Datadog insights into your application.

59:20.120 --> 59:24.280
You combine that with the server metrics, your performance, and you get it all into

59:24.280 --> 59:26.160
a customizable dashboard.

59:26.160 --> 59:30.880
And you can take actual action on what you see.

59:30.880 --> 59:31.880
But you got to get started.

59:31.880 --> 59:35.360
So go to datadog.com slash coderadio.

59:35.360 --> 59:39.880
If you set up one dashboard, you now qualify for some free swag, a Datadog t-shirt, but

59:39.880 --> 59:43.040
you got to go to datadog.com slash coderadio.

59:43.040 --> 59:45.480
This is a tool to allow you to communicate.

59:45.480 --> 59:51.040
I say that because that's how Datadog started, as a way for the developers to communicate

59:51.040 --> 59:53.080
to the sysadmins.

59:53.080 --> 59:55.880
That's such a quintessential problem, communication.

59:55.880 --> 01:00:01.320
And to have a tool, analytics and data base that you can use to communicate with your

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.360
teams, that's worth its weight in gold.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.520
So just get started, just see what it can do.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:11.360
Go to datadog.com slash coderadio.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.520
All right, Mr. Dominic, one last thing for you before we go.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:20.000
You mentioned this at the top of the show, does the release of.NET 6, which is getting

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.040
closer and closer, preview one is out, I think today as we record.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.800
So it'll be a few days by the time people hear this.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.240
It's out, it's close, this is it.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:34.280
This is like them bringing the last several six years or so of work together.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:43.120
So it's the promise of taking a lot of the, what is it, Xamarin, X-Marion, the X-Marion

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.600
tools bringing a lot of that and actually bringing it into.NET and creating something

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:53.480
that's actually usable for desktop, web, cloud, mobile, gaming, IoT, Windows, Linux,

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:57.280
Android, iOS, Mac, even Apple TVs on the list.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.720
I mean, this is it, it's here, at least in preview.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:08.160
I'm just kind of, I don't know, curious to get your take on.NET 6 and their new preview.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.200
So I'm trying to be a little careful here.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.600
I have not tried the preview yet.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.560
It's going to be a big like asterisk on this.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:22.480
You know, I have scars from the Java applet days and I do worry that.NET is getting a

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:27.360
little too cross platformy, but I have no evidence of that.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.080
Like I have no reason to think that other than just.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.200
It seems like they're promising the impossible.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:37.400
Well, it seems like they're promising a lot and not showing much yet, right?

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.240
So it's almost a premature, I mean, all right.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:47.480
One of my concerns just to kind of put the cards on the table is at some point does it

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.240
become too fractured in a way, right?

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.080
Where there is, it's this big unified framework, but there's all these little asterisks at

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.080
all, but are you on iOS?

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.080
Oh, but are you on Android?

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.760
Oh, but are you on Windows?

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.760
Oh.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.360
It's really a bunch of different tools that have kind of been relabeled and brought together

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.640
is kind of like a crockpot of different stuff in.NET.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.920
It feels an awful lot like the old Java promises of write once run everywhere.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:11.920
Yeah.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.920
Only this time it's coming from Microsoft.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.920
Well, sure.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.760
But like, you know, anybody could promise you anything, right?

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:22.600
I mean, yeah, I'm just saying like, yeah, yeah, no, I do agree.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:26.440
I was always reading through their announcement because it, yeah, like I said, it came out

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.040
just as we're about when we're recording.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.360
And you know, they go through all the standard stuff, but they say our unification efforts

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.240
offer something for all.NET developers.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:40.920
If you're a desktop app developer, there are new opportunities for you to reach new users.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.640
If you're a mobile app developer, you'll benefit from using mainline.NET tools and APIs while

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.000
targeting iOS and Android platforms.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.320
If you're a web or cloud developer, it will be easier to expose services and.NET mobile

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.840
and apps that share code with them.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.720
I mean, they're really pushing on that.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:01.560
And I think we've had a good sense that when.NET Core came out and they started working

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:07.380
towards this, this was the ultimate scenario is taking these tools that they've invested

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:09.880
in over the years and bringing them in there.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:15.480
I mean, even WebAssemblies in this mix, it's all encompassing.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.040
Unlike you, I kind of have a little bit more of a positive take on it.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:25.000
It seems like Microsoft has taken really a decade to kind of sift through all of this

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.480
and pull it all together.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:33.160
And then what's really happened now is.NET 6 is really kind of like it's like an umbrella

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.880
of this stuff that you can do now.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:40.680
And so when you're a.NET developer, it's going to mean a whole bunch of other stuff

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.360
all of a sudden.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.880
And then on top of that, they have the pipeline, right?

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.440
They have the tools on the desktop.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.840
They have the tools in the cloud.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.560
They have GitHub.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:54.440
I think in a way, I am more bullish on what Microsoft is doing here than I have ever

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.440
been on anything I have seen them do.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:02.160
And I can clearly see the hallmarks of how this benefits Azure.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.720
I can see how this benefits their GitHub platform.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.160
I can see how this makes more Microsoft developers.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.840
I can see how this sells more Windows licenses and Visual Studio licenses, like check every

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.840
box.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.840
All right.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:14.840
But what do they want?

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.940
Like, this is my whole problem with Microsoft right now.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.640
What the hell do they want?

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.520
Are they trying to get you to use Windows or trying to get you to pay for Visual Studio

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.520
Pro?

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.880
Are they trying to get you to?

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:30.280
This is a respin of an idea that I think I rolled out on the show a while ago.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.800
So it's been a couple of years, but I've thought about this.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:37.480
And this isn't the right analogy, but I think this is the only way to state it where it'll

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.480
click.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:45.520
It's like they want to recreate the magic of Windows, but they want to be Windows for

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.520
developers.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:52.160
They want to bring all of this stuff together, and they don't care if you're targeting Android.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.160
Have at it, Haas.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.820
If you want to make TVOS apps, have at it.

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:58.660
But you're using a Microsoft editor to do it.

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:04.040
You're using a Microsoft developer platform to put a repo to store your code.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.840
And you're using.NET as the back end, and you're using the.NET SDK and tools.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:14.960
I just think it's Microsoft wins for every Android device that uses this or every TVOS

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.960
device.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:19.160
They don't need you running Windows, but if you want to run Windows, it's going to be

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.160
great.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:26.680
And I think it's so clever it's devious because they're creating something that's useful.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.440
It's competitive in the market.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:33.820
It answers problems that developers have and corporations, especially enterprises, while

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:39.600
also kind of ensuring that they stay relevant in the game even when people are done with

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.000
the desktop entirely.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.120
Like this, essentially, what I think this.NET umbrella does and combining it with Azure

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.340
and GitHub and everything else, sorry, sorry, sorry, but it's just going to have to be said

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.240
over and over again for a little bit.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:54.440
When they're all done, they don't even need Windows.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.680
They don't even need Windows at all.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:01.000
Windows can just fade away, and they're totally good because the world will be developing

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.240
for IoT, for the web, for mobile, and for the desktop using their tools.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:12.040
And even if it isn't totally market dominant, they're probably over time going to be able

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:18.720
to carve out a nice, sizable, long-term percentage, which will include a ton of businesses and

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:23.380
enterprises, dark matter developers, and people on the front lines like yourself that are

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:27.660
just building shops around this tool chain because it's all there.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.340
Every piece of the pipeline is there for you.

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:34.240
You can build a shop around all of these tools.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.580
It's all there for you.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.400
And you can just start executing.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.400
I guess.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.840
I mean, I know months ago, or, oh my God, like over a year ago, we talked about, it

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.600
was all about that sweet Azure manna raining from heaven.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:47.600
Mm-hmm.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:48.600
But...

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.160
They've got to om-nom that Azure manna.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.160
Om-nom.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.160
I guess.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160
All right.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.160
I guess I'm with you.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:58.880
I sort of feel like I want Windows to get better, and everything you've described is

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.960
it's not really going to get better.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:03.480
They don't need it to now.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.480
And I think they...

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.480
Yeah, I don't know.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.840
I mean, it's deviously clever, I think.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.980
I'm very impressed with the strategy because you just don't normally see it.

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:18.840
So you don't normally see a company be able to shift like this in such a clever way.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.200
Usually it's just a large ship, and once it's set up and going in a direction, it goes in

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.880
that direction forever.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.880
Maybe I'm wrong, but...

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.880
No, I think you're right.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:33.200
I mean, I think that's the whole thing is they don't care, which I mean, we're going

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.200
way over.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.680
If you're a.NET developer today, should you be scared?

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.680
I mean, I don't think so.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.760
Look at what they're trying to target.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.760
That's everything.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:43.760
They're literally trying to...

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.120
That's every platform that exists, from WebAssembly to IoT.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.120
Right.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.120
That's the thing.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.840
I kind of worry that they're trying to be everything to everyone, and it's just not

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.680
going to work.

01:07:54.680 --> 01:08:02.040
That sounds like Microsoft to a T though, and it will work well enough for a large chunk

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.360
of business, for a large chunk of the market.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.240
It will do the job, and it will do the job well enough.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:13.840
The Surface tablets, we do sell development for them at TMB, at the bad botter, because

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.120
they make sense.

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:19.040
But the only reason they make sense is because Android tablets are hot garbage.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:25.080
Please send your emails to alan at jupyterbroadcasting.com, and because Apple is just a pain in the ass

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.760
about enterprise distribution, right?

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:34.760
If Apple would just not have that policy, I would much prefer develop for iPads.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.640
Have you heard of our friends over at Google with their Chrome OS?

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.640
Thank you for listening today.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.560
I'm at Jumanuku on Twitter.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.560
He's at Chris Lass.

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.560
All right.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.560
All right.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.560
Yeah.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.560
Also, thanks to our members.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.560
We should say...

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:50.760
I don't know if we said it last week, but thank you to our members over at coderqa.co.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.920
We appreciate our members.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.920
Thank you very much.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.400
Go get your coderlies.

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.400
Yeah.

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.080
At the bad botter, Inc.'s the company.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.320
Anything else you want to plug?

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:04.160
I have a book review coming up for Jay LaCroix, a friend of the show, and we met him at System

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.160
76...

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.920
Or I met him at System 76 a couple of years ago.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.560
He's mastering Ubuntu Server, so that should be up this week.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.560
Cool.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.560
On dominicm.com.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.560
Great guy.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.560
Linux podcaster.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:14.720
Linux YouTuber.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:20.080
And sounds like if somebody is administering an Ubuntu server, a very useful resource.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.800

I'd encourage you to hang out live if you have some time on a Monday evening.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:53.280
We do this show starting around 5 PM Pacific, 8 PM Eastern over at jblive.tv.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.880
I'm usually dorking around on the stream, and then Mike shows up about the half hour

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.880
mark and we kick off.

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.920
And it's a Coder happy hour.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:03.200
Share drinks and hang out with friends at jblive.tv on a Monday.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.280
