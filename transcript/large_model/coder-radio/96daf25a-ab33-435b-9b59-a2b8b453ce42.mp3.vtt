00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 491 for November 7th, 2022.

00:07.760 --> 00:19.420
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.420 --> 00:24.900
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.900 --> 00:29.860
My name is Chris and joining us every single week, hopefully fully caffeinated, it's our

00:29.860 --> 00:31.400
host, Mr. Dominic.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.400
Hello Mike.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.340
Damn, skip it Chris, I'm a pot of coffee in and I have a steaming cup of hot matcha right

00:36.340 --> 00:37.340
next to me.

00:37.340 --> 00:38.340
In.

00:38.340 --> 00:39.340
Yes!

00:39.340 --> 00:40.340
In.

00:40.340 --> 00:41.340
Cause I'm, you know, I'm no pleb.

00:41.340 --> 00:42.340
In a mad-botterer cup.

00:42.340 --> 00:43.340
Ah, very good.

00:43.340 --> 00:44.340
A mad-botterer coffee cup, yep.

00:44.340 --> 00:47.060
You know, I'm still loving that KOTOR robe.

00:47.060 --> 00:48.060
Still loving it.

00:48.060 --> 00:49.060
Just rocking it the other day.

00:49.060 --> 00:50.460
It's all I wear when the mailman comes.

00:50.460 --> 00:53.840
You know, I really genuinely had the thought the other day, like, why don't I just wear

00:53.840 --> 00:57.680
this all the time and nothing but this when I'm just going to be home all day?

00:57.680 --> 01:02.620
It doesn't happen very often, but my God, the two things together are so glorious.

01:02.620 --> 01:04.660
So, so glorious.

01:04.660 --> 01:09.300
We are gathered here today mostly, I think, to hear about your two-factor nightmare and

01:09.300 --> 01:11.700
looks like you went deep into Swift again.

01:11.700 --> 01:15.100
So that's going to be, I think, the bulk of the show today.

01:15.100 --> 01:21.820
However, since we gathered together last week, there has been a tremendous amount of news.

01:21.820 --> 01:26.660
So we're going to do a little hangover watch for the economy, pour yourself a cup of coffee.

01:26.660 --> 01:27.660
Yeah.

01:27.660 --> 01:31.340
I found a new site that I wanted to tell you about that is shocking.

01:31.340 --> 01:38.740
It's called layoffs.fyi and it's currently tracking 755 startups with over a hundred

01:38.740 --> 01:42.780
and four thousand layoffs in 22 so far.

01:42.780 --> 01:45.300
And of course you can jump around, you can look at the charts.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.780
They've got, they're doing some really interesting ways of tracking it and showing different

01:48.780 --> 01:55.740
waves of different, I guess, phases of layoffs since COVID-19 really hit.

01:55.740 --> 02:03.620
And the list is, it's kind of depressing to see, honestly, but the news has been unbelievable.

02:03.620 --> 02:10.580
Today before we started recording, Apple announced an update on the supply of iPhone 14 and

02:10.580 --> 02:12.780
iPhone 14 Pro Max.

02:12.780 --> 02:17.620
I haven't seen one of these updates since about 2008 or 2009.

02:17.620 --> 02:25.720
They say that, they say due to COVID-19 restrictions in China and the concern about the health

02:25.720 --> 02:33.140
of their workers, they are going to miss the supply and that they will have more shipments

02:33.140 --> 02:37.980
than previously anticipated that will experience longer wait times as they will be producing

02:37.980 --> 02:40.500
fewer iPhones.

02:40.500 --> 02:45.140
And we've seen rumors about less iPhone demand.

02:45.140 --> 02:48.820
And I had speculated that that would be an early recession indicator is all of a sudden

02:48.820 --> 02:50.820
a thousand dollar phone looks a little ridiculous.

02:50.820 --> 02:56.420
When times are good and the money's flowing, you can buy a $1,100 phone.

02:56.420 --> 02:59.760
But when the price of gas is going up on a monthly basis and the price of food still

02:59.760 --> 03:04.940
going up, $1,100 phone is kind of silly sometimes.

03:04.940 --> 03:09.380
And I think Apple's feeling, they're blaming COVID-19, but they've also been moving more

03:09.380 --> 03:12.540
and more manufacturing to India and Taiwan and other places.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.300
So I don't know.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.740
But I think that's a big indicator there.

03:17.740 --> 03:22.860
Also today's the day that Elon set the deadline for Twitter Blue and it seems to have worked,

03:22.860 --> 03:23.860
remember?

03:23.860 --> 03:25.860
He said they have until like the seventh or they're fired.

03:25.860 --> 03:26.860
Yeah.

03:26.860 --> 03:27.860
Well, they're fired.

03:27.860 --> 03:28.860
And they're rolling out the Twitter Blue.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.380
They're rolling out the new membership stuff.

03:30.380 --> 03:32.460
I think they, although yeah, a lot of them are fired.

03:32.460 --> 03:35.900
You know, I've been thinking about this too.

03:35.900 --> 03:40.900
Imagine what we're going to see here after, if Elon pulls this off even somewhat, and

03:40.900 --> 03:47.220
if the metric is going by ruthless CEO standards in the market, not going by human standards,

03:47.220 --> 03:51.220
if the metric is profitability, he might do it.

03:51.220 --> 03:55.300
I mean, if he gets thousands of people to pay eight bucks a month and he lays off 60%

03:55.300 --> 03:57.940
of the staff, he might get it.

03:57.940 --> 04:00.900
And if he has verified accounts, advertisers are going to eat that up.

04:00.900 --> 04:05.380
I mean, right now you're seeing advertisers pause, but once they know that that's a genuine

04:05.380 --> 04:10.980
human who's been verified and that they know exactly what kind of things they like, that

04:10.980 --> 04:16.740
in terms of an ad buy, a person who is a knowable, verifiable person is worth substantially more

04:16.740 --> 04:18.500
than an anonymous number.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.500
Right.

04:19.500 --> 04:22.260
Than an impression on a page or a CPM or anything like that.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.260
Sure.

04:23.260 --> 04:27.260
So what if we're seeing an extreme recession model be created here?

04:27.260 --> 04:30.100
You'll see other tech companies essentially go on sale.

04:30.100 --> 04:35.980
They'll have some CEO that buys them out ruthlessly, comes in, fires half the staff, brings in

04:35.980 --> 04:43.420
their own people, basically carves it down to an MVP, takes it private, does all of this

04:43.420 --> 04:46.420
work, because you wouldn't do it when it's a public company, does all this carving.

04:46.420 --> 04:52.380
It's kind of the Romney strategy of past, you know, the bank capital strategy, only

04:52.380 --> 04:54.420
it's for tech companies now.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.920
And it's by tech CEOs.

04:55.920 --> 05:00.600
And I think if he pulls it off, and I'm not saying this is a good thing.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.500
If he pulls this off, I think it's going to be looked at as a model for the next two years,

05:04.500 --> 05:09.020
because we're going into a multi-year recession and there's going to be a lot of businesses

05:09.020 --> 05:10.320
on sale.

05:10.320 --> 05:16.460
And I think this is going to be the play, is the idea is you go in, you clean up, and

05:16.460 --> 05:17.460
then you turn it around.

05:17.460 --> 05:22.060
And by the time the market's picking back up in 2024, 2025, you bring it public again,

05:22.060 --> 05:23.500
you make a bunch of money.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.500
Yeah.

05:24.500 --> 05:28.060
I mean, I think Twitter itself, I mean, that could be a model that generally works.

05:28.060 --> 05:31.840
I still feel kind of going along with what I said last week, that Twitter itself has

05:31.840 --> 05:32.840
some unique problems.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.100
One, I mean, I don't know if you've noticed this.

05:35.100 --> 05:38.540
I know I'm much more active on Twitter than you generally are.

05:38.540 --> 05:40.900
My Twitter feed is basically worthless now.

05:40.900 --> 05:44.820
And I used to get a lot of good tech news, dev news, follow a bunch of open source people

05:44.820 --> 05:51.780
or people at Microsoft, stuff like that, because it's everybody just being mad about Elon.

05:51.780 --> 05:57.820
And I understand that it's just strange.

05:57.820 --> 06:03.620
The things I've been saying are the Magic the Gathering 30th anniversary event and Elon

06:03.620 --> 06:05.100
hate.

06:05.100 --> 06:10.180
So I feel like he's somehow got to get a handle on this.

06:10.180 --> 06:14.540
Now, of course, the Internet's attention span is like that of my dogs.

06:14.540 --> 06:18.700
So maybe, you know, maybe he just needs to ride it out for another week.

06:18.700 --> 06:19.700
Yeah.

06:19.700 --> 06:24.300
I mean, I think inevitably, once we get past all this, right, and I think this, I don't

06:24.300 --> 06:29.300
really want to go on about Twitter, but yeah, I think inevitably, people just, they freak

06:29.300 --> 06:32.300
out, they have an absolute panic attack.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.460
And then in six months, they pretend like it never happened.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.020
That's our current state of the world right now.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.020
Right.

06:37.020 --> 06:41.300
I mean, as far as like the way I like to use Twitter, other than like trolling and like

06:41.300 --> 06:46.100
memes or whatever, I still feel like Google Plus was a much better like techie social

06:46.100 --> 06:50.740
network where I got more valuable data than I ever did with Twitter.

06:50.740 --> 06:51.740
Right.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.180
Like I had different circles for perfect example.

06:54.180 --> 06:58.780
So Google Plus, I had like an iOS dev circle I was in and I had your whatever the JB one

06:58.780 --> 07:01.740
was right there was like, I don't know if it was official by you or what.

07:01.740 --> 07:02.740
Yeah, yeah.

07:02.740 --> 07:03.740
Yep.

07:03.740 --> 07:04.740
It was like the JB circle.

07:04.740 --> 07:08.740
You could have like the, Hey, I have this problem with like UI table view conversation

07:08.740 --> 07:12.460
and avoid getting the, you know, sometimes friendly, sometimes less than friendly trolling

07:12.460 --> 07:15.380
from the Linux folks, right?

07:15.380 --> 07:19.100
And then you could have the Linux conversation about, you know, whatever open source.

07:19.100 --> 07:23.180
I think at the time I was like trying to help out with Geary or something like that.

07:23.180 --> 07:24.900
It was better, right?

07:24.900 --> 07:25.900
Than just like scream.

07:25.900 --> 07:30.060
I feel like Twitter in a lot of ways is, you know, going to the Empire State Building and

07:30.060 --> 07:33.420
just shouting at the top of your lungs.

07:33.420 --> 07:40.020
So I don't know, I, maybe I'm just retroactively assigning more value to the Google Plus than

07:40.020 --> 07:41.020
there really was.

07:41.020 --> 07:47.500
But I felt like I had more serious, deeper conversations that actually produced you know,

07:47.500 --> 07:48.500
mutual value.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.500
Right.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.500
Oh, absolutely.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.820
Mastodon is seeing a big boom right now.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.300
So some people are moving over there.

07:54.300 --> 07:57.500
I want to keep going on the Hangover Watch though.

07:57.500 --> 08:02.620
Apple also warned investors they predict a substantial drop in Mac revenue for the holiday

08:02.620 --> 08:04.220
quarter.

08:04.220 --> 08:08.660
Tim Cook made it clear during the earnings call with investors that the company is subject

08:08.660 --> 08:13.540
to impacts of the macro economy, which has been affected by the war in Eastern Europe

08:13.540 --> 08:17.220
and as a consequence of the pandemic.

08:17.220 --> 08:20.500
In other words, the supply chain and inflation is going to cost them.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.140
Well, and they sold a ton of MacBook Airs, right?

08:23.140 --> 08:27.820
The MacBook Air, see, I know our audience, we're all like MacBook Pros, you know, or

08:27.820 --> 08:29.540
the Linux folks, whatever.

08:29.540 --> 08:33.620
They sold a lot of those and those buyers are your average Joe and Jane.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.940
They're buying maybe every three years.

08:35.940 --> 08:38.820
So and there was huge pent up debate.

08:38.820 --> 08:46.380
I worry that if the iPhone is being paused in production and they're predicting a quote

08:46.380 --> 08:52.100
substantial drop in Mac revenue, which Apple is usually very accurate about these things.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.360
I think we're going to see dark Apple.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.360
I think we really are.

08:55.360 --> 09:00.700
You know, there is also since we got together, developers have discovered that recent changes

09:00.700 --> 09:04.580
made to the App Store ads sort of raised some serious privacy concerns.

09:04.580 --> 09:11.200
It seems that the App Store app on iOS 14.6 and up is sending every tap you make inside

09:11.200 --> 09:12.860
the app everywhere to Apple.

09:12.860 --> 09:15.040
We that could be exploited.

09:15.040 --> 09:19.420
There's some uncertainty is that if you have analytics on or not, right, or is it by default?

09:19.420 --> 09:24.140
I wonder, though, you combine this with the recent gambling ad stuff.

09:24.140 --> 09:29.380
And that's that, of course, you know, they they they just knocked the knees out from

09:29.380 --> 09:33.140
meta for app tracking and a bunch of other advertising platforms.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.900
And they've only been turning it up on their own platform.

09:35.900 --> 09:39.160
And it's this, I think, is pretty alarming.

09:39.160 --> 09:42.700
Because if their hardware sales are going to go down, then they're just going to have

09:42.700 --> 09:45.020
to push even harder on services.

09:45.020 --> 09:47.900
And they just raised the rate of Apple one.

09:47.900 --> 09:50.140
They're all in subscription package.

09:50.140 --> 09:54.380
The level of details in the video that they show here is striking.

09:54.380 --> 09:57.500
Gruber says Apple ads are going wild.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.860
Even Gruber is not on board.

09:58.860 --> 10:04.820
Jason Snell, also very concerned, like long time Apple commentators feel like we're starting

10:04.820 --> 10:07.220
to see dark Apple develop here.

10:07.220 --> 10:10.380
And I just got to imagine a recession with hardware sales is just going to make the situation

10:10.380 --> 10:11.820
even worse.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.420
I think Apple is becoming more and more of a threat factor.

10:14.420 --> 10:17.500
It sucks because the M1 hardware, the M2 stuff, I'm sure is going to be great.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.500
Like the M series is fantastic.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.820
But Apple is a company, I think, not good.

10:23.820 --> 10:25.000
We mentioned the Twitter layoffs.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.340
Jack Dorsey came out playing cover for Elon Musk, said it's his fault.

10:30.340 --> 10:31.940
They hired too many people.

10:31.940 --> 10:36.660
Facebook has announced they are planning, quote, large scale layoffs this week.

10:36.660 --> 10:41.500
Stripe is cutting its head count by 14%, readies for, quote, leaner times.

10:41.500 --> 10:45.980
Lyft to lay off 700 employees in a second round of job cuts.

10:45.980 --> 10:52.740
And Lyft has been having just a bear of a time for a couple of years.

10:52.740 --> 10:56.180
Amazon executives confirm a hiring freeze.

10:56.180 --> 11:02.040
Additionally, the scuttlebutt in my local town is they have a ginormous Amazon facility

11:02.040 --> 11:06.420
by the studio that's going to bring 2,000 trucks a day into my area.

11:06.420 --> 11:12.820
And it was about 95% finished, and Amazon hit the pause button.

11:12.820 --> 11:18.620
And they're not going to finish it until proceeds go up, because they don't know if there's

11:18.620 --> 11:20.740
enough demand for another warehouse in this area.

11:20.740 --> 11:22.900
So they're just going to leave it at 90% finished.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.380
They're going to have to keep security on it.

11:24.380 --> 11:25.860
They're going to have to keep the lights on.

11:25.860 --> 11:27.540
And there's a lot of homeless around here.

11:27.540 --> 11:31.460
So if they're not constantly guarding it, it's going to turn into a ginormous homeless

11:31.460 --> 11:32.460
encampment.

11:32.460 --> 11:33.460
Oh, my god.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.740
It's really going to be something.

11:34.740 --> 11:38.100
And it's wild, because it's just this huge building that blocked my view of the mountains

11:38.100 --> 11:40.380
and just totally took over the skyline.

11:40.380 --> 11:42.020
And they're just hitting pause.

11:42.020 --> 11:44.820
I mean, we've been saying it for months now, right?

11:44.820 --> 11:45.820
I know.

11:45.820 --> 11:48.300
It's going to be an icy winter.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.300
So why do we talk about it?

11:49.300 --> 11:52.860
We talk about it not because we want to watch the economic porn.

11:52.860 --> 11:55.620
We're not talking about it because we want to scare you.

11:55.620 --> 12:00.580
We're talking about it because these macro trends are going to impact developers.

12:00.580 --> 12:01.900
They're going to impact client jobs.

12:01.900 --> 12:03.100
They're going to impact employment.

12:03.100 --> 12:06.520
They're going to impact your negotiation abilities.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.420
There's a real world impact that's going to hit the development community.

12:09.420 --> 12:16.000
And they're going to be hit hardest because this is specifically going after tech.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.500
Investors are pivoting from growth stocks to value stocks.

12:19.500 --> 12:23.300
They're literally transferring money out of tech stocks, like another trillion dollars

12:23.300 --> 12:27.540
in tech stocks was drained last year or last week, last week.

12:27.540 --> 12:31.560
And they're putting it into other places, assets and other stocks that are like value

12:31.560 --> 12:33.140
stocks and things like that.

12:33.140 --> 12:37.440
And the tech companies are getting hit the hardest because the tech companies were the

12:37.440 --> 12:40.520
biggest recipients of the easy money for the last decade.

12:40.520 --> 12:44.620
And so now they're getting hit the hardest and it's going to directly affect our community.

12:44.620 --> 12:48.020
And we've been talking about it, but now it's actually happening.

12:48.020 --> 12:51.820
And it just seems like the pace is picking up faster and faster.

12:51.820 --> 12:53.940
You got to wonder where we're going to be in a couple of months.

12:53.940 --> 12:54.940
A couple of months.

12:54.940 --> 12:55.940
Right.

12:55.940 --> 12:56.940
We're going to see more layoffs.

12:56.940 --> 12:58.820
I agree with you on the multi year thing.

12:58.820 --> 13:03.580
I think this actually doesn't hit the depending on how you want to look at it, the peak of

13:03.580 --> 13:05.300
pain or the trough of misery.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.300
Right.

13:06.300 --> 13:12.220
It's going to be a maximalist destruction probably for another whole year.

13:12.220 --> 13:15.340
You convinced me of something last week and I was thinking about it after the show.

13:15.340 --> 13:22.240
I don't think that unless you get a sorry, Europeans, this is super America, United States.

13:22.240 --> 13:26.540
Our Canadian friends don't like it when we say America, the super U.S. focused.

13:26.540 --> 13:32.460
But unless you have a Republican sweep in Congress, there is no way Biden is going to

13:32.460 --> 13:34.660
not turn on the money printer.

13:34.660 --> 13:41.400
He'll tolerate it for maybe a year, but not if this isn't going to be five years because

13:41.400 --> 13:43.580
they'll never win another election.

13:43.580 --> 13:50.540
It's just unfortunately, the whole the whole economy and the populace as a whole is now

13:50.540 --> 13:53.240
addicted to printing money.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.280
And everything runs on printed money now.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.820
Everything runs on.

13:56.820 --> 14:01.400
You know, you take a look at the housing market, which is going down somewhat.

14:01.400 --> 14:06.320
But the prices are still unattainable for your average, you know, your average 20 something

14:06.320 --> 14:09.420
coming out of college, getting married, whatever.

14:09.420 --> 14:13.820
Where if you go back to the halcyon days after World War Two and let's even say like the

14:13.820 --> 14:16.460
60s, 70s, that was much more doable.

14:16.460 --> 14:21.240
And not only that, that was the normal, very attainable path.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.260
So same thing for wages.

14:23.260 --> 14:25.940
This is not one that you'll see in the Wall Street Journal, but I think it's interesting

14:25.940 --> 14:31.380
that we effectively lease everything now in terms of all these services instead of actually

14:31.380 --> 14:34.800
owning anything as something that's been on my mind.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.580
Like I paid 10 bucks a month to listen to the same maybe 30 albums when I could have

14:38.580 --> 14:39.580
just bought.

14:39.580 --> 14:44.500
And I, in fact, do have many of them either in iTunes purchased or CD or whatever.

14:44.500 --> 14:54.260
The universe that happens if they just let this burn is a total realignment of the economy.

14:54.260 --> 15:02.460
And probably that's actually good if you're a little guy, if you can survive it.

15:02.460 --> 15:07.700
Because I don't, I think tech businesses, particularly software businesses are gonna

15:07.700 --> 15:12.140
sober up a little bit and go back to, hey, we actually have to be a business where we

15:12.140 --> 15:15.500
sell or license a product and actually make money.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.940
Where I can tell you one of my big pain points has been, and I've talked to other people

15:18.940 --> 15:24.320
in similar positions, VC backed companies who are just a drunk on the free money, find

15:24.320 --> 15:28.500
out you're a competitor and they're like, oh, they're charging 8,000 or 5,000 for a

15:28.500 --> 15:32.760
license or whatever, we'll do it for 500, right?

15:32.760 --> 15:37.700
They just literally kneecap you and effectively bleed out your capital, right?

15:37.700 --> 15:39.380
Cause you're bootstrapped.

15:39.380 --> 15:43.340
So that might be my hobby horse, but I think it's bad that all these people are losing

15:43.340 --> 15:44.340
their jobs.

15:44.340 --> 15:46.420
Obviously I feel for them on a human level.

15:46.420 --> 15:50.500
But these businesses, and I'm thinking less of the big, big guys and more of like the

15:50.500 --> 15:56.420
VC companies that are trying to kind of edge their way in.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.980
They need to be real businesses, right?

15:58.980 --> 16:01.780
Even it's funny, you mentioned all these big dudes.

16:01.780 --> 16:06.260
Apple in a way was on this list, the only traditional business that when it started

16:06.260 --> 16:09.260
had to actually make money.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.700
Go down that list, Twitter, Facebook.

16:11.700 --> 16:15.740
My thinking though is if it hits these big guys, it's gonna be even harder on the small

16:15.740 --> 16:16.740
ones.

16:16.740 --> 16:19.460
Well, what's gonna be harder is I think consulting could become harder cause you're gonna have

16:19.460 --> 16:24.500
a bunch of like ex Facebook engineers who are like, screw it, I'm gonna go 1099 it out.

16:24.500 --> 16:29.740
And you know, that's very sexy for the, you know, the marketing agency hiring an iOS dev

16:29.740 --> 16:32.100
for a contract or something.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.100
Sure.

16:33.100 --> 16:35.440
But yeah, I mean, it's bad overall.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.440
Don't get me wrong.

16:36.440 --> 16:41.420
I'm saying there's a slight silver lining, but this is a bloodbath and it shouldn't have

16:41.420 --> 16:42.420
happened.

16:42.420 --> 16:43.420
It shouldn't have.

16:43.420 --> 16:47.500
But just to touch on the human moment just a little bit, because we often talk about

16:47.500 --> 16:54.920
it from a business owner, CEO kind of market perspective, but regular everyday people are

16:54.920 --> 16:58.700
paying the price for policies that led us here.

16:58.700 --> 17:07.100
And last week I watched Chair Powell's update on, you know, another rate increase.

17:07.100 --> 17:10.220
And he signaled he's going, he's gonna go for a while.

17:10.220 --> 17:11.220
Pedal to the metal, baby.

17:11.220 --> 17:12.220
Yeah.

17:12.220 --> 17:15.980
And one of the things I love about the mindblower is so there are 12 members of the feds open

17:15.980 --> 17:19.260
market committee that vote for these rate increases.

17:19.260 --> 17:21.700
And one of them is Esther George.

17:21.700 --> 17:26.340
And she is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

17:26.340 --> 17:29.400
She's on this 12 member board that votes for the rate increases.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.300
And she did something really unusual.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.540
She had an interview with NPR.

17:33.540 --> 17:37.980
In this interview, she says they're basically going to keep going until American savings

17:37.980 --> 17:39.980
account are drained.

17:39.980 --> 17:46.340
Quote, we see today that there is a bit of savings buffer still sitting for households.

17:46.340 --> 17:51.000
That may allow them to continue to spend in a way that keeps demand strong, she said.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.340
That suggests we may have to keep at this for a while.

17:56.340 --> 18:00.500
Because regular Americans have too much money, they're gonna have to keep at this for a while,

18:00.500 --> 18:03.620
because they can afford the inflation for a little while.

18:03.620 --> 18:10.860
And then, you know, you look at what Powell says is he says employment's too high.

18:10.860 --> 18:13.340
The employment market's still too hot, is his term.

18:13.340 --> 18:15.180
They need to cool down the employment market.

18:15.180 --> 18:17.420
There's still too many jobs available.

18:17.420 --> 18:19.820
There's not enough people unemployed.

18:19.820 --> 18:25.340
So you've got a clear, like they want to raise employment and they want to make Americans

18:25.340 --> 18:31.780
spend their savings buffer so that way they can lower demand, which will lower pressure

18:31.780 --> 18:35.100
on the supply chain, which will then fix inflation.

18:35.100 --> 18:38.300
So they're talking about like fourth order effects they're going for here.

18:38.300 --> 18:43.660
And the experiment is being done on the middle class average workers, while the people that

18:43.660 --> 18:48.620
are rich will be able to just buy up assets that become super cheap as a result of this.

18:48.620 --> 18:49.620
Distressed assets.

18:49.620 --> 18:52.780
Yeah, and they'll just totally blow up in value when the market returns and they'll

18:52.780 --> 18:54.140
make a ton of money.

18:54.140 --> 18:58.940
And meanwhile, the American people, the average people will be left with less sales and a

18:58.940 --> 19:03.940
higher standing unemployment, which is going to bring the quality of life down for everyone.

19:03.940 --> 19:05.300
And that's their stated policy.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.300
Yeah.

19:06.300 --> 19:10.820
I mean, we should get off the doom and gloom, but I think I also saw her on NPR.

19:10.820 --> 19:13.540
I think it's actually slightly worse than you describe it.

19:13.540 --> 19:16.900
I think there's a thing you kind of missed.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.340
It's not just savings.

19:18.340 --> 19:22.580
It's spending power, which is a euphemism for credit.

19:22.580 --> 19:26.220
So what is likely to happen, and we've seen this before, right?

19:26.220 --> 19:29.260
2008, remember that, it's a good time.

19:29.260 --> 19:33.100
Most households are not going to immediately cut their standard of living.

19:33.100 --> 19:37.460
They're going to, yes, burn through savings, but they're also going to leverage every bit

19:37.460 --> 19:39.700
of credit they have.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.780
And at the end of this, you're going to have a lot of bankruptcies.

19:43.780 --> 19:49.140
And what will happen is the people lucky enough to own modest homes, this is going to be a

19:49.140 --> 19:50.960
party for BlackRock Capital, right?

19:50.960 --> 19:54.620
You're going to have a lot of foreclosures because people use home equity credit if they

19:54.620 --> 19:55.620
have any.

19:55.620 --> 20:00.820
A lot of just bankruptcy is caused by straight up credit card debt.

20:00.820 --> 20:04.580
And yeah, you're going to see payday lending is going to go up, which you should never

20:04.580 --> 20:07.300
ever do that, by the way.

20:07.300 --> 20:11.460
In a weird way, this is going to be, since we're using the addiction analogy, right?

20:11.460 --> 20:16.660
This is going to be, okay, the Fed's cutting off your legal opioid supply.

20:16.660 --> 20:21.380
Now you're doing street heroin.

20:21.380 --> 20:24.760
The history proves it out, and I am 100% sure it will be the same this time.

20:24.760 --> 20:29.620
People aren't just going to say, I'm lowering my family's day-to-day standard of living

20:29.620 --> 20:30.620
significantly.

20:30.620 --> 20:31.620
They're going to whip out that capital.

20:31.620 --> 20:32.620
Not until they're forced.

20:32.620 --> 20:34.580
Well, when they max everything out, right?

20:34.580 --> 20:35.920
But it's not just savings, right?

20:35.920 --> 20:37.220
It's not capital.

20:37.220 --> 20:38.220
It's also debt.

20:38.220 --> 20:39.220
Yeah, you're right.

20:39.220 --> 20:40.220
Yeah, so.

20:40.220 --> 20:41.220
Yeah.

20:41.220 --> 20:46.580
So I think people that can focus on doing more with less, people that can focus on building

20:46.580 --> 20:52.740
a minimum viable product value are probably going to have the most success.

20:52.740 --> 20:54.740
And there's going to be a correction in other places.

20:54.740 --> 20:55.740
That's not true.

20:55.740 --> 20:57.020
The super-rich are still going to have the most success.

20:57.020 --> 20:58.020
Well, that's true.

20:58.020 --> 21:03.260
If you bought Apple in 1995, you're in great shape.

21:03.260 --> 21:07.180
No matter what, right?

21:07.180 --> 21:08.900
Linode.com slash coder.

21:08.900 --> 21:11.740
That's where you go to get $100, and it's a great way to support the show.

21:11.740 --> 21:16.460
You get $100 on a new account for 60 days, linode.com slash coder.

21:16.460 --> 21:21.600
Linode is quite simply the best place to build your next application, host your infrastructure,

21:21.600 --> 21:24.420
or run a personal site or a gaming server.

21:24.420 --> 21:28.620
Linode has a really easy-to-use dashboard, and they have one-click deployments for things

21:28.620 --> 21:33.980
like Joplin, Git Tea, Focalboard, which is sort of like a Trello system that you can

21:33.980 --> 21:38.500
just self-host up on Linode, and when you have our $100 credit, why not?

21:38.500 --> 21:44.880
It's like if Trello and Asana had a tacit affair and had a baby, that would be Focalboard,

21:44.880 --> 21:49.360
and you can deploy it with one click up over on the Linode dashboard.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.360
So many great things in here.

21:50.360 --> 21:54.900
I mentioned Gaming Server 2, one-click deployment of the Minecraft Java edition, actually several

21:54.900 --> 21:59.400
game servers, several, including, you know, adult games.

21:59.400 --> 22:03.860
I'm talking about development stuff like Node.js, Nextcloud.

22:03.860 --> 22:05.420
That's my form of gaming, at least.

22:05.420 --> 22:08.540
So they have the one-click deployments, and they have a dozen data centers around the

22:08.540 --> 22:13.940
world, and they're adding another dozen throughout 2023, so they just keep moving from strength

22:13.940 --> 22:14.980
to strength.

22:14.980 --> 22:18.820
They started almost 19 years ago, and they just had to survive on a great product, and

22:18.820 --> 22:23.620
now here we are, standing on the shoulders of generations of development.

22:23.620 --> 22:24.620
It's really quite nice.

22:24.620 --> 22:30.380
I had an opportunity recently to deploy one of their GPU systems, 96 gigs of RAM.

22:30.380 --> 22:36.140
It had an RTX 6000 GPU, three times over.

22:36.140 --> 22:42.100
Unbelievable, and it has a 40 gigabit connection to the network.

22:42.100 --> 22:46.620
Their systems are screaming fast, regardless of which build you go with, because they are

22:46.620 --> 22:49.540
their own ISP, so they all have 40 gigabit connections.

22:49.540 --> 22:51.980
They have NVMe PCIe storage.

22:51.980 --> 22:56.260
They have AMD EPYC processors, if you want a rig that has really fast processors.

22:56.260 --> 22:58.500
They have high memory systems.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.300
This is one thing I've never really needed.

23:00.300 --> 23:05.840
I do have a system that does have 96 gigs of RAM, our matrix server, but they have systems

23:05.840 --> 23:10.500
where you can get like, you know, 300 gigs of RAM.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.860
And because Linode has the best support ever, if you've got a question, you get stuck, or

23:13.860 --> 23:16.900
you want to talk about a custom plan, they'll work with you on that as well.

23:16.900 --> 23:20.460
365, they pick up the phone, they answer your questions.

23:20.460 --> 23:24.100
Because again, as a business, they had to survive on the merits of their product, and

23:24.100 --> 23:26.100
support is part of that product.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.220
And it just reflects throughout the entire Linode product.

23:28.220 --> 23:32.540
They have so many great things over there, like object storage, Kubernetes support, databases

23:32.540 --> 23:35.420
as a service, and a lot more.

23:35.420 --> 23:39.160
So go try it out, support the show, and get $100 on a new account.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.260
You go to linode.com slash coder.

23:41.260 --> 23:47.780
One more time, to support the show, it's linode.com slash coder.

23:47.780 --> 23:53.580
So I get the sense you've been deep diving into Swift, but before we get there, I want

23:53.580 --> 23:58.180
to chat about your recent go about with losing a device, and how I think you almost lost

23:58.180 --> 24:02.180
access to everything, at least based on the chat we had.

24:02.180 --> 24:06.760
One way Apple gets device sales is people who are forced to.

24:06.760 --> 24:13.460
My iPhone 12 Pro, whatever it was, had an unfortunate trick-or-treating accident.

24:13.460 --> 24:18.940
So I got it kind of working, but of course, it was shattered.

24:18.940 --> 24:22.020
It stopped working completely.

24:22.020 --> 24:27.820
In the time it was working, I thought it was going to be OK, and I had failed to take off

24:27.820 --> 24:30.020
my Google Authenticator from it.

24:30.020 --> 24:31.020
Oh, yes.

24:31.020 --> 24:32.020
Oh, my gosh.

24:32.020 --> 24:33.020
Yep.

24:33.020 --> 24:34.020
Been there.

24:34.020 --> 24:35.020
Been there.

24:35.020 --> 24:39.740
So OK, I have no phone now, which is super not viable for running a business.

24:39.740 --> 24:45.520
So I march my little butt over to my local Verizon reseller, because for some reason,

24:45.520 --> 24:50.380
you can do Verizon's back to doing the two-year thing, and I've had Verizon for like 10 years.

24:50.380 --> 24:58.780
So I go, I get me a handy new iPhone 14 Pro Max, which I can tell you, if I didn't smash

24:58.780 --> 25:02.920
my 12 Pro, I would not have gotten, because it's just not that different.

25:02.920 --> 25:03.920
It's a little bigger.

25:03.920 --> 25:04.920
It's more purple.

25:04.920 --> 25:10.820
Which I like, but it's not worth what it costs in terms of upgrades.

25:10.820 --> 25:12.660
No wonder the iPhone 14 isn't selling.

25:12.660 --> 25:14.060
Yeah, they say the camera's better.

25:14.060 --> 25:15.060
I can't see it.

25:15.060 --> 25:17.620
That might just be whatever.

25:17.620 --> 25:20.620
I really could not tell much of a difference between the 12, 13, or the 14.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.060
As you know, I'm on the upgrade plan.

25:22.060 --> 25:23.780
I got my 14.

25:23.780 --> 25:24.780
It's fine.

25:24.780 --> 25:30.740
So was the 13, except the device-to-device transfer did not transfer everything like

25:30.740 --> 25:32.360
I had been told it would.

25:32.360 --> 25:35.920
And they've added a new screen after you're done doing device-to-device transfer.

25:35.920 --> 25:40.060
On the original device, your old device, they now come up with a screen that says, would

25:40.060 --> 25:42.340
you like to erase this device?

25:42.340 --> 25:46.520
Because I've been led to believe everything was copied over in a moment of lapse of judgment,

25:46.520 --> 25:48.140
I said, yeah, go ahead and erase it.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.140
Oh, no.

25:49.140 --> 25:53.580
Then the password prompt for my iCloud account came up, and it says, you got to enter your

25:53.580 --> 25:55.220
password before we can erase this device.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.220
And I thought, OK, yeah.

25:56.220 --> 25:59.240
I don't feel like doing that, because I got to go look it up on Bitward, and so I'll let

25:59.240 --> 26:00.840
me log into my new phone.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.740
So I log into the new phone, and I realize it's like doing that download from the app

26:04.740 --> 26:09.100
store and restoring stuff, and I launch a few of my apps, and they have none of my state,

26:09.100 --> 26:10.980
including my two-factor app.

26:10.980 --> 26:13.020
So I pick up the old phone, and I go hit Cancel.

26:13.020 --> 26:18.820
I'm raising my finger to tap the Cancel button, and before I can hit Cancel, the password

26:18.820 --> 26:19.820
screen clears.

26:19.820 --> 26:20.820
Oh, god.

26:20.820 --> 26:22.380
And it begins the wipe process.

26:22.380 --> 26:23.960
Oh, god.

26:23.960 --> 26:24.960
And it wipes my phone.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.260
Oh, so you feel my pain.

26:26.260 --> 26:27.260
Yeah.

26:27.260 --> 26:28.260
So tell me what happened.

26:28.260 --> 26:29.260
All right.

26:29.260 --> 26:31.780
So I'm super, so I get the phone.

26:31.780 --> 26:35.540
I don't know what goes on at the Verizon store, but it always takes an hour and a half to

26:35.540 --> 26:36.540
get out of there.

26:36.540 --> 26:38.780
But sure enough, it took an hour and a half.

26:38.780 --> 26:40.580
I think it's the eSIM.

26:40.580 --> 26:42.560
They just had a hard time activating the phone.

26:42.560 --> 26:47.460
I think they just have a countdown timer on their point-of-sales device, and they just

26:47.460 --> 26:49.900
come up with a reason to keep you there for an hour and a half.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.540
Maybe it's like, baby, get paid by the hour you're there or something.

26:52.540 --> 26:53.540
It was weird.

26:53.540 --> 26:54.540
But so whatever.

26:54.540 --> 26:55.540
I get it.

26:55.540 --> 26:58.540
Then I realized about the Google Authenticator.

26:58.540 --> 26:59.980
So I'm like, crap.

26:59.980 --> 27:03.380
So I'm desperately trying to get my other phone to unlock while I'm sitting there waiting

27:03.380 --> 27:04.380
for this dude.

27:04.380 --> 27:05.380
Won't do it.

27:05.380 --> 27:06.380
Won't turn on nothing.

27:06.380 --> 27:07.380
Dead at DOA.

27:07.380 --> 27:08.380
Gone.

27:08.380 --> 27:11.500
Luckily, I had diligently saved my override codes.

27:11.500 --> 27:14.360
I can't say this is the first time this has happened.

27:14.360 --> 27:20.500
Something like this, especially because I've been using 2FA for a very long time.

27:20.500 --> 27:25.660
On one service that I will not name, I only have two override codes left.

27:25.660 --> 27:32.180
So it got me thinking, after I had spent roughly an entire afternoon unlocking and re-2FAing

27:32.180 --> 27:36.740
everything, what happens if you just run out of override codes?

27:36.740 --> 27:37.820
Do you know what happens?

27:37.820 --> 27:41.060
I would imagine then it's going to depend on what their support policies are.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.260
It's going to be per platform.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.520
With the exception of Facebook.

27:44.520 --> 27:48.620
The only one who will override 2FA for you is Facebook, and they require you to send

27:48.620 --> 27:50.020
them your driver's license.

27:50.020 --> 27:51.620
Yeah, you know, I could see that.

27:51.620 --> 27:54.100
They're probably dealing with boomers all the time that are losing their account.

27:54.100 --> 27:55.100
No offense.

27:55.100 --> 27:57.300
Listen, get off my lawn.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.500
So by the way, we are boomers.

27:59.500 --> 28:02.500
Look at how we bitch about the economy, right?

28:02.500 --> 28:03.660
We're down with it.

28:03.660 --> 28:05.420
I am literally considered a millennial.

28:05.420 --> 28:06.420
Yeah, so am I.

28:06.420 --> 28:07.420
You're on the edge.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.420
I'm on the edge.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.420
I'm on the line.

28:09.420 --> 28:16.380
So it turns out that the answer to my question is, you're hosed.

28:16.380 --> 28:20.700
There is no, for almost every service, there is no way around that.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.260
Yeah, get a new account.

28:22.260 --> 28:23.260
Get a new account.

28:23.260 --> 28:25.980
And in the case of Matrix, message Chris and have him just reset it for you.

28:25.980 --> 28:26.980
Thanks, Chris.

28:26.980 --> 28:27.980
Right?

28:27.980 --> 28:28.980
Thanks, Wes, really.

28:28.980 --> 28:29.980
Thanks, Wes.

28:29.980 --> 28:30.980
I asked Wes.

28:30.980 --> 28:31.980
You asked me.

28:31.980 --> 28:32.980
I asked Wes.

28:32.980 --> 28:37.100
So I have a couple ideas here.

28:37.100 --> 28:41.940
One, what I'm doing now is I got rid of Google Auth completely, and I'm just using my phone

28:41.940 --> 28:42.940
number.

28:42.940 --> 28:43.940
Oh, OK.

28:43.940 --> 28:47.860
Which in itself is problematic, right?

28:47.860 --> 28:49.220
It's not as good.

28:49.220 --> 28:50.220
It's slow.

28:50.220 --> 28:54.940
There's a problem with their Twilio integration, which is probably what most of them are using.

28:54.940 --> 29:00.700
And there's a good amount of documented public hacks where somebody got through because they're

29:00.700 --> 29:01.700
using SMS two-factor.

29:01.700 --> 29:02.700
Well, right.

29:02.700 --> 29:05.420
And it's just SMS, not iMessage.

29:05.420 --> 29:12.300
I propose that as Apple wants to conquer more of the known universe, they should make an

29:12.300 --> 29:20.100
iMessage-specific 2FA system, like a Google Auth that runs through iMessage.

29:20.100 --> 29:24.580
That if you have access, because think about it, Apple has your biometrics, right?

29:24.580 --> 29:28.940
In my case, they have two fingerprints, a couple face scans.

29:28.940 --> 29:33.580
Well, I think they scan your face like every five, 10 minutes, but a bunch of face scans.

29:33.580 --> 29:35.780
I have multiple passwords.

29:35.780 --> 29:37.300
They have my phone.

29:37.300 --> 29:42.460
If you're also wearing the watch, the watch is on you, and they know how close it is to

29:42.460 --> 29:44.820
the phone, which is just another data point.

29:44.820 --> 29:48.620
So why couldn't that be the override?

29:48.620 --> 29:55.420
It seems like a system, and I know some of our InfoSec listeners are going to be, well,

29:55.420 --> 29:57.900
every override is an attack vector.

29:57.900 --> 30:06.580
That's true, but I fear, and I've always pushed 2FA, I just fear that even me, who knows what

30:06.580 --> 30:12.460
he's doing other than destroying his iPhone, people are going to have this experience like

30:12.460 --> 30:18.780
I did, but be a little less savvy and not know how to get around it, or frankly, not

30:18.780 --> 30:24.620
save their override codes, which I think is probably super likely, super common, right?

30:24.620 --> 30:32.260
And they're just going to stop using 2FA altogether, which is a bad idea, to be clear.

30:32.260 --> 30:33.260
So I don't know.

30:33.260 --> 30:34.260
I mean, it was a nightmare.

30:34.260 --> 30:37.020
It wasted most of a day.

30:37.020 --> 30:40.500
Discord was surprisingly hard to recover.

30:40.500 --> 30:43.540
And I only use Discord for Patreon things that I follow.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.820
I don't particularly care for Discord.

30:45.820 --> 30:52.500
If I didn't know better, right, I probably wouldn't have re-enabled 2FA on anything,

30:52.500 --> 30:57.140
because it was such a pain in the ass to get stuff back.

30:57.140 --> 31:00.420
And I think about things like, my Discord is the perfect example.

31:00.420 --> 31:05.620
I support a bunch of things that I follow, like Unfilter, even though Chris won't give

31:05.620 --> 31:09.380
me any new episodes because he doesn't love me anymore.

31:09.380 --> 31:13.260
I can't remember Shannon Morris's channel, a bunch of Magic the Gathering stuff that

31:13.260 --> 31:16.380
you people never want to hear about because you don't love Magic the Gathering like I

31:16.380 --> 31:17.380
do.

31:17.380 --> 31:18.380
Of course.

31:18.380 --> 31:23.620
But I have tons of content that I can only get in that Discord account, right, that I

31:23.620 --> 31:24.620
like to watch.

31:24.620 --> 31:25.620
Right, right.

31:25.620 --> 31:26.620
Yeah.

31:26.620 --> 31:27.620
So what would I have to do?

31:27.620 --> 31:28.620
I thought about it.

31:28.620 --> 31:29.620
So what if it fails?

31:29.620 --> 31:32.340
Okay, well, I have to somehow get a hold of Shannon Morris, who probably has some pretty

31:32.340 --> 31:34.780
aggressive filters, I would assume.

31:34.780 --> 31:36.900
So actually getting in touch would be challenging.

31:36.900 --> 31:42.780
I have to get all these random YouTubers who play Magic, again, who I have a feeling have

31:42.780 --> 31:49.660
some pretty aggressive, you know, filters up, to individually respond to me, believe

31:49.660 --> 31:55.820
me that I am one of the people paying their Patreon, and then somehow let me just give

31:55.820 --> 31:59.140
them another Discord handle that they can give the access to.

31:59.140 --> 32:03.540
There's an entire manual process that I would need about six people to do.

32:03.540 --> 32:07.860
Many of them, I'm pretty sure, never read their DMs, nor should they.

32:07.860 --> 32:11.340
So that would suck.

32:11.340 --> 32:14.900
I imagine this is what life also feels like, say, your Google account gets turned off.

32:14.900 --> 32:15.900
It's a very similar thing.

32:15.900 --> 32:18.300
There's a gentleman we could ask about that from a month ago, right?

32:18.300 --> 32:19.300
Yeah.

32:19.300 --> 32:23.140
And I also use my Google account to authenticate to several services as well outside of that.

32:23.140 --> 32:24.140
Well, I do too.

32:24.140 --> 32:27.860
For all my work stuff, because I use G Suite, it's all Google.

32:27.860 --> 32:31.940
Like I can't use my, if I lost my Google account, I could not use GitHub anymore.

32:31.940 --> 32:34.620
Because I have the SSO thing.

32:34.620 --> 32:38.720
So you know what saved my bacon in this situation, and I'm not necessarily saying you should

32:38.720 --> 32:45.180
do it this way, but what saved my bacon was I use Authy, which syncs your two factors

32:45.180 --> 32:50.740
across your different devices that you have Authy on, and I happen to have it installed

32:50.740 --> 32:53.100
on an M1 Mac Mini desktop.

32:53.100 --> 32:54.540
The M1 saves the day.

32:54.540 --> 32:58.340
So I could do my two factor when I was sitting at that machine from the desktop, and so I

32:58.340 --> 33:03.100
was able to pull it up on that device and then resync my new phone.

33:03.100 --> 33:07.540
But it took me two days before I remembered that because I don't use that Mac Mini very

33:07.540 --> 33:08.540
often.

33:08.540 --> 33:16.580
So I was like for two days, genuinely depressed that I had f that up so badly and that I knew

33:16.580 --> 33:22.020
what a, because everything has two factor and I mean, hundreds of different services

33:22.020 --> 33:25.300
and sites I have just for JB alone, not to mention all my personal stuff.

33:25.300 --> 33:30.180
Like I was mourning the loss of my two factor codes, and then I remembered it was on that

33:30.180 --> 33:31.180
machine.

33:31.180 --> 33:34.500
So having that sync, I don't think it makes it as secure and it makes Authy, you know.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.940
It seems like Authy is the obvious attack factor then.

33:36.940 --> 33:37.940
Yeah.

33:37.940 --> 33:38.940
Right.

33:38.940 --> 33:40.940
Is it syncing the actual generated codes or is it syncing the overwrite?

33:40.940 --> 33:41.940
Yes.

33:41.940 --> 33:42.940
Okay.

33:42.940 --> 33:43.940
That's actually pretty good.

33:43.940 --> 33:46.700
You know, don't do like I do, but that was that worked really well.

33:46.700 --> 33:51.740
Bitwarden can also be a tool in this bitwarden.com slash Linux if you want to support our shows.

33:51.740 --> 33:55.780
This is an awful experience and the other thing that's really challenging here is if

33:55.780 --> 33:59.620
you're trying to go from iPhone to Android, some of the stuff doesn't move over either.

33:59.620 --> 34:00.620
Yeah.

34:00.620 --> 34:04.500
If you're with an all Apple solution, you'd be tied to Apple and they'd have a lock on

34:04.500 --> 34:05.500
that.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.860
So I just, but you wouldn't want Google to do it either.

34:07.860 --> 34:09.900
I wouldn't want any of these major companies to do it.

34:09.900 --> 34:15.780
Well, the problem is if, you know, security now, right, TNO, trust no one, but that includes

34:15.780 --> 34:16.980
yourself.

34:16.980 --> 34:21.720
So if you're doing a true trust no one security set up, it is totally possible to screw yourself

34:21.720 --> 34:22.720
these.

34:22.720 --> 34:27.260
I feel like our rough areas, technology needs to work out and as we have more and more digital

34:27.260 --> 34:31.660
assets that we place value on, this just becomes a bigger and bigger problem.

34:31.660 --> 34:39.520
Like your photos, you know, your email, cryptocurrency, pictures of like JPEG monkeys, I don't know,

34:39.520 --> 34:43.420
like whatever people think is worth something, like you have this problem where if you want

34:43.420 --> 34:49.700
to secure it and protect it, you also make it possible to lose it if you lose access

34:49.700 --> 34:50.700
to it.

34:50.700 --> 34:53.820
It's a genuine problem that humanity really hasn't fully sorted out.

34:53.820 --> 34:57.780
We don't have photo albums like we used to just, you know, we don't have that anymore.

34:57.780 --> 34:58.780
It's all on the computer.

34:58.780 --> 34:59.780
It's all digital now.

34:59.780 --> 35:01.340
Yeah, it's all digital now.

35:01.340 --> 35:02.340
Figure it out.

35:02.340 --> 35:04.820
For some reason I thought you ended up on an Android device during all this.

35:04.820 --> 35:08.040
I briefly was using a pixel test device that I have.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.260
What era of pixel?

35:09.260 --> 35:12.100
Pixel 3, 4, no, pixel 4a.

35:12.100 --> 35:13.100
Okay.

35:13.100 --> 35:14.100
Okay.

35:14.100 --> 35:17.220
Yeah, I have a 3 and that's getting pretty long in the tooth.

35:17.220 --> 35:18.220
It was pretty slow.

35:18.220 --> 35:22.860
Like I tried, I bought a couple like games to try on it, just to see how it ran.

35:22.860 --> 35:27.660
It was pretty, if I was to stick with Android, I might have to get a new one.

35:27.660 --> 35:28.660
But you just got out of there.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.140
You just were like, no way.

35:30.140 --> 35:35.540
Well, so this is unrelated, but turns out all my contacts are in iCloud.

35:35.540 --> 35:36.540
Oh yeah.

35:36.540 --> 35:37.540
Yeah.

35:37.540 --> 35:39.380
So like I had to ask my wife for her phone number.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.100
Yeah, I would have to as well.

35:41.100 --> 35:42.100
Yeah.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.140
I was just thinking the other day I should memorize that.

35:44.140 --> 35:45.140
Yeah.

35:45.140 --> 35:48.500
I did a little bender on Android about a month ago.

35:48.500 --> 35:52.380
I went with Graphene OS and my whole thing was not to use Google services.

35:52.380 --> 35:53.900
So I had the same problem with contacts.

35:53.900 --> 35:58.100
I'm like, what the hell do I do for my contacts in my calendar?

35:58.100 --> 36:01.720
And I'm not saying this is what everybody could do, but I have the option and I did

36:01.720 --> 36:07.640
this is I was able to put a little wedge in there basically that lets me send all that

36:07.640 --> 36:09.340
to Nextcloud.

36:09.340 --> 36:13.620
So I became my own contacts in calendar sync point.

36:13.620 --> 36:15.240
And then I had that available in Nextcloud as well.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.240
That was really nice.

36:16.240 --> 36:20.820
I had to roll that whole solution myself, including unlock the phone, reflash it with

36:20.820 --> 36:23.180
ADB, set up, you know, find this app.

36:23.180 --> 36:26.040
Thanks to Jeff who gave me an idea where to find it, get this app so I could actually

36:26.040 --> 36:28.020
sync to Nextcloud, get all that configured.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.340
I already had Nextcloud set right.

36:29.340 --> 36:31.540
Like it was just this massive amount of work.

36:31.540 --> 36:37.000
If you were starting from square one, I was starting from like square three, but it was

36:37.000 --> 36:43.300
possible on a modern ish Android device to have a clean Android install with no attachment

36:43.300 --> 36:46.460
to Google and still have like cloud syncing stuff.

36:46.460 --> 36:47.460
If you want to build it.

36:47.460 --> 36:48.460
Yeah.

36:48.460 --> 36:49.460
But do you want to build it?

36:49.460 --> 36:51.300
I guess some people do.

36:51.300 --> 36:53.100
It depends on how bad it gets, I suppose.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.100
Yeah.

36:54.100 --> 36:55.100
All right.

36:55.100 --> 36:56.100
We've been teasing it.

36:56.100 --> 36:59.320
You got you got into like the Swift again, something you smell a little swifty.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.820
Maybe that's the Swift UI that's extra ripe.

37:00.820 --> 37:01.820
I'm not sure.

37:01.820 --> 37:02.820
But I think you've been doing a deep dive.

37:02.820 --> 37:06.780
Yeah, I I've been playing around with Swift again for a while.

37:06.780 --> 37:07.780
It doesn't matter.

37:07.780 --> 37:08.780
He's six.

37:08.780 --> 37:09.780
He doesn't listen to the show.

37:09.780 --> 37:14.660
I was giving my kid for Christmas a Pokemon, a digital Pokemon trading card binder in Swift.

37:14.660 --> 37:18.460
Yeah, I might throw it on the app store because people always ask, do you have anything on

37:18.460 --> 37:19.460
the app store?

37:19.460 --> 37:22.420
But I figured if I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it right.

37:22.420 --> 37:28.500
So it's using the latest, the greatest version of Swift, which I think is five point seven

37:28.500 --> 37:31.860
because I didn't put that in my notes.

37:31.860 --> 37:32.860
Pure Swift UI.

37:32.860 --> 37:40.900
None of my safe space of, you know, interface builder or her good old UI view or any storyboards,

37:40.900 --> 37:41.900
anything like that.

37:41.900 --> 37:48.020
I'm doing I'm using the relatively new async await features in Swift.

37:48.020 --> 37:52.460
And and this is what I think is the interesting part.

37:52.460 --> 37:59.580
I'm actually doing de-serialization the Swift way, not the Objective C way, which is just

37:59.580 --> 38:03.340
doing it by hand.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.140
Where to begin?

38:05.140 --> 38:09.060
Xcode always has the best error messages.

38:09.060 --> 38:15.700
This is something other IDEs need to think about because at one point I opened Xcode.

38:15.700 --> 38:17.180
It's like I can't open this project.

38:17.180 --> 38:18.180
It's from the future.

38:18.180 --> 38:19.260
Closed it, open it again.

38:19.260 --> 38:20.260
It opened it.

38:20.260 --> 38:21.260
Fine.

38:21.260 --> 38:22.260
Incredible.

38:22.260 --> 38:23.260
Good stuff.

38:23.260 --> 38:24.260
Like Doctor Who.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.260
I crossed my own timeline.

38:25.260 --> 38:26.260
Amazing.

38:26.260 --> 38:27.260
Yeah, nicely done.

38:27.260 --> 38:29.860
It is far more stable than it used to be.

38:29.860 --> 38:30.860
All right.

38:30.860 --> 38:31.860
That's good.

38:31.860 --> 38:38.540
Still, Swift UI, I don't know how much RAM you need, but it wants all of it, all the

38:38.540 --> 38:42.100
RAM in terms of the preview view.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.220
But it's still pretty nice.

38:43.220 --> 38:46.220
Just kind of laggy, kind of slow, whatever.

38:46.220 --> 38:53.180
My first takes working in it were, so Apple just sat back, watched like the whole Angular

38:53.180 --> 38:56.300
React thing happen and was like, we're going to do this, but we're going to make it better

38:56.300 --> 39:00.940
because we're Apple and we only care about one platform.

39:00.940 --> 39:02.660
Cool.

39:02.660 --> 39:09.500
This one class, async image, which you can put on any Swift UI major components like

39:09.500 --> 39:11.420
a V stack or an H stack.

39:11.420 --> 39:14.380
Those are a vertical stack and horizontal stack, respectively.

39:14.380 --> 39:18.060
I had to write a whole library to do this in old iOS.

39:18.060 --> 39:20.940
And the this is, you have a view.

39:20.940 --> 39:23.100
You have a URL to an image.

39:23.100 --> 39:27.460
You want that image to load asynchronously and show a progress bar and not block the

39:27.460 --> 39:28.460
UI.

39:28.460 --> 39:34.900
It is one line of code in Swift UI and the performance is really good.

39:34.900 --> 39:35.900
That sounds nice.

39:35.900 --> 39:36.900
It is super nice.

39:36.900 --> 39:42.380
I mean, I'm super jelly of the new iOS developers because this is easy mode.

39:42.380 --> 39:49.500
Async and Swift, it's like they took async in Python, but married it to the bitchiness

39:49.500 --> 39:50.500
of Rust.

39:50.500 --> 39:51.500
Okay.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.420
We've got a lot of try catching going on.

39:53.420 --> 39:56.620
I mean, it demands.

39:56.620 --> 40:00.460
So this is something I guess I had forgotten about Swift.

40:00.460 --> 40:05.140
Unless you slap those exclamation points everywhere, which is the rough equivalent to slapping

40:05.140 --> 40:07.860
unsafe everywhere in Rust.

40:07.860 --> 40:10.900
It makes you catch everything.

40:10.900 --> 40:15.060
But you know, and by the way, this is coming to C sharp as the default now and the dot

40:15.060 --> 40:16.060
net.

40:16.060 --> 40:18.180
I think it just came in six and seven comes out soon, too.

40:18.180 --> 40:19.180
So enjoy.

40:19.180 --> 40:22.980
You could have question marks everywhere and exclamation points.

40:22.980 --> 40:23.980
Beautiful.

40:23.980 --> 40:28.940
I actually think it is beautiful because I'm catching stuff at compile time that basically

40:28.940 --> 40:34.140
once I get the damn view to be buildable, it pretty much works.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.140
Yeah, fair enough.

40:35.140 --> 40:36.140
Might as well catch it then.

40:36.140 --> 40:37.140
Yeah.

40:37.140 --> 40:41.820
So far, device scaling Swift UI, I think does a fair job of being device agnostic with the

40:41.820 --> 40:46.300
big caveat of I have not yet decided to try it out on landscape.

40:46.300 --> 40:48.460
Things that I don't like.

40:48.460 --> 40:49.740
I get it.

40:49.740 --> 40:51.300
And I have this problem with Rust, too.

40:51.300 --> 40:54.540
I get that you want to be absolutely correct.

40:54.540 --> 41:00.580
But you know, sometimes it's weird, like the Xcode makes you feel just like Rust does.

41:00.580 --> 41:07.100
It makes you feel dirty when you're like overriding its warnings or it's, you know, checking stuff.

41:07.100 --> 41:11.860
A lot of it's just feels unnecessary.

41:11.860 --> 41:17.340
I know I've read the forums, I've read the subreddit, I may have posted on Reddit and

41:17.340 --> 41:22.820
gotten yelled at by the Swift people that, you know, things should be safe, you need

41:22.820 --> 41:25.380
to know the types, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

41:25.380 --> 41:26.380
Fair enough.

41:26.380 --> 41:28.180
I've been doing too much Python.

41:28.180 --> 41:34.940
It is very clear to me, and I'm not sure that maybe this isn't bad, but that Apple is going

41:34.940 --> 41:37.500
to shove Swift UI down your throat.

41:37.500 --> 41:44.220
So if you're clinging to, you know, storyboards or it's probably only storyboards at this

41:44.220 --> 41:48.420
point, right, unless you're doing, I guess you could do individual nibs, but I think

41:48.420 --> 41:49.660
you need to change.

41:49.660 --> 41:55.620
I wrote a couple, about a year and a half ago, a blog post on bringing over zibs, which

41:55.620 --> 42:02.140
they're called nibs, by the way, from UI kit into Swift UI.

42:02.140 --> 42:05.340
I almost think that's basically misguided now.

42:05.340 --> 42:13.260
And it's in this weird transitional state of so far, if you stick to just the, it's

42:13.260 --> 42:18.420
not, it's unfair to credit slash blame him, but like the Marco Arment style of app development

42:18.420 --> 42:23.020
where you're basically just using Apple's components with very little styling, then

42:23.020 --> 42:26.100
Swift UI is super fast, super efficient.

42:26.100 --> 42:31.300
The minute you want to go a little custom, things get rougher and it's tempting to drop

42:31.300 --> 42:37.660
to UI view, because you can wrap it in a Swift UI component, but I, having tried it both

42:37.660 --> 42:46.100
ways, I almost think it's one, a matter of time before Apple just, you know, makes it

42:46.100 --> 42:47.100
more robust, right?

42:47.100 --> 42:49.380
You get more robust controls out of the box.

42:49.380 --> 42:50.380
You would hope so.

42:50.380 --> 42:53.980
Well, from when I tried it last time to where it is now, they have, right?

42:53.980 --> 42:57.260
They totally have, you know, WWDCs in June.

42:57.260 --> 42:58.260
Yeah.

42:58.260 --> 42:59.780
If they're trending in the right direction, that's a good sign.

42:59.780 --> 43:00.780
Yeah.

43:00.780 --> 43:09.060
But the point being, I think it's almost misguided to not just embrace the glory that is Swift

43:09.060 --> 43:10.060
UI.

43:10.060 --> 43:11.900
And I know I like T-Swift.

43:11.900 --> 43:12.900
This is really good.

43:12.900 --> 43:19.260
I mean, working on this Pokemon project, I'm like super missing iOS dev.

43:19.260 --> 43:25.660
And I do some for clients, the, we have an app from 2010 that is written in no memory

43:25.660 --> 43:28.860
managed objective C, but that's more archeology at this point.

43:28.860 --> 43:30.460
It's not like new dev.

43:30.460 --> 43:32.700
This is like fun to work in.

43:32.700 --> 43:39.820
In particular, you can monitor your app's health and tail scale.

43:39.820 --> 43:42.140
Tailscale.com slash coder.

43:42.140 --> 43:46.900
That's where you go to try it for free for up to 20 devices and experience the best mesh

43:46.900 --> 43:49.620
VPN you've ever, ever tried to set up.

43:49.620 --> 43:53.460
You get it going in like, probably two minutes on a device.

43:53.460 --> 43:55.840
If not that I, I'm not even kidding you.

43:55.840 --> 44:00.700
It takes me 30 seconds to get a system on my tail scale VPN mesh network, and it's all

44:00.700 --> 44:05.740
protected by wire guards, noise protocol, the encryption is solid.

44:05.740 --> 44:09.700
And the other thing is the performance is incredible and the system is smart enough

44:09.700 --> 44:12.460
to know if you're trying to communicate with your tail scale network, or if you're trying

44:12.460 --> 44:16.220
to communicate with a general internet or something on your land, it's also smart enough

44:16.220 --> 44:20.180
to figure out that if you're talking to another tail scale device on your land, it'll just

44:20.180 --> 44:21.180
stay on the land.

44:21.180 --> 44:23.220
It doesn't rat out to the internet and come back in.

44:23.220 --> 44:29.060
We had huge storms here in the Pacific Northwest this last weekend, 70 mile per hour winds.

44:29.060 --> 44:31.320
Power got knocked out at the studio.

44:31.320 --> 44:34.740
And one of the things that I love is in the tail scale dashboard, I can see the last time

44:34.740 --> 44:36.580
a node was online.

44:36.580 --> 44:38.560
So I knew exactly when the power went out at the studio.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.060
So I knew how long things were down.

44:40.060 --> 44:41.060
I set up a ping.

44:41.060 --> 44:44.360
I just started pinging the tail scale IP of one of the devices here.

44:44.360 --> 44:47.580
And sure enough, it came back online when the power came up and I knew to come down

44:47.580 --> 44:50.740
and fix everything because it was a bad one.

44:50.740 --> 44:54.980
I just love that flexibility tail scale gives me to just, you know, I can use it in so many

44:54.980 --> 45:00.620
different ways, but the thing that really became handy was, this is my bad, but more

45:00.620 --> 45:04.840
systems were using DHCP than probably should have.

45:04.840 --> 45:10.460
So a bunch of my boxes got new IP addresses and like my node for Bitcoin and where I checked

45:10.460 --> 45:16.020
the boost, but also some studio systems, but their tail scale IP stayed the same.

45:16.020 --> 45:17.480
Same tail scale IP.

45:17.480 --> 45:18.480
So I was like, oh yeah, wait a minute.

45:18.480 --> 45:22.340
I can just connect to the tail scale IP and I'm fine.

45:22.340 --> 45:25.060
It just was like, wow, this is even on my land.

45:25.060 --> 45:27.360
This is just so freaking great.

45:27.360 --> 45:31.260
And tail scale SIN is like airdrop for all my devices, including my Linux boxes and my

45:31.260 --> 45:32.620
mobile devices.

45:32.620 --> 45:35.440
And tail scale SSH is absolute fire.

45:35.440 --> 45:39.940
You can log into your system using tail scale through SSH, it's absolute by you're going

45:39.940 --> 45:40.940
to love it.

45:40.940 --> 45:42.300
There's so many great things.

45:42.300 --> 45:46.120
And they've recently made DNS even better than ever on the tail scale network.

45:46.120 --> 45:50.560
So go try it for yourself for free for up to 20 machines and support the show by going

45:50.560 --> 45:53.160
to tailscale.com slash coder.

45:53.160 --> 45:54.940
I think this is going to blow you away.

45:54.940 --> 45:58.180
You're going to wonder why you hadn't tried it sooner.

45:58.180 --> 46:01.660
tailscale.com slash coder.

46:01.660 --> 46:02.660
Now that's not all.

46:02.660 --> 46:09.100
I know you had a continuing journey and have discovered strong opinions, some pushback

46:09.100 --> 46:10.900
and perhaps even a few demons.

46:10.900 --> 46:11.900
Yeah.

46:11.900 --> 46:13.660
So this, this is actually really cool.

46:13.660 --> 46:19.740
So I said I did the JSON deserialization for my Pokemon card structs the way that Swift

46:19.740 --> 46:25.340
wants you to not the old Objective C way of like just passing in an NS dictionary and,

46:25.340 --> 46:28.140
you know, manually parsing the keys, right?

46:28.140 --> 46:32.420
And yes, kids, that is how we used to do an Objective C. Yes, I know it's bad.

46:32.420 --> 46:36.340
You guys have no freaking idea how easy you have it.

46:36.340 --> 46:37.500
So I don't want to hear about it.

46:37.500 --> 46:38.500
Go to your room.

46:38.500 --> 46:39.500
Okay.

46:39.500 --> 46:40.500
Is he in his room?

46:40.500 --> 46:41.500
Good.

46:41.500 --> 46:43.660
We're going to call him just some like 13 year old developer and just yell at him.

46:43.660 --> 46:44.660
That's what we do on the show now.

46:44.660 --> 46:47.620
We're going to call him Tim and we're just going to yell at him all day long.

46:47.620 --> 46:48.620
Dang it, Tim.

46:48.620 --> 46:50.180
You are disappointing us.

46:50.180 --> 46:53.820
Tim, what, what do you mean Java?

46:53.820 --> 46:54.820
Java has functions.

46:54.820 --> 46:55.820
That doesn't have functions.

46:55.820 --> 46:56.820
Everything's like objects.

46:56.820 --> 46:57.820
Java one.

46:57.820 --> 46:58.880
That's all you get.

46:58.880 --> 47:01.100
How do you not know who Duke is?

47:01.100 --> 47:02.660
Go read Wikipedia.

47:02.660 --> 47:03.660
Go to your room.

47:03.660 --> 47:07.260
Then the problem is me and Chris go to the bar and we get Ubered home because we're crying

47:07.260 --> 47:12.740
about somebody named Scott McNeely and son and the 20 year old bartender has no idea

47:12.740 --> 47:15.660
what's wrong with these two old dudes, but she wants them away.

47:15.660 --> 47:19.460
At poor little Tim, he's just looking at his Coda radio dads and he's just wondering why

47:19.460 --> 47:21.700
do they always cry when son comes up?

47:21.700 --> 47:24.260
I don't understand what's wrong about the son.

47:24.260 --> 47:29.820
Every day at sunset, we just sit on the, on the veranda drinks in hand, tears streaming,

47:29.820 --> 47:30.820
openly weeping.

47:30.820 --> 47:32.900
I mean, it's really terrible.

47:32.900 --> 47:34.340
But things that make us happy.

47:34.340 --> 47:39.780
The codable protocol and Swift, first of all, if you're going to name protocols, I love

47:39.780 --> 47:40.780
this thing.

47:40.780 --> 47:41.780
Yeah.

47:41.780 --> 47:43.820
In fact, Swift, you guys get a robe.

47:43.820 --> 47:44.820
This is robe worthy.

47:44.820 --> 47:45.820
Yeah.

47:45.820 --> 47:46.820
This is better than coderly.

47:46.820 --> 47:47.820
Ooh, painful.

47:47.820 --> 47:48.820
We got to do that.

47:48.820 --> 47:49.820
It's codable.

47:49.820 --> 47:50.820
I know.

47:50.820 --> 47:51.820
I know.

47:51.820 --> 47:52.820
I know.

47:52.820 --> 47:54.580
So I linked the documentation.

47:54.580 --> 48:01.700
It's so baller that it's really a type alias for two protocols, not one decodable, which

48:01.700 --> 48:07.340
does exactly what it sounds like to codes, a Jason object into your class, an instance

48:07.340 --> 48:13.300
of your class, or I'm sorry, struct encodable, which does the opposite encode your, you know,

48:13.300 --> 48:22.580
your data type into Jason and now it has some opinions on how the Jason should look, but,

48:22.580 --> 48:25.220
and this is what saved my butt.

48:25.220 --> 48:30.900
It is possible to do custom decoding and still keep all the other benefits.

48:30.900 --> 48:35.980
So if you have one, let's say easy example, you have like one type that's like a weird

48:35.980 --> 48:36.980
type of Jason.

48:36.980 --> 48:41.260
It's some kind of weird like string that they encoded instead of using a real data type.

48:41.260 --> 48:45.660
You can just have like a custom function that decodes that as long as it decodes back to

48:45.660 --> 48:48.020
one of the basic Swift types.

48:48.020 --> 48:49.020
Hmm.

48:49.020 --> 48:50.020
That's handy.

48:50.020 --> 48:51.020
Right.

48:51.020 --> 48:55.020
But if it is a, if it's an easy map, so like a Jason array to a Swift array, it just does

48:55.020 --> 48:56.020
it.

48:56.020 --> 48:57.400
You just tell it it's an array and it does it.

48:57.400 --> 49:00.540
So you don't have to follow its specific output that it requires.

49:00.540 --> 49:02.380
You can, there's room for fudging it.

49:02.380 --> 49:07.820
It expects camel casing, but if you don't have camel casing, you can tell it that it's,

49:07.820 --> 49:11.500
it actually has built in enums for like other crazy casing, like snake casing.

49:11.500 --> 49:12.500
Well, good.

49:12.500 --> 49:13.780
I'm glad you're not compromising on this.

49:13.780 --> 49:15.860
Well, no, I like my snake casing.

49:15.860 --> 49:16.860
Okay, good.

49:16.860 --> 49:18.940
I'm glad it accommodates you.

49:18.940 --> 49:20.340
What's wrong with snake casing?

49:20.340 --> 49:21.340
Nothing.

49:21.340 --> 49:22.340
Nothing.

49:22.340 --> 49:23.340
Hmm.

49:23.340 --> 49:24.340
Sensing a disturbance.

49:24.340 --> 49:28.500
I just, what I find quite humorous is you going out of your way to just not have to

49:28.500 --> 49:29.500
change.

49:29.500 --> 49:34.220
Like I would just be like, okay, machine, all right, I'll do it your way.

49:34.220 --> 49:35.220
You're like, no, let's see if there's a.

49:35.220 --> 49:36.740
It's not my API though.

49:36.740 --> 49:37.740
I don't control the JSON.

49:37.740 --> 49:38.740
Oh, that's fair.

49:38.740 --> 49:39.740
Yeah, fair.

49:39.740 --> 49:40.740
Right.

49:40.740 --> 49:41.740
You're not, yeah, you're not necessarily controlling the input.

49:41.740 --> 49:42.740
Yeah.

49:42.740 --> 49:43.740
I suppose that's fair.

49:43.740 --> 49:46.820
To be fair, the API I'm using is camel cased and I did have it hit one of mine that's snake

49:46.820 --> 49:49.980
cased and you know what snake casing is the right casing.

49:49.980 --> 49:53.740
Although my Swift code, I am, I am being a proper Swift developer and doing it camel

49:53.740 --> 49:54.740
case.

49:54.740 --> 49:55.740
So there you go.

49:55.740 --> 49:58.380
I hear it tastes like chicken.

49:58.380 --> 50:00.620
It tastes like a, it does taste like chicken as a bird.

50:00.620 --> 50:05.940
I thought for, I think chicken, I think like Raptors great grandson now and I'm very scared.

50:05.940 --> 50:06.940
I had hot wings.

50:06.940 --> 50:09.660
I'm like when the dinosaurs come back, they're going to be so pissed at me.

50:09.660 --> 50:11.520
You could just look at them and kind of see it, right?

50:11.520 --> 50:12.800
You can just see it.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.380
It's surprisingly fast.

50:15.380 --> 50:20.860
It can even handle cases where you can do the question mark thing and say it's an optional.

50:20.860 --> 50:23.220
And if it's not there, it just accepts it.

50:23.220 --> 50:30.980
You can nest different codable or decodable types within a kind of a overarching type.

50:30.980 --> 50:35.220
So for instance, I have a card result type, which in it has a card and in that has the

50:35.220 --> 50:37.660
card has a set so it can decode the set.

50:37.660 --> 50:40.300
And within that you have like all kinds of crap, right?

50:40.300 --> 50:43.940
Like Pokemon attacks, blah, blah, blah.

50:43.940 --> 50:48.060
Now I know the.net developers are like, we have this too.

50:48.060 --> 50:49.060
You do.

50:49.060 --> 50:54.340
It does it a lot better because I think what they did is just rob your ass.

50:54.340 --> 50:59.420
I'm feeling a lot of the Swift stuff is just ripping off good ideas from other places.

50:59.420 --> 51:01.140
It's like we have the strictness of RASP.

51:01.140 --> 51:04.340
You can throw an exclamation point in there if you don't want to listen.

51:04.340 --> 51:08.100
And here's all the.net MVVM kind of stuff.

51:08.100 --> 51:15.060
But we're going to make it a lot simpler and a little, you know, more I want to say forgiving.

51:15.060 --> 51:21.740
I wouldn't say that, but more almost like you can Voltron up your own.

51:21.740 --> 51:27.460
You can more easily than I found in.net Voltron up your own custom.

51:27.460 --> 51:28.980
Whatever data structure you need, right?

51:28.980 --> 51:31.900
It seems like a good strategy on their part that actually does.

51:31.900 --> 51:32.900
Why not look?

51:32.900 --> 51:35.580
Why not see what others are doing like.net in this case?

51:35.580 --> 51:36.580
For sure.

51:36.580 --> 51:37.580
Yeah, good strategy.

51:37.580 --> 51:44.460
Yeah, I would say the closest analogy is probably like a couple of who I think is a Klingon.

51:44.460 --> 51:46.560
Swift does something similar, which I think is ironic.

51:46.560 --> 51:49.220
Also Microsoft who ripped off C Sharp their own thing.

51:49.220 --> 51:53.540
So I feel like C Sharp being early with the stuff kind of.

51:53.540 --> 51:56.060
You know, it's got some baggage.

51:56.060 --> 51:59.240
So I'm going to go on a limb here.

51:59.240 --> 52:00.240
Swift is enjoyable.

52:00.240 --> 52:03.180
Just think if I had a time machine right now.

52:03.180 --> 52:04.180
Don't worry, Alex.

52:04.180 --> 52:05.180
Alex will find it.

52:05.180 --> 52:07.220
I have perfect faith in him.

52:07.220 --> 52:08.340
I think he's kind of been.

52:08.340 --> 52:09.460
He's kind of moved past it by now.

52:09.460 --> 52:10.460
He's like a 200 now.

52:10.460 --> 52:11.460
Yeah, he's in the.

52:11.460 --> 52:12.460
I can't believe he's I can't believe you.

52:12.460 --> 52:15.300
It was 2016, I know it was one ninety something.

52:15.300 --> 52:16.300
OK, OK.

52:16.300 --> 52:22.180
It was such a wild episode for me on my end where you rage quit in the middle of the show

52:22.180 --> 52:27.660
because so short version is we were doing the Apple event live and now it's Swift and

52:27.660 --> 52:31.940
then we go to record the show to get the reaction and Mike's reaction is just rage on bridled

52:31.940 --> 52:32.940
rage.

52:32.940 --> 52:37.100
And then he leaves the show and I'm like, all right, well, thanks for coming, everybody.

52:37.100 --> 52:38.700
It's like a twenty five minute show.

52:38.700 --> 52:40.460
Yet one of our most listened to shows.

52:40.460 --> 52:44.340
I just I'm pretty sure I keep people keep sending me stuff about it.

52:44.340 --> 52:47.300
I feel like.

52:47.300 --> 52:50.300
Swift has made a big journey since that episode.

52:50.300 --> 52:54.220
Oh, it's a I would argue it's a completely different language to like even from where

52:54.220 --> 52:58.380
Swift one point started to Swift five point seven.

52:58.380 --> 53:01.380
I'd say it's more like rust than anything else.

53:01.380 --> 53:03.980
I think it's been trending this way because it seems like each time we check in, you're

53:03.980 --> 53:05.180
like, OK, this is getting better.

53:05.180 --> 53:06.180
I like this.

53:06.180 --> 53:08.060
This is getting a little you know, I like where they're going here.

53:08.060 --> 53:12.300
So it sounds like this is it's really starting to come together for you.

53:12.300 --> 53:13.300
Codable protocol.

53:13.300 --> 53:14.300
I like it.

53:14.300 --> 53:20.560
I mean, I kind of wish Apple wasn't so vampiric with the App Store, but, you know, I since

53:20.560 --> 53:25.980
I'm doing this Pokemon card thing anyway for the kid, I may as well throw it on there and

53:25.980 --> 53:30.100
charge ninety nine cents, which guarantees I will get one download or you can make it

53:30.100 --> 53:34.460
free and do a nine dollar in app purchase for something really basic.

53:34.460 --> 53:37.980
You know, and then Apple will spotlight it because it's free.

53:37.980 --> 53:44.660
Just not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

53:44.660 --> 53:47.860
We got a ton of great support for last week's episode.

53:47.860 --> 53:48.860
Thank you, everybody.

53:48.860 --> 53:54.260
Zurno boosted in with twenty nine thousand nine hundred sats.

53:54.260 --> 53:56.420
Keep the change, you filthy animal.

53:56.420 --> 54:00.740
It was spread across a couple of boosts because he was bailing out of Breeze.

54:00.740 --> 54:04.060
I've also sort of stopped using Breeze myself.

54:04.060 --> 54:07.320
Fountain has done recent updates and they've added CarPlay support and they just did an

54:07.320 --> 54:10.860
update yesterday to fix a couple of stability issues.

54:10.860 --> 54:13.940
I got to say, I'm still I'm really liking Fountain Podverse.

54:13.940 --> 54:19.260
But Zurno says, OK, Mike, every time you say GitHub Copilot produces terrible code, I wonder

54:19.260 --> 54:22.980
I've heard on other podcasts that it seems to produce code based on the user's previous

54:22.980 --> 54:23.980
work.

54:23.980 --> 54:27.760
Does this mean your repository is filled with bad code?

54:27.760 --> 54:29.180
That's not quite how it works, right?

54:29.180 --> 54:30.780
It doesn't just go on your code alone.

54:30.780 --> 54:32.020
No, it doesn't.

54:32.020 --> 54:33.460
And I would even challenge firms.

54:33.460 --> 54:35.340
I don't say it only produces terrible code.

54:35.340 --> 54:40.620
I would say that when it produces bad code, it's really funny, but it it doesn't produce

54:40.620 --> 54:41.620
bad code.

54:41.620 --> 54:42.620
Right.

54:42.620 --> 54:49.860
Like if you're for example, if you're just doing a jQuery form or a Python WTF form,

54:49.860 --> 54:52.300
it will do that and it will be fine.

54:52.300 --> 54:53.300
Right.

54:53.300 --> 54:55.900
It'll do it in context and it it'll scan.

54:55.900 --> 54:59.780
I think it scans a collection per language.

54:59.780 --> 55:01.340
I think it's actually per platform, too.

55:01.340 --> 55:08.380
It can tell like if you're doing flask or fast API, for example, or rails, it will produce

55:08.380 --> 55:11.340
code for, I don't know, most common cases.

55:11.340 --> 55:16.660
I don't think it's all terrible, but how valuable is someone generating a form for me that I've

55:16.660 --> 55:18.420
written 400 times?

55:18.420 --> 55:22.420
GitHub says on their site, languages with less representation in public repositories

55:22.420 --> 55:26.760
may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

55:26.760 --> 55:32.180
But they say, for example, JavaScript is well represented in public repositories and is

55:32.180 --> 55:36.620
one of GitHub Copilot's best supported languages because there's so many examples of it.

55:36.620 --> 55:38.400
So you can kind of imagine how that would probably work.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.780
The more there is of something, the more source it has.

55:40.780 --> 55:44.780
Also on the topic of Copilot, a lawsuit has been filed.

55:44.780 --> 55:45.780
Oh, Lord.

55:45.780 --> 55:49.460
It's basically along the lines of what we've talked about, a class action lawsuit in a

55:49.460 --> 55:51.680
U.S. federal court in San Francisco.

55:51.680 --> 55:53.260
You know the details and we'll follow it.

55:53.260 --> 55:56.180
We'll follow it quietly and we'll update everybody if there's anything worth really discussing

55:56.180 --> 55:57.180
there.

55:57.180 --> 55:59.500
But I think it's interesting that that process has now kicked off.

55:59.500 --> 56:03.660
It's probably wasn't and we probably should have, we probably could have had a bet on when

56:03.660 --> 56:04.660
it would happen, not if.

56:04.660 --> 56:06.060
Yeah, I have a little fascinating thought.

56:06.060 --> 56:08.500
I mean, I still hold what I said a couple of weeks ago.

56:08.500 --> 56:15.580
It would be a shame if legal chicanery got rid of Copilot.

56:15.580 --> 56:19.340
Maybe not get, you know, the idea of a Copilot like tool, right?

56:19.340 --> 56:23.500
It's funny because from the first, from Zerno's message, I would actually prefer to be able

56:23.500 --> 56:27.220
to tell Copilot only to look at my repositories because then I could actually use it on client

56:27.220 --> 56:28.220
work.

56:28.220 --> 56:32.100
I think you can with like the private version for Visual Studio, but I'm not sure.

56:32.100 --> 56:34.180
Isn't there some way to do that privately?

56:34.180 --> 56:35.180
There is some way.

56:35.180 --> 56:36.180
Maybe there is.

56:36.180 --> 56:37.860
I just turn it off when I'm not working on my own thing, so.

56:37.860 --> 56:43.620
I would, you know, if I was going to be selfish, if I knew I could go use Copilot and it would

56:43.620 --> 56:48.620
be a pretty good aid and if there was a way I could somehow trust its results, maybe I

56:48.620 --> 56:50.700
could just do that through peer review.

56:50.700 --> 56:55.860
I'd probably be more inclined to write my own stuff and do my own like little side projects

56:55.860 --> 56:57.860
if I knew it was actually going to be a good guide.

56:57.860 --> 57:04.780
If you're writing like a very mainstream, you know, node with an Angular front end or

57:04.780 --> 57:11.160
node with a React front end, there's just a ton of examples that Copilot can pull from.

57:11.160 --> 57:14.540
It's when you get more domain specific, you're going to, yeah.

57:14.540 --> 57:15.540
Which I probably would.

57:15.540 --> 57:16.540
Yeah.

57:16.540 --> 57:17.540
Yeah.

57:17.540 --> 57:23.620
All right, Nomadic Coder 5 boosted with 5,555 SATs.

57:23.620 --> 57:28.060
I recently started using my iPod Touch just to listen to podcasts and music, but with

57:28.060 --> 57:31.660
Apple's latest money grab, I'll have to switch to Fountain on my Calix OS phone in case Apple

57:31.660 --> 57:33.700
starts taxing boosts.

57:33.700 --> 57:37.160
With every announcement Apple does, something that drives me further and further away seems

57:37.160 --> 57:39.380
like it drives me further and further away from them.

57:39.380 --> 57:40.380
I agree.

57:40.380 --> 57:46.260
Yeah, they are going after like in-app advertising, although with like Fountain you don't buy

57:46.260 --> 57:49.940
the SATs, so there's no transaction happening, thankfully.

57:49.940 --> 57:50.940
That's why.

57:50.940 --> 57:51.940
They know.

57:51.940 --> 57:56.620
I've talked to the folks behind both Fountain and Podverse and they're very much aware of

57:56.620 --> 57:58.860
Apple's shenanigans.

57:58.860 --> 58:00.900
They're very careful.

58:00.900 --> 58:03.340
They try not to even play in the gray zone.

58:03.340 --> 58:04.340
They go by the letter of the law.

58:04.340 --> 58:07.740
No, I got to say, like if you're doing an iOS app, I've learned this for many years

58:07.740 --> 58:11.500
of complaining about it on this show, don't even go in.

58:11.500 --> 58:13.740
It's like the neutral zone with the Romulans.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.780
Don't just stay the hell out.

58:15.780 --> 58:17.420
Don't go there.

58:17.420 --> 58:18.420
I agree.

58:18.420 --> 58:19.420
I agree.

58:19.420 --> 58:23.260
Sam Squatch comes in with 16,180 SATs.

58:23.260 --> 58:26.100
Hey, rich lobster.

58:26.100 --> 58:27.860
Oh, shit.

58:27.860 --> 58:29.460
I'm buying a car suite.

58:29.460 --> 58:30.460
I know.

58:30.460 --> 58:32.220
Like I said, we've got some great support this week.

58:32.220 --> 58:37.560
They say, so I absolutely think Twitter is likely pretty bloated, but the metric of code

58:37.560 --> 58:39.140
is a bit of an odd choice to go by.

58:39.140 --> 58:40.140
I agree.

58:40.140 --> 58:41.380
People have been tossing around how much code.

58:41.380 --> 58:42.380
Bad management.

58:42.380 --> 58:43.380
Yeah.

58:43.380 --> 58:47.900
My experience as my career has gone on and I've gone through to become a principal engineer

58:47.900 --> 58:51.260
and now a manager, I write less and less code.

58:51.260 --> 58:56.340
I spend more time reviewing other people's code, catching bad decisions, overseeing early

58:56.340 --> 58:57.900
design plans, et cetera.

58:57.900 --> 58:59.860
Effectively, I try to be a force multiplier.

58:59.860 --> 59:03.500
Does that mean by Elon's metric, I'm a bad engineer?

59:03.500 --> 59:08.420
No, I mean, I don't know if we have any data to suggest that.

59:08.420 --> 59:11.860
I did see an article that said they actually are trying to reach back out to some of the

59:11.860 --> 59:14.220
people that have been fired so far and rehire them.

59:14.220 --> 59:15.220
Jackass.

59:15.220 --> 59:16.220
That's embarrassing.

59:16.220 --> 59:21.460
That is, that's just, I tell you what, I don't know.

59:21.460 --> 59:23.140
It's going to be wild to watch that.

59:23.140 --> 59:27.580
I think his best shot, just to touch on it one last time, is to make his changes and

59:27.580 --> 59:29.620
get the hell out of there and hand it off.

59:29.620 --> 59:30.620
Yeah.

59:30.620 --> 59:35.940
I don't think you should take Elon super seriously when he talks about the management stuff or

59:35.940 --> 59:40.680
basically anything else because I'm pretty sure he's playing a caricature of himself

59:40.680 --> 59:42.820
at this point, right?

59:42.820 --> 59:49.100
It's like when I go and decide I'm going to complain and make fun of the PHP people.

59:49.100 --> 59:50.580
I don't actually hate PHP people.

59:50.580 --> 59:53.460
I don't even think PHP is that bad of a language.

59:53.460 --> 59:55.540
It's just an act, right?

59:55.540 --> 59:59.940
And to his detriment at this point, I would say, he's playing a caricature.

59:59.940 --> 01:00:04.860
There's no way he is sitting there reading printouts of thousands of lines of code.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.700
No, they didn't even do that eventually.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.780
There's been some bogus reporting, but...

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.340
Yeah, it's just bull.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.340
Yeah.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.500
Anyway, moving on.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:16.580
I think he is moving quick and ruthlessly because he just spent $44 billion on something

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.220
that's probably worth a billion dollars.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.860
Well, maybe more, but anyways.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:21.860
Okay.

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:25.180
Noob Steve Boostin with 48,600 sats.

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:28.460
I hoard that with your kind covet.

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:31.140
Now he's listening to episode 483.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:35.780
I think he's responding to something he said in episode 481 about subscriptions in Adobe

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.340
Cloud, which kicked off a series of discussions.

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.340
He said, sorry, guys.

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:44.220
I didn't really mean to kick off an S-storm, as he puts it.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:47.200
I promise I'll never mention those who shall not be named again.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.900
Please accept my humble boost as a formal apology.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:51.900
Also, congrats, Mike.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:55.380
Sorry, you're having to deal with green bubbles right now.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:58.100
I lasted less than a day, don't worry.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.540
That's amazing.

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.420
That is amazing.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:02.820
Who was the not to be named?

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.780
I believe it was Adobe and Creative Cloud that kicked off.

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:06.780
Oh, yeah.

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:10.020
Noob, you can correct me, but that's what I recall.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:14.020
So Ham boosted in with a row of ducks, 2222 sats.

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.660
This old duck still got it.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:16.660
All right.

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:18.660
Brace yourself for this one.

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:22.380
Capitalism requires the funny green line profit to always go up.

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:26.700
The catch, the earth and humanity is a finite resource.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.020
Infinite growth is simply not possible.

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.900
Apple really has no choice other than to become a bully.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.840
Can you really blame them?

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.940
This is I agree to a sense here.

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:39.140
It's like if we are serious about wanting to protect the environment, then we can't

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.180
have unlimited everything.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:47.300
We have to be real about some of these limited resources like, honestly, lithium.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:51.260
There's a new OPEC being organized around lithium now, which is just going to recreate

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:53.740
the same problem we have with oil.

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:56.540
And the number one producer of lithium is China.

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.780
And I hate to think what the labor standards are.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:00.980
It really is quite a conundrum.

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:06.860
I don't know because I think capitalism is really just human nature.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.860
It's trading and creating value for things.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:15.220
I think that's human nature where obviously as it gets at a certain scale and certain

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:18.960
amount of control and influence, it tries to get perverted and now it's become something

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.220
that seems very sick.

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:27.060
But I don't know if you can take trading and selling out of humanity.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:30.660
So we just have to, I guess, have a way to do it sustainably.

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.860
Let us know if you've got an idea for that.

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:32.860
Also, shout outs for Boost CLI.

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:33.860
Whoa.

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:34.860
Yes.

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:37.740
You know what you get?

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.100
That's just for you, Soham, for using Boost CLI.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.100
All right.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:45.260
Trevdev boosted in with some leet sats saying, inflating your downloads, we're talking about

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:49.500
people that have been buying downloads, is a whole industry in third world countries,

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.500
he writes.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:54.780
It boosts your placement on the top podcast list in the Apple Podcast Index.

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:59.940
That artificial inflation of your popularity gets you a real audience.

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.160
That's a good point.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.160
That is true.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.780
That actually does make the transaction worth it.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:08.140
As an example, when we get big baller boosts into the show, we go to the top of the Fountain

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.140
FM list.

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:15.380
Koda Radio is like in sometimes the top four podcasts when people give us big boosts.

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.060
And that's a serious signal.

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.240
People are spending real sats.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.340
That's a real signal of quality and we've been picking up new audiences as a result

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.340
of that.

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.340
LUP too.

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.420
LUP's been benefiting from that as well.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:31.140
Pegdot boosts in with some enterprise sats, 1701.

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.700
Make it so.

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:33.700
This is our last one.

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.140
Hello, Star Trek Radio Show.

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:39.060
A few weeks ago, I asked which series to get started with, with Star Trek.

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.060
We remember.

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:42.380
Both of you recommended The Next Generation.

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:47.340
I started yesterday with Encounter at Farpoint, which is episode one and two, and I'm continuing

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:51.180
today with episode three, the one where everyone gets drunk and horny.

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:54.180
Really enjoying it so far.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.180
Thanks for the recommendation.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:01.220
P.S. I tried the Lord of the Rings series yesterday too, but I like Star Trek better.

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.220
That's great.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:07.340
I thought TNG was a little risky just because that first season, first two seasons, they

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.900
have some gems, but they also have some rough spots.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:14.340
But if you're enjoying the drunk episode, I think you're going to be all right.

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:18.620
Yeah, I was in the drunk episode is one of the worst episodes in that season.

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:25.020
So yeah, there's also that one where the king of a planet like captures Tasha to make

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:29.580
her his love slave, and then they have to fight his current love slave.

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.740
You have to have the original series sexism reboot, right?

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:37.740
Well, it's funny you say that, man, because that's the drunk episode.

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:41.740
That episode, a lot of the season one and two episodes were old scripts from the 60s.

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:42.740
Yep.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:46.860
And they just kind of put the 80s lipstick on them, right?

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:47.860
Exactly.

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:49.820
80s hair and lipstick.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:54.180
Season three, The Next Generation kind of gets its own identity, although if you want

01:04:54.180 --> 01:05:01.180
the one true Trek, and I will stand by this, I'm rewatching Strange New Worlds.

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:02.660
I just love it.

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.580
It's funny you say that.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:10.900
I was reading this boost with Wes yesterday, and he and I were talking about how TNG was

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:11.900
kind of a risk.

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:16.100
And I said, I think the other way to go now would be Strange New Worlds because it's good

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:18.860
Trek with modern production values.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:20.820
I think it's a good introduction possibly.

01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:26.620
So, if you can enjoy TNG, it gets so rich because then you can move into DS9 and Voyager

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:29.660
and then Enterprise and just work your way up.

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:33.220
And that is quite literally years of TV watching.

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.300
I started doing that with my wife when we were dating.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:39.580
And we're now on season two of Enterprise.

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:44.700
And so we started with TNG, and we've been married for like six, I don't know, I don't

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.700
know how long.

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.140
We've been married a couple of years, but we've been dating for a while, it's been years.

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:50.100
And we're just now in Enterprise.

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.620
And so it's literally years of great television.

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:56.820
And you can store it locally and there's no ads and it's just, if you get into it, it's

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:57.820
pretty great.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:58.820
All right, enough.

01:05:58.820 --> 01:05:59.820
Enough.

01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:00.820
Big shout out too.

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.820
I really want to say thank you to those that boosted in.

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:05.380
Some just send in some sats without saying anything, few send in some notes.

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:07.940
We don't put them all in the show if you can believe it.

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:15.340
But we did get 109,999 sats from WM, who went on a little bit of a boosting spree for our

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.780
shows and Coda Radio was a big beneficiary there.

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:23.900
We got 100 sats from jmac217, who says no one in his real life circle is using Twitter

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.780
in central Illinois.

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:29.220
Twitter is just not a thing in his neck of the woods, he says, in the real world.

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:32.140
And we got 3,000 sats from Agania or Ahagania.

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.620
Thank you guys very much or appreciate you very much.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.820
You're doing a good job.

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:41.260
If you'd like to send a boost into the show, go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:45.880
There's a whole suite of options there from a whole new podcast app to just using tools.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:49.540
And if you're in the U.S. and you want to grab some cheap sats, the Strike app or the

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.860
Cash app is fantastic outside the U.S.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:54.100
I like Blue Wallet a whole bunch.

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:57.880
And of course, you can invest in the ongoing production, the real nuts and bolts of the

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.500
show by becoming a member, codercua.co.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:04.500
I got an email, I got a nice note from one of our members, I think we both got it, from

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:09.500
one of our members over the week who says, this would be my boost would be, but since

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.300
I'm a member, I'm just going to send it to you directly.

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.300
Totally fine.

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.300
We love hearing from you.

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:16.980
And as a thank you, you get an ad-free version of the show and a coderly report, which we're

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:17.980
going to get together.

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:18.980
We will.

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:23.100
Oh, my gosh, you guys, you wouldn't believe how busy the world has been, but we'll get

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.660
it together and send it out to our members as a thank you, codercua.co.

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:30.620
I don't know, you feeling like you got anywhere you want to send the people this week, Mr.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:31.620
Dominic?

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:34.220
You know, as always, I'm at Team Unuku on Twitter, but why don't you all sign up for

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.580
the Matrix Room?

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:39.420
I usually hang out in the Coder Radio general Matrix chat room.

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:41.020
Yeah, we got two Coder chat rooms.

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:44.740
There's like a feedback specific room and a general chat and we link to the general

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:47.020
chat at coder.show slash matrix.

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:50.580
That's a great call because that's also what we put up on our live stream.

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:54.260
And so you can find out when we're live just by being in there or you can just review the

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:57.500
chat if you're listening to an episode and you're curious to know what the chat room

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.500
said.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.500
It's all there.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.620
And of course, yeah, both Mike and I are hanging out and they're pretty much every day from

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:02.620
time to time.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.620
I'm popping in at least a few times a day.

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.100
So join us over there.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:11.420
We got links to what we talked about today at coder.show slash 491.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.500
How about that?

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:15.700
And you can actually watch how these shows get made over at Jupiter.tube.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.940
It's live 9 a.m. Monday, 12 p.m. Eastern.

01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:23.660
And then the archived version stays up there for playback because why not?

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:24.660
It's our own YouTube.

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:28.380
I can do whatever I want.

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.020
Is that not a great laugh?

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.180
I'll work on an evil laugh, though.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.500
I'll get that together for the next time I talk about it.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:36.820
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program, and we'll

01:08:36.820 --> 01:09:03.900
see you right back here next week.
