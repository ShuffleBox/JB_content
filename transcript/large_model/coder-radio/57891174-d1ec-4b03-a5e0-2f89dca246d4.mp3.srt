00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
This is KOTORadio, episode 473 for July 4th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,160
Hello friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,080
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,560
My name is Chris and joining us in his flag-themed outfit, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,560
That's right.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,040
Chris, can we hear that eagle soar?

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
We got an eagle.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
You sure I should let it out, Mike?

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
You sure?

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,040
Let it out.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
Let it out.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,040
That's right.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,040
I'm putting down the tea, picking up the coffee.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,960
Look at the way it goes.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
Look at that.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,840
I can't remember other British things.

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
Hold on.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,120
I think it just stole someone's hot dog.

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
Oh.

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
Yes.

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
No.

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Geez.

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,960
Well, we just ruined their Independence Day.

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,440
So yeah, it's a holiday here in the States.

25
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
Yes.

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,160
Of course, by the time you're hearing, it's over.

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,200
We have that whole time delay.

28
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,920
That's kind of the reasons we always just do a show, because by the time you're hearing

29
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,680
this, your holiday is over.

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,220
So here we are for you.

31
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:13,520
I got to say, I have a little bit of, I don't know, slash envy, slash impressed.

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
I don't know.

33
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,680
You have become like a grill master.

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,400
I didn't even realize you owned a grill.

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,280
And then you know how I stalk you on Twitter, as I do.

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,680
And as one of everyone.

37
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,040
And I'm just seeing all kinds of goodies all the time.

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,640
I mean, grilled ribs, grilled corn on the cob.

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Those ribs were not me.

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,640
But it's funny you mentioned ribs, Chris.

41
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,640
Yeah.

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,520
Are you flying down or teleporting via LadyJuice, my serial network?

43
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,920
I mean, if I need to for ribs, I probably could.

44
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,720
There are going to be barbecue ribs, a couple of hot dogs, because we have some children

45
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,080
that have not experienced or embraced the glory that is ribs, which great.

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
More for dad.

47
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
Not a problem.

48
00:01:52,080 --> 00:02:00,080
But ribs there, paired with some Redwood Empire bourbon, as well as some Mexican corn, again,

49
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
on the grill.

50
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Oh, my.

51
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Yes.

52
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,960
And French fries, because little kids exist.

53
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
But yeah.

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,320
That sounds like a lot of fun.

55
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
That's nice.

56
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
That's nice.

57
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
There will be a picture.

58
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,480
Don't worry.

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,800
I don't generally see you get like, you know, a three or four head day start on the show.

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,900
But this is a special week.

61
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,240
You got a jumpstart, and I think I think there's one man that deserves credit for it.

62
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
It can only be one.

63
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,040
And of course, it is the Egon Egon has written into the show again.

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,120
He says, Hi, guys.

65
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,480
This is Egon.

66
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,080
As I've told you before, the joy of listening to Mike and Chris chat about the art and business

67
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,900
of software development and the world of technology is the weekly highlight of my commute.

68
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,960
But episode 471 was special.

69
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,600
Birthday drunk, freshly engaged Mike is the best kind of Mike.

70
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,400
I love his vibes.

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
Coder Radio is the most informative, entertaining tech podcast I know.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,020
But when you started to talk about me and to me, the joy of listening to your show raised

73
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,720
like an Apple stock since 2019.

74
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,680
Damn.

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,160
Now it's time for me to give back to the greatest show on Earth, apart from being a Coder QA

76
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,640
member for the first hour.

77
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,260
But of course, a first hour Coder QA member.

78
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,400
That is impressive.

79
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,560
Now it is time for me to give back to the greatest show on Earth, apart from being a

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,000
Coder QA member, I will do I henceforth apply for one of the following positions on the

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Coder Radio team.

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
All right.

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Get ready.

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,560
The official Coder Radio mascot or 90 percent Coder Radio Jesus without the 100 percent

85
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,000
because he doesn't want to get nailed on to things.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,320
So he wants to be the 90 percent Coder Jesus or president of the German speaking Coder

87
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,000
Radio chapter in Europe.

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,720
I'll be waiting for your answers with great anticipation.

89
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
The Egon.

90
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,680
This is a tough call.

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,560
I think Egon is probably qualified for any of these three positions for sure.

92
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,360
And also, I am concerned about the size of the organization just growing and growing.

93
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,040
And so I feel like there may be room to collapse a couple of these positions and just give

94
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,560
more work to Egon.

95
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,840
I feel like he could just do all three, although I have to say the German aspect of it is very

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,580
intriguing to me because I failed to tweet this, but I do often grill brats and various

97
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,380
other types of German sausages.

98
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,380
There's that.

99
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,380
Yeah.

100
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,640
I would probably be aware of that.

101
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Yeah.

102
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
The radio mascot.

103
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,640
I think that's that's probably pretty good.

104
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,600
The Coder Jesus one is tricky.

105
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
That's tricky.

106
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
I see.

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
I think he'd be more like a Coder John the Baptist, right?

108
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,320
He's like spreading the word.

109
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

110
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
That's exact.

111
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Yeah.

112
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
All right.

113
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,440
So why don't we go ahead and give approval since we're having our little production meeting

114
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,520
now to Egon being the official Coder Radio mascot and the president of the German speaking

115
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,680
Coder Radio chapter of Europe.

116
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,740
And we will revisit his exact status in the actual order of the Church of Coder Radio.

117
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,400
But it's definitely high up there.

118
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
That's for sure.

119
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Right.

120
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Incredible work, Egon.

121
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Keep it up.

122
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,360
And also, Gary gets a little point in the chat room for managing to mention Snow Leopard

123
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,640
less than three minutes into the episode.

124
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,720
We've got some trains so well.

125
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Nicely done chat room.

126
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,800
You know what?

127
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
They know how to make you happy.

128
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,280
Wait, can Egon like wear a Snow Leopard themed outfit with maybe like an adium watch?

129
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
We can make this work.

130
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,440
I feel like this is going a different direction.

131
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,080
Like this is a different thing.

132
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,120
So that's a different podcast, I think.

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,280
You know, I want to just put one more word out there for the London meetup because I

134
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
won't be there.

135
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,840
And I want to make that clear.

136
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,160
But Alex from Self Hosted is going to be there as well as a bunch of community members.

137
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,680
And I feel like this could be the proto meetup.

138
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,240
I've been looking to get over in the London area forever, and it'd be great to bring a

139
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,880
few members of the crew over there and do a meetup.

140
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,520
And so this is sort of like the scouting mission, right?

141
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,760
We're sending over the early scouts to go over and discover the territory.

142
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,400
So meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, they've got a venue, they got a date.

143
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
It's getting solid.

144
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,020
And an obligatory plug for the new J.B. Meetups Matrix space.

145
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,040
This is an area where we are organizing physical meetups and virtual meetups.

146
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,520
We have a London Colony meetup chat room, a Pacific Northwest Colony, a Mumble Colony.

147
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,120
I could see the Mumble ones for virtual events.

148
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,760
I could see us doing a California one because we have a California road trip coming up soon.

149
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,880
I could see us doing one in Raleigh, Florida one, you know, Florida Man community chat

150
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
room.

151
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Yeah, I haven't come to Florida.

152
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,160
Yeah, one day I would like to.

153
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,840
I mean, I have been.

154
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
I have been.

155
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,920
The nice thing about doing a meetup in Florida, if you do it near Orlando in particular or

156
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,440
even Tampa works good, is that the whole economy, other than Disney, which I don't know if the

157
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,120
governor has his way, we're going to just like send some cats in to catch the mouse,

158
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,360
is basically geared towards this exact thing, right?

159
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,820
It's all like people come in, they do their thing, they leave.

160
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,820
We pay no income tax.

161
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,920
We tax the **** out of you while you're here.

162
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
It's amazing.

163
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Really good stuff.

164
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,960
I was surprised by Raleigh.

165
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,080
There is a lot of industry in Raleigh and that I realized is kind of part of it is if

166
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,120
you can do meetups around where there's some big industry buildings where they have offices,

167
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,320
you get a lot of listeners that show up.

168
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,000
It's kind of funny how that works.

169
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, I wouldn't mind going to Raleigh this time.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, yeah.

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Be good.

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I you know, I was it was funny.

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,360
I was going to go to Linux Fest Southeast or right.

174
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Mm hmm.

175
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Southeast Linux Fest.

176
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Yeah, thank you.

177
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
That's the one.

178
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,040
And apparently it either didn't happen or happened early this year or I for some reason

179
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
thought it was early.

180
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,240
I don't know, man.

181
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,480
That was crazy.

182
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
I wanted to go.

183
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,000
And then I think I saw like my buddy Noah chatting in Telegram or something that it

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
was live right then.

185
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I was like, oh, what?

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, yeah.

187
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Well, Emma told me because she's like, are you coming to any events this year?

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,320
Yeah, I'm going to go to self and she's like, but I'm we're here now.

189
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
What are you talking about?

190
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Yeah.

191
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Yeah.

192
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,880
This it's you know, I got to get back.

193
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,360
There used to be a good app and I can't remember what it was to track like all the upcoming

194
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,720
events for a given topic.

195
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,560
And I guess I don't know if it's gone.

196
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,400
It's funny how some events are they're pretty clever.

197
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,240
They reach out to media with an email that says, hey, just so you know, this is the details

198
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
about our event.

199
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,720
If you get a chance to mention on there, that'd be great.

200
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,400
But just want you to be aware of what's going on because they realize, hey, you know, they

201
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,040
probably talk to hundreds of thousands of people.

202
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,360
So if we tell them then they could tell hundreds of thousands of people.

203
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,320
But then other events just don't think that way and they don't reach out and they don't

204
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,360
try to like get coverage.

205
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,780
And I think it hurts their growth a little bit.

206
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,680
It's sort of an echo chamber thing, too, I suppose.

207
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Yeah.

208
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,720
Well, it sucks to for local events that don't really maybe know how to do the outreach.

209
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,320
And I've had it so many times where I realize like there was literally something in Tampa

210
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,960
that would have been cool for me to go, like maybe do an interview for the show or something,

211
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,880
you know, some kind of like because we have a lot of weird like infosec stuff because

212
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,640
we have a big military base here.

213
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,780
And just like they don't they don't publish anything.

214
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:54,160
And they're surprised when all their events are super duper small.

215
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,880
Linode.com slash coder.

216
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,860
Go there to get one hundred dollars and 60 day credit on a new account.

217
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,000
And it's just a great way to support the show while you learn something.

218
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

219
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
You got to try it for your next project.

220
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,400
Maybe it could be the back end for your business.

221
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,680
That's what I do.

222
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,400
Maybe it's just a personal site.

223
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,100
You know, maybe you got a portfolio, maybe you got a blog you want to put there.

224
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,200
Maybe you want your own personal peer tube instance.

225
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
It's actually great for that.

226
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,040
And then you can use their object storage back end for the video storage, which is killer.

227
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,320
But if you need like a high performance application, well, they've got you covered there, too.

228
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,040
They got MVME storage, PCI beautiful MVE storage.

229
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,240
They got their own ISP connections.

230
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,580
So they have just screaming 40 gigabit connections coming into these machines.

231
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,680
And of course, they've got processors with AMD, epic CPUs and 11 data centers around

232
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
the world.

233
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,320
So you're going to find something near you or your customers.

234
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,060
Linode's been doing this for nearly 19 years.

235
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,000
Crazy cats got started in 2003 because they just saw where Linux was going.

236
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,280
They saw where the technology could take them.

237
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
I can resonate with that.

238
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
I think you might, too.

239
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,200
And I think you'll see it throughout the service.

240
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,560
And then if you ever get any trouble, you'll find that they have the best service.

241
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,080
You know, somehow those hyperscalers can make billions and billions and billions of dollars,

242
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,340
but they can't do simple support.

243
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,980
Maybe there's something special to it.

244
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,400
Maybe it's not so simple.

245
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,960
Maybe Linode just has it figured out after nearly 19 years.

246
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,760
Either way, go try it for yourself and find out, support the show and get $100.

247
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,120
Go try out my host.

248
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,800
I wouldn't host our applications anywhere else, and I think you'll feel the same way.

249
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,040
Linode.com slash coder.

250
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,720
All right, Mr. Dominic, let's talk about your Linux 2022 toolbox.

251
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,240
Actually, let's issue a challenge.

252
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,800
Your ad read just inspired me.

253
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,400
All right, give it to me.

254
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,320
Use the Linode code.

255
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,720
Use their managed, I think it's Postgres thing.

256
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Yeah.

257
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,560
I think they do a couple, but I think it's Postgres and MySQL for sure.

258
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,080
Yeah, and they got Mongo, too.

259
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,040
They got Mongo, Postgres, and MySQL.

260
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,520
Build, you have to be in the US, blah, blah, blah, the same caveats I always put on it.

261
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,720
I, for some reason, have a spare dev one because I think I entered some alcoholic fugue state

262
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,240
where I just started ordering dev ones.

263
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,560
Yes.

264
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,960
See this is why it used to be a video show.

265
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,840
Your face is priceless right now, like it's amazing.

266
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,720
I almost did a spit take on the mixer.

267
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
I legitimately-

268
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
That would have been amazing.

269
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,560
I'm watching your reactions to the nonsense.

270
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
It's amazing.

271
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,400
You're just like, the sad part is Chris knows that this is 100% definitely true.

272
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,320
Oh yeah, of course, of course, yeah.

273
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,840
So tell you what, the winner who could make me the best web application, not just me,

274
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:40,320
like post it publicly, whatever, that tracks all the dev slash community events in the

275
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,760
States, particularly focusing on the Northwest and the Southeast, like that's where we are.

276
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,680
A nice format where you can add it to your calendar with links to sign up so that next

277
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,960
time there's an event that makes sense for either Chris or I to go to, we can just not

278
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,600
screw it up and actually know about it, unlike this yourself, which is my fault.

279
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,040
A Linux community event tracker.

280
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
Yeah.

281
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,360
I mean, it'd be cool if you could just sign up for an email every time there's one added

282
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
or something.

283
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Yeah.

284
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Or a calendar ICS feed.

285
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,820
You know, I know the Portland area has one specifically for Portland, but we need something

286
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,820
for our reporter.

287
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,120
There's a bunch for like, even meetup.com does something like it.

288
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,560
But first of all, their filters are, their filters are just awful, but I'm thinking someone

289
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,860
who knows, you know, knows the show, knows the JB community, and this could be something

290
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,440
useful for other hosts or other even just community members sign up for have better

291
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
meetups.

292
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
We could put our stuff on there.

293
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,080
I'm surprised this doesn't exist.

294
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
I haven't found it.

295
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,640
If it, I mean, if it exists, then you know, all bets are off, but I haven't found it.

296
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,120
Yeah, no, I have not either.

297
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,800
I, like I said, I know of like the, the one in Portland, which I think is actually open

298
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
source.

299
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Oh yeah.

300
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
It has to be open source.

301
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Right?

302
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Like that's the caveat.

303
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Open source on GitHub.

304
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
GPL it if you want.

305
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Oh yeah.

306
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,280
Calligator is what they call it.

307
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Calligator.

308
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
That's terrible.

309
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Yeah.

310
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,520
Well, you know, you could fork that.

311
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Yeah.

312
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,120
It's Portland's tech calendar, calligator.org.

313
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,160
And it is a collection of all of the events.

314
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,800
Like here's some data engineering Q and a night, uh, software engineering beyond bootcamp,

315
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,760
mentorship Saturdays, just different events, including they'll have their Linux.

316
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Yeah.

317
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,720
Community events on there and whatnot.

318
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Someone could look at that.

319
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
I'll put a link in the show notes.

320
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,880
Maybe somebody could get started there.

321
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,200
You know, I will say the, uh, young man, I didn't, I didn't feature him cause he was

322
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,440
a underage and I just, you know, but who made me, or maybe he was 17, 18.

323
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't remember who made me the snow leopard GTK theme did in fact, I guess his gazelle.

324
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,520
I'm just saying I always pay, I always pay my bets.

325
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,320
So that's great.

326
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,640
Oh, right.

327
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Okay.

328
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,760
So you've updated your Linux toolbox for 2020 and you've got some, you know, you've been

329
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,480
playing around some new hardware, certain software has been discontinued.

330
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,280
Some software I think has become more prominent.

331
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Tell me a little bit about it.

332
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Yeah.

333
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,480
So, um, you know, for, for you hardcore Linux heads, I think a lot of this is going to be

334
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,260
like lay doi, but kind of, I've been using the Mac a lot and I still have not been able

335
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:08,440
to move my, this is kind of sideways, but my, uh, like audio production stuff.

336
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,200
I don't do a lot of it like Chris, but I do enough that it's annoying, but you could like

337
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,080
Photoshop workflow onto Linux.

338
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,120
Although I am learning the gimp.

339
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,840
Also it seems that, uh, old Adobe has plans to make a web version of Photoshop.

340
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,600
There's also photo P which I don't know if you ever tried that.

341
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,560
I don't know that one photo P like P E a, it is like Photoshop seven in the web browser.

342
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
It's not bad actually.

343
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,320
Oh, that actually would be perfect.

344
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
And it opens and saves.

345
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,880
I think it saves, but I know it opens PSD files too.

346
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,760
So there's something interesting.

347
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
So that would be super good.

348
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Yeah.

349
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
I don't do a ton of it.

350
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,200
It's always like, you know what, when you're working with a designer on a product, they're

351
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,760
all, they hate cutting assets and they always want to hand you just a photo set up file.

352
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Right.

353
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
And they're just like, here you go.

354
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Yes.

355
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Yes.

356
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
Totally.

357
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
All right.

358
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
So yeah, Rob, I'm just going to run through the list.

359
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Some of this is obvious vs code.

360
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Why?

361
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Because I'm a developer and I don't like to pay for things.

362
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,520
And also Microsoft has thrown just a stupid amount of investment vs code.

363
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
It's really good.

364
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,520
We all know that everybody has their preferences.

365
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Move on.

366
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Melt.

367
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
I really like melt.

368
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,640
Thank you for putting melt in here.

369
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,280
I don't understand what's wrong with meld.

370
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,600
It's a, it's a gooey dipping tool.

371
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,920
It's comparable to the popular Mac app kaleidoscope, which is also a gooey giving tool, except

372
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
meld is free.

373
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,280
It's an almost every app store on Linux that I could think of that runs gnome.

374
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,800
I don't know, man.

375
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,200
It gifts my like merge conflicts or various versions of documents really quickly, really

376
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
visually.

377
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,840
You can customize it to a point.

378
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,800
It's one of those tools that I use a lot and just works.

379
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,320
Sounds super boring.

380
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,480
I like it better than the vs code diff tool, mostly because I like having it side by side

381
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,080
with the colorized, uh, like colors, the different versions, right?

382
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,040
Like, you know, blue is whatever colors you pick, but like mine is blue and red.

383
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,400
So I could see like, okay, we have this three way merge, you know, where the hell did we

384
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,500
go wrong?

385
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,800
The next one is color picker, which is again, super simple, but this, my post is really

386
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,960
targeting people coming from the Mac Mac has the, what is the digital cuddle color meter.

387
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Is that right?

388
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Is that what they call it?

389
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,440
I mean, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

390
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Yeah.

391
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,640
This is a better version of that, believe it or not.

392
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,440
This is a case where the Linux alternative is in fact like more full featured, easier

393
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,400
to use and makes a lot more sense for what you're doing.

394
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
So it's great.

395
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,600
You can put a droplet or a pipette or whatever they call that anywhere on your screen and

396
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,680
it will get you the color of that item in various formats.

397
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,720
Super useful if you're doing something for a client and you know, they just got to have

398
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,240
their shade of blue, right?

399
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,320
But no one wants to give you a hex code or RGB code for it because they don't know it.

400
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,040
My next one up, I use this damn thing every day on every operating system.

401
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Postman.

402
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,240
If you don't know what Postman is and you either write API calls or you use API calls,

403
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
it's free.

404
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Go download it.

405
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,400
You can download it from the Electron app, but it will make your life a hundred times

406
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,080
easier than just having to like curl, test your requests or, you know, have some giant

407
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,480
document of like request samples.

408
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
You can save them.

409
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
You can group them.

410
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,000
You can have collections for like, I have it by client mostly, but I have it by project

411
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,340
if it's for our internal stuff.

412
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,340
Really good.

413
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,140
You can also do variable, like variable values.

414
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,680
So like if you're on one machine, the API key can be this, if you're on another machine

415
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,080
it can be that.

416
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,760
Super cool stuff.

417
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,960
Really useful.

418
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,840
There is a paid option, which I do pay for.

419
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,280
Getting some love in the chat room too.

420
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Oh yeah.

421
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
You got to check out the Postman.

422
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,480
Hammerless says it's one of the Electron apps that doesn't feel like an Electron app.

423
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,560
It does exactly what it says on the tin, right?

424
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
It just works.

425
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Tabby Terminal.

426
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
All right.

427
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,360
So this is one where I decided to bitch at somebody.

428
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,400
I don't know why Zach and company at Warp Terminal seem to be wanting to duck the when

429
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,640
is it coming to Linux question.

430
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
Actually I have a suspicion.

431
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Can I fry some bacon?

432
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Yeah.

433
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
You want some?

434
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
All right.

435
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,720
So Warp Terminal, we covered it a couple of weeks ago or a month ago.

436
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
You can look it up.

437
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,980
We'll put it in the show notes.

438
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,440
They keep making mouth noises about like a web-based version of it because they want

439
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,440
this whole like remote teamwork and they have a lot of features for that.

440
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,000
I have a feeling they're going to do the web before they do Linux.

441
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I just do.

442
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,280
And that to me is a big mistake.

443
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,400
And then Linux users can go run it in a web browser.

444
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,560
They're not going to, right?

445
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,360
Or they'll do some like they package it, right?

446
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,860
But whatever.

447
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,460
So I've decided to go to a web-based terminal called Tappy.

448
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,440
I will say this is the one where I like it over G Terminal.

449
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,040
It has some better auto-completion, some more configurability.

450
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,560
If you're on Mac and you haven't tried Warp, I know they have the weird thing where you

451
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,280
have to log in with GitHub, but unless you're like super worried about that, they don't

452
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,760
track what you do in the terminal.

453
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,400
You can turn all that stuff off.

454
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,360
It is really good.

455
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:56,200
I'm Tappy for now, but I would be going back to them if they could get on Linux since other

456
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,960
than this kind of production stuff, I'm basically daily driving.

457
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,480
So yeah, what did I miss?

458
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,680
I know I'm missing stuff.

459
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
You think so?

460
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
It's funny.

461
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,300
I can forget that I'm on the dev one sometimes because I'm really just living in like terminal

462
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,440
windows tiled all over the place and VS code.

463
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
That's so nice.

464
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,480
It's so clean.

465
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,800
It's so portable, that setup.

466
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,600
Like you could run that on anything, really.

467
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
That's a great place to be.

468
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,920
I mean, you got all the obvious things like, of course, chat apps and whatnot.

469
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Yeah.

470
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:32,000
I didn't put like, you know, Lutris in there because I was kind of, you know, I will give

471
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,400
the Linux machine over the Mac, like most of my Steam library seems to work relatively

472
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
well.

473
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Yeah.

474
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Oh, it's way better.

475
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
It's way better.

476
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
And it's pretty neat.

477
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
It's only a 16 gig machine, too.

478
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
I was surprised.

479
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,640
It's a time where if you want a game and you want a good developer workstation, Linux makes

480
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,040
a lot more sense than the Mac and the Mac is in such a bad gaming position right now.

481
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,380
I'll toss in one bonus app.

482
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,920
If you like me end up with multiple browsers to either test things in different browsers

483
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,040
or for different account reasons, there is an app that I've mentioned maybe once before

484
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
on the show.

485
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,140
Maybe it's called Junction.

486
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,200
And it's like Bumper on Mac OS.

487
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,540
It lets you choose the browser a link opens in.

488
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
So you click a link.

489
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,540
Oh, that's cool.

490
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,540
Yeah.

491
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,560
And this little pop up overlay that lists your browsers, you know, just icons or whatever

492
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,720
browser auto detects on your system.

493
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,360
You tap that browser and then that browser launches with the URL.

494
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
That's super cool.

495
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
Yeah.

496
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,560
I use this a surprising amount.

497
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,480
I just there's some things I use Chrome for, some things I use Firefox, some things Edge

498
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,920
even good on Web.

499
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,040
So you mentioned Edge.

500
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,700
I had Edge in here and I took it out because I was afraid that the whole thing would be

501
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,680
overshadowed by Edge 8.

502
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,440
I am living in Edge now.

503
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,560
You know, but are you really?

504
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,400
It is the easiest way for me to sync all my insanely long passwords.

505
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,400
And I still have to let Google authenticate with the authenticator app, everything, but

506
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
it runs everywhere.

507
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,200
I mean, if it works for you, you know, I have Edge in a couple of spots because for whatever

508
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,200
reason, some of these apps we use for remote shows and stuff just use considerably less

509
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,480
CPU and Edge than they do Chrome or Firefox.

510
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,700
I don't know what they're doing.

511
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,040
So I end up reluctantly using Edge quite a bit for that sort of stuff.

512
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,720
I wonder how many people are using Linux and Edge at the same time.

513
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,040
But you know, it's like, well, yeah, yeah, officer, I did have a drink or two, but listen,

514
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,960
my grandma died and I was running Edge.

515
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Yeah.

516
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,260
Oh, I see.

517
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,260
It's been a rough day.

518
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,260
I see.

519
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,480
So obviously your Discord chat was taunting you and in your despair.

520
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
I see.

521
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
Okay.

522
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
All right.

523
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,200
So one of the things we're reluctantly using, how has Copilot gone for you so far?

524
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,240
I know you signed up for the GitHub Copilot.

525
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
You're now a paying user.

526
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,600
Yeah, that was, I got to stop doing stuff like that.

527
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,520
It's really, I mean, it's great for system 76.

528
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
And content, content.

529
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
And content.

530
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,560
But we need to raise our ad rates, all right.

531
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,880
So Copilot, we're going to do this like a nice corporate performance review.

532
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Performance.

533
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,320
Damn, things fast.

534
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
I was surprised.

535
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,120
Like it figures it out quick, you mean?

536
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Yeah.

537
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,400
Well, well, it's fast.

538
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,240
It's fast like a drunk driver's fast.

539
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,920
Like it's pretty quick, but it ain't going anywhere good.

540
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,720
That's a little, I mean, languages.

541
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
So this is all right.

542
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,640
I'm just going to do the bad stuff first.

543
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:34,120
If you are writing relatively mainstream Python, Copilot is amazing.

544
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,700
For Python, it's amazing.

545
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,280
I'm struggling to understand what you just said, because it sounded like what you just

546
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,020
said is if you're writing Python, Copilot works really well, which is just, that's hard

547
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,520
for me to wrap my head around.

548
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,280
And then I started thinking, is that because maybe all of the open source software they

549
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,360
fed this thing was mostly Python?

550
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,160
I think that's what it is, right.

551
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,600
It's a, you know, when I say mainstream Python, I'm talking about like basic, you know, I'm

552
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,400
parsing data, blah, blah, blah, rendering a webpage, doing some ginger stuff.

553
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
That all works pretty good.

554
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,360
Some of the suggestions are definitely questionable, but you know, if you are a junior dev and

555
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:19,000
need a little handholding and you're writing, let's just say a Django app, I think it would

556
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,880
be helpful or at least not harmful.

557
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,880
It has some interesting ideas on HTML and CSS.

558
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:32,240
Now, that's not my strongest suit, so I don't know if it's, I have a very old school way

559
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,160
of doing things on the front end.

560
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,440
I doubt that because I'm doing Angular TypeScript right now, which I know isn't the newest thing,

561
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,860
but it's also not like, you know, straight up jQuery, right?

562
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:51,800
It gets really convinced once you do something, like once you take one of its suggestions,

563
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,440
it gets real sure you want that like 20 other times.

564
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,040
It gets an attaboy and it really responds.

565
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,920
Yeah, which can become annoying.

566
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,160
I have some concerns that weren't really my concerns, but then I got hammered enough on

567
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:16,480
the DMs and on the telegrams that I'm not sure that this isn't going to open up like

568
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,440
potential just, you know, they used to say PHP was bad because like all the kids didn't

569
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,760
know what they were doing, we're just writing PHP and copy off stack overflow.

570
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,080
Well this is like without even having to hit control C, control V, right?

571
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
This is pretty bad.

572
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,520
Yeah, and it could be for everything.

573
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,160
So if you're using fast API, it seems pretty confused, but that's because fast API is a

574
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,180
Python framework that West turned me on to a while ago, is much newer, much less popular

575
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,000
and frankly not that supported, right?

576
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,320
Yeah, it probably wasn't in the data set as much.

577
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,800
Right, where if you're using Django or Flask, it's like, okay, I get you.

578
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,880
Or honestly, like if you're writing a Python command line app, that's your guy.

579
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,500
He's there for you, like a good neighbor, copilots there.

580
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,280
Like a drunk neighbor, copilots there.

581
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,880
If he's grilling, he might give you food though.

582
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
That's true.

583
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
Yeah.

584
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
That's kind of nice.

585
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
I'm going to keep it up for the year though.

586
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
I'm going to use it.

587
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,840
I'm going to keep using it for non-client internal stuff because I don't want to get

588
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
sued.

589
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,280
So that's the way to kind of walk that line, is nothing you're going to ship to any client.

590
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,120
Yeah, the Telegram freedom beard scared me enough that I was like, all right.

591
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,320
Which I would say if you're a freedom beard on Telegram, did you forget about IRC or whatever?

592
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,080
The argument they made that you'll get sued and your client will get sued for the GPL,

593
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,160
I don't think so.

594
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,600
That seems cray-cray, but I guess it's possible.

595
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,400
My concern would be like copilot generates some crazy proprietary thing or more likely,

596
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,600
my actual concern was copilot basically generates a bunch of security holes, right?

597
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,080
Because it takes the most popular, which might be the most naive and crappy way to do things.

598
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
All right.

599
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
Interesting.

600
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,680
Well, I'll be curious to circle back and see how it's going.

601
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Yeah.

602
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm going to try it with some either Minecraft mod development or some light game development

603
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,240
because I'm doing that project with my kid I talked about last week.

604
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,720
So that's, I want to see how it does on something that's not like web dev.

605
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,960
I definitely get the feeling that like, this is one of those things, right, where it's

606
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,800
like when you're on Twitter and you see the people tweeting about doing dev, you know

607
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:34,040
half those dudes who are talking about hardcore hacking are like JavaScript developers.

608
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,000
Tailscale.com slash coder.

609
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,840
Go there to get a personal account for up to 20 devices for free.

610
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,760
And of course, your support in the show.

611
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
Tailscale is a game changer.

612
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:48,360
It's a zero config VPN, installs on any device in minutes, manages your firewall rules, navigates

613
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,040
your dub gnats, and it'll work from anywhere.

614
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,320
And of course, devices connect directly in a mesh network using WireGuard's noise protocol.

615
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,120
You build up, then you have static IPs for all your machines.

616
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,840
It's so handy.

617
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,600
Literally, last night, laying in bed, realizing I had screwed something up for the LUP show

618
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
notes.

619
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,360
I should just go to bed, but you know what, it was really important, and I was already

620
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
home.

621
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,560
And I knew thousands of people would be confused if I didn't go make this correction.

622
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:23,000
So I pop on my laptop, by the time my Wi-Fi is connected, my tailscale connection's up.

623
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And I'm SSHed into a server, and I'm fixing things.

624
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,320
Within minutes.

625
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,120
It's such a peace of mind.

626
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,740
It really was the missing piece for how I run my networks.

627
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,920
And I've also been able to turn off all the inbound ports on my firewalls now.

628
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,960
So my firewalls are like pristine, man.

629
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,480
It's Fort Knox up in here because it's tailscale.

630
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
It's so great.

631
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,680
I got in everything from my Arch boxes, my Nix boxes, my Pi's, my iPad, I mean, you name

632
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
it, man.

633
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,000
I got tailscale on it.

634
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,540
Every device is connected to a mesh network with static VPNs.

635
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,240
It's so great.

636
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,440
They're always on.

637
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,640
So they're always available.

638
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,640
And they're smart about how they route the traffic.

639
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,360
Go try it yourself for free for up to 20 devices and support the show.

640
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,200
It's tailscale.com slash coder.

641
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:16,320
Okay, so we thought to stay in theme with the fact that it is Independence Day today.

642
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,360
We should probably talk about why you and I originally went independent, independent

643
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,400
agents so many years ago.

644
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,120
And I thought maybe we should try to capture this before I completely forget it.

645
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,120
Because once I suggested this idea, I really started struggling remembering the history

646
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,080
of everything because I've gotten so far from it that I really can't remember life before

647
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
this way now.

648
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,520
So I'm probably properly broken for ever working in a company, I would imagine.

649
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah, I would think so.

650
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,060
Let's start with you.

651
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,520
So what was it?

652
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,880
Did you start on a career trajectory like I did?

653
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,100
Like I went into the traditional nine to five world first and then did a course correction.

654
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,100
Is that the case for you?

655
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,800
Or did you always just go like, I'm not doing that.

656
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,200
I'm doing my own thing.

657
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,560
It was kind of the opposite for me, right?

658
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,320
Because when I was in school, I did a lot of Java applet work, but that was effectively

659
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,880
what we would call now freelancing.

660
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Yeah.

661
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,840
But it was they just called it, you know, contracts, part time, whatever.

662
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,780
Basically, they don't pay payroll tax because they're bricks.

663
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,520
Then the iPhone came and I did a lot of web and iOS stuff for a long time.

664
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,620
I got like when we talked about this a long time ago, but I was on a contract that was

665
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:31,280
like a job, but then I was supposed to convert over.

666
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,400
I think I may have actually converted over for like a month and then it was a startup.

667
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,240
They had some severe financial issues and that did not last.

668
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,440
So I was in this position where I literally left the place, went downstairs because it's

669
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
New York.

670
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,200
So there's like a bar in the basement and went to the pub and it was just like, okay,

671
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,040
well, nothing has literally changed.

672
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
I just lost a client.

673
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,880
You know, we got to remember this is like the big, this is right before the App Store

674
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
gold rush.

675
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,160
And then the App Store gold rush happened and I never looked back really.

676
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,280
Every once in a while I'll be like, ah, I'm getting older.

677
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,920
You know, I'm not, you know, I'm doing very different things than I used to do now.

678
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,160
But yeah, I don't see myself looking back.

679
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,120
I definitely think if you're going to do it super young, like I think your way is probably

680
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,340
the more traditional, safer way if you're going to do it the way I did.

681
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,040
You want to be on the new hotness because otherwise you're going to get trounced by

682
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,040
the contractors and freelancers who actually have, you know, experience.

683
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,040
So yeah.

684
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
Yeah.

685
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Yeah, definitely.

686
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:40,080
I had a real interesting looking back at it path because I got initially my very first

687
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,080
job was actually at a school district, which is surprisingly bureaucratic and complicated

688
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,040
in, in how pay works and I was part of a union and all of that.

689
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:57,320
And then I left and I went into a private bank, which was its own kind of bureaucrat

690
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:03,680
sort of run organization and had, you know, 700, 800 ish employees.

691
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,360
And maybe, maybe by the time I left a thousand, I don't know.

692
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,520
And then I went and did small startup companies.

693
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,360
I worked for a company called Dream Dinners, which was one of the very first meal order

694
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
services.

695
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Oh, neat.

696
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,080
Only because it was so early, you'd go to the website, which was all of course a PHP

697
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,000
app, which I ran the backend for.

698
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,840
You'd put your order in, but then you would go to one of the franchise locations and assemble

699
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,280
the meals yourself and then like cart them home.

700
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,880
Like they didn't deliver them.

701
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,440
They hadn't figured like the two side, oh, you would go, wait, you the customer?

702
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
Yeah.

703
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
You would go, you would go.

704
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
That's awesome.

705
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Yeah.

706
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,260
So of course we had a bunch of franchise locations and then they brought in some quote unquote

707
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,520
experts from Starbucks and an expert from Boeing and the company went into the toilet

708
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
immediately.

709
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

710
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,640
Where is the convert on the Venn diagram of Starbucks executives and Boeing executives?

711
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,500
I guess they both like to fuel things locally.

712
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,720
They looked at as two icons of industry, of course, Seattle, right, right.

713
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,360
And the, and the, the two gals, the two co-owners that ran dream dinners really idolized this

714
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,680
other gal that worked at Starbucks.

715
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,920
Of course, Starbucks had fired her, but so they picked her up.

716
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,480
And then of course, Boeing laid this guy off and they picked him up and they just really

717
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,060
just ran things differently and the whole thing fell apart.

718
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,860
And it was about at that point where I had kind of walked the whole spectrum and of course

719
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,860
I'm shortening.

720
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,640
There's a lot of little other jobs in there of where I realized I can hate working for

721
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
somebody else.

722
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
It drives me crazy.

723
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,200
I can't stand their pandemic, pandemic priorities.

724
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,760
I can't, I can't understand most of their motivations.

725
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,400
I lose motivation working for them.

726
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,400
I typically, I typically just, it doesn't work out longterm.

727
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,760
And I was looking at that math and thinking to myself, I'm like, you know, I could just

728
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,000
take a handful of clients and I could just do this.

729
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,960
I mean, really, it's not, it's not that big of a deal, which of course little did I know,

730
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,560
doing independent IT contracting with a handful of selected clients, which was great money

731
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:12,640
transformed into podcasting as I kept trying to refine the podcast and I kept trying to

732
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,320
figure like, what could we do to make them sound better?

733
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,440
What could I do to make the content better?

734
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,080
What do I have to do in order to make the show good enough for somebody to want to spend

735
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,860
their time listening?

736
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:27,120
And everything kept coming to, well, I need to spend more time on the podcast and less

737
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,460
time consulting.

738
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,900
And so it just sort of consumed everything and I just sort of worked over time to make

739
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,840
it possible to do this full time.

740
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,560
And then about a decade into it, we decided, okay, let's try combining with a larger organization

741
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,200
that has a similar goal set as ours, but has a much bigger budget.

742
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,400
You know, like for me too, man, I was so burned out because I just didn't have anybody doing

743
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
marketing.

744
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,760
I didn't have anybody doing this or that, right?

745
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,680
There's when you join a large organization, all of a sudden you get all these resources

746
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,520
and I got health insurance right before I ended up in the hospital.

747
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
So that was nice.

748
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,960
And I learned at that point what it's like to be in a VC backed business, a couple of

749
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,720
them because then they are acquired by a cloud guru, but I also learned a very valuable lesson

750
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,160
that the kind of dedication that these podcasts require can't happen in an organization where

751
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,500
the podcasts are not ultimately the end product.

752
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,560
So if the end product is anything but the podcast, there's just no way the organization

753
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,160
will be as focused and prioritized to serve the podcast as they need to be.

754
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,160
That makes sense.

755
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,080
And in order to make them competitive, they need that kind of dedication and focus.

756
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,140
And so that's when I realized it wasn't going to work as part of a larger organization.

757
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:43,160
That's when we began the process of making JB independent again.

758
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:48,520
And now it's kind of like I'm in a middle ground where I kind of miss some of that stuff.

759
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,860
I was caveching before the show started that for the last two days we've had tech issues.

760
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:57,560
After years of great stability, we've started having some tech issues as the machines are

761
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,240
getting older.

762
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,240
And you know, I'm the guy that's in here to do something else and all of a sudden I realized

763
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,600
the computer's broken and now I've gone back 15 years in time and now I'm doing tech support

764
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
for myself.

765
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,360
And that kind of stuff, you know, in the past we had like a full team of people so there'd

766
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,120
be somebody in here that could do that and that's all right.

767
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,860
It's not the same but ultimately I think the shows are better for it so the product's better

768
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,860
for it.

769
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,420
And our core team is, you know, you know the people that are around now.

770
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
They're great.

771
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,060
They're the best team we've ever had.

772
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,960
So that all worked out.

773
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,480
I'm kind of figuring out a health insurance thing and I'm in process of it right now which

774
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,480
could be great.

775
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,060
That'd be a nice relief because I haven't really had anything before so I'm getting

776
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,480
close to having that all sorted out.

777
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,360
It's been a long journey but I think ultimately it was about figuring out what works for me

778
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:57,560
and how I can work best and also understanding that and maybe it's in part because I've been

779
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,920
diagnosed with ADD but like I have to be working on something that matters to me and if I'm

780
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,560
working on something that matters to me I can just work endlessly on it and if I'm working

781
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,160
on something that doesn't matter to me not only do I have to like really stay on myself

782
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,160
to like keep going and keep getting the job done but I screw stuff up.

783
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,720
I just don't pay attention to the details.

784
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,700
I miss things not intentionally but because I'm just not laser focused on it but when

785
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,400
I'm laser focused on it I become hyper aware of attention.

786
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,900
I have a hyper attention to detail.

787
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,280
So it's just a big flip in realizing how I work too and then trying to build something

788
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,280
around that.

789
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Who knows?

790
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,760
The next couple of years are probably going to be pretty wild.

791
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,320
Something else is probably going to change.

792
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:45,320
Yeah what's funny is when I first started going indie my goal was to be a game dev company.

793
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,680
I still every once in a while try to do it but my crusty old Coco's 2D Objective-C code

794
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,280
just doesn't cut it today.

795
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,120
Things have changed so much but maybe one day.

796
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
One day.

797
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
Time to get skilled up in metal.

798
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Metal!

799
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
I'm sorry what?

800
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
Yeah right.

801
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,680
But what's funny too is I can sense that there is another shift coming and in part because

802
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,160
I think there's so many macro economic shifts happening and I think budgets are going to

803
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,760
get reallocated and I think everything's going to go through a repricing.

804
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Everything.

805
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Everything.

806
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,920
And so I feel like that inevitably is going to have some sort of knock-on effect to what

807
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,160
I do but it just is too early to tell.

808
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,240
So it's sort of just like you just go into it knowing that there's kind of a storm down

809
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,960
the road and you just kind of hope you're going to drive through it.

810
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,280
Yeah this is going to be a hell of a year or two year period I think.

811
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
Yeah or more.

812
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
Yeah.

813
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
Hmm.

814
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,480
So it's tough to say but you know I guess part of it is you learn to shift.

815
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,920
You learn to kind of tuck and roll I suppose because look at you right.

816
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,880
Started you want to do game development ended up writing the App Store away for a while

817
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,160
and now you're really you're probably writing more back-end applications and you know.

818
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,780
Well yeah mostly back-end I would say yeah definitely mostly back-end but like this line

819
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,320
of business applications almost all back-end right.

820
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,160
Yeah it's not funny and it's it's each time it's a tuck and roll right.

821
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,000
And sometimes it's just stuff out of your control.

822
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,960
It's jumping out of a moving car.

823
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,200
Yeah right.

824
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,420
Very much so.

825
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:19,120
System 76 dot com slash specials yep our friends at system 76 are back they have a fourth of

826
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,600
July sale.

827

Each user is going to receive a tool kit which includes the iFixit.

828

I think it's the Minow you know it's like their DIY repair kit.

829
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,320
You're also going to get a right to repair declaration scroll.

830
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,360
That sounds fun.

831
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,360
And a sticker.

832
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,400
This is going to come with any purchase of a computer until their supplies run out the

833
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,820
Tinkers tool kit until it's gone.

834
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,800
And now is a great time to get a new machine because of course they've got great prices

835
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:49,260
right now and brand new Lemur or I'm sorry the Lemur with a 12th gen Intel CPU.

836
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,260
That's what's up.

837
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:57,120
We're waiting for that 14 hours of battery life clocking at only 2.5 pounds with 4 terabytes

838
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,320
of NVMe storage.

839
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,400
Wow.

840
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,940
Then also the new darter you know the darter was recently released also has a 12th gen

841
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,680
Intel you can get an i7 or an i5 in there.

842
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:14,680
Nine hours of battery life 3.8 pounds 64 gigabytes of RAM.

843
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,880
Go check out system 76 I will give a personal shout out to the launch absolutely love it.

844
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Got it right here.

845
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,000
I had to launch right in front of me as I record.

846
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,760
It is the best keyboard I've ever used.

847
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,120
So many great systems over at system 76 and they're born to run Linux and they're better

848
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,120
than ever.

849
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,440
So go take advantage of their 4th of July sale.

850
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,760
Get yourself that free Tinkers tool kit while supplies last and you support the show.

851
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,560
So to get the special to get that tool kit the sticker and the scroll go to system 76

852
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,380
dot com slash specials and when you're checking out tell them the coder program sent you say

853
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,960
hi from Mike and Chris would you say hi to our friends over there.

854
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,840
System 76 dot com slash specials.

855
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:01,960
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you but what you can boost for your podcast.

856
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,840
All right so logic came in with 500 sats four days ago.

857
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:10,200
He says let's get some resources posted over on matrix need to get more people in matrix.

858
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,700
I owe Mike an account although I have accounts disabled so I have to figure out if I have

859
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,360
to turn accounts on and then create you an account or if I can create them but have them

860
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,280
disabled for the public.

861
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,760
And of course there's no like UI to manage any of this.

862
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,560
I mean there's some projects out there but it runs on Linux.

863
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,720
What do you buy.

864
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,360
But the matrix room is beginning to organize.

865
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,780
I think they're going to come looking for it soon.

866
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:41,080
So just FYI on that you better watch out Oh a guy one boosted in 120 sats look I'm giving

867
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,620
you the last sats I earned from promoted clips and shows on fountain.

868
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,160
This is a new thing they're doing now where they're giving away sats to help people boost

869
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,680
when you listen to promoted clips actually says he likes it a lot.

870
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,440
It feels like marbles when I was a kid.

871
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,440
That's pretty great.

872
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
That's pretty good.

873
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,760
Keep up the incredible work.

874
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,720
Maybe I will get enough sats to send a tribute to my much loved 6502 processor.

875
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,360
The classic the classic says you might become a member to user and boosted in 225 sats four

876
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,360
days ago.

877
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:15,400
But Vim guys it's still a solid choice today especially with Neo Vim.

878
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,940
No surprise it's listed as one of the most loved ideas in the stack flow in the stack

879
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,360
overflow developer survey speaking of.

880
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,880
Have you thought about reviewing that survey.

881
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,080
This year we didn't do it.

882
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,080
We didn't do it.

883
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
We've done it.

884
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,080
We've done it almost every other year.

885
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,460
You know that survey kind of I'm getting done with it getting done with it because it's

886
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,460
always like JavaScript.

887
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,880
It's like always number one.

888
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
Yeah.

889
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,160
Unless he means the ideas and they're always kind of the same to ran.

890
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,980
What's it going to be.

891
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,320
People who are lying and saying they're using like Emacs and Vim who are really mostly using

892
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,680
VSCode you know people actually using Emacs and Vim and a bunch of folks using JetBrains

893
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,960
and Visual Studio right.

894
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,000
So I don't know it's it's I don't know did we ever actually talk about it but the reason

895
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,760
I didn't even like put it in the show notes maybe we did talk about it was it it's just

896
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,360
kind of the same for the last several years right.

897
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,600
The last shakeup was really the app store stuff when Objective C shot up the thing and

898
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,000
then Swift came and there was a bit of a jumble.

899
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,320
Yeah otherwise it's kind of just been more of the same Linux doing great.

900
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
That's all I care about.

901
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
Yeah.

902
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
Linux is fine.

903
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
It's gaining share.

904
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
Yeah.

905
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,320
Yep.

906
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,520
Dave Jones boosted in four days ago with two thousand one hundred and twelve sats.

907
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,120
He says yeah he's all on board with the rope coin could call it RBC.

908
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:31,160
You know we could get a you know a crap coin out there that we pump and dump with robes

909
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:37,120
and then if you have like a thousand of them then you could turn them in for a robe or

910
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,120
something like that.

911
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,120
We'll have to figure it out.

912
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,120
We'll have to because definitely.

913
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,120
I love it.

914
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,560
There's there's there's a real like tokenomics to a good scam we'll definitely have to figure

915
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,560
it out.

916
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,800
Don't don't want to miss out on that club three thousand boosted in two hundred twenty

917
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
five sats.

918
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,080
Chris you had a good opportunity to tell Mike some of the privacy technologies like coin

919
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,160
join and lightning.

920
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,840
The transactions are visible but it's difficult to trace the addresses to their owners if

921
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,280
they're regularly doing coin joins and spreading them with lightning.

922
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,920
Also with 50 percent of Bitcoin and lightning nodes behind Tor and in different countries

923
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,600
it's going to be difficult for anyone to stop the Bitcoin network.

924
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,640
You see you say something bad about the Bitcoin and somebody is going to come at you.

925
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,400
I didn't you know I you know pleb I don't really tend to argue on this stuff because

926
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,240
I feel like history will will tell us what happens.

927
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,760
Time will tell.

928
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,600
You know the coins I want to be careful the coins are still looking for their killer app

929
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
right.

930
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,200
I didn't say block chain.

931
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,080
You know I think block chain is going to be a thing that lots of banks and financial institutions

932
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,280
use but I'm not sure that we're going to see like the I keep going back to it but like

933
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,040
the indie rent you know the indie opportunities there because I think block chain it's slow

934
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,320
it's resource intensive and it has certain attack vectors if it's not of a certain size

935
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:56,920
of a network and I don't think there's a lot of compelling use cases for block chain outside

936
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,920
of Bitcoin.

937
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,460
I think it's pretty much the one and the only real value and use case I see there long term

938
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,960
is a hard money that is all accountable you know we're all twenty one million of them

939
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,120
are and they are all unique and scarce and it's a store of value because of that.

940
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,360
People love that scarcity thing outside of that like the NFT marketplace is completely

941
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,800
crashed right.

942
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,680
All this stuff just seems like it's totally in the tank and I think we're really seeing

943
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,720
a dot com kind of clean out.

944
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,720
That's what I was going to say.

945
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,400
Yeah you'll see some projects survive but I think for the most part a lot of this stuff

946
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,560
is going to get washed away.

947
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,640
This is I mean it's going to be a couple of years we're going to go through the cycle

948
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,640
again right.

949
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,760
I mean you could even see the VCs are pulling back and I read something just wonderful in

950
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,600
the New York Times this morning.

951
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:49,280
Apparently Uber didn't realize they weren't making money because they're in a panic it

952
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,920
seems over according to this op-ed because oh we make no money and there's not like drunk

953
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,560
VC money anymore.

954
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,960
So what are we going to do and the answer is this is like my revenge from 2012 right

955
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,440
like the point of a business is to like that number in Excel needs to be black not red.

956
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,360
They're going to have to clean house.

957
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,280
Yeah we're going to see like the fall of the stupid business models.

958
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,240
Now Uber is a bad example Uber is not going to fall right they have too much money too

959
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,020
much momentum but I think it's healthy to be honest I think it's a healthy purge.

960
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:24,400
It probably is it probably is and I think my prediction since I love to make them in

961
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,460
the show apparently is that in a couple of years after some regulation has settled it'll

962
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:35,640
go it'll shake out like this you're going to have Bitcoin and maybe a couple of other

963
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:41,780
cryptos and those will be called digital assets and then all the junk is going to be crypto

964
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,640
and that's going to be the stuff that's just sort of like in this early stage that isn't

965
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:50,800
properly regulated and isn't ever going to be of any serious value and the stuff that

966
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,720
we take serious the culture will just shift to calling them digital assets they're digital

967
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,720
assets.

968
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,080
You could see like MTG arena like going to a crypto model right and then allowing like

969
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,480
easier car trading and stuff like that but I love it but me makes a lot of sense to me

970
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,960
but yeah I will promise they can solve all that problem without going to crypto sorry

971
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,320
but yeah that's just it right there's there's good I think that's there's going to have

972
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:20,760
to be a process of I guess people trying it and failing and then realize you know we could

973
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:27,680
just use a database and what the problem is in what case is the SQL query more resource

974
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,320
intensive and slower than putting this on the blockchain if I'm like literally doing

975
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:35,840
card trading or something like that and the answer is almost done or I can't think of

976
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,840
one so.

977
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,880
All right the golden dragon boosted in two days ago with a row of ducks two thousand

978
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,240
two hundred and twenty two sets I'm a duck D.U.K. duck loaded with talent because I'm

979
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:52,000
wary of anything that can use licensing against its users like Copilot it seems super bad

980
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,840
that an A.I. can just grift code from users to sell time to move to another get instance

981
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:03,280
perhaps no no I mean OK so that this is one one of my great pains in life is that I'm

982
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,040
not using GitHub because I have to do a bunch of manual crap that I wouldn't have to if

983
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:12,920
I was just fully on GitHub I keep trying it I keep coming back but I think during this

984
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,920
what I consider I think we'll be calling it like a winter for tech did we give it a name

985
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,640
or boy it sure feels like it is it's going to yeah heck winter I'm looking to cut cost

986
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,440
and I know they're not a sponsor anymore but D.O. you got a low those drop prices are killing

987
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:35,640
me especially the backups you know you know this whole Copilot thing I was on hacker news

988
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:42,140
and they have this GitHub Copilot search it's both a copilot both impressive but not nearly

989
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,840
as impressive it's like a Roomba right it sure it's like that was super cool but like

990
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,780
I don't know man I have cats and dogs and like the Roomba can't do the job by itself

991
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:56,760
it just can't that's Copilot and and actually I would say the Roomba is far more impressive

992
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:02,120
and far more confident than Copilot it's like this hand wringing this pearl clutching it's

993
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:07,460
just quite using it first before you say it's the end of open source and it's going to dominate

994
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:12,640
the world and Microsoft's going to all murder away it's just not going to happen I mean

995
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:18,520
it it's it's really like clippy dude it's clippy forget it's clippy for code that's

996
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:24,120
what it is as a man who keeps rewriting clippy and calling it Alice over and over again it's

997
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:30,240
clippy all right the golden dragon double boosted in with a nice message for you another

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,760
favorite weekly podcast amongst the few I listen to thanks golden dragon becoming well

1000
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,840

1003
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:04,240
look at you guys look at you guys Lima three boosted in with 4,720 sats three days ago

1004
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,120
is why has it taken me so long to start listening to this podcast I listen to a number of other

1005
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:13,300
JB shows which I love I'm a sys admin by trade but a coder by education maybe you could

1006
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,280
throw a short segment into office hours to do a quick run through all the JB shows to

1007
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,320
help spread the word and so you don't have to guess oh for the numbers 4,720 is because

1008
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:28,680
4472 was my first episode based on the episode number keep it up that's clever you know we've

1009
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,320
been doing the show for a while and so I think as a result it just doesn't come up much on

1010
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,720
the other shows but we should try to mention him or I'm I really walk that line of try

1011
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,680
not to do too many self plugs but also making sure people know it's out there I mean like

1012
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,760
once a year you have me come on the Linux shows and I just troll people although now

1013

1027
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,840
boosting in if you'd like to send us a boost you can get a new podcast app at new podcast

1028
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:14,920
apps calm I've been using fountain FM and you do earn some sats in there with some of

1029
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,380
those supported clips so I'll have a link in the show notes if you want to try that

1030
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:24,880
out and there's also boost CLI and breeze both of which don't require switching podcast

1031
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,560
apps who CLI is obviously a command-line client and breeze is a separate app that you get

1032
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:36,260
at be our easy dot technology and you know we should think soon about maybe later this

1033
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,860
week recording a special for our members because our coder QA crew is out there and it is time

1034
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:45,040
for their coder Lee report it is it is time we should do it this week yeah maybe Thursday

1035
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,360
for I'll chat with you after we we wrap up here but that's a great way to support the

1036
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,800
show and you get an ad-free version of the show you get the coder Lee report little extra

1037
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:59,600
bonus show and soon you'll have a second feed option for the live stream coder QA dot co

1038
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,040
oh no I know watch out right mr. Dominic is there anywhere you want to send the people

1039
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,760
ah you know what go to Dominic m.com I I might actually manage another blog post this week

1040
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,960
because I've been putting torturing I mean I would say testing but uh I've been told

1041
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:21,640
that uh apparently they didn't expect me to have a prohibition style party inappropriate

1042
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:28,280
juggling at HP dev ones and now I see that uh Carl has new laptops for me to use his

1043
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:34,920
coasters so I'm just very busy definitely definitely I I've also requested a purple

1044
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,520
themed Thalia that doesn't seem to be in the offing so you know there is a very very special

1045
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,280
edition Thalia I've heard I've seen it yeah there I wonder if they'll ever sell it because

1046
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:51,600
you know I need a new OBS machine and wouldn't that be cool let me spend thousands of dollars

1047
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,120
no way right no way that's why this I'm that's why this iMac Pro is still hitting here sitting

1048
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,560
here it's literally for OBS cuz I keep going with doing that video thing we talk about

1049
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:07,120
every few months and one I can't sell this damn computer for some reason no one wants

1050
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:14,720
to buy an iMac it has an Intel but it's also like kind of the ideal production machine

1051
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:21,040
for the level of like you know just twitch production I would be doing so yeah yeah it's

1052
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:27,040
good enough it really is it's fine but then it's Mac and I'd really like to do it on Linux

1053
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,200
but then I'm like do I want to spend tons of money on another Thalia or something and

1054
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,360
the answer is no this is where I'm at right now this is where I'm at I got to figure all

1055
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:40,760
this out because my OBS machine now that we're doing video streaming into Jupiter tube it's

1056
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:47,460
barely hanging on yeah sure barely so you know we built it to do audio streaming right

1057
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:52,280
so yep well once you add video everything just and I want to do video of like my so

1058
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,300
I want to go like full like I'm learning from the 14 year old that like apparently they

1059
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:00,600
have to see your face and a little square on the bottom of the screen oh yeah yeah and

1060
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:05,240
you have to screen cap and you have to make sure you turn off notifications oh yeah because

1061
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:13,480
that IMS should get in a lot of trouble yeah oh we know we do all right how is Leo Laporte

1062
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,640
these days you know I think they're doing great over there I think they're doing just

1063
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:22,760
fine I love Leo actually all right you can follow the show at Coder Radio show like you
