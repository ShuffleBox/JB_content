This is KOTORadio, episode 324 recorded August 29th, 2018.

00:30.840 --> 00:34.520
Hi everyone and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:34.520 --> 00:39.360
pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

00:39.360 --> 00:43.280
This episode is brought to you by our two great sponsors, Linux Academy and DigitalOcean.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.320
I'll get you hip to them sponsors later on in the show.

00:46.320 --> 00:53.360
My name is Chris and joining us every single week, like the wise Yoda in the swamps, but

00:53.360 --> 00:56.280
instead of like some weird planet.

00:56.280 --> 00:57.760
No, no, it's Florida.

00:57.760 --> 00:58.760
Hello Mike.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.240
Hmm, you said not been to Florida recently.

01:01.240 --> 01:06.240
Yeah, I guess that's what I was thinking when I said that I'm like, well, it is kind of

01:06.240 --> 01:07.240
a strange planet.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.280
But you know, I know now that I'm sure we're that you're based out of Florida.

01:10.280 --> 01:13.160
We probably have a hardcore Florida fan base.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.360
I would just imagine true.

01:15.360 --> 01:21.720
That is not well, I didn't want to upset the one or two of them as it might be, even if

01:21.720 --> 01:22.720
they are family members.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.680
I didn't want to upset them, Mike.

01:24.680 --> 01:29.880
We are gathered today to do a little makeup for the audience last week since I've been

01:29.880 --> 01:30.880
sick.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.120
Yeah, we wanted to we wanted to make another episode for you.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.140
We wanted to give you something a little more something later in your week, a little more

01:36.140 --> 01:37.140
coder in your life.

01:37.140 --> 01:40.480
And we've got a good smattering of topics that we like to put together on these kinds

01:40.480 --> 01:44.920
of episodes, some some that are really just for me to troll Mike really, to be honest

01:44.920 --> 01:48.720
with you and others that I think we'll get into pretty far.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.800
Maybe we should start with what you teased in our last episode.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.320
And that was you breaking your phone, because that's probably the one everybody's expecting.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.080
So they'll not have any idea what's coming next.

01:58.080 --> 02:04.520
So let me let me set the stage thousand dollar iPhone 10 with face ID, no home button, all

02:04.520 --> 02:06.560
glass screen.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.520
Is it in a case?

02:09.520 --> 02:11.080
In a leather case, it is.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.080
Yes.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.800
Oh, I have the leather case, too.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.320
So the leather case did not prevent this disaster failed the test.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.240
So did it fall like on a rock?

02:20.240 --> 02:25.080
Like how did you get past the bun the bumper around the edge here?

02:25.080 --> 02:29.160
So it landed directly on his face on quote unquote artisanal.

02:29.160 --> 02:32.860
Yeah, basically uneven tile, right?

02:32.860 --> 02:39.520
Like tile that's intentionally uneven to feel whenever at the Brandon Mall.

02:39.520 --> 02:40.520
Thank you.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.560
It was great.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.040
So so the irony is there's a crack in the screen.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.120
That's not the worst part.

02:46.120 --> 02:50.880
I can no longer hit buttons on the top nav bar.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.880
Hmm.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.720
So it's like pretty much unusable.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.120
Yeah.

02:57.120 --> 03:01.580
Oh, Mike, you know, you're supposed to wait another couple of weeks because we're like

03:01.580 --> 03:05.560
we're like probably what seven, eight days away from announcement.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.320
I know I could literally buy a new iPhone.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.320
I get it.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.320
Yeah.

03:09.320 --> 03:15.360
So I've had this happen to you know, not not exactly a destroyed phone, but my partner

03:15.360 --> 03:25.120
hadia her phone is a is like a six s I'm not sure the seven I don't know seven maybe I

03:25.120 --> 03:27.800
don't know but it's a it's a it's a standard iPhone.

03:27.800 --> 03:33.800
It's not the it's not the eight and it has a lightning port like all iPhones do hello

03:33.800 --> 03:40.720
and when she plugs it in regardless of charger or cable or if it's like a car charger or

03:40.720 --> 03:45.800
an Apple brick it'll say charging you know boom and it's a little icon will light up

03:45.800 --> 03:51.040
that it's charging and you're good to go say it's like 20% you come back an hour later

03:51.040 --> 03:56.080
and it's like at 18% it goes down it's going down even though it's showing that it's charging

03:56.080 --> 04:00.920
it's got the little lightning bolt icon the battery is discharging and sometimes if you

04:00.920 --> 04:04.980
like unplug and replug it'll start charging back up again won't necessarily get to 100%

04:04.980 --> 04:08.680
but sometimes it does and then sometimes it stops at like 50% then you got to like pull

04:08.680 --> 04:12.200
the lightning cable out turn it and plug it back in again tried multiple cables multiple

04:12.200 --> 04:16.100
power adapters try to DC adapter.

04:16.100 --> 04:19.960
It's always exhibiting this issue and I'm like babe you got to just keep this thing

04:19.960 --> 04:23.800
going for like three more weeks you got to keep this phone going I'm not I'm not going

04:23.800 --> 04:30.400
to go buy you a brand new iPhone seven or whatever eight or whatever it is just weeks

04:30.400 --> 04:36.920
before so naturally the only solution is to buy an Android phone right.

04:36.920 --> 04:42.840
I've done nothing so far oh are you tempted to go with the Android route I was until I

04:42.840 --> 04:48.800
found out there's no comparable Android phone to buy the now the Samsung S8 is coming out

04:48.800 --> 04:54.040
shortly but there's nothing and here's the problem I'm traveling to Utah in a week and

04:54.040 --> 04:58.080
a half what from the date this will be out with no phone no you got to get a phone no

04:58.080 --> 05:03.120
I need a phone that works like this phone okay my iPhone 10 works if I'm very concerned

05:03.120 --> 05:08.720
like it's basically a dumb phone now that I have to be very sensitive and how I touch

05:08.720 --> 05:15.480
it yeah I'm living in a nightmare you could just get a feature phone you know just for

05:15.480 --> 05:19.720
like a couple of weeks although when you're traveling also slip my wrists in a bathtub

05:19.720 --> 05:25.120
you need maps and oh man yeah cuz I'm driving in Utah let me tell you Utah it's not a friendly

05:25.120 --> 05:30.680
state to me have you have you met Mormons and by the way we're once again brought to

05:30.680 --> 05:35.280
us by Malfoy gin I'm just saying Utah's not where I want to be lost Salt Lake City is

05:35.280 --> 05:38.880
not bad I tell you what I've had some good times in Salt Lake City have you cuz I've

05:38.880 --> 05:44.800
had some rough times in Salt Lake City I did get stared at a lot I did a lot of are you

05:44.800 --> 05:49.480
okay sir yeah I got a lot of that I got a lot of I got a lot of weird looks and I don't

05:49.480 --> 05:56.120
know exactly why cuz I wasn't doing anything oh I can tell you why why cuz of me cuz cuz

05:56.120 --> 06:03.520
you and I do we stand out yeah we're well how it stands out is it is it the hair what

06:03.520 --> 06:06.680
is it have you ever seen the movie have you ever seen the movie Monsters Inc it's my it's

06:06.680 --> 06:11.440
a Disney movie kids love monsters my son's current favorite yep oh man it's a good time

06:11.440 --> 06:16.680
when they get you and I are effectively hairy blue neon green monsters and yeah in Salt

06:16.680 --> 06:20.920
Lake City yeah and we're sullies is what you're saying we're walking around as giant sullies

06:20.920 --> 06:30.440
we're giant sullies and sometimes I'm Mike Wazowski like it's not what you want because

06:30.440 --> 06:35.480
I don't know I I fear Mormons and and I have relatives who've converted to the Latter-day

06:35.480 --> 06:41.240
Saints Church which is Mormonism yeah I'm terrified of them because my nightmare is

06:41.240 --> 06:47.440
a Mormon cop actually like that's things I'm afraid of it does sound scary it does sound

06:47.440 --> 06:50.960
scary I'm wondering I'm wondering if there's a show title in this somewhere but it does

06:50.960 --> 06:57.000
I follow your point I do follow you Mike fears Joseph Smith right right like yeah I mean

06:57.000 --> 07:06.200
so you you and I have ever okay can we talk about water down beer for a moment yeah okay

07:06.200 --> 07:13.400
have you ever had tap your beer in Salt Lake City the worst beer okay in the United States

07:13.400 --> 07:20.240
that is the it is it is so disappointing but to drink you know why law it's a lot like

07:20.240 --> 07:24.120
they think they have a hard cap on the right there's a municipal ordinance right on the

07:24.120 --> 07:30.800
alcohol content of beer right yeah how producers I actually think Utah is partially responsible

07:30.800 --> 07:36.360
for America's bad rap for beer because we have we have fantastic beer here in the States

07:36.360 --> 07:42.320
we have a massive microbrew culture with really good beer Tampa has 70 breweries yeah like

07:42.320 --> 07:48.400
we're yeah but we have that we have that dysfunctional situation in Utah where beer manufacturers

07:48.400 --> 07:52.800
have to make these half-assed one-cock versions of their beers which just tastes horrible

07:52.800 --> 08:01.360
I can't even describe the taste it's and it's almost like it's like just a water it tastes

08:01.360 --> 08:05.680
like this like it tastes like sadness right there's a really cuz like because there's

08:05.680 --> 08:11.920
no reason to drink it because it tastes horrible and it's like shitty soda yeah it's not beer

08:11.920 --> 08:17.880
it's not soda it's something awful in between yeah yeah I was shocked I mean I know about

08:17.880 --> 08:27.280
it but I was shocked when I die and frankly go to hell because yeah I will end up in Salt

08:27.280 --> 08:35.480
Lake City like that so like I'm not enthusiastic about this trip I'm pretty unhappy you know

08:35.480 --> 08:38.800
as long as you don't drink the beer I think Salt Lake City is pretty great you know I

08:38.800 --> 08:42.680
think it is yeah what are two martinis and wait till the cops follow you around yeah

08:42.680 --> 08:47.480
I'm just saying yeah yeah yeah it's just hostile territory we should move on from this all

08:47.480 --> 08:54.680
right so uh so your phone broke and Mike's an alcoholic but we give you yeah yeah those

08:54.680 --> 08:59.200
are the two two major points here yeah now here's the one that I don't know if we shared

08:59.200 --> 09:03.920
with the class is you and maybe you told us but I don't think you've given us the review

09:03.920 --> 09:10.400
yet recently picked up a new workstation a new portable workstation a galago 2018 you

09:10.400 --> 09:16.160
bought the original galago uh 4k had some fan issues had some temperature issues so

09:16.160 --> 09:20.800
I was surprised to hear that you went back to the new galago but from your initial impressions

09:20.800 --> 09:25.520
it sounded like they had made some revisions to the model that were pretty good so now

09:25.520 --> 09:28.560
I'm curious now that you've had them for a couple of weeks what's it been like using

09:28.560 --> 09:37.680
the new galago yeah so I got the new galago um I got the 1080p not the 3k version okay

09:37.680 --> 09:45.560
or rather 4k version apologies um and I have to say matte screens are the way to go ah

09:45.560 --> 09:51.840
the 1080p screen is matte part of it's because a lot of linux apps just don't have awesome

09:51.840 --> 09:58.280
4k coverage yeah and it's a lot more computer to drive that display too right and and just

09:58.280 --> 10:06.480
like matt is prettier the battery life is better than the 4k version is this you're gonna is

10:06.480 --> 10:12.560
this gonna be your utah rig no and I like the entrapment I like the entrapment so why

10:12.560 --> 10:20.360
is that because the product I am unveiling at utah is a windows-based product oh my mac

10:20.360 --> 10:24.160
my macbook will be my utah rig because it has a windows partition you know that tickles

10:24.160 --> 10:32.520
me right yeah that tickles me in the words of my my distant cousin bain necessary evil

10:32.520 --> 10:35.960
so this is like your office daily driver this is what you're like you know what fuck it

10:35.960 --> 10:41.000
I'm just gonna go for it all right we're gonna talk about the cute company for a moment oh

10:41.000 --> 10:48.200
oh boy I spent months writing this product in c++ to run on linux it was gonna be a huge

10:48.200 --> 10:52.320
thing for us we were gonna veil on quit radio was gonna be fabulous it was gonna be great

10:52.320 --> 10:55.480
I was gonna give you some money you could have done some ads on linux yeah that sounds

10:55.480 --> 11:05.360
good I like all those linux action news it was gonna be awesome and then capitalism oh

11:05.360 --> 11:14.980
not that again those dirty dirty money grubbing money they yeah yeah but I'm hoping to make

11:14.980 --> 11:19.680
some money yeah yeah not they want to make more money per unit than I was gonna charge

11:19.680 --> 11:25.920
per license right like I would literally owe the money every time I made a sale like what

11:25.920 --> 11:30.760
the hell is wrong with cute so you were you're buying this galago and you're thinking this

11:30.760 --> 11:36.000
is my future right here this is it like we're gonna build linux and windows cross-platform

11:36.000 --> 11:41.920
software because you know we're in the aerospace industry so yeah ignoring windows is is effectively

11:41.920 --> 11:46.760
suicide right or you got a choice that's what your customer that's what your customers run

11:46.760 --> 11:51.360
the future is going to be linux right okay like the future's next even microsoft knows

11:51.360 --> 11:58.280
that so right so I'm thinking okay we'll write it in cute for linux and then we'll like effectively

11:58.280 --> 12:05.320
back the work to windows all right and I spent three days in and we talked about in a previous

12:05.320 --> 12:11.960
episode in dll hell making it all work yeah and it worked it was fabulous right everything

12:11.960 --> 12:18.560
worked we have a fully functioning binary that written in cute that's awesome feels

12:18.560 --> 12:26.120
good business deal with the cute company just like it was basically if I can channel my

12:26.120 --> 12:33.640
new jersey roots here and forgive me itunes go get your fucking shine box kid we just

12:33.640 --> 12:41.280
don't make enough money for them to even care to deal with us yeah it's it's crazy that

12:41.280 --> 12:46.800
is an old saying go get your shine box kid that is so jersey it is very jersey I like

12:46.800 --> 12:53.480
how you cleaned it up so we ended up in this position where while linux is the future windows

12:53.480 --> 12:59.880
is a requirement for right now to go it seems like that's yeah we're already committed we're

12:59.880 --> 13:05.720
already we're already like married to the show I can't back out I'm I'm hooked yeah

13:05.720 --> 13:12.720
man so rewritten in dot net it was what do you think about windows 10 dual booting on

13:12.720 --> 13:20.360
the galago I haven't done it yet I bet you it works better than it does on the macbook

13:20.360 --> 13:24.600
you know I wonder why you say that because it's because it's garbage on the macbook first

13:24.600 --> 13:30.760
of all the camp isn't that terrible it is it is like the fans are crap like this your

13:30.760 --> 13:34.880
macbook constantly is way too hot it's because there's no thermal management under windows

13:34.880 --> 13:38.440
until you start getting to the really critical stuff it's just never has felt right it's

13:38.440 --> 13:43.320
just like the bootcamp drivers are trash they're just the worst software you gotta you gotta

13:43.320 --> 13:48.720
run that one single executable to install everything and they're all garbage and at

13:48.720 --> 13:53.200
the end of it you get a machine that's got like a somewhat less functional trackpad poor

13:53.200 --> 13:58.440
thermal management it just feels like forced on there but the galago I mean that's just

13:58.440 --> 14:04.160
standard Intel hardware with a standard thermal system and a standard fan management system

14:04.160 --> 14:09.960
like it's all just Intel spec so Windows 10 would just work with natively with all that

14:09.960 --> 14:16.440
stuff you know because you know there's models of that galago sold by other OEMs that are

14:16.440 --> 14:21.600
running Windows you know so I so so this is the sick irony of this whole problem I would

14:21.600 --> 14:26.720
have bought a galago with a bigger hard drive had I known true right right right I do recall

14:26.720 --> 14:30.840
you kind of got a smaller one because you didn't need a big one but but you asked me

14:30.840 --> 14:34.440
about the galago and I decided to go on a rant about cute those money-grubbing pricks

14:34.440 --> 14:41.080
from Boston the literal worst place in the United States other than Salt Lake City so

14:41.080 --> 14:45.360
we should continue on so you're liking it though for what it is I'm liking it you keep

14:45.360 --> 14:51.520
pop on there did you switch off pop what's going on I'm on pop I am running basically

14:51.520 --> 14:58.320
an environment that is effectively as close to the stock as you can get and I want to

14:58.320 --> 15:03.840
hedge that a little because I've done some changes hmm I did get really drunk one night

15:03.840 --> 15:11.320
sure and mess with your computer install Katie I installed plasma oh Chris I installed plasma

15:11.320 --> 15:17.020
yeah it's tempting I know and let me tell you something oh plasma is not just tempting

15:17.020 --> 15:21.240
plasmas leave your wife and kids and never look back yeah you can lose a lot of time

15:21.240 --> 15:28.000
you couldn't yeah plasma is nice I I question the wisdom of pot being based on no after

15:28.000 --> 15:32.560
looking at plasma you know I had a I had a I had a back and forth on Twitter with a journalist

15:32.560 --> 15:38.120
at Forbes who's been today before we go to the show that has been trying out a bunch

15:38.120 --> 15:42.200
of different Linux distros and he just popped on plasma and loves it too and I'll tell you

15:42.200 --> 15:46.520
if you if you try it and you like it it's it kind of behooves you to install kabuntu

15:46.520 --> 15:51.240
or another spin that is plasma first so that way it's a little cleaner like you know terminal

15:51.240 --> 15:55.320
launches the right call you know the cute version of it and all it is it is a great

15:55.320 --> 15:59.800
desktop system I agree it is nice you throw that on there you got a nice screen you got

15:59.800 --> 16:05.060
a good keyboard that's a it's a good setup it sounds like how's the heat how's the heat

16:05.060 --> 16:12.320
and fan how's that so this is where we get into some conversation so I still have I was

16:12.320 --> 16:18.840
able to repair my damaged original galago now it's slightly damaged still so we can

16:18.840 --> 16:28.620
take this a grain of salt my subjective analysis is that the fan on the non-high dpi new galaco

16:28.620 --> 16:36.320
comes up much less frequently that makes sense but it does come up oh and the battery life

16:36.320 --> 16:47.800
while being better is not like macbook good or macbook pro good it's it's good enough

16:47.800 --> 16:55.360
right that's what I would say I follow that's a little disappointing but I follow it yeah

16:55.360 --> 17:00.760
it's I'm happy with the machine I'm not in love with it you know if I put it against

17:00.760 --> 17:06.860
my 50 I mean it's unfair to put it against my 15 inch macbook pro with a designated graphics

17:06.860 --> 17:15.340
card but it like it's weird it has a better keyboard for sure but the battery life definitely

17:15.340 --> 17:20.880
suffers and I was wondering so would you say so I know you you kind of you bought a pretty

17:20.880 --> 17:25.560
reasonable one for me because I would want some storage for multiple distros and stuff

17:25.560 --> 17:33.640
like that for me in fact that price is mine like a 2161 dollars do you feel like that's

17:33.640 --> 17:37.560
a fair price for the rig would you would you spend that kind of money on it for more storage

17:37.560 --> 17:48.640
and an i7 it has the i7 with 32 gigs of ram is that is it a 2100 computer it I think it

17:48.640 --> 17:55.960
is it so so this is a you're getting to a fundamental problem I'm having of should laptops

17:55.960 --> 18:05.920
be a main development computer or not and what I'm realizing is you know maybe Mac versus

18:05.920 --> 18:13.120
Linux is not that important I mean Windows is garbage because it's Windows but I'm just

18:13.120 --> 18:21.160
kidding folks like let me give you an example I put like right now I'm broadcasting on my

18:21.160 --> 18:30.200
MacBook Pro right the minute I plug it into my monitor eight down clocks so and I mostly

18:30.200 --> 18:35.600
work in clamshell mode plugged into a monitor or monitor mode using the laptop screen as

18:35.600 --> 18:42.080
a second monitor it and that's not a Mac problem at most computers do that I think the Gallego

18:42.080 --> 18:49.320
will do that so is that a reasonable computer I guess if you intend to use it as a laptop

18:49.320 --> 18:55.560
but I would almost question and more question myself than you do you need does your portable

18:55.560 --> 19:03.400
computer need to be that powerful like have we approached this question in the wrong way

19:03.400 --> 19:09.440
I think the assumptions always been more powers better see battery life is becoming a bigger

19:09.440 --> 19:16.200
and bigger issue for me I feel like my dual core XPS 13 is way too slow these days web

19:16.200 --> 19:21.120
pages are not loading fast enough electron apps are too laggy like a booth still fine

19:21.120 --> 19:25.600
shuts down super fast like the disk seems fine like doing updates packages installing

19:25.600 --> 19:32.640
all perfectly fine but I do feel like I'm getting leg in the UI on both Chrome and Firefox

19:32.640 --> 19:37.560
a lot more these days to the point where sometimes it makes it a little annoying to use and even

19:37.560 --> 19:41.040
to the point where sometimes I've even seen input delay when I'm like filling out a form

19:41.040 --> 19:46.120
or something like that so that is not fast enough and so that's why I've decided to get

19:46.120 --> 19:52.120
a ThinkPad T 480 myself it's ordered now it is ordered and I think it's gonna take him

19:52.120 --> 19:56.640
like three weeks to make it because it's a custom order and that's gonna be a 14 inch

19:56.640 --> 20:02.360
screen but with you know pretty high-end components because I was trying to get the most out of

20:02.360 --> 20:08.920
this XPS 13 I could but it really has just felt too slow and because I'm pushing it so

20:08.920 --> 20:13.040
often the fan has been going so much now that it sounds like that the fans starting to grind

20:13.040 --> 20:17.920
like the fans going out it's only got one fan in it so if it goes I don't know what's

20:17.920 --> 20:22.560
gonna happen that's that so that was sort of my threshold you know I didn't have like

20:22.560 --> 20:27.340
a like a metric I was trying to figure out a metric to measure some benchmarks or something

20:27.340 --> 20:32.340
that I could get some data around and I couldn't I never got there even on unplugged I asked

20:32.340 --> 20:36.680
the audience I'm like what do you guys use like what tools and I talked about open benchmark

20:36.680 --> 20:40.280
and how you could use that but it just didn't really work it was at the end of the day I'm

20:40.280 --> 20:44.800
like this computer just doesn't feel fast enough I'm waiting around too often for this

20:44.800 --> 20:49.440
computer and then part of it is because the web applications the damn electron and web

20:49.440 --> 20:54.740
apps have just gotten bigger and I'm not really doing anything different other than just running

20:54.740 --> 21:03.200
more complex online applications it's yeah so I and yeah so that I went with the t480

21:03.200 --> 21:09.200
although I was I did consider the galago for a bit it's a it's also a great machine so

21:09.200 --> 21:13.000
and I'm glad to hear that it seems like it's better overall I would be curious now how

21:13.000 --> 21:19.840
Windows 10 works on that thing yeah I might have to do I mean that the problem I'm facing

21:19.840 --> 21:26.280
is my dogs also hate the cute they're barking at you right now yeah like I don't want to

21:26.280 --> 21:32.760
like badge on cue like I said last episode I have invited a rep from the cute company

21:32.760 --> 21:40.840
come on and they have not responded I there is no reason I should be doing major WPF

21:40.840 --> 21:47.840
done that development other than as a small business I can't afford their license right

21:47.840 --> 21:51.640
they sort of forced your hand on what tool you're going right they gave me no choice

21:51.640 --> 21:56.240
because I'm already married to the show we talked about it I think last episode in Utah

21:56.240 --> 22:05.460
or was it this episode I have no idea in my sadness with their water down there yeah it

22:05.460 --> 22:12.520
it seems weird to me that we don't have a first class completely open source Windows

22:12.520 --> 22:17.240
slash Linux cross platform software development platform well I guess we do supposedly it's

22:17.240 --> 22:21.360
just not the one you wanted it's the hero you needed but not the one you wanted which

22:21.360 --> 22:27.280
one is it that I want done well you wanted to use cute but dotnet is offering you a solution

22:27.280 --> 22:30.000
it's just not the one well and this is the irony and this is where I want to take this

22:30.000 --> 22:37.040
conversation ironically the Xamarin right now you can compile to GTK sharp and one on

22:37.040 --> 22:44.240
Linux yes right right so the answer to my question is actually dotnet yeah it feels

22:44.240 --> 22:52.320
weird like it feels like a cringe you know I get a little nauseous it feels it feels

22:52.320 --> 22:57.080
odd because I think about Q and I think that's like so you know that's the KDE project that's

22:57.080 --> 23:02.600
in the Linux ecosystem but it turns out that they're like more hostile to a small development

23:02.600 --> 23:11.240
shop that wants to be Linux focused then Microsoft which is like weird you know so I'll pick

23:11.240 --> 23:16.240
up on that a sec but I'll say this just as an aside is I have always heard rumblings

23:16.240 --> 23:20.160
of the licensing around cute it's really strange it's something you'd look into it's a concern

23:20.160 --> 23:25.880
and I never really got any specifics on it until this event and I think I think so I

23:25.880 --> 23:30.520
know it I know this it has a rep but it's really always been very vague and it turns

23:30.520 --> 23:36.660
out you don't really find out let me take it for you exciting and there are two types

23:36.660 --> 23:41.040
of licenses there's a straight commercial where you pay per developer which is expensive

23:41.040 --> 23:45.000
but kind of reasonable it's like taking a merchant advance loan it's really expensive

23:45.000 --> 23:52.400
but you get how they got there yeah the problem I hit is that they felt and I was cringing

23:52.400 --> 23:58.920
at the developer license is that they felt what we were doing and I'll in a few weeks

23:58.920 --> 24:04.440
so I'll be talking about the product on the show they considered it an embedded product

24:04.440 --> 24:09.680
even though it's running on you know straight Debian and straight Windows 10 they considered

24:09.680 --> 24:17.840
it an embedded product which they have a per unit license fee plus an initial cost which

24:17.840 --> 24:22.120
was completely unsustainable for sure and they considered using it in this manner was

24:22.120 --> 24:30.040
an obvious violation of the LG PL no matter how we do so that okay that does that does

24:30.040 --> 24:33.600
clear it up so that that left us and it because people have been tweeting at me that left

24:33.600 --> 24:38.280
me in a position of if I went forward and just like a sort of the LG PL yeah you know

24:38.280 --> 24:43.160
I can't go to court against Q right in win because I don't I just don't have the capital

24:43.160 --> 24:47.800
I just don't have enough money my whole product that I've been working on for months would

24:47.800 --> 24:54.000
be open source and I would just like not be able to sell it philosophy aside that's just

24:54.000 --> 24:59.320
not the model I'm working on yeah yeah so yeah I mean if that I mean feel free to ask

24:59.320 --> 25:03.160
any questions you want Chris I mean that but that's like the long and short of it well

25:03.160 --> 25:06.100
I'll do this let's take a moment and thank digital ocean and then I'll come back and

25:06.100 --> 25:12.520
ask do dot co slash coder that's where you go to sign up for a $100 free credit for new

25:12.520 --> 25:16.360
accounts over digital ocean and then you can try out the platform for 60 days with that

25:16.360 --> 25:19.760
$100 credit try out one of their mix and match droplets where you can set up the different

25:19.760 --> 25:24.200
resources that you need for your specific application one of their high CPU or high

25:24.200 --> 25:28.520
memory droplets that's why over a million developers trust digital ocean because they

25:28.520 --> 25:33.400
make it so easy and so quick to get started which means you go from hey I got an idea

25:33.400 --> 25:38.520
to it's actually up on the web and ready to test in five minutes and that kind of compression

25:38.520 --> 25:43.060
of time means you actually get to do it you actually get to try it and you build momentum

25:43.060 --> 25:46.920
so quickly with these projects it really makes the difference and you can get started with

25:46.920 --> 25:52.200
a $100 credit at do dot co slash coder they have industry leading price to performance

25:52.200 --> 25:58.920
an example my favorite rig three cents an hour beautiful four gigs of RAM two CPUs 80

25:58.920 --> 26:03.520
gigabytes of enterprise grade SSD three terabytes of transfer and you can get it going in less

26:03.520 --> 26:08.480
than 55 seconds you can do an entire deployment of an application stack or you can just deploy

26:08.480 --> 26:13.160
the base system and get started plus they have a lot of really good documentation to

26:13.160 --> 26:17.020
help you get even further with digital ocean just a couple of days ago they posted how

26:17.020 --> 26:23.160
to use node.js and github webhooks to keep your remote projects in sync you could get

26:23.160 --> 26:26.980
this running on a digital ocean droplet take care of this for you and man this is nice

26:26.980 --> 26:31.680
looking and one of the beautiful things about digital ocean just real gorgeous number all

26:31.680 --> 26:37.080
over there is their tutorials really well crafted well put together not only I mean

26:37.080 --> 26:41.600
not just from like a structure standpoint but from a formatting standpoint to to really

26:41.600 --> 26:45.840
make it clear this is code this is something that needs to go to config file and then it's

26:45.840 --> 26:51.560
all itemized out to it's the best documentation on the web so try it all out by going to do

26:51.560 --> 26:57.020
dot co slash coder and a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the coder radio

26:57.020 --> 27:02.360
program so I guess my question to you is this how big of an oh shit moment did you have

27:02.360 --> 27:08.000
when all this math comes to okay this is why I bought the galago shit now I can't use that

27:08.000 --> 27:12.980
oh crap we've already committed to present at this show in Utah and now that the demo

27:12.980 --> 27:18.600
app that we have built we can't use and we got to come up with something else and we

27:18.600 --> 27:22.880
have a couple of weeks to do it like how big of an oh shit moment was that for you let's

27:22.880 --> 27:27.800
just say those those boxers will never see the light of a lot of poo came out yeah it

27:27.800 --> 27:36.860
was a bad situation I mean and it was yeah oh man that must have been a really stressful

27:36.860 --> 27:42.200
couple of days I imagine it was rough I'm sorry dude I can only cheese and my coder

27:42.200 --> 27:50.440
therapy sessions were canceled I know right right so it was but the whole application

27:50.440 --> 27:56.340
got rewritten and it's frankly done now in dot net so you bet how much writing of dot

27:56.340 --> 28:05.560
net have you been doing on Linux itself some okay a little bit so how much so just a little

28:05.560 --> 28:12.760
bit well so like back in logic is back in logic right the the places where you get into

28:12.760 --> 28:22.800
trouble is the user interface I imagine that is very much the case actually yeah yeah yeah

28:22.800 --> 28:29.920
so like yeah so you you tease me with some large-scale WPF development I'm assuming then

28:29.920 --> 28:35.520
that this is all part of this this is part of this yes the application it's a WPF application

28:35.520 --> 28:43.800
which you know we had platform UNO on a few weeks ago they do not currently support WPF

28:43.800 --> 28:49.520
the irony though is in parallel to all of this Xamarin the little the little busy bees

28:49.520 --> 28:56.640
over there have been working on a GTK sharp compile point and a WPF file point compile

28:56.640 --> 29:05.480
point rather so this may all be able to be rectified by simply refactoring a bit from

29:05.480 --> 29:12.360
WPF native to Xamarin okay that's not like you know it's not terrible yeah it's not like

29:12.360 --> 29:16.640
writing yeah that's that's recoverable you know this is another way to put that the C

29:16.640 --> 29:23.320
sharp code goes into the garbage I mean start the C++ code from Q has already gone into

29:23.320 --> 29:30.720
the garbage which is kind of disappointing I think I hear your MacBook over there working

29:30.720 --> 29:36.360
hard right now my MacBooks real upset you're not running Windows on that thing are you

29:36.360 --> 29:44.520
I'm not it's just running Firefox and Chrome one Chrome tab like I hate I hate computers

29:44.520 --> 29:48.920
right now I can't even you know all I have to say all laptops kind of suck right now

29:48.920 --> 29:54.360
yeah yeah it's the best machine is the machine down on the on the floor with a monitor and

29:54.360 --> 29:59.720
keyboard like attached to it yeah I have to say it's you know I know system 76 supposedly

29:59.720 --> 30:04.520
is coming out with a desktop their manufacturing Colorado yeah Apple in 2019 may or may not

30:04.520 --> 30:08.720
have a Mac Pro right I think those are gonna be the two machines I looked at I'm just getting

30:08.720 --> 30:13.880
real tired of worrying about thermals I mean yeah yeah battery life and just you know what

30:13.880 --> 30:18.560
like get a Chromebook get 12 hours of battery life and that's your expectation I just I'm

30:18.560 --> 30:22.600
so there and maybe this will finally solve our problems that we've been having with these

30:22.600 --> 30:27.560
things like I'm here recording I'm thinking to myself you know I my best machines in the

30:27.560 --> 30:33.120
studio have been these desktops because they last for like five or six years to running

30:33.120 --> 30:38.300
24-7 laptops don't hold up to that and these things never get a break they're always going

30:38.300 --> 30:42.120
they're always on always ready to record and they're still great they're still reliable

30:42.120 --> 30:49.000
and they still feel fast no I I I I mean my laptop dream and I can hear my fan through

30:49.000 --> 30:53.820
my headphones I can hear and it's a Mac it's not even the Galaga yeah I can't even say

30:53.820 --> 30:58.240
it's like I know has a bad thing it's the fricking MacBook yeah yeah it's that Chrome

30:58.240 --> 31:02.220
tab the Chrome tab eats up the CPU it's the one tab I'm running with you to do the show

31:02.220 --> 31:10.520
right like yep yeah it's there's there's so much wrong with the way things are right now

31:10.520 --> 31:15.880
I don't know no but but at all all kidding aside right like I am deeply disappointed

31:15.880 --> 31:22.120
that the that the stuff with Q didn't work out yeah man I could only imagine like I mean

31:22.120 --> 31:26.600
you got you know not only do you have like this this like like the sensation oh man I

31:26.600 --> 31:30.480
bet on the wrong horse but also like now you got it you got to do this whole like what

31:30.480 --> 31:35.080
are we gonna do now how long did it take for you to sort of refactor was it was it was

31:35.080 --> 31:40.000
it a was it sort of an a B thing as in well we have no other choice but this or was there

31:40.000 --> 31:45.120
some sitting around thinking what do we do can we LDL this thing can we there was it

31:45.120 --> 31:49.880
yeah there there so a lot of things happen in parallel there was an initial version of

31:49.880 --> 31:55.840
this written in Xamarin actually ah okay and it was well do we just do we just embrace

31:55.840 --> 32:02.520
Xamarin right it's a Marion whatever you want to call it right that that got effectively

32:02.520 --> 32:09.320
vetoed by me because splitting average garbage yeah right like well Xamarin is not garbage

32:09.320 --> 32:15.960
I take it back but like Xamarin for the high performance error space use case is a tough

32:15.960 --> 32:25.240
choice right now so we ended up going with WPF taking some of the C sharp logic over

32:25.240 --> 32:31.000
for the Xamarin version and that was purely a practical decision of our potential end

32:31.000 --> 32:35.960
customers in this industry ultimately while they're moving to Linux they ultimately initially

32:35.960 --> 32:43.280
care about Windows and WPF is a technology like we looked at Avalon rather Avalon UI

32:43.280 --> 32:49.960
which is an open source UI project to bring a UWP to all the platforms we looked at platform

32:49.960 --> 32:56.540
Uno but ultimately as a small company working in a big space I felt that I very strongly

32:56.540 --> 33:01.960
that I need to mitigate the fear right to sell our product come back to the mic come

33:01.960 --> 33:07.120
back to the mic so yeah you fear of the team or fear of the customer fear of the customer

33:07.120 --> 33:11.620
right okay so the customer look at that sideways and go what the hell is this right so we ended

33:11.620 --> 33:19.120
up rewriting the UI and WPF ah so to make it safer essentially to the customer nobody

33:19.120 --> 33:27.360
gets fired for buying a WPF app right oh man that's true yeah so we ended up going in that

33:27.360 --> 33:38.320
direction huh seems pretty rational it seems sad yeah a compromise I would have preferred

33:38.320 --> 33:47.160
to even go UWP to be honest you know I feel like in some way not that this is the double

33:47.160 --> 33:54.200
episode of picking on Q but Q is somehow like ignoring a market that would be willing to

33:54.200 --> 34:00.640
pay them several hundred dollars a month yeah I have also heard that sentiment from others

34:00.640 --> 34:05.920
yeah like I would have been much happier coming on the show today and saying we are a Linux

34:05.920 --> 34:12.120
shop we're running C++ yes we cross compile to the windows and yes we you know 90 percent

34:12.120 --> 34:17.760
of our customers are using Windows devices but you know we're a Linux shop but in reality

34:17.760 --> 34:22.680
the licensing fees were just unacceptable I'm curious as to what you've heard I've definitely

34:22.680 --> 34:27.280
heard that they could come up with something that is way more compelling to small business

34:27.280 --> 34:32.260
and solve a lot of this that is that is a sentiment I've heard from people at conferences

34:32.260 --> 34:37.000
a lot where I've gotten a lot of the side by grousing that never was quite clear to

34:37.000 --> 34:42.200
me until we've had our conversation I'll tell you man I'll take the liable liable suit yes

34:42.200 --> 34:48.040
I'll tell you know things can change but it sort of doesn't matter like the window of

34:48.040 --> 34:52.120
opportunity like let's just I was just thinking like maybe down the road they'll come up with

34:52.120 --> 34:56.800
some sort of like small business competitive offering but because you know really the reason

34:56.800 --> 35:03.360
why I think that'd be great is cute is stronger as a platform the more of it that is out there

35:03.360 --> 35:06.680
the more the more people that are shipping cute apps the more people that are developing

35:06.680 --> 35:13.280
cute software the larger the community though just what is the right word to put it it's

35:13.280 --> 35:17.480
a it's a it's there's a tangible benefit that's probably the way to put it there's a real

35:17.480 --> 35:23.080
tangible benefit to the cute company for more people to be shipping cute apps so it would

35:23.080 --> 35:27.920
seem like if the opportunity came up for them to say okay here's a small business here's

35:27.920 --> 35:31.720
a small business package that would be a very compelling offering that would probably get

35:31.720 --> 35:37.000
a lot of traction but it's it's too little too late for you isn't it well it's a done

35:37.000 --> 35:42.200
deal right I mean I I'm going to demo the software in a week and a half now and we're

35:42.200 --> 35:47.960
by the time this is on the RSS feed probably less than a week so it's yeah I mean we're

35:47.960 --> 35:51.640
married to dotnet we're married to C sharp you're already going to the event as far as

35:51.640 --> 35:56.840
it's concerned really I mean you're right I mean even if this product fails it would

35:56.840 --> 36:02.680
be hard for us to go to Q and and frankly I think this product is going to do okay well

36:02.680 --> 36:06.000
I hope so that sounds from what I've heard off air it sounds pretty cool I'll take a

36:06.000 --> 36:09.480
moment and I want to thank Linux Academy they have something really cool going on starting

36:09.480 --> 36:15.000

37:33.880 --> 37:42.000
for sponsoring this here program so if you ever you ever fantasize about like what if

37:42.000 --> 37:48.920
you're in a totally different field and I have yeah yeah what's yours what would be

37:48.920 --> 37:55.200
your like if like you know a universe be version of Mike that never becomes a developer you

37:55.200 --> 38:00.080
know what would your teacher school teacher school teacher poetry wow school I could do

38:00.080 --> 38:06.560
teaching definitely I I feel like I worry for me that it'd be something like sales you

38:06.560 --> 38:10.400
know like I get into sales or something because I think you do have that voice yeah I sell

38:10.400 --> 38:16.600
yeah yeah yeah you're a seller that's so I mean it would just be horrible like no offense

38:16.600 --> 38:21.440
to salesman because a good salesman is a very valuable thing no a lot of offense to salesman

38:21.440 --> 38:25.940
cause I have not yet to meet a good one keep going you're talking to one no I'm telling

38:25.940 --> 38:29.840
you like I worry that's what it would be but I think it'd be like a like a used car salesman

38:29.840 --> 38:35.120
or something horrible if I had a fantasy we're like it would never work out it would be running

38:35.120 --> 38:41.480
my own barbecue you know like a like a hole in the wall slow-cooked pit barbecue where

38:41.480 --> 38:47.840
I just have a like a stable customer base that comes in on the weekdays for lunch and

38:47.840 --> 38:52.320
I only serve lunch and dinner and then and then maybe start doing a little breakfast

38:52.320 --> 38:56.960
do you have a liquor license I mean I think I do in this fantasy yeah well then I'm there

38:56.960 --> 39:00.660
baby I'm your best customer I think I would I think I would run a pretty good barbecue

39:00.660 --> 39:05.000
place I'd only have a few things at first you know keep it real focused real narrow

39:05.000 --> 39:09.560
and nail those products that's my fantasy but I got to tell you I think the reality

39:09.560 --> 39:15.960
is I'd be I'd be like a software engineer sales lead or something it's like the worst

39:15.960 --> 39:19.880
job on the planet because I already went into IT so I've got to avoid that but you know

39:19.880 --> 39:24.240
and I'm already in broadcasting now and so I got to avoid that so it'd have to be I mean

39:24.240 --> 39:27.080
that's you know that's a couple of that's a couple of my go-tos that I can't choose

39:27.080 --> 39:33.760
from so you could tell us audience what you think our alternative universe careers are

39:33.760 --> 39:38.160
by going to coder.show slash contact and if you got a good one I'll try to read it on

39:38.160 --> 39:42.160
a future episode of the Coder Radio program our record schedule is gonna be a little funky

39:42.160 --> 39:45.320
for the next bit because you heard their mics traveling and doing this thing and it's a

39:45.320 --> 39:49.560
long event and he's gonna be gone for a bit so when we get an opportunity we'll do some

39:49.560 --> 39:53.840
doubles and we'll keep the feed going so go to coder.show slash subscribe for all the

39:53.840 --> 39:56.160
ways to get new episodes.

39:56.160 --> 39:59.760
Now before we wrap do you have any like tools or like tool chain stuff you want to cover

39:59.760 --> 40:04.040
because we always tend to do that when we do these doubles any new I mean we mentioned

40:04.040 --> 40:08.360
scoop last week so we can't use that mentioned scoop last week any tools you've been working

40:08.360 --> 40:13.920
with in this process or anything like that yeah kind of so geez I don't even know if

40:13.920 --> 40:20.080
I want to mention this but I took a quick look at a oh geez what did get pod or oh yeah

40:20.080 --> 40:25.520
get pod.io that's what it is I'll drop a link in the show notes yeah drop a link they're

40:25.520 --> 40:30.800
in beta yet yeah I've heard about this yeah they're one of these cloud IDEs and I looked

40:30.800 --> 40:35.320
at it in the content let me give you some context again I have an 11 year old brother

40:35.320 --> 40:39.240
now and I and he's interested in learning coding so you know but he's in New Jersey

40:39.240 --> 40:46.640
I'm in Florida so you know there's some challenge there right like working with him on assignments

40:46.640 --> 40:52.880
this is a cloud IDE that integrates directly with github it seems pretty powerful I've

40:52.880 --> 40:57.320
played with it some it reminds me a lot of remember cloud nine we featured a few years

40:57.320 --> 41:03.640
ago yes yeah it seems like a cloud nine on steroids the catch here is they only support

41:03.640 --> 41:11.960
so many languages okay very few actually so javascript java python go php rust ruby

41:11.960 --> 41:21.040
c and c++ json docker and obviously html and c it says they don't support much else but

41:21.040 --> 41:26.720
they they directly tie into a github get flow workflow yeah that's like their key feature

41:26.720 --> 41:30.160
really yeah so so to me I mean this is not how they build themselves and I would love

41:30.160 --> 41:34.880
to have someone from get pod on the show to explain it to me but to me this is the ultimate

41:34.880 --> 41:43.280
teaching tool for a oh you know a child like like my brother sure huh yeah so it's it's

41:43.280 --> 41:46.160
it's tightly integrated with github it's where you start actually with this you have to use

41:46.160 --> 41:50.240
get up right it's it's you have no choice yeah and then they have an enterprise version

41:50.240 --> 41:54.920
that you can host yourself but that's you know this is pretty cool though how's the

41:54.920 --> 41:59.400
how's the ui all that stuff it's pretty usable you know it reminds me of vs code like it's

41:59.400 --> 42:06.360
okay honestly i we've experienced some latency issues my brother is running a older macbook

42:06.360 --> 42:15.280
that i gave him uh like a 20 oh geez let's say a 2014 macbook pro 13 inch uh with a kick

42:15.280 --> 42:20.920
as a ram but you know he i give him my hand me down he's doing like it works for him fine

42:20.920 --> 42:24.080
yeah he's right you know he's right you know how you mean you remember kids right i'm sure

42:24.080 --> 42:27.760
you have dylan you know they're writing their little games right whatever it's you know

42:27.760 --> 42:32.080
yep yeah yeah they're fine with it his laptop is not a performance machine at all and he's

42:32.080 --> 42:36.400
fine with it i mean yeah i'm sure as he gets older he'll want something faster but yeah

42:36.400 --> 42:41.000
this is nice and so it's got an integrated chat too and it makes it yeah it doesn't make

42:41.000 --> 42:45.320
it clear who's working on what portion and whatnot it does i find it works significantly

42:45.320 --> 42:50.720
better in chrome than firefly uh-huh i've had a few of the little yeah which is a little

42:50.720 --> 42:56.880
annoying to me but other than that it's it's a uh i mean it's pretty powerful my brother

42:56.880 --> 43:01.560
and i like i can't speak to the go support or the java support we've been working mostly

43:01.560 --> 43:08.280
in ecma script slash javascript um but yeah and also it supports python so any of the

43:08.280 --> 43:14.840
other parents out there i know 99.99 percent of our listeners are um frankly corrupted

43:14.840 --> 43:22.520
by the snake and love python so yeah does not support ruby though somehow uh oh right

43:22.520 --> 43:31.080
it does oh oh it doesn't support it partially supports ruby yeah i have uh i have been i

43:31.080 --> 43:36.160
have been using chrome more and more again because of several applications and sites

43:36.160 --> 43:40.600
that i use that just seem like they slow down the firefox ui the whole browser ui gets

43:40.600 --> 43:46.200
all laggy i've been having since i've been working on my mac for this wpf project because

43:46.200 --> 43:52.000
yay visual studio for mac and vmware um i've been having stability issues in firefox because

43:52.000 --> 43:58.400
of just like certain applications seem to just require chrome and and it it reminds

43:58.400 --> 44:04.960
me of ie6 i don't i don't i hate saying that because it feels very old manny but i mean

44:04.960 --> 44:09.120
come on chris you remember like what's best than i yeah yeah like yeah oh yeah oh yeah

44:09.120 --> 44:14.840
i do oh yeah i do yeah i'll give you a couple of tools that i've been using just really

44:14.840 --> 44:20.880
quickly um i guess i'll really one um but i've been using it to use multiple tools and

44:20.880 --> 44:24.200
uh you may know about it but i'm going to remind you in case you've forgotten it's called

44:24.200 --> 44:30.840
nata fire nata fire makes any web page into essentially an electron app um oh sure yeah

44:30.840 --> 44:36.760
but it's great because so you know you can point nata fire mail.google.com and i can

44:36.760 --> 44:41.280
have multiples with different icons and different logins and in their own individual windows

44:41.280 --> 44:45.600
which i find really great for managing multiple gmail accounts or whatnot and it's just really

44:45.600 --> 44:52.420
simple because it pulls down like their uh web app icon so you can you know you can actually

44:52.420 --> 44:58.800
use the official logo icon for the application and it works on uh i think all the platforms

44:58.800 --> 45:03.440
i mean i've obviously been using it on linux but uh i yeah their github page shows it on

45:03.440 --> 45:08.080
a mac and it's nice it's simple sounds like you've probably heard of it before mike and

45:08.080 --> 45:12.320
it just essentially wraps up websites and electron which i know that's everybody's favorite

45:12.320 --> 45:17.920
thing but if it gets a heavily used web application out of a tab in my web browser and lets me

45:17.920 --> 45:25.520
have my own set of credentials in that window and all of that it's a win for me so yeah

45:25.520 --> 45:30.040
i'll link to that too yeah sounds yeah no that's really good in the notes it'll all

45:30.040 --> 45:34.280
be a coder.show slash three two four is this which which episode is this yeah three two

45:34.280 --> 45:39.200
four two four they run together yeah so i've been i've just plugged in like a few different

45:39.200 --> 45:43.600
google apps into that and a couple other things that i just i find that to be intensely useful

45:43.600 --> 45:46.340
there's a couple others out there we talked about another one on linux unplugged this

45:46.340 --> 45:51.880
week but mr dominic i that was my tool um i don't really i don't really have much others

45:51.880 --> 45:56.520
other than grousing about firefox which i i could do for a whole nother episode but

45:56.520 --> 46:01.520
yeah i want firefox to be better than it is yeah yeah i just want it to be great because

46:01.520 --> 46:06.940
i want there to be that strong competition and i want a company like mozilla to be putting

46:06.940 --> 46:10.960
a product out there where their primary motivation is an open web and not commercial dominance

46:10.960 --> 46:15.700
of the internet so google frankly scares me yeah yeah and their and their leverage of

46:15.700 --> 46:22.960
chrome is one of the scarier aspects of google right now so it is a big problem oh too bad

46:22.960 --> 46:28.080
it seems to i mean it just seems to work better for me and i find that intensely frustrating

46:28.080 --> 46:33.580
i feel that way about mac os oh oh oh i'm sticking with firefox for now but when i'm

46:33.580 --> 46:37.160
on other platforms other than linux i tend to use chrome more i don't know all right

46:37.160 --> 46:41.320
mr dominic uh give somebody something else to go get if they want a little more mic in

46:41.320 --> 46:46.600
their life during the week uh go to add to my twitter and at the mad butter.com hey how

46:46.600 --> 46:52.300
about that you can follow me i'm at chris las the whole network is at jupiter signal

46:52.300 --> 46:57.160
and of course we have the subreddit coderadio.reddit.com try to check that before each episode and

46:57.160 --> 47:13.320
our main show site at coder.show thanks for being here see you next week
