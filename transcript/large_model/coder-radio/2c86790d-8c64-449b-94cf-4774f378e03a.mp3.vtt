00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Kota Radio, episode 379, for September 14th, 2020.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello, friends, and welcome to Kota Radio,

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
taking a pragmatic look at the art

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
and business of software development

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
and the world of technology.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Tech moves fast, and so does ACG.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Their courses and labs are always online

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
and obsessively updated.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Plus, they curate all the news on AWS,

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Kubernetes, Linux, and more.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Stay up to date at acloudguru.com.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
My name is Chris, and joining me triumphantly

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
is my co-host, Mr. Dominic.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Hello, Mike.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Hello, Chris.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
I have ascended from my aquatic grave.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I come to you with Windows Azure.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I'm sorry, Microsoft Azure.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm sorry, Just Azure.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Dammit, stop changing the name.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Did you get the barnacles washed off?

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
I did, and I actually, while I was down there,

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
I found my old purple HTC Windows Phone 8.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Hey, you know, those were great back in the day, man.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
You know, that's going to take over the world.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
You just wait.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
How are you?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
How is Florida?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
How is the life?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
How is the Dominic household?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
All of those things.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Well, Florida is 4,000 degrees,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
but not nearly as hot, horribly,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
as the Pacific Northwest, of course, in California.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
That's a shame.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I'm tired.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
You know, I tried to code into the night last night

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
something I have not been able to do for several years now

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
without horrible repercussions in the morning.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Yeah.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
I have also fought that one.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Also because sometimes now, just more often than not,

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I can't sleep.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yep.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
That does stink because it does put my whole day

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
kind of like in a funk.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Like, I'm just not as effective.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Today, I actually tried to avoid that.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I actually stayed at the studio last night

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
because the RV is way, way, way far away,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
like two hours or something far away.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
So I stayed here thinking,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
well, I'll save myself the exhaustion of driving

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
for like four hours that day,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
and I'll just crash here,

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
and I'll get a good night's sleep,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
and then I'll hit the ground running,

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
and I'll take off in the afternoon.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Of course, the reality is I didn't sleep for like a wink.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Like, maybe I got an hour or two, maybe, you know?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
It's just horrible.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
But the day goes on,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
and I just deploy my caffeine strategy,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
which is caffeinate hard, caffeinate often.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
And the real key to my caffeine success

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
is I catch it before the last dosage is wearing off,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
and you have to consider digestion time.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
So you got to know what your own digestion time is

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
so that way you can intake more caffeine

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
before the last take wears off.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And if you don't get it right, you know, it can be too much.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
That is true, and it's also, so I started with coffee,

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
which I haven't been drinking, so that's great.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
But I'm back on the coffee wagon, so sadness.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Woo-woo!

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Oh, I don't know.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
There's something nice about it, too, though.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Well, you know, well, for me making coffee,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
it would be easy to like turn on a coffee pot,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
but no, we can't do that.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
We have to boil just enough water in a tea kettle

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
and then get a single-serve French press

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
as we measure out as though we were dealing

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
with nuclear-physical material the exact amount of beans,

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
which of course had to be freshly ground.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
Right, right, which is loud and dirty and a mess,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
and that thing's always a pain in the butt to clean up.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Then in my case, the four-year-old turns and yells at me

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
because, of course, the grinder is louder

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
than Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
He says, Daddy, what are you doing?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Right.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
What's the matter with you?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
What's wrong with you?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
That's sort of how life is in my place, too,

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
just about it.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
It sounds better.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
How are you?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
How is everybody?

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Just, you know, kind of trying to avoid the smoke

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
unsuccessfully.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
There's literally absolutely nowhere to go.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I'd have to probably go to Montana.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I mean, I'm not sure how far away, how far east

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I'd have to go to get away from it at this point.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
It's so thick, and it smells like wood smoke everywhere,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
like my clothes now smell like wood smoke,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
and yet it's also kind of cool in a way, right?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Because it's different, and it gives me a good excuse

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
to stay inside and be on my computer.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Yes, because you need lots of convincing for that.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Right.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
It doesn't take much, and you know what?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
They say stay inside.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
It's unhealthy air quality, so I just follow an advice,

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
you know?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
You are doing the prudent, responsible thing.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
So we had a couple bits of feedback.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Jordan wrote in.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
He went over to coder.show slash contact,

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
and he says, hi, Chris West in pain, AKA Michael.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I'm a full-time C++ developer at a small company

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
where I do cross-platform application development

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
and maintain a massive legacy code base.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I can feel the weight of that sentence.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Oh, man.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Jordan, I feel your pain there.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
He says, anyways, I wanted to throw in my two cents

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
on your latest conversation around C++.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
C++ is one of the hardest programming languages to learn.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Don't forget about templating in C++,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
which is particularly another programming language altogether.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
While many people in the C++ community

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
are trying hard to make C++ more accessible and safer,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
things like undefined behavior, defaults,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
and antiquated functionality within the standard library

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
make it an uphill battle.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
And some fixes would require breaking ABI,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
something the standards committee cannot agree on doing

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
even 10 years down the road.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Now, there are nice benefits to the standardization process

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
and improvements in C++ with each new standard,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
not fast enough nor ambitious enough to solve

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
the fundamental issues, though, many developers face

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
on even a day-to-day basis, such as package,

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
dependency management, memory management,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
and code correctness.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Many have tried and failed to make C++ better from the inside,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
which I think is why we have so many spin-offs

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
that are meant to be better replacements for C++.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
I hope to see Rust and Go continue to replace C++ code,

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
not only for my sanity, but because it's also just more fun

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
to develop in Rust and Go.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
They let you really focus on the problem you're trying to solve

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
instead of a bunch of more problems

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
you now need to solve as well.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
That is a decisive take from Jordan.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah. Decisive.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
And I think we are seeing that, right?

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
I think we're seeing particularly Rust is gaining a lot of traction,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
sort of, in a way.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
I don't know. It's a little weird.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
But C++ is a beast with a lot of legacy.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
There's no doubt.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Yeah.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
The other conversation that came up in the community was,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
well, what about when we're talking about operating system components,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
like in the launch of Amazon Bottle Rocket?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
You know, this is a sign that sometimes algorithms work,

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
because on YouTube, a video came up that just seemed like it was

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
a perfect response to the conversation starting our community about,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
well, maybe we should all adopt Rust

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
for lower language operating system components.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
And I found this audio of Linus,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
who was asked a similar question at an event,

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
and this was his response about why he still prefers C.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
So I have to say, I'm kind of old-fashioned,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
and I'm really interested.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
The reason I got into Linux or operating systems in the first place

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
was I really love hardware.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I love tinkering with hardware.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Not in the sense that I'm a hardware person.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
Giving me a soldering iron is a bad idea.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
But I like interacting with hardware from a software perspective.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
And I have yet to see a language

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
that comes even close to C in that respect.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
It's not just that you can use C to generate good code for hardware.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
It's that if you think like a computer,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
writing C actually makes sense.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
And I think the reason it works that way is

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
the people who designed C

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
designed it at a time when compilers had to be simple

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
and the language had to be kind of geared towards what the output was.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
So when I read C,

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
I know what the assembly language will look like.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
And that is something I care about.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Not that I feel like Linus is wrong.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
It's just that he's not 100% right anymore either.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
And it's a bit of an old school take, but still a valid one.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
I always hate this argument because no matter what,

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
there's no good way to capture all the nuance in a 45 second,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
one minute response, right?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Taking a step back, right?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
There's the question of like the low levelness

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
and the memory management stuff.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
And there's the question of C++ is just like super old, right?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
And it's got like a lot of like the ABI stability comment

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
that Jordan mentioned is actually kind of a big deal.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Although it's one of those things

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
that if you're coming from a different environment

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
or frankly, if you're not insane,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
and although if you listen to coding podcasts,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
you're probably pretty deep into it.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
So maybe you are the set who actually like understands what that means.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Quick detour, right?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Committing to ABI stability,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
it was like a huge problem for Swift

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
because it meant that you basically couldn't change

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
a large percentage of the foundational stuff in the language,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
which is why Swift did not do it for a long time.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
In fact, I don't think they have done it yet,

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
but I am not super up to date on the Swift community.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I can't disagree with Linus psychologically,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
so I'm going to say he makes great points.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
But I've been kind of tooling around with C++ the last few weeks.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
There are reasons I do not recommend it to clients, right?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
There are reasons I have a pretty substantial client

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
who one of their projects when they have time and budget

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
is always like we are wanting to move our C++ stuff into.NET Core.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
One, because you can do all kinds of fun stuff

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
where you call the C++, right?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
You can either make it a binary and call into it

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
or thank God for FFI in most cases.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
It's just a hard language to work with.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
And like the challenge I've very recently had,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
people who follow me on Twitter might have noticed

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I've been doing like some weird game dev thing.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
Not my C++ and your C++ are going to be very different, very likely, right?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
The style, like I do not use templating

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
because I think it's crazy evil magic.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
This is a good point.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Right.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
And like I write C++ from the perspective of I wish it was Objective-C,

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
which is insane because they're like totally different language philosophies, right?

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
Well, I mean, I also write, you know, like a check and fill out IRS forms with brackets.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I get them back all the time.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
They're like, sir, sir, just give it up, okay?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
That's beautiful.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
It really is sad.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I mean, Jordan, more power to you, man.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Yeah, right.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Every day, large code base.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
There's got to be some deep legacy demons in that baby.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Massive legacy code base is what he said.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Somebody suggests that as a title.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
That's just a monster.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Eldritch code base over there, right?

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Steve T. said, great episode, but I had a question.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
What really is a quote unquote safe language?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Which, of course, is a huge rabbit hole.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
But I guess a fair question.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
We didn't really define it when we were talking about Rust

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
and what makes it valuable.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
You know, probably better to link to the explanation in the show notes,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
but there's several things that make a language safe.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
You have memory safety, obviously, which is a big one

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
because that prevents things like buffer overflows,

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
no pointer differences, lots of little things that have got us in trouble

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
for years and years are generally caught by languages like Java, too.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Not just Rust.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
It's not just a Rust thing, but Rust is one of the newer, hotter things

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
that seems to be offering it.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
I'll link to Michael Hicks' list of several different definitions

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
of memory safety because there are several definitions of it.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
And that's probably a pretty good starting point for people

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
who are kind of glancing that there's something that people keep dropping

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
about Rust, something people like about it,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
something about being a safe language.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Check out the links to the show notes.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah, everything you said is super correct, right?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
But just the Java reference.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
What Rust gives you that Java does not is that it is a...

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
I hate this high-low dichotomy, but like lower level,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
i.e. more performant programming language.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
So you get the safety and you get the C++ type speed.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
Now, I also want to add because pet peeve time,

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
if you are writing Rust and you are throwing the unsafe keyword

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
every other line in your code,

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
you are effectively defeating the compiler's safety mechanisms.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Do not do that.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
If you have unsafe, I don't know,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
I would say like more than 10% of your code,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
you're probably doing something wrong.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
And I know that's a little bit of a spicy take because that's...

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
No, I think it's, yeah, I think it's, well...

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
The unsafe keyword is controversial

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
in how it should or shouldn't be used.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I used to be like, I just get it done, right?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Hackity hack, hack, hack.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
I've suffered enough that I kind of don't like it.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
When you have to use it, like particularly when you're interoperating

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
with stuff, you're probably going to have to use it.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
But it's definitely a code smell.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Having said that, Rust is amazing.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
We should all thank Mozilla and find ways to give them money

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
because they need money.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
No kidding.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
But they did make Rust, right?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
My hot take is it's the summer of Rust.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I really, I mean, it's been building,

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
so it's not just the summer,

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
but I think the iceberg became much more like pronounced above water,

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
like all of a sudden, boom, here's this big Rust iceberg.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
And now all of the stuff below is kind of coming to surface.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
It just seems like it's been a big, big, big summer.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Right, I agree.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
We're all going to be dancing to the sound of the rusty trombone.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Ha ha ha ha ha.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
A Cloud Guru dot com.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
A Cloud Guru is known for their hands-on labs,

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
the real way to learn.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
ACG is the leader in hands-on cloud learning.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
And you guys know the only way to lock in a new skill is by doing.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
cloud Linux servers, and much more.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
You learn the tricks, the nuances, and the gotchas

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
before you test and before you go to work.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
And why not check out all the other great content

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
over at a Cloud Guru while you're there?

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Get your hands cloudy at a Cloud Guru dot com.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
One of the reasons I say it is sort of the summer of Rust

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
is right after we wrapped up last week's show,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
we found a whole batch of stories

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
about different large tech companies proclaiming

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
their newfound love for Rust.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
We saw that Apple has job postings open specifically

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
looking for Rust developers.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Here's a bit of the description.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Quote, the performance and security of the systems

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
we build are critical.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
We interface directly.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
This is Apple, by the way.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
We interface directly to low-level Linux kernel interfaces

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
using asynchronous IO and threads to distribute the workload.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
Following a very successful first foray into Rust,

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
we are migrating an established code base from C to Rust

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
and building new functionality primarily in Rust.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
So we're hiring.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
And Microsoft, a similar story, making the case

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
about using Rust for low-level operating system components.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
And a lot of this is all coming to a head in the summer.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I really do think it has been the summer of Rust,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
and I have been worried about making the show too much

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
about Rust.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
But then when is the right time to talk about a language

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
except for when it's exploding like this?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
When Rust is actually solving a problem, right?

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Like a very serious problem of, you know,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
you mentioned some of the buffer overflow stuff,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
which can lead to insane security issues.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Taking a step back, if Apple and Microsoft,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
and I happen to know for a fact that Google also uses Rust some,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
are all kind of jumping on this,

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
they're not like us in the Telegram chat room or whatever

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
where we get swept up in things and try everything out.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
They're making large-scale business decisions,

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
which means that these big corporations are probably going to also be

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
committing code back to the Rust community, right?

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Developing cargo packages, which for those who don't know,

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
cargo is, it's the MPM of Rust, right?

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
So I think we should just embrace our new Rust overlords.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
That's my take.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
All right, so while we're on the topic of Apple,

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
the Epic and Apple battle continues with another

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
go-forward-step-back kind of situation.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
Apple threatened to disable the sign-in with Apple for Epic Games.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Just such a weak flex, I'm sorry.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Oh, man. I mean, what I think is so pathetic about it is

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Apple just basically got this deployed

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
and is already leveraging it to punish a developer.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Like, that didn't take long.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah, Apple isn't shy about putting you in your place

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
when you're a developer for them, right?

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
This really sucks as a consumer, as a user of the iOS platform,

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
because I really wanted sign-in with Apple to solve this problem

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
of everything needs an account,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
and everything has to send me spam-crap email.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
And I got to be honest with you,

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
quite literally every single time I've been offered to sign-in with Apple,

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
anytime I've been needing to set up a new service,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I just have done that.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
It's so much better from a consumer standpoint,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
and so it's really disappointing to see this happen,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
because now I have to take that into consideration.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Now I have to take into consideration that Apple could pull the plug

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
for some reason down the road when some goalpost has been moved,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
and now all of a sudden I'm caught in the middle of some sort of dispute.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
It reminds me of when I had Dish TV,

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
and they would have a dispute with the TV providers,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
and now my local channel wouldn't be on the television network anymore.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Well, I'm still paying the same price.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I really don't like this.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I don't like this from a developer leverage standpoint,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
because you shouldn't use your login infrastructure

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
as a way to punish people. That just seems evil.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
And I don't like this from a user standpoint. This is pretty crap.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
Now, I should mention, Apple kind of retracted this in a weird way.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
They said that they will extend them a indefinite extension

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
for sign-in with Apple.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
It's not saying it's resolved,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
but we're going to indefinitely extend this offer

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
for you to continue to use sign-in with Apple.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
And that's where it's at now.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
I mean, this one really got to me, because it's so stupid and petty.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
How about the other one where the EU tax,

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
and they're passing that tax on to individual developers now?

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
It's like, come on, guys. What are you doing?

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
It really does seem to be that they perceive the relationship

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
such that the developer is deriving more value from the platform

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
than they are from the developer. Do you get what I mean?

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Like, they must think that the way that the value model works

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
is that they're kind of doing developers a favor

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
by shipping their apps on the iPhone.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
You know, it reminds me of, I don't know what getting a driver's license

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
was like in other states,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
but when I was a young Indian in New Jersey,

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
they constantly stressed you when you're taking the driving exams.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Driving is a privilege, not a right.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Even if you buy a car, it's a privilege.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
Which is their way of saying, I'll take this right off you, right?

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
This is kind of like, I guess, writing code in Xcode and for iOS

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
is a privilege?

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
It's a whole new way of thinking about developer relations

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
that I'm pretty sure other companies would not agree with.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Maybe they'd like to have this model, but yeah.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
And didn't seem to really be the bargain when the App Store launched?

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
It kind of seemed like the App Store was the thing that sold the iPhone

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
for almost a decade?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And they used to help out developers.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
It's so weird how, I guess, power corrupts, right?

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
And also, they kind of need developers totally on board right now

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
because they're going through a massive platform transition?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
What is happening?

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Are we combining two things that shouldn't be combined?

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Does Epic really represent developers?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
It's not just Epic. Epic is the easy case.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
One, Epic has not exactly tried to de-escalate the situation either.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
No, no, no, no, no.

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
So the problem here for Apple, from their perspective, I'm sure,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
is not that they're being mean.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
It's that Epic isn't some guy in his spare bedroom in Florida

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
that they can just roll.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
It's another billion-dollar company.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Right. Yep.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
It's a high-profile one with a very popular product.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
And Tim Sweeney's got some personality quirks

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
that make him a difficult person to be in a conflict with.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
And nobody at Apple has that problem.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
And Tim Cook just apparently hates him.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I don't even understand.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Again, if you haven't, you have to read those emails

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
that came out in the court filing.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
It's weirdly personal.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Isn't that something?

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Yeah, there's some personality conflicts.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
But all right, so let's ask the $64,000 question

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
that we don't have in the doc, but I think is relevant.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Would you caution our listeners, particularly younger folks

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
who are wanting to get into development,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
to maybe avoid Apple's platforms?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Well, I think certain business models should consider it.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
If you're the hay business model,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
you probably better think about it real hard.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Again, another outspoken tech founder

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
with an interesting personality who took Apple on.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
If Ben Thompson is to be believed,

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
he has received many dozens of other stories from developers

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
that just were afraid to come public.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
And I can buy that.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
And so I would say to a degree,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
you know, I don't think we should kid ourselves.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
I don't think this is a story that is pervasive

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
amongst the customer base of iPhones.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
I think it's well known amongst a small percentage

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
and maybe now a little more because of Fortnite.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
But I'd say so a lot of businesses are totally fine,

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
especially if you're comfortable playing within Apple's rules.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
But if you have something that skirts around

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
or kind of relies on a loophole

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
or maybe takes advantage of a gray area

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
or kind of hopes Apple lets this one slip by,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
you are 100% screwed.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
It's just not going to happen.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Maybe the web is a better platform for you.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Yeah, I'm sort of hoping that, like,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Apple comes to their senses a little bit.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Like, and I understand it's different people

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
and things have changed and whatever,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
but this does feel like it's like your old friend

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
who's, like, just gone nuts for a while.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Like, you hope that he wakes up,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
but they don't seem to be waking up, right?

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Like, in fact, they seem to be doubling down.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
So, yeah, I don't know.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
That's what makes it so fascinating to watch.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
How does a king lose its crown?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Like, when somebody makes one a company,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
like Microsoft or Google or Apple, make it to the top,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
what causes them to fall?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Piss off the EU enough.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
I mean, that's probably how this ends, right?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I don't know.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I don't know. Apple may just buy them out.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
We bought Belgium.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
No offense to people in Belgium.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
I kid.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I just think it's fascinating to watch, you know,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
a trillion-dollar-plus company.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
They have to sabotage themselves in the name of profits,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
in the name of services revenue.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I made a prediction on this show years ago.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
I've said it before.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
It's all going to be, I said, if you're a developer for Apple,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
you're going to have the game change on you

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
as they get more and more serious about services.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
And because that app store equals services

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
in their quarterly results, they've got to milk that sucker.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
That's the game on Wall Street.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I keep using the metaphor of sharecroppers,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
but it does feel like that.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
It's not great.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
So let's cheer ourselves up.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Apparently, I was right in 2013.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I want to set the stage.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
This was September of 2013.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
So not surprisingly, here we are in September again.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Let me pull up the exact date

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
because this is actually kind of interesting, isn't it?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
We released this episode,

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
episode 67 of Coda Radio on September 16, 2013.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Here we are on September 14, 2020.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
So that's pretty great.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
And this is typically around the time

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Apple has its traditional event.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
And I think this was when they announced the iPhone 5S.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
So that's how long ago this was.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
And you had a hot take that you just kind of tossed out there

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
in 2013, and we had a listener go back

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
and listen to the back catalog and say,

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
hey, you got to check this clip out.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
The most interesting thing that's happening now

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
with Apple and the iPhone isn't what they do with the colors,

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
isn't what they do with the design

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
or the fact that the background now has parallax.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
I think what is interesting is you have one company

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
who is making their own chip based on the ARM design reference.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
But I find that to be a huge, huge advantage.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
I mean, I got to imagine now Samsung gets close, right?

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
But they don't own all of the bits like Apple does, top to bottom.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
So my crazy conspiracy theory is that this is step one

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
in a five-step plan where step five is Macs

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
start running Apple's own ARM chips.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Oh, I hope not.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Damn.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
You called it from the iPhone 5S.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I'll take the W.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Yeah, we were both spot on, I think, not to my own horn,

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
but I was spot on about their CPUs were going to be their secret sauce

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
and it was going to be a huge deal.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Yeah, you were too.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
You were spot on about their desktop switching over to ARM processors.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
Now, that's interesting because today it was announced

25:24.000 --> 25:31.000
that Nvidia for 40 billion US dollars is acquiring ARM holdings.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
And this is massive.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
They're buying it from SoftBank

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
and it's clearly going to change the industry.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
This will probably be one of the biggest tech stories of 2020.

25:40.000 --> 25:46.000
And they seem to be, Nvidia, seem to be positioning this as a big AI play,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
which I think is interesting.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Got to get those buzzwords.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Yeah.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah, it's all about AI and their press releases.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
In fact, here's a bit of a quote from one.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
AI is the most powerful technology force of our time.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
It is the automation of automation where software writes software.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
That's according to the Nvidia CEO.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
He goes on, together Nvidia and ARM are going to create

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
the world's premier computing company of the age of AI.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
How about AI?

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
But I think early, I mean, I'm sure it's a component of it.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Bringing Nvidia's GPUs together with ARM CPUs

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
and putting them in low power situations

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
where they can do a lot of on premise, on location processing

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
would be extremely valuable.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
I mean, you're seeing that play out in cell phones already for your selfies.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
But it feels like to me what Nvidia is really doing here

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
is focusing on the shiny and exciting

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
because they don't really have a full fleshed out plan yet.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
They got vague details.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
So you refer to something that's vague and people will be like,

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
oh, that's great.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
That's going to be amazing.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
And they'll make up scenarios like I just did.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Meanwhile, they're like, we just had to make this play

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
because somebody else was going to buy them

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
and we wanted it to be us, right?

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
That's got to be what happened here.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
And they moved as fast as they could.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
They had a sticky issue regarding some Chinese owners

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
and they kind of sort of quote unquote resolve the matter.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
And then as soon as they did that, the deal went through even on a Sunday.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
It was almost finished on a Sunday.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
I mean, it was a big rush, it seems like from the outside.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
And then they talk about AI because that's pretty noncommittal.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
Yeah, I mean, I would give them, I mean, I know I put the crack about being a buzzword.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I would give them a little more credit.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
So Microsoft had that spheres thing.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Is that what it's called?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
It was like their system on a chip or?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Yeah, the Azure sphere.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
It's like a shipping product now.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
A big weakness of that product

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
and a big weakness of people trying to deploy AI systems in general

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
is that they tend to always rely on cloud services to do the actual,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
you know, machine learning and processing.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Right.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
And this is an area that actually, like I know I mentioned Apple all the time,

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
but Apple has actually done a lot of great on device AI stuff,

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
not, or I'm sorry, ML stuff and not exactly like the best ML stuff.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
But the fact that they're not constantly calling servers is impressive.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
If Nvidia can pull this off, which is a big, big, big, you know,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
HTML one blink tag if.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Yes.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
They could very well do to the embedded AI market,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
which is a term I just made up,

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
but what I mean is small systems on, you know, a single chip computing.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
What they have done to basically, you know, CUDA, right?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Let's talk about CAD.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
A thing we don't talk about much on this show because we're not like gaming oriented

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
is specific games, but more importantly,

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
CAD programs are programmed to CUDA, which is Nvidia's like proprietary,

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
weird, whatever graphics thing,

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
which means that they're kind of the leader in the graphics market,

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
even though we're AMD lovers here, that's because we tend to run Linux.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
And it's what actually drives a huge reason why Nvidia develops a driver for Linux.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Yeah.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
And, you know, System 76, a sponsor of this show,

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
and we're both customers of they build laptops and desktops specifically for the CUDA market.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
It's a big sector.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
It's a big sector.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I mean, it is the leader in that space, right?

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
To the everlasting shame of Mac people who had to switch to Windows

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
or hopefully picked up a System 76 computer to do their CAD work.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Right.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Because they can't.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
So you can't get Nvidia on Mac because apparently they had a nasty breakup.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
Again, blinking if tag if they can actually do this.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
And I'm a little skeptical on this one, Chris.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
This is the Holy Grail.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
If they can do it, this makes AI not at all a buzzword anymore.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
This makes it real.

29:30.000 --> 29:37.000
I could see that if the devices could think faster and it was safer in terms of privacy

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
because it's interestingly enough, and I think you've probably noticed this too,

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
there is a very large percentage of the market that will just never buy a Amazon tube

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
or a Google tube because of privacy reasons.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
It's become a thing people think of more, not as pervasive as I would like,

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
but there is a large section of the market now that does worry about privacy.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Sure.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
And if you could say, sort of like what Apple leans into,

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
if you could say instead of uploading this to the cloud to process,

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
we're doing this on your device locally and now it's faster and more secure

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
and safe from hackers or whatever, they could really play it up.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
Put a Guy Fawkes mask on the commercial, I could see it.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Yeah, that would appeal, I think.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
It would appeal not only to people like me who have already accepted the tube in the house,

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
even though it does concern me,

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
but it would also appeal to people that had been previously opting out of certain,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
quote unquote, smart products.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Yeah, that's a great point.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
I wasn't thinking of the consumer space, but that's a great point.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
I actually right now have a customer who works in the agriculture space

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
and they have giant stocks of produce, like growing produce,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
and that creates a really stupid problem.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Wi-Fi signal is unable to penetrate the mass.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
It can't get through the fruit?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Can't get through, right, can't get through the fruit.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
So we have to do all these insane local caching stuff

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
and to reintegrate with the whole system.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
Something like this would be awesome, right?

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
And I could think of over the years at least a dozen scenarios

31:09.000 --> 31:16.000
where my main problem was the client had either the space was too vast, it was outside,

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
spotty cell signal or the devices they were using didn't have cell connection,

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
because remember not everything is an iPad or Android app, right?

31:24.000 --> 31:31.000
So I would be super hot on this if it worked and if it had an Objective-C SDK.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Ah, you got it in there.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Or I'll settle for Rust, how about that?

31:34.000 --> 31:40.000
Okay, all right, yeah, that'll be the new go-to.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
This is to me, and this is maybe why I was a little skeptical on my take of the AI stuff,

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
is I think really not so much about the high end of the market,

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
but it's really about NVIDIA now getting in the low end of the market,

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
because they kind of own the high end, especially with their GPUs,

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
and they don't really have much of any play in the low end,

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
like IoT devices, like I was talking about, or router devices, networking devices.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
They have all of this area they can expand into.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
Now what's interesting about this deal is that ARM will essentially operate as a separate entity.

32:12.000 --> 32:19.000
They will be a subsidiary of NVIDIA with supposedly their own command structure,

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
separate from NVIDIA.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
Yeah, sure, okay, yeah.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
Yeah, that $40 billion was for no influence, right?

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
Of course, they'll be able to license to themself as much as they like,

32:30.000 --> 32:36.000
but I would imagine they're also going to now be taking the revenue over from the existing licensees,

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
including folks like Apple, which you wonder what that deal is going to look like now.

32:40.000 --> 32:45.000
I think NVIDIA is going to focus a lot on kind of pushing down into that market,

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
maybe even if we're lucky, bringing up the capabilities.

32:48.000 --> 32:54.000
But without a doubt, this just clearly makes NVIDIA one of the most significant players in tech now.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Yeah, I mean, they weren't a slouch to begin with.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Right.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
But we could see a future where when you rattle off the big tech, the big five,

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
when you're rattling through Amazon and Microsoft and Apple,

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
there may be a future now where NVIDIA is in that list.

33:08.000 --> 33:14.000
It's not there yet, but it may get there because think about the dominance of the ARM CPU,

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
especially if they can combine it with some of their technology,

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
and the reach, if they play this right, they could achieve.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Yeah.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
It seems like a lot of upside for them, if they don't blow it.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Tough dungies for Intel?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Yeah.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
Man, right as they're just not getting their act together either, right?

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
I mean, woof.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
And AMD is starting to make inroads into the laptop market.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
That's a rough time.

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
You also wonder if it will have a knock-on effect to RISC-V or OpenPowerPC.

33:41.000 --> 33:47.000
Could we see some renewed community interest or company interest in those platforms as sort of a hedge?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
You had me at PowerPC.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I tell you what, man, I miss it.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
I love the PowerPC architecture.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
That's a statement.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Okay.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Really?

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
No, I did.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
One of my favorite things to do for a long time was to get old PowerPC Macs

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
and run Yellow Dog Linux on them and Debian.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Yellow Dog.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Yes.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Oh, yeah.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
You could also run that on a PS3, if I recall correctly.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
As I did.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Yep.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
And so did the Air Force.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Really?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Yeah, a lot of them.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
Weird.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
That's weird and random.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
I mean, there's other Linux boxes one could have.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
At the time, though, the PS3 was like, this is not my personal experience,

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
but it was a widely-published story at the time.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
It was the most cost-effective, powerful Linux box they could buy.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
So they just called Sony and were like, we need 200 of those.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Right.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
It had that cell processor, which is PowerPC-based.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Yep.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Well, one last hot take while we're in the hoopla.

34:41.000 --> 34:46.000
This is over at Matt Kelad's, I'm not sure, blog.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
And we'll link for the full read.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
But it's a take I think I can get on board with.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
And the headline is, your language sucks, it doesn't matter.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
And the central thesis is that the actual programming language,

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
the syntax, the semantics, the paradigm, it doesn't really matter.

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
What matters is the characteristics of the runtime, roughly what it does

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
with memory of running processes and what does all of that look like.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
That's the core thesis.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
And I feel this way, too, about not just programming languages,

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
but I also feel that way about Linux distributions.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
All Linux distributions suck and also all Linux distributions are great.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
It's just really how you use it and what you're familiar with

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
and the tools you know.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
And honestly, that's kind of my hot take on operating systems

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
to a lesser extent as well.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Yeah, I think this guy makes a great point.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
It's back to our classic, the right tool for the job.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
Now, I'm curious on your operating system thing.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
When you say operating system, do you mean like Linux distros

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
or like Mac, Linux, Windows, whatever?

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
All of the above, but I did mean the actual, you know,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
predominant like Linux, Windows, Mac.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
But I feel that way about distros as well.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
I can just switch distros and it's great.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
It's just some have other advantages that work better for me.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
And it's like tools, right?

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
It's like I just got a rigid drill set.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
I looked at a lot of different drills and I almost didn't go with rigid,

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
but I was gifted a couple of batteries and I'm like,

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
I got these batteries and we can get these chargers.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
And so I went with that tool.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Now, people listening to this who don't like rigid drills might think,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
oh, you shouldn't have done that.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
But for me, that's what fit my use case.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
They all have pluses and minuses.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
That's my wisdom for you, Mike. It's wisdom.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
That is pretty wise.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
Have you been like meditating in a monastery or something?

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
I think it's the drive through the mountain passes.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
You know, maybe it's all the tree smoke.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Just to tie in at the end of his article,

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
he has some four takes or five takes rather.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
His first one, he expects rust to be a major language.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
A fun fact, their rust consultancy might be related, but I agree.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
Can I just say I had no idea when this Lincoln in the show notes that he had a rust tie and that's hilarious.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Yes, it's got this.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
So he he writes first.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I expect rust to become a major language.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Naturally, smiley emoji.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
This needs some explanation.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
All right. You know what? I'm not doing that.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
But oh, I see. Yeah, OK.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Yeah, I see the paragraph you're talking about.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
Yeah, but he says he argues the memory safety is a runtime property,

37:11.000 --> 37:17.000
despite the fact that it is uniquely to rust achieved exclusively via language machinery.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Yes, it's not really a runtime property.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
It's a it's a it's the language specification.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
But I see where he's going.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Julia becoming popular.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Yeah, I doubt that.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
But we'll see.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
He wouldn't be surprised if dark grows.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
You know what? Yeah.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
A year ago, I would have said no chance.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
But I'm seeing a lot of activity on Flutter.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Yep. I had Chris sells on the M.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
Dominic show, and he is the product manager for Flutter.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
They've got a lot of cool stuff.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
They've got the Ubuntu support now, which I know is Linux support, but canonical partner.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
So don't know.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Leave the hate mail.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Crystal, no chance.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
He's right about that.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Swift. Yeah.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
This is the one I wanted to troll about.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
Remember when IBM was like, we've got this.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
We're making the Swift version of a Web service.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
It's going to be an enterprise language.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Yeah, that worked, right?

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Yeah. Huge.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
No, super popular.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Huge.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Which actually is a crying shame.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
Yeah. I, of course, personally hate Swift, but it's a really good language.

38:19.000 --> 38:26.000
And its ambition is a little crazy, like it wants to go everywhere from systems programming to scripting.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
But it just never got out of the Apple sandbox.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
You know, things can change.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
A language can can languish for quite a while and then all of a sudden get some notoriety.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
But I mean, I shouldn't put it that way.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
I shouldn't put it that way.

38:37.000 --> 38:42.000
I mean, even even just the iOS platform and Apple Mac platform are huge.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Right. So, yeah, I mean, it's getting some play.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Let's be honest.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Yeah, it's actually a really good read.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
All of those predictions are fun, but we'll have the link to the whole thing.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
Yeah, the predictions are actually pretty good.

38:54.000 --> 38:59.000
Linode.com slash coder receive a one hundred dollar 60 day credit towards your new account.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
Linode is the largest independent cloud for developers.

39:02.000 --> 39:13.000
You can simplify your cloud infrastructure with their easy virtual machines, tools to develop, deploy and scale your modern applications faster and easier than you ever thought possible.

39:13.000 --> 39:24.000
Linode also costs 30 to 50 percent less than the major cloud providers like AWS, Google or Azure, because you receive a balance of technology with price and performance ratio that's just right.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
And with 11 data centers worldwide, you're going to find just the right spot to deploy.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
And you'll rest easy with Linode's built in monitoring tools.

39:33.000 --> 39:39.000
Linode is my cloud hosting provider and all of the new infrastructure for JB 3.0.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Yeah, we're putting it on Linode.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Where else would we put it?

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
They've really gotten great.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
I've been a customer for two years.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
I have watched them get better and better and better.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
And now nobody touches them.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
The largest independent cloud provider.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
They've been around since before AWS.

39:52.000 --> 39:58.000
And when you go to Linode.com slash coder, you get a hundred dollar credit for 60 days on a new account.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Now, they have shared rigs starting at just five dollars a month.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
But of course, they have dedicated CPU machines, GPU compute.

40:04.000 --> 40:11.000
I mean, you can get seriously powerful and fast infrastructure if you need it or deploy something quick and easy for testing or learning.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
You've got to go to Linode.com slash coder.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
Oh, and one last thing.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Linode's hiring.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
If you go to Linode.com slash careers, you'll find out more.

40:21.000 --> 40:28.000
Why not start by supporting this show and getting yourself a one hundred dollar 60 day credit towards your new account by going to Linode.com slash coder.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
And a big thank you to Linode for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
That's Linode.com slash coder.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
Now, here's the hottest of the hot takes this week.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Open source is essentially dead.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
We are living in a post open source world.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
There's several links we'll have.

40:46.000 --> 40:59.000
One of the one of the links that is cited here is, quote, a tweet that says open source as a community endeavor is falling apart right before our eyes and being replaced by open source as a big Corp enrichment strategy.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
It is mean, but it's been happening for a while.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
But seeing Mozilla's sinking like this is just driving the point home for me.

41:06.000 --> 41:13.000
And that's what kicked off this entire conversation, to be frank with you, is the Mozilla layoff situation.

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
And that's what drove this author to write this. A lot of cool people working on important shit, as this author put it.

41:18.000 --> 41:29.000
But the consensus that he's seen is that it reflects Mozilla's search for profit over impact, mismanagement and dis appropriate executive compensation.

41:29.000 --> 41:39.000
He says this is a trend not only at Mozilla, but it's taking place over the corporatization of open source over the past several years and an ongoing open source sustainability crisis.

41:39.000 --> 41:47.000
And covid-19, the all consuming crisis that makes other crisis is worse, has brought this issue up even worse.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
It's like I say, it's hot, it's spicy. This is where I think maybe it resonates a little bit with you.

41:52.000 --> 41:58.000
So clear your mind. Open your mind to this, because he is no fan of the GPL three.

41:58.000 --> 42:05.000
And I'll get you there. They write the flagship projects of the free software movement are probably Linux and the Gnu pile of tools.

42:05.000 --> 42:15.000
The Linux kernel being released under a free software license doesn't directly create more free software, though, even since things that lie closely to the Linux kernel aren't obligated to also be free software.

42:15.000 --> 42:20.000
And of course, user level applications can have whatever license they want.

42:20.000 --> 42:27.000
And also, most of the people using Linux right now are using it by accident distributed as Chrome OS or Android, either of which is free software.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
So Linux is a win for the free software movement, but it's a useless win.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
The Gnu user land tools are, for the most part, even more underwhelming.

42:36.000 --> 42:41.000
GCC had, as far as I can tell, been basically the C compiler for a while.

42:41.000 --> 42:48.000
If you weren't stuck with MSVC or something else, the free software movement were stubborn ideologues with weird priorities.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
They still had one big technical advantage, but then the GPL three happened.

42:54.000 --> 43:04.000
So big companies like Apple saw new restrictions coming in at the same time were more aggressive with enforcement and said, well, shit, who want to base our software on these handy, convenient tools like GCC?

43:04.000 --> 43:10.000
But we can't use GPL three software while keeping our hardware and software is locked together as tight as possible.

43:10.000 --> 43:19.000
So they started pouring money into a new C compiler LLVM that was instead open source, not free software.

43:19.000 --> 43:25.000
And LLVM became at least as good as GCC and less risky decision for big companies and easier to build new languages.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
So the free software's last technical advantage was gone.

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
His social advantages also kind of went up in flames with the GPL three.

43:34.000 --> 43:43.000
The free software movement in the end burned itself out by fighting for tiny crumbs of success and then turning around and lighting that success on fire.

43:43.000 --> 43:50.000
The death of free software tells us that we can't use a license to trick corporations into sharing values, our values.

43:50.000 --> 44:04.000
They want to profit. And if good software has a license that puts a limit on how much they can do that, they'll put more resources into writing their own alternative than they would spend complying with the license in the first place.

44:04.000 --> 44:15.000
So in his mind, especially in the world of big cloud services, this is done. It's over like the ID log movement didn't work and free software is done.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
Well, OK, so maybe I'm on the short bus today.

44:20.000 --> 44:25.000
Is he claiming that open source is gone or dead or something or has failed?

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
Or is he claiming that like FOSS has failed because it's two different things, right?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Free software versus a little bit of both.

44:31.000 --> 44:38.000
I think the I think he's trying to make the case where they think it's a he is trying to make the case that both have failed.

44:38.000 --> 44:48.000
We couldn't get companies on a moral basis and we couldn't get them on an open source license to trick them into not making too much money because they just bypass both.

44:48.000 --> 44:56.000
And so the only kind of license that works is something that's essentially I opt to revoke your permission to use it anytime I deem.

44:56.000 --> 45:03.000
He has a quote, a license that's F around and find out license faffle for short.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
The license reads the software shall be used for good, not evil.

45:07.000 --> 45:13.000
The original author of the software retains the sole and exclusive rights to determine which uses are good and evil.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
Yeah, no one's going to go for that. I know to get out of here. That's it.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
Get it out of here. What about what about the premise?

45:20.000 --> 45:27.000
What about the premise that almost no license is better than a license in this new in this new world we live in?

45:27.000 --> 45:33.000
Almost no. So so no license. The default would be proprietary.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
Or are we saying like a public domain?

45:36.000 --> 45:43.000
I think it'd be up to you, you know, for your software, the default might be proprietary with or the default could be something like this share.

45:43.000 --> 45:49.000
And I I don't think anybody would go for a license that says I choose to revoke it for any reason at any time.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
Yeah, no, of course not. It's just kind of it's yeah, you're right.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
It's kind of a who would write software for for anything where someone could just come in and say,

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
we don't like you anymore and throw you off the platform and then remove a sign in feature from you. Oh, wait.

46:01.000 --> 46:07.000
We'll be talking about it. So this is what. So this right here, what you just touched on is what I keep coming back to.

46:07.000 --> 46:14.000
And what this I think with this article got me thinking about is this almost does kind of seem like an unsolvable problem in a way.

46:14.000 --> 46:25.000
But what is the problem? Well, in theory, the problem is large company X comes in, decides to use your code to make millions and millions of dollars and never gives you a dime.

46:25.000 --> 46:31.000
Got it. So effectively, AWS and Azure are rolling around with making lots of money on Linux.

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
And the Linux Foundation has to go cap in hand and get some shekels from them. That's what we're talking about.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
Yeah, I mean, essentially, that's it. And then, of course, that doesn't really trickle down to projects.

46:40.000 --> 46:49.000
So still, the developers that are actually burning the midnight oil, making the software actually possible, are really not reaping any of the benefits at all.

46:49.000 --> 46:55.000
All right. So I'm going to make you even sadder than OK. Remember, there was a hero in this category.

46:55.000 --> 47:02.000
And we had this argument years ago when I was full, like stupid, you know, do everything proprietary.

47:02.000 --> 47:07.000
Someone will find the clip. I'm sure you throw it right back at me. Well, Red Hat's making tons of money, man, and they're open source.

47:07.000 --> 47:14.000
Oh, wait. Everybody has failed. Right. Canonical is like maybe the exception to this.

47:14.000 --> 47:20.000
But again, they have effectively become a consulting company. Sorry to all our friends at Canonical.

47:20.000 --> 47:25.000
Well, I mean, it's not a bad thing. But see, the way I look at it is it's all kind of open source by default now.

47:25.000 --> 47:34.000
I mean, I think I think there is a fair observation being made here. Certainly, the spirit of free software is just like that.

47:34.000 --> 47:39.000
But merging them together into open source and free software.

47:39.000 --> 47:46.000
How could you be open and good and not have the big companies like want to use your stuff?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
That's what I'm saying. That seems to be the catch 22 of it.

47:48.000 --> 47:56.000
But maybe it's enough that a small core group of technology enthusiasts care about this and advocate for these things.

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
And maybe that's but what are they advocating for? Well, at least contributing code improvements back.

48:01.000 --> 48:10.000
Well, I think to be like slightly fair to the dark are glorious corporate overlords in the open source community.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
Microsoft does commit code back to Linux kernel and a number of other projects.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
Right. Canonical does a lot. And I see people.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
You know, I knew someone was going to say open core. I knew it was coming.

48:22.000 --> 48:29.000
Conan, kudos. Kudos to you, sir. Well, here's my question, though, is does it work out in the wash?

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
Maybe some projects suffer and other projects grow and become funded and get developer time.

48:35.000 --> 48:41.000
And it all kind of comes out in the wash, even though some projects are left behind.

48:41.000 --> 48:49.000
I don't know if we can say that. Let's try to think of a company who is even like maybe not like Microsoft level.

48:49.000 --> 48:58.000
Right. But like maybe a couple of years down, that is open source and making money and is not having their lunch eaten by AWS.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
And the one in the chat room that inspired that point is maybe it's Suze.

49:03.000 --> 49:10.000
But that has more to do with the fact that nobody willingly uses Suze and they affect.

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
And the D.O.D. happens to like really like Suze because you have to have a vendor thing.

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
Oh, and Germany. Right. The Germans loves it. Right. Yeah. Well, that tells you everything.

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
I love you, Germans. I love you. Their model is to sell you an insane enterprise like maintenance contracts.

49:25.000 --> 49:30.000
Yeah. I hate to be Debbie Downer. And please do, you know, coder dot show.

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
There's a form there. Go ahead and send feedback if you can think of one. But Chris, can you?

49:34.000 --> 49:41.000
I can't really. I mean, to me, it seems like fundamentally this has always been the way it's worked.

49:41.000 --> 49:49.000
Now we see it because I think it's more pronounced with the scope and scale and revenue size of these companies.

49:49.000 --> 49:55.000
So it's really in our face because they're like in some cases the fricking back end of the Internet, essentially.

49:55.000 --> 50:03.000
And so it's just egregious. If you look at people who make a ton of money on open source, I mean, it's not it's not a big list.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
And I think ton of money is going to have to be pretty relative.

50:06.000 --> 50:12.000
Maybe upper middle class in the United States is probably what I mean. I don't know.

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
Maybe Linus is worth a billion dollars. I doubt it, though. I bet he's got some money. Right.

50:16.000 --> 50:21.000
I'm sure he's doing real comfortable and anybody would be thrilled to be in that position.

50:21.000 --> 50:29.000
But he's not rolling in like Tim Cook money or even probably Johnny Ive money or Phil Schiller money.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
Yeah. According to the Googles, his net worth is one hundred and fifty million dollars.

50:33.000 --> 50:39.000
So not not even close. I wonder what Johnny Ives net worth is or Phil Schiller's right.

50:39.000 --> 50:47.000
Or or or even Satya Nadella. Not that Satya Nadella hasn't made a good contribution, but let's let's be clear, it's not the scale of Linus Torvalds contributions.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
So how would you solve the problem then? I don't know if there is a solution.

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
I think in a part it's people dedicating themselves to just furthering software development.

50:55.000 --> 51:02.000
And sometimes the reward isn't monetary. Sometimes it is. And I think people may know that bargain when they go in.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
Again, this is like remember a couple of years ago, the hotness was open core.

51:06.000 --> 51:11.000
Right. Yeah. Because of this problem, if you did something purely open source.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
Literally, AWS or whoever would come in and just eat your lunch if it was even promising at all.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
It's essentially what's happening. And that also failed. So, you know.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
Yeah. Although, you know, if it's under the ocean, maybe it doesn't matter.

51:24.000 --> 51:32.000
This is kind of neat. Just as we're kind of sitting down to record today, Microsoft announced that their underwater data center has resurfaced after two years.

51:32.000 --> 51:40.000
The data center has been retrieved from the ocean floor. It was covered in barnacles and all other kinds of underwater crap, as you might expect.

51:40.000 --> 51:47.000
But here's some interesting details. Their first conclusion so far is that the cylinder packed with servers under the ocean.

51:47.000 --> 51:54.000
Yes, under the ocean had a lower failure rate than a conventional data center when the container was hauled off the seabed.

51:54.000 --> 51:59.000
And then it was about a half a mile out offshore. So it was underwater about a half mile out.

51:59.000 --> 52:07.000
It was placed there in May of 2018. Only eight out of eight hundred and fifty five servers failed.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
Quote, our failure rate in the water is one eighth of what we've seen on land.

52:12.000 --> 52:17.000
This is according to Ben Cutler, who is the lead Microsoft project guy on this.

52:17.000 --> 52:23.000
And he says our failure rate is probably lower in part because we use nitrogen rather than oxygen.

52:23.000 --> 52:28.000
So there's less corrosion. But also no doubt about it. It's got to be because there was less humans.

52:28.000 --> 52:33.000
Bumping into stuff is really neat when you see the pictures in the show notes.

52:33.000 --> 52:40.000
It's a tube with racks in it. It's just they straight up through a whole bunch of racks of servers,

52:40.000 --> 52:45.000
one new servers in these racks, and they even have KVM crash carts on them.

52:45.000 --> 52:51.000
And they don't know if it's going to turn into a product for Microsoft, but they say it could have potential.

52:51.000 --> 53:00.000
You know, imagine a natural disaster and a region's telco infrastructure goes out or whatever it might be.

53:00.000 --> 53:06.000
A big, big old boat could come in and drop this thing off the shore half a mile and you run fiber out to this thing.

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
And now you've got infrastructure on demand. That could be powerful.

53:11.000 --> 53:17.000
I am so excited about this. So this is my X-Files, the lone gunman hackety hack solution.

53:17.000 --> 53:24.000
Things are going bad. You toss a bunch of armed servers from NVIDIA to a capsule right down the bottom of the ocean.

53:24.000 --> 53:31.000
And you know what? Hopefully future aliens will find our technology and still not be able to make money on open source.

53:31.000 --> 53:36.000
Microsoft says they think they're past the point where it's a science experiment.

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
Now the question is how much they want to engineer this. They want to make a small scale one, a large scale one.

53:41.000 --> 53:50.000
I'm thinking what needs to happen is a bunch of Bitcoin billionaires need to come together and purchase a few of these and sprinkle the blockchain around the bottom of the ocean.

53:50.000 --> 53:57.000
Never tell the Bitcoin people about this. They're like, hmm, water cooling with the whole ocean, huh?

53:57.000 --> 54:03.000
Oh, you're right. Boy, you're right. OK, mum's the word on this one, everybody. Don't tell the Bitcoiners.

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
All right. All right. Hot, hot prediction. Hot prediction. Here we go.

54:07.000 --> 54:15.000
Who buys the island just to dunk servers within the territorial boundaries underwater first, Amazon or Microsoft?

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
Hmm. Whoever's going for that sweet, sweet China contract first.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
Right off the South Pacific, right?

54:23.000 --> 54:29.000
Yep. Also, just a special thank you to the Coder QA team. Thank you everybody who's been going to CoderQA.co to sign up.

54:29.000 --> 54:39.000
If you become a member, you get a limited ad feed, you support the show and you'll get that quarterly Coderly exclusive content.

54:39.000 --> 54:44.000
And we just appreciate the support helps keep the show sustainable at Coder QA.co.

54:44.000 --> 54:50.000
Also, if you know somebody who might enjoy the show, consider sharing it with them.

54:50.000 --> 54:57.000
Absolutely. No doubt about it. One hundred percent word of mouth is the only form of podcast marketing that actually works.

54:57.000 --> 55:03.000
So if you know someone who may have enjoyed this episode, consider sharing it with them because we might just get a new listener.

55:03.000 --> 55:09.000
Mr. Dominic, is there anything you'd like to plug? I know that the job posting we had mentioned last week did get posted.

55:09.000 --> 55:14.000
Yep. Yep. We're hiring a Python developer. No, not really. I'd say just follow me on Twitter at Tumanuko.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
And I swear to God, I will ship this Rails app at some point.

55:18.000 --> 55:24.000
And you know what? Drop a link like in the chat or somewhere and I'll grab it and I'll put it in the show notes for the job posting.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
So people can find that if they're looking for it. Will do.

55:28.000 --> 55:33.000
I am at Chris LAS on the Twitter. You can also find my personal website, chrislast.com.

55:33.000 --> 55:39.000
Check out the new logos hitting the show art and the Jupiter Broadcasting website rolling out over the next week. That's pretty exciting.

55:39.000 --> 55:45.000
And that's pretty much all I have to plug. Maybe I'll just say you can find the show at CoderRadioShow on Twitter, too.

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
And links to everything we talked about today, coder.show slash 379.

55:49.000 --> 55:54.000
Oh, I know what I'll say. Last but not least, consider joining us. We'd love to have you join us live over at jblive.tv.

55:54.000 --> 56:19.000
We do the show at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern. Thanks so much for joining us. See you right back here next week.
