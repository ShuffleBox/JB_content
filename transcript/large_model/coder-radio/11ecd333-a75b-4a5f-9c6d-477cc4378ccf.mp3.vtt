00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 435 for October 11th, 2021.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.520
Hello friends, welcome to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.520 --> 00:23.720
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.520
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

00:25.520 --> 00:30.280
You know, they have that cloud playground, Azure, AWS, or Google cloud sandboxes on ACG's

00:30.280 --> 00:32.320
credit card, not yours.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.480
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru.com.

00:35.480 --> 00:39.280
My name is Chris and joining us every single week is the man who's been burning the midnight

00:39.280 --> 00:42.440
oil, but taking a nap before the show.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.840
It's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:43.840 --> 00:44.840
Hello, Mike.

00:44.840 --> 00:45.840
Hello, Mr. Fisher.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.260
I like this employment of the nap strategy.

00:49.260 --> 00:51.400
So you know, you know, you got to be fresh for the show.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.100
I mean, that's like pro move.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.100
It's pro.

00:54.100 --> 00:55.720
I'm impressed.

00:55.720 --> 00:59.440
You know, I just came out of the woods this morning, I went in for my reading weekend,

00:59.440 --> 01:03.080
and I only got through a book and a half didn't really work out the way I wanted.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.240
But it was still really enjoyable.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.880
I was I was actually looking forward to hearing about that.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.040
I enjoyed it a lot.

01:08.040 --> 01:11.040
And I think the concept is sound.

01:11.040 --> 01:15.100
I just need to clear my schedule a little bit more, I guess, because I ended up having

01:15.100 --> 01:17.720
to drive in and you know, the whole thing.

01:17.720 --> 01:19.920
But I still really enjoyed the time I did get out there.

01:19.920 --> 01:24.360
Oh, the other thing that was kind of funny is I'm used to going out there and it just

01:24.360 --> 01:28.040
being no one around for like miles.

01:28.040 --> 01:31.160
But I guess it's like salmon season right now in the Pacific Northwest.

01:31.160 --> 01:36.040
So all the fishermen were out in the woods, like finding the good fishing spots along

01:36.040 --> 01:41.760
the riverbed and and then, you know, they drink while they fish all day.

01:41.760 --> 01:47.040
And then when the sun sets, they load up in their trucks and they go bombing through the

01:47.040 --> 01:53.440
woods, running into crap and driving 35 miles per hour, having a good old time, blasting

01:53.440 --> 01:55.480
their music in the dark.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.600
And it was quite the experience.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.840
So I learned pretty quickly, like when when the sun sets, I'm going to get inside for

02:00.840 --> 02:06.660
a bit, let the fishermen clear out, let them have their time.

02:06.660 --> 02:11.720
But I came out of the woods and I saw a pretty big announcement from you.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.920
It's like it's here.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.080
It's real.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.240
And we're going to talk about it today.

02:16.240 --> 02:19.560
I don't know how much you want to say now, but it seems like a pretty big congratulations

02:19.560 --> 02:20.560
is in order.

02:20.560 --> 02:21.560
Thank you.

02:21.560 --> 02:22.560
Yes.

02:22.560 --> 02:35.400
So finally, finally, after 5000 years, Alice is at a one point state launched to do.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.160
If you've noticed the Python content, she's in Python.

02:39.160 --> 02:43.000
Yeah, I mean, I know we have some more stuff on it, but yeah, basically it's a Rosetta

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
stone for data.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.720
So it's like, you know, I've been trying to do these automation things for a while.

02:48.720 --> 02:53.120
I found that dealing with people's proprietary data from like whatever insane system that

02:53.120 --> 02:58.940
somebody built for them and, you know, the odds, the early odds was always like the problem.

02:58.940 --> 03:04.640
So what she does, I call it universal data fluency, which it's really catchy for like

03:04.640 --> 03:05.640
the PM types.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.160
So if you're a PM and you like it, thank you.

03:08.160 --> 03:12.200
Where she can analyze data, compare it to known data types and try to understand it

03:12.200 --> 03:14.720
based on what she already knows.

03:14.720 --> 03:18.440
Obviously the idea is as I introduce more integrations, more types of data, she learns

03:18.440 --> 03:21.040
more stuff, more, learns more stuff, right?

03:21.040 --> 03:22.040
Yeah.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.040
Yeah.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.840
So we'll probably talk more about that in a little bit.

03:24.840 --> 03:25.840
Thank you.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.840
Well, congratulations again.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.840
Yes, we will.

03:27.840 --> 03:32.320
We're definitely going to talk more about that, but we had a couple of emails come in

03:32.320 --> 03:34.240
that we felt like, ah, we got to answer these.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.440
So we're going to, we're going to stick to the format for a bit and there's also some

03:37.440 --> 03:39.860
hoopla, but then we're, we're going to dive in.

03:39.860 --> 03:41.120
So stick around for that.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.320
First, let's start with Ethan.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.000
Ethan kind of feels, I think like he's run out of time.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.120
He says, Hey guys, I'm riding in because I'm facing a bit of a dilemma.

03:49.120 --> 03:52.280
I'm a computer science student trying to get a job before I graduate.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.520
However, I don't have any on the job experience.

03:54.520 --> 03:58.800
I've been trying for internships, but in this last year of school, it looks like all of

03:58.800 --> 04:01.520
them are booked out until summer of 2022.

04:01.520 --> 04:05.360
I feel like my skills are diverse, but I'm trying to find a job for either positions

04:05.360 --> 04:09.520
that I could possibly work in, which would be an embedded systems programmer or perhaps

04:09.520 --> 04:10.520
an OS developer.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.880
I just don't necessarily have all the skills yet.

04:12.880 --> 04:17.880
I have been working on a operating system as a side project and I have tried applying

04:17.880 --> 04:19.840
for some dev ops internships.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.460
However, nothing's really clicked.

04:22.460 --> 04:27.160
I've had some projects stall because of various bugs involving something that come up or maybe

04:27.160 --> 04:28.920
something just doesn't work out.

04:28.920 --> 04:33.120
I know a few different programming languages, including C++, Python, Go and Rust.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.600
I have some sys admin experience for both Linux and windows, and I have a bit of database

04:36.600 --> 04:40.480
experience, but I don't really understand what the majority of the jobs I find.

04:40.480 --> 04:46.020
Seem to require like automation skill sets like SaltStack or Kubernetes or Ansible.

04:46.020 --> 04:49.640
At this point, I'm just not really sure where to start looking or even if I'm looking in

04:49.640 --> 04:50.640
the right place.

04:50.640 --> 04:54.860
Overall, I'm wondering if my skills are the right skills for the kind of jobs I want,

04:54.860 --> 04:58.640
if I'm looking in the right place, if I should just go for internships in 2022, if there's

04:58.640 --> 05:04.240
something I'm overlooking, any advice you guys could offer, I'd appreciate.

05:04.240 --> 05:08.060
And the email is kind of all over the place, Mike, and I read through it and before the

05:08.060 --> 05:17.360
show and the vibe I got from this was he's sort of a jack of all trades, master of none

05:17.360 --> 05:23.440
kind of guy, and he's also not really following through like he's got two projects that he's

05:23.440 --> 05:28.080
put on the shelf because like a roadblock was encountered and he kind of just ran out

05:28.080 --> 05:29.080
of steam on them.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.800
And it kind of seems like he's just all over the place with the skill sets.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.280
And I think maybe that's his core issue.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.280
What are your thoughts?

05:34.280 --> 05:40.160
Yeah, I mean, a little bit of focus on that might make it a little easier to, I hate the

05:40.160 --> 05:44.100
word marketable when it comes to people, but I think that's the right word here, right?

05:44.100 --> 05:46.480
To be a little more marketable.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.600
This is almost worthless advice, but you got to stick to it, right?

05:49.600 --> 05:50.600
Yeah.

05:50.600 --> 05:56.040
I mean, I might even have different versions of my resume that like paint me, not lying,

05:56.040 --> 05:58.040
right, but slightly.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.200
Different focuses.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.200
Different focuses, right?

06:00.200 --> 06:04.240
Featuring like the DevOps stuff in one and something else in another.

06:04.240 --> 06:09.000
Or the embedded stuff in another and really kind of sell yourself as somebody who focuses

06:09.000 --> 06:13.080
in on that and then tailor it for that particular job that you're applying for.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.480
That's exactly what he's got to do, huh?

06:14.480 --> 06:19.280
Well, just like, you know, anybody, anybody selling a product or anything like they kind

06:19.280 --> 06:23.280
of have different pitches based on who they're talking to.

06:23.280 --> 06:28.540
And I think to Ethan's young enough that he may find that if he does find a job or an

06:28.540 --> 06:33.200
internship or an open source project that he wants to work with, he may either discover

06:33.200 --> 06:37.400
he really enjoys that kind of work or he doesn't yet enjoy that kind of work.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.400
And so I don't, I don't, you know, reading through his email, he feels like he's in a

06:41.400 --> 06:44.880
bit of a rush, like he's looking at summer 2022 and that's not soon enough.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.720
And I don't think he's actually in the position he thinks he's in.

06:48.720 --> 06:53.480
I would encourage him to follow Mike's advice to the letter is maybe even if you're not

06:53.480 --> 06:56.680
ready to focus yourself, focus your resumes, focus your tactic.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.520
Don't come in as just somebody who's capable of doing everything, whatever you need me

06:59.520 --> 07:04.440
to do, because that just says that just screams project to a hiring manager.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.440
Just makes you sound like a project.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.440
Yeah.

07:06.440 --> 07:07.440
All right.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.720
Solve that one.

07:08.720 --> 07:13.800
Tyler writes in, he's got two situations he wants to run past us.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.800
Tyler's also a high school student.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.800
I should point out.

07:15.800 --> 07:16.840
So, uh, this is, that's interesting today.

07:16.840 --> 07:17.840
Both emails.

07:17.840 --> 07:18.840
Hmm.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.840
Tyler writes, I feel like the attacks on large corporations generally have good underlying

07:22.840 --> 07:27.560
intentions and he's referring to like, uh, the employees, you know, like there's like

07:27.560 --> 07:32.560
this Apple to hashtag now on Twitter where people are sharing their, their Apple stories

07:32.560 --> 07:36.680
about, you know, employment issues and stuff like that.

07:36.680 --> 07:40.800
Uh, but Tyler says, I think that many people fail to grasp that the arguments only have

07:40.800 --> 07:45.720
validity when someone else is creating a platform for others to build on.

07:45.720 --> 07:49.840
Competition is essential to a functioning economy and therefore to function as a society.

07:49.840 --> 07:54.680
If you create a platform and you call it fair, but then cunningly deceive your clients, that's

07:54.680 --> 07:56.880
uncool and that should be banned.

07:56.880 --> 08:02.520
However, if you try to create these anti-monopoly laws in the wrong way, we could very well

08:02.520 --> 08:06.000
end up in a position to dastardly to recover from.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.320
I feel bad that Tyler has to worry about these kinds of things.

08:08.320 --> 08:13.800
I think what he's trying to say is, wow, when they do something wrong that has to be stopped,

08:13.800 --> 08:15.480
we could very well go too far.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.420
In fact, you might argue that Microsoft was a good example of this for a while.

08:19.420 --> 08:23.240
They really seem to have their hands tied behind their backs and got lapped by the rest

08:23.240 --> 08:27.300
of the market and the kind of missed out on the mobile situation that kind of missed out

08:27.300 --> 08:30.200
on the beginning of the internet situation.

08:30.200 --> 08:34.800
And when Satya Nadella came on board, the other thing that happened around that timeframe

08:34.800 --> 08:40.640
and maybe it played a role, maybe it didn't is some of the overseeing structure that was

08:40.640 --> 08:46.260
in place by the government was removed that time it expired.

08:46.260 --> 08:51.600
And so the monopoly watchdog that was like, you know, installed at Microsoft left, they

08:51.600 --> 08:52.840
were done.

08:52.840 --> 08:57.200
And Microsoft figured out how to play game, play ball with the federal government and

08:57.200 --> 09:00.840
buddy up and make contracts and accommodate special national security needs.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.960
And they did all the right things.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.880
And now they're, you know, they're doing better than ever.

09:04.880 --> 09:09.440
So I don't know, I think what Tyler's trying to say is we could screw it up too much if

09:09.440 --> 09:11.480
we try to overmanage it.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.200
But he has another note and he wants to get your opinion on Mike.

09:14.200 --> 09:18.240
He says, as a high school student, I love programming and I pretty much love doing nothing

09:18.240 --> 09:19.800
else but maybe some gaming.

09:19.800 --> 09:25.400
I'm curious, this is a programmer, how high in a company can I reasonably expect to rise?

09:25.400 --> 09:26.400
He's asking as a developer.

09:26.400 --> 09:30.560
I mean, I don't really want to end up as a server administrator, but I also want to progress,

09:30.560 --> 09:33.400
grow and make some money in the process.

09:33.400 --> 09:37.200
I'd love to hear your takes on what avenues I should pursue to find a job where he could

09:37.200 --> 09:40.380
reasonably rise up in the ranks and make good money.

09:40.380 --> 09:44.680
So he wants a good day job, something he could raise up in the ranks, huh?

09:44.680 --> 09:46.520
Probably means you're gonna look for a company of a certain size.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.560
I don't know, what else would you look for?

09:48.560 --> 09:51.400
Well, you want to look at the history of the company, right?

09:51.400 --> 09:56.160
So one, when you say rise up in the ranks, there's rank and there's money.

09:56.160 --> 10:02.920
There are companies that don't promote developers into necessarily upper management, but they

10:02.920 --> 10:07.400
have like steps on the developer track where you end up just making a ton of money, right?

10:07.400 --> 10:08.400
It's possible.

10:08.400 --> 10:13.040
There are companies like Microsoft that a good way, unless you're Balmer, which I don't

10:13.040 --> 10:19.280
think they want to repeat that, a good way to get to the upper C-suite is to be technical,

10:19.280 --> 10:20.280
right?

10:20.280 --> 10:22.960
Especially if you get on the right projects at the right time.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.320
That's often what happens in these companies is you're working in one group, that group

10:26.320 --> 10:29.840
does really well, so they kind of tap you for the next big project.

10:29.840 --> 10:33.040
And if that project takes off, your career tends to go along with it.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.680
I just want to say, by all accounts, Satya Nadella is a lovely dude, super nice, great

10:36.680 --> 10:41.920
to work with, but he's probably CEO today because he was the boss of Azure, which just

10:41.920 --> 10:42.920
prints money.

10:42.920 --> 10:43.920
Right?

10:43.920 --> 10:47.440
I mean, it helps to be like in the right place.

10:47.440 --> 10:52.000
Well, it also was a very strong message to Wall Street that this is the future direction

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
of Microsoft by putting Satya there.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.520
I mean, we don't have it in the show, but this is a bit of a diversion, but you know,

10:58.520 --> 11:04.420
Windows 11, not a huge upgrade, unless you want like WSL, then it is, right?

11:04.420 --> 11:05.420
Then it's really nice.

11:05.420 --> 11:07.240
That's like the best feature of it from what I can tell.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.240
It's like the best feature.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.600
That, and it looks a little more like Plasma, the Plasma desktop.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.600
I like that too.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.840
I mean, everything has to steal from KDE there.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.240
I said one nice thing about KDE, that's it for the next year.

11:18.240 --> 11:22.200
Oh, I said, you know, look at the company's organization, you know, a company that its

11:22.200 --> 11:28.600
business is technical or engineering focused is probably going to be more open to, you

11:28.600 --> 11:32.100
know, a good promotion track for that kind of role.

11:32.100 --> 11:36.780
My point being like, if you work at like a law firm as like the guy who runs their website,

11:36.780 --> 11:39.640
that's probably not the best choice for you.

11:39.640 --> 11:40.640
Yeah.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.640
That's my point.

11:41.640 --> 11:44.360
Having said that you're super young, you're probably going to switch organizations a bunch

11:44.360 --> 11:45.360
of times.

11:45.360 --> 11:49.000
So I wouldn't even worry necessarily about it just yet.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.680
He's probably not even going to make it until the crash.

11:50.680 --> 11:51.680
Let's be honest.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.680
He's going to be a, wait, what?

11:52.680 --> 11:53.680
The dot com bubble 2.0?

11:53.680 --> 11:54.680
What?

11:54.680 --> 12:00.840
Please don't say that now.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.480
Linode.com slash coder.

12:02.480 --> 12:07.120
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

12:07.120 --> 12:08.120
show.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.280
I host everything on Linode these days.

12:09.280 --> 12:13.060
They've got servers all over the world, 11 different data centers, and to make things

12:13.060 --> 12:16.080
really sing, they became their own ISP.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.160
So they control the links between their own data centers.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.920
They've recently reinvested in their MVME storage.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.400
So it's faster than ever.

12:23.400 --> 12:27.600
And their high end CPU systems have AMD epic processors.

12:27.600 --> 12:32.000
It screams with 40 gigabit connections coming into their hypervisors, a beautiful dashboard

12:32.000 --> 12:36.080
to manage it all and tons of one click applications.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.400
Maybe for example, you'd like to deploy VS code server.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.800
Why not have your own VS code editor in the cloud?

12:42.800 --> 12:48.480
But under your control on your own box, they have a one click deployment for VS code web

12:48.480 --> 12:49.480
server.

12:49.480 --> 12:50.480
It's great.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.400
Also like next cloud, Jitsi, tons of projects.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.440
Maybe you just want to get started on and don't want to spend time setting up.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.080
They've got one click deployments for that.

12:58.080 --> 13:03.160
But if you're a DIY kind of person, they got you covered and it's easy to use their S3

13:03.160 --> 13:08.320
compatible object storage, managed cloud firewalls, they have DDoS protection, a powerful DNS

13:08.320 --> 13:10.480
manager, and so much more.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.000
Linode is all about the community too.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.440
Their community support runs deep.

13:14.440 --> 13:18.920
They've invested in projects that make what we do possible, distributions that I use every

13:18.920 --> 13:21.160
single day, and they made our road trip possible.

13:21.160 --> 13:24.920
And I bring this up because it's like being a good environmental citizen.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.960
They're taking care of their neighborhood.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.940
They're taking care of their community.

13:28.940 --> 13:31.520
They invest in all the important aspects of their business.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.000
They've been doing this since 2003.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.520
They know how to do it right.

13:35.520 --> 13:38.240
But I think you got to go check it out for yourself because there's a lot of places you

13:38.240 --> 13:42.080
can host stuff, but nobody checks all the boxes like Linode.

13:42.080 --> 13:45.940
So go over there and take advantage of our $100 credit and support the show.

13:45.940 --> 13:48.040
It's linode.com slash coder.

13:48.040 --> 13:57.000
Get $100 for 60 days on a new account and support the show linode.com slash coder.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.440
Well speaking of antitrust and just weird things that don't feel quite right when it

14:01.440 --> 14:09.320
comes to these large tech giants, of course, as absolutely 100% expected, Apple is appealing

14:09.320 --> 14:16.520
the Epic Games ruling, you know, the one in which it pretty much won every single claim

14:16.520 --> 14:18.560
except for a single claim.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.960
It is appealing that single claim.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.520
Obviously a 99.9% victory is unacceptable.

14:24.520 --> 14:28.160
But there was just that one problem, you know, is that was that one little finding that said

14:28.160 --> 14:32.520
that Apple violated California's anti-steering rules and demanded that Apple let developers

14:32.520 --> 14:34.100
linked outside payments.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.960
So it's kind of why they're fighting that one.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.160
It's kind of the one they care about the most too.

14:38.160 --> 14:43.080
And then they're using the excuse, which I suppose is legit, of ongoing litigations against

14:43.080 --> 14:46.480
Epic to not allow them back into the app store.

14:46.480 --> 14:49.560
They're like, you wanted to bring this against us?

14:49.560 --> 14:50.560
Well guess what?

14:50.560 --> 14:51.560
You're not getting back in now.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.280
And Epic's asked to be back in and Apple said, nope.

14:53.280 --> 14:57.520
I don't understand why Epic thought that we're going to get back in.

14:57.520 --> 14:58.980
No, this is just beginning.

14:58.980 --> 15:02.520
So like Apple has asked to have this appeal.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.600
The court has not yet granted the appeal.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.560
And if they do, then they will grant a stay.

15:07.560 --> 15:12.000
That stay will push out this this change that Apple have to implement to at least until

15:12.000 --> 15:13.160
December.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.360
Apple's plan is to argue.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.720
Remember that chicken compromise that they announced a few weeks ago before the epic

15:19.720 --> 15:20.720
trial finished?

15:20.720 --> 15:21.720
Yeah, yeah.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.200
They're going to argue it's moot because they already offered a compromise.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.840
Yes, they're going to go into court and they're going to point to that announcement.

15:26.840 --> 15:27.840
This is their plan.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.440
And they're going to say, look, we've already agreed to some of this stuff.

15:29.440 --> 15:34.120
So we not only not only do we think this is bogus, but we don't even think it's necessary.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.120
It's a bunch of ticks.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.440
I think the judge is going to buy it.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.440
I think so, too.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.440
That's so bad.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.440
Oh, man.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.920
And Apple is just going to laugh all the way to the bank and Epic's going to be screwed

15:44.920 --> 15:45.920
in the meantime.

15:45.920 --> 15:50.040
I bet Apple lets them in after all this is done, but it could be a long time.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.240
Well, I mean, Epic is, quote, screwed.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.160
I mean, I don't know.

15:54.160 --> 15:57.920
Even you know, the court documents, iOS is not that huge for market for real time feedback

15:57.920 --> 15:59.880
is bite bitten points out in the chat room.

15:59.880 --> 16:06.600
The Netherlands is getting nudged or the Netherlands is nudging Apple for their app store payment

16:06.600 --> 16:07.600
options.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.280
And then today, as you and I were going on the air, the Wall Street Journal published

16:11.280 --> 16:17.520
a report that the U.S. Justice Department is quietly hush hush putting together antitrust

16:17.520 --> 16:20.800
enforcement against Apple.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.880
I guess like they're working with the Biden administration, the White House would go for

16:23.880 --> 16:25.720
it and I'll have a link in the show notes.

16:25.720 --> 16:30.920
But they're basically putting together a low key antitrust case against Apple right now

16:30.920 --> 16:32.720
in the Justice Department.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.600
And that should be interesting.

16:34.600 --> 16:39.120
This all feels super weird to me because like Apple's got to know they're not going to get

16:39.120 --> 16:41.080
away with this forever.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.840
Remind me again how they're a monopoly.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.720
With 20 percent of the phone market.

16:45.720 --> 16:46.720
Remind me again.

16:46.720 --> 16:51.360
It seems pretty clear that they're going to have to give something on the app store payments.

16:51.360 --> 16:52.680
I guess so.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.520
I'm trying to I'm trying to think about it.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.900
I mean, I agree they should.

16:56.900 --> 16:59.200
But are they truly the monopoly of the market?

16:59.200 --> 17:04.040
That just seems like we've completely lost focus on how large Android is as a platform.

17:04.040 --> 17:09.720
It just doesn't seem well, I mean, as many sad lawyers have made the argument, right?

17:09.720 --> 17:16.720
The problem with Android is it is the share monopoly, but not the revenue monopoly.

17:16.720 --> 17:17.720
I'm sorry.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.360
It is the share majority, but not the revenue majority.

17:19.360 --> 17:24.080
Like I wouldn't write a native Android app anytime soon unless somebody paid me to do

17:24.080 --> 17:25.080
it.

17:25.080 --> 17:26.080
Yeah.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.080
From from a revenue standpoint.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.080
Yeah.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.080
Yeah, you're right.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.080
Yeah.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.080
Yeah.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.080
I mean, that's kind of crazy.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.080
So although I don't think that's a valid argument, I'm not a lawyer, but I can't imagine going

17:34.080 --> 17:35.080
into court.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.080
But yes, Your Honor.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.600
But that 80 percent of the market won't buy my smurf berries.

17:38.600 --> 17:45.920
It just kind of feels like saying that Disneyland has a monopoly on, you know, event parks.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.280
Well, that's true.

17:47.280 --> 17:50.040
Like they are the biggest and they're the most expensive.

17:50.040 --> 17:53.480
And when you go in, it is all Disney from top to bottom.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.480
But there's six flags.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.840
There's, you know, Splash Mountain.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.520
There's there's other stuff out there.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.080
There's Silverwoods in Idaho.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.600
There's all there's other Universal Studios.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.600
They will.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.600
If you live in Florida, they will send you a letter every month until you sign up for

18:05.600 --> 18:07.680
their pass, reminding you that they're there.

18:07.680 --> 18:12.480
I'm guessing wildly, but I bet you if you looked up at the overall percentage of different

18:12.480 --> 18:16.520
types of fairgrounds in parks like that, Disney was probably the minority.

18:16.520 --> 18:20.000
If you look around the world, you know, it's like claiming that Disney is has a monopoly

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
on this market.

18:21.000 --> 18:27.300
And I, I agree that if you go into Disney's Park, Disney has a monopoly.

18:27.300 --> 18:30.120
But you chose to go into Disney's Park.

18:30.120 --> 18:34.640
And I know this is an old argument, but I'm just trying to I'm just trying to grasp quite

18:34.640 --> 18:38.800
how serious this is, because this is a really weird angle to take on it.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.680
But like if you take if we screw this up, like just thinking about Tyler's email and

18:41.680 --> 18:44.840
we say we take Apple down, what has been changed?

18:44.840 --> 18:48.880
What's been accomplished is now on 20 to 30 percent of the mobile market.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.040
There's more flexible payment options.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.040
That's what we're going to accomplish.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.720
I mean, that's a good thing, I guess.

18:53.720 --> 18:57.160
But I don't know.

18:57.160 --> 19:00.280
Seems like you give Apple five to 12 years and they're going to be there themselves anyways.

19:00.280 --> 19:05.640
I mean, maybe not, but it just doesn't seem like it doesn't solve the overall problem.

19:05.640 --> 19:10.180
That's like these five tech companies control our entire lives and you literally cannot

19:10.180 --> 19:13.360
go through modern life without touching one of them.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.080
That's the real problem we have now.

19:15.080 --> 19:18.840
Not that, you know, that 20 percent of the market can't use Stripe to pay for an app.

19:18.840 --> 19:22.640
I mean, it's an issue, but is it really the issue that the Justice Department?

19:22.640 --> 19:23.640
I don't know.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.640
Well, that's what I was going to say.

19:24.640 --> 19:29.600
The real problem is that to solve the problem, you just stated that these five monoliths

19:29.600 --> 19:34.040
are basically a presence of everyone's life that they cannot realistically avoid.

19:34.040 --> 19:38.640
You would need functioning government, which we don't have.

19:38.640 --> 19:43.440
So that people are just trying to like use the courts as a way to, you know, conjure

19:43.440 --> 19:49.880
litigation and to do that, the only route, because honestly, if you want to like dunk

19:49.880 --> 19:53.920
on Android people, sorry, most of the audience who has Android.

19:53.920 --> 19:58.040
Another way to look at it is why don't Android users spend more money?

19:58.040 --> 19:59.040
Right.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.160
And you can you actually market to them differently?

20:01.160 --> 20:04.840
I think that's a very complicated, very complicated problem.

20:04.840 --> 20:05.880
It's a complicated thing.

20:05.880 --> 20:12.080
And there's a strong case that if you're on the Apple side of life, you just say, it is

20:12.080 --> 20:13.080
not my problem.

20:13.080 --> 20:19.320
It is not my job to make your software successful if you don't like our platform, go to the

20:19.320 --> 20:20.320
other platform.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.320
Yeah.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.320
I don't know.

20:22.320 --> 20:27.360
I like I sort of want that not to be true because like my issue is more all the restrictions

20:27.360 --> 20:31.800
on what developers can do less than 30 percent, even though it is ridiculous.

20:31.800 --> 20:36.300
You know, and maybe I'm wrong, Gus 77 in the chat room linked me to counterpoint market

20:36.300 --> 20:40.480
share data that was published on August 16th of 2021.

20:40.480 --> 20:44.000
And it shows that for the last this just goes back to Q1 2020.

20:44.000 --> 20:50.480
But basically, it just shows a steady growth of iPhone for the last year, really kind of

20:50.480 --> 20:54.760
since the pandemic began going to today.

20:54.760 --> 20:59.080
The iPhone has just gobbled up market share and according to these stats that now has

20:59.080 --> 21:01.640
a 53 percent market.

21:01.640 --> 21:06.840
Now this I don't know if this is true, because they also at one point claimed at a 65 percent

21:06.840 --> 21:10.000
market share and then it dropped down to 55 and now it's 53.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.560
So I don't know, maybe it's going back down.

21:12.560 --> 21:17.120
But according to these stats, it's at it's at over 50 percent of the market.

21:17.120 --> 21:20.080
So I guess you could start considering a monopoly at that point.

21:20.080 --> 21:25.020
However, it seems pretty tenuous if if just three quarters ago is at 65 percent and now

21:25.020 --> 21:26.800
it's at 53 percent.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.320
Seems pretty tenuous monopoly to me.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.240
Oh, well, this will be another three years.

21:32.240 --> 21:33.240
He wants to learn.

21:33.240 --> 21:37.920
He says, I know this is not always topical, but it's a bit of an evergreen question, something

21:37.920 --> 21:39.680
I thought you guys might have some thoughts on.

21:39.680 --> 21:43.520
I'm an RN by employment, but I self identify as a general purpose nerd, really.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.480
And I've always been more of a hardware guy.

21:45.480 --> 21:48.720
I like to solder and, you know, I like to do my own custom sensors and hook them up

21:48.720 --> 21:49.720
to home assistant.

21:49.720 --> 21:50.720
Ha ha.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.720
Atta boy, Chrissy.

21:51.720 --> 21:55.680
He goes on to say, for example, I like to wire up the various configurations and always

21:55.680 --> 21:58.080
make sure I get the best speed bump.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.480
I'd like to learn some basic coding, though, to fill in the gaps of my knowledge.

22:01.480 --> 22:06.880
I've got no formal training anything aside from one credit of VB I took in high school.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.280
That's the most important class.

22:08.280 --> 22:12.080
So also dating himself slightly.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.760
I'm not trying to write standalone software or anything.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.200
So any thoughts on like maybe what I could do?

22:17.200 --> 22:22.440
Remember, I'm somebody with a negative amount of free time or really hardly disposable income.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.120
But I can learn some basic coding and programming.

22:25.120 --> 22:29.120
But what can I do with zero prior knowledge?

22:29.120 --> 22:31.840
And that just sounds like a fun challenge.

22:31.840 --> 22:36.360
I thought maybe since Chris was working with Home Assistant.

22:36.360 --> 22:41.020
I thought this could be an excellent opportunity to learn Python because the Home Assistant

22:41.020 --> 22:42.520
project is written in Python.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.720
No, that's exactly what I was going to suggest.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.680
Do some of your your home automation stuff in Python.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.800
I mean, talk about a great language to jump into.

22:49.800 --> 22:56.600
There's so many, so many resources to learn Python to you found a really, a really good

22:56.600 --> 23:01.280
one that it's a type of resource that completely clicks with the way I learn.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.800
I like this.

23:02.800 --> 23:07.320
It's called understanding all of Python through its built ins.

23:07.320 --> 23:12.320
So this is an idea of just learning quite a lot about what Python is capable of and

23:12.320 --> 23:16.840
its various features by just learning what all of the built in options are and what they

23:16.840 --> 23:17.840
do.

23:17.840 --> 23:18.840
Yeah.

23:18.840 --> 23:22.800
Basically telling you what features obviously is not, you know, comprehensive, but what

23:22.800 --> 23:27.240
features the designers of language think were so important that they had to have like special

23:27.240 --> 23:30.800
built in functionality for I have to say, it's a pretty novel way.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.280
I've never thought of it this way, but you know what?

23:33.280 --> 23:37.800
For someone, someone like the writer coming in kind of technical, but doesn't, you know,

23:37.800 --> 23:41.000
not really a programmer, that's probably a good good blog post to look over.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Oh, man.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.360
It's so extensive.

23:44.360 --> 23:45.440
It's so extensive.

23:45.440 --> 23:48.680
It's so well done too and formatted really, really well too.

23:48.680 --> 23:52.200
So it's very easy to read the actual code and understand what it's doing.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.800
It's top notch.

23:53.800 --> 23:57.320
The other thing, and this might be a, maybe he's too advanced for this now, but a spark

23:57.320 --> 24:02.800
fun, they sell like boards and stuff, but they have a whole like burn section where

24:02.800 --> 24:07.280
they do, they have like videos on how to, you know, you buy the lighter sensor.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.280
How do you program it?

24:08.280 --> 24:09.280
How do you set it together?

24:09.280 --> 24:10.280
How do you do the soldering?

24:10.280 --> 24:15.080
I know for him, he already can do the soldering it sounds like, but that might be a route

24:15.080 --> 24:17.560
for folks trying to learn how to do this kind of thing.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.120
That could be a really fun way to do it.

24:19.120 --> 24:22.880
If you're more of a hands-on visual style learner, that could be a great resource.

24:22.880 --> 24:27.820
I'll mention that our friends over at a cloud guru have an entry-level Python programmer

24:27.820 --> 24:30.480
course that'll help you get a certification as well.

24:30.480 --> 24:34.240
The certified entry-level Python programmer certification is what it's called.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.600
And it's a great place to start when getting started with Python, or if you even want to

24:37.600 --> 24:40.020
consider getting a Python certification.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.020
Go check it out.

24:41.020 --> 24:44.800
They'll go over Python data types, control flow structures, data collections, functions

24:44.800 --> 24:45.800
and generators.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.320
By the time you complete the course, you should be more than comfortable with Python.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.840
I'll have a link to that in the sponsored section of the show notes, or you can go over

24:52.840 --> 24:57.760
to a cloud guru and search for certified entry-level Python programmer certification, quite the

24:57.760 --> 25:00.880
mouthful link in the show notes at a cloud guru.com.

25:00.880 --> 25:04.280
And that could be a great way to get started perhaps.

25:04.280 --> 25:05.480
What do you think, Mr. Dominic?

25:05.480 --> 25:06.480
Are you ready?

25:06.480 --> 25:08.400
Should we, should we talk about the big news?

25:08.400 --> 25:10.960
Do you feel like we've, we've done our duty for the people?

25:10.960 --> 25:12.440
I feel like we've done our duty.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.440
We've dutied.

25:13.440 --> 25:20.440
So tell us about Alice and, and what Alice is and I don't know, I personally love to

25:20.440 --> 25:21.440
hear the backstory stuff.

25:21.440 --> 25:24.400
So maybe any of that kind of you want stuff you want to share too.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.400
Yeah.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.680
So it's a, it's a conversational UI, right?

25:27.680 --> 25:28.680
So that's probably a big part.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.320
It lives in Slack and MS teams.

25:31.320 --> 25:35.840
So you interact with it via speech or not speech, but typing.

25:35.840 --> 25:39.120
People might notice a couple of weeks ago, I was talking about and tweeting my NLT key

25:39.120 --> 25:50.640
NLT kit using that fast API, async IO rust via a very, very cool library called Pio three,

25:50.640 --> 25:53.680
which lets you take a rust.

25:53.680 --> 25:58.480
I always, I always mix up how they say this, but basically, you know, a rust module and

25:58.480 --> 26:05.280
make it into a Python module that you call and it feels and looks like Python from, you

26:05.280 --> 26:07.400
know, from the consumer's perspective, right?

26:07.400 --> 26:09.420
The consuming developer's perspective.

26:09.420 --> 26:14.800
So that's kind of the technical underpinnings, a lot of WebSockety stuff, particularly for

26:14.800 --> 26:22.360
Slack because Slack is amazing and has a great WebSocket API that actually works unlike others.

26:22.360 --> 26:26.820
Just on top of that too, it's, it's a tool that so many people already have.

26:26.820 --> 26:30.600
So it's just, it's like just plugging into something that's already part of their workflow.

26:30.600 --> 26:31.600
Exactly.

26:31.600 --> 26:32.600
Exactly.

26:32.600 --> 26:36.880
So the whole idea here is to, let's say you're a midsize business, right?

26:36.880 --> 26:45.800
You have some system, some contractor probably wrote in VB6 and it's sitting there holding

26:45.800 --> 26:46.800
you back, right?

26:46.800 --> 26:51.520
You want to move on to more, you know, more modern technologies.

26:51.520 --> 26:55.800
A big need that I kept seeing people kind of calling and reaching out was because of

26:55.800 --> 27:01.080
COVID, they're trying to do like more either hybrid working or just straight remote working.

27:01.080 --> 27:05.440
And these systems that are like behind the firewall, weird VB application are causing

27:05.440 --> 27:06.440
all kinds of problems.

27:06.440 --> 27:09.080
So Alice can also live behind the firewall.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.080
That's kind of the key.

27:10.080 --> 27:11.980
This is not like a SAS that you subscribe to.

27:11.980 --> 27:15.360
This is something where there's an installation implementation.

27:15.360 --> 27:20.120
And from there, basically we take a look at what kind of weird psychedelic data is your

27:20.120 --> 27:23.440
proprietary system coming out with.

27:23.440 --> 27:29.200
She'll compare it to what she already understands and we'll get a close approximation.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.160
We call it universal data fluency.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.820
If we have to tweak it, we will, and we'll go from there.

27:33.820 --> 27:38.520
And the key is once she understands the data, we can then convert it into all the other

27:38.520 --> 27:39.960
formats she knows.

27:39.960 --> 27:40.960
I love this.

27:40.960 --> 27:46.520
So this is universal data fluency is this concept that your business application may

27:46.520 --> 27:52.320
spit out something that really no other application can do anything with, but Alice can understand

27:52.320 --> 27:55.400
it and then translate it into something that is usable.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.840
Am I following you so far?

27:56.840 --> 27:57.840
Right.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.840
So she tries to figure it out, right?

27:58.840 --> 28:00.560
She gets it and then she keeps comparing it.

28:00.560 --> 28:05.440
We have to have a couple of expected outputs, but we go from there and piece by piece she

28:05.440 --> 28:07.120
puts together the structure.

28:07.120 --> 28:14.160
But then let's say, so the value that you add as a company is if it's something so esoteric,

28:14.160 --> 28:17.000
Alice doesn't really recognize what to do with it.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.360
You provide the ability to customize Alice in a way to help her work specifically with

28:22.360 --> 28:23.520
that format.

28:23.520 --> 28:26.460
So the business could reach out to you, contract you to do that bit of work, and then they

28:26.460 --> 28:27.680
have that forever.

28:27.680 --> 28:28.680
Correct.

28:28.680 --> 28:29.680
Right.

28:29.680 --> 28:35.960
If you have some like really insane thing that is unlike anything else we've ever seen,

28:35.960 --> 28:38.160
we can just do that as part of the implementation.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.160
That's awesome.

28:39.160 --> 28:42.100
That's great for you because it means that from time to time you're going to get a contract

28:42.100 --> 28:45.440
to do some work and make some revenue that, you know, makes it worth reinvesting back

28:45.440 --> 28:46.760
into Alice.

28:46.760 --> 28:50.420
And for Pete, for businesses, you know, like the business I've worked with, they'd absolutely,

28:50.420 --> 28:54.360
that's a, it's a great concept for them because it's like a, it's like we, we just have to

28:54.360 --> 28:55.660
hire this chunk of work.

28:55.660 --> 28:58.580
It's not like this ongoing thing that they'll have to do forever.

28:58.580 --> 29:00.640
So it's not going to be like this endless pit of money.

29:00.640 --> 29:04.840
It's you get the software, you hire them for some, from our, some hours of time to do this

29:04.840 --> 29:05.840
for us.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.080
It's, it's pretty straightforward.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.080
Yeah.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.080
That's, that's the whole idea.

29:09.080 --> 29:13.360
I mean, the, the other advantage is once we have an understanding, a comprehension of

29:13.360 --> 29:18.680
your, your, you know, proprietary data format, well then we can do all the automation stuff

29:18.680 --> 29:21.100
that you would expect from any automation tool, right?

29:21.100 --> 29:25.480
Like a Zapier or something like that, where it's like, Oh, I want to automatically, you

29:25.480 --> 29:30.200
know, get this data out of my system and create tickets and Trello, or I want to create, you

29:30.200 --> 29:35.280
know, a report or I want to write an Excel document, stuff like that, or remind a message

29:35.280 --> 29:37.480
in Slack or send a message in Slack.

29:37.480 --> 29:38.480
Yeah.

29:38.480 --> 29:39.480
Save a file and drive, right?

29:39.480 --> 29:41.400
All that stuff.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.200
The key is that first step though, right?

29:43.200 --> 29:47.320
Of deciphering the actual crazy format.

29:47.320 --> 29:52.900
That's why I, that's why I liked the Rosetta Stone analogy because that's, this is a weird

29:52.900 --> 29:54.200
history nerd thing.

29:54.200 --> 29:59.280
But when the Rosetta Stone was found, there was a, I think I believe a French archeologists,

29:59.280 --> 30:03.600
they were able to start translating Egyptian hieroglyphics, which they never could do because

30:03.600 --> 30:07.480
the other languages on the Rosetta Stone were known to them.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.600
So that's the whole, that's the whole point, right?

30:09.600 --> 30:10.600
So that's, yeah.

30:10.600 --> 30:14.320
And this seems like a, it seems like it's gotta be a pretty common business problem

30:14.320 --> 30:18.320
because I don't think I've been in a single business that doesn't have a problem just

30:18.320 --> 30:22.200
like this, where it's either some old app they've purchased, some old application I

30:22.200 --> 30:24.840
should say, or it's something they've built or something like that.

30:24.840 --> 30:28.720
And it's just time to move, time to migrate or time to integrate.

30:28.720 --> 30:31.440
And it's just like this roadblock they always hit.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.440
Yeah.

30:32.440 --> 30:33.880
It was kind of how this idea came about.

30:33.880 --> 30:39.080
I would constantly be in these sales conversations for projects that went something like this.

30:39.080 --> 30:43.540
We have this insane proprietary database we bought from some company.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.560
That company is now out of business.

30:45.560 --> 30:46.840
We don't know how to work with this.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.800
So we're stuck on this old application.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.640
We want you to write a new one.

30:50.640 --> 30:51.740
What's that going to cost?

30:51.740 --> 30:57.200
And the answer was always, well, we can't get your data out or the cost was just most

30:57.200 --> 31:01.320
likely too much for them to want to pursue.

31:01.320 --> 31:03.080
This solves that second problem, right?

31:03.080 --> 31:04.780
Well, it solves both.

31:04.780 --> 31:09.480
This is a cheaper solution because it's, you're just licensing it.

31:09.480 --> 31:12.520
And voila here, but welcome to the modern world.

31:12.520 --> 31:13.520
Yeah.

31:13.520 --> 31:18.900
Well, and for you as a development shop, it means you don't have to build the customer

31:18.900 --> 31:23.400
a GUI that sits on top of this data translation tool that you're one off building for them.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.400
Correct.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.400
That's great.

31:25.400 --> 31:29.040
I mean, it helps you scale across multiple problems without having to invent some sort

31:29.040 --> 31:31.840
of graphical interface every single time.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.960
And oh man, I think that's really clever.

31:33.960 --> 31:34.960
I like it.

31:34.960 --> 31:39.300
Do you have an idea of what kind of size, like, is this like a small business tool?

31:39.300 --> 31:40.560
Is this like a government tool?

31:40.560 --> 31:43.840
Like what do you, what's your idea on that kind of like ideal customer?

31:43.840 --> 31:44.840
Yeah.

31:44.840 --> 31:49.160
I think it's more than the medium to smaller enterprise, not small business, but like you

31:49.160 --> 31:53.840
got 50 to like a hundred people ish, right.

31:53.840 --> 31:57.920
Where you're, you're big enough that you have custom systems already that are probably kind

31:57.920 --> 31:58.920
of older.

31:58.920 --> 32:03.000
And you could probably use some workflow automation, but you're not like, you don't have that giant

32:03.000 --> 32:08.740
enterprise contracts with like, you know, Microsoft or or Oracle or whoever, right.

32:08.740 --> 32:13.520
And they're probably using some sort of team communication tool and cloud storage and all

32:13.520 --> 32:14.520
that.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.520
Yeah.

32:15.520 --> 32:16.520
That's pretty good.

32:16.520 --> 32:21.080
So, uh, we should, we should mention if people want to check it out for themselves, alice.dev

32:21.080 --> 32:23.720
and we'll have a link in the show notes.

32:23.720 --> 32:24.880
It looks so slick.

32:24.880 --> 32:29.880
I, whoever's doing your, uh, your Alice artwork, you got to hook me up because that's not a

32:29.880 --> 32:30.880
problem.

32:30.880 --> 32:31.880
You know what I'm saying?

32:31.880 --> 32:36.400
I want some of that work always comes out good.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.640
So there was a little, a little hiccup though.

32:38.640 --> 32:43.200
Oh, so somehow my domain got flagged as malware.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.200
Yes.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.200
Right.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.200
Right.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.200
Right.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.200
Right.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.200
As you're like about to launch to this weekend.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.200
Yeah.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.200
Right.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.200
Oh man.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.200
So I ran around with like a chicken with his head cut off all weekend.

32:53.200 --> 32:59.920
So I've been like Dick Tracy and the underbelly of these cyber security companies that, ah,

32:59.920 --> 33:02.960
so that's why you got a new Apple watch.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.960
I did not get a new Apple watch.

33:04.960 --> 33:11.160
I learned something very disturbing and that is one of the ways these companies decide if

33:11.160 --> 33:15.800
your site is malicious is they just look at each other and say, did the other one say

33:15.800 --> 33:21.600
it's malicious, which creates a cascading false positive, which is exactly what happened

33:21.600 --> 33:22.600
here.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.600
Yeah.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.360
So you're, in other words, not only did you have like issues with one, but you had issues

33:26.360 --> 33:29.640
with multiple social media sites like Facebook and Twitter were blocking you at the same

33:29.640 --> 33:30.640
time, right?

33:30.640 --> 33:31.640
Uh, yes.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.040
I will give Facebook some credit though.

33:33.040 --> 33:38.240
They're their tool to like put in the URL and like ask them to manually check it.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.920
They were, they were very fast.

33:39.920 --> 33:40.920
They did it.

33:40.920 --> 33:41.920
You were fine.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.080
And I guess the Genesis is, is that at one point there was like something wonky on the

33:45.080 --> 33:48.600
site, something, something flagged it, but then it just, you just get passed around on

33:48.600 --> 33:51.040
these lists even after it's fixed.

33:51.040 --> 33:54.760
I think what happened is at one point last year I had to have an XE for someone to download

33:54.760 --> 33:55.760
and I just put it on the server.

33:55.760 --> 33:56.760
Oh, that's right.

33:56.760 --> 33:57.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.760
Right.

33:58.760 --> 34:01.000
I think that's like a no, no, you can't really, you're not supposed to do that.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Yeah, yeah.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
The demo XE.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Yep.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
That, that's right.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.780
And then you got flagged and now it's in a database and it takes months for these databases

34:08.780 --> 34:10.440
to propagate is the other thing.

34:10.440 --> 34:15.000
Oh man, you know, uh, you should use Linode object storage for that.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
I really should.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.320
That's like the best, the solution to this problem.

34:19.320 --> 34:20.320
Amazing.

34:20.320 --> 34:23.480
Well, um, so that's like super last minute stress.

34:23.480 --> 34:27.720
I mean, think about everybody, put yourself in Mike's shoes for a second.

34:27.720 --> 34:32.120
You've been pushing for weeks, you've been building towards something.

34:32.120 --> 34:37.960
It's now finally time to release it to the world, to go public, to launch it and your

34:37.960 --> 34:43.040
site gets blacklisted by social media, which when there's no events going on is like the

34:43.040 --> 34:46.760
primary platform to promote something like this.

34:46.760 --> 34:50.240
I mean, you must have been extremely pissed.

34:50.240 --> 34:58.880
Uh, I was more pissed when I realized that Twitter, um, their support option is you tweet

34:58.880 --> 35:00.240
at them and they ignore you.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.240
Yeah.

35:01.240 --> 35:02.240
That's also the problem.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.960
It's much like the Google Python script of go pounce and yeah.

35:04.960 --> 35:09.280
Yeah, they arbitrarily decide to censor you for whatever reason.

35:09.280 --> 35:12.580
And then there's really no, there's no like repercussions.

35:12.580 --> 35:13.580
You can take these.

35:13.580 --> 35:14.580
Okay.

35:14.580 --> 35:19.480
Well at the same time, emailing me, emailing me to see if I'm ready to run the ads, which

35:19.480 --> 35:20.480
I thought was hilarious.

35:20.480 --> 35:21.480
Oh yeah.

35:21.480 --> 35:22.480
That's great.

35:22.480 --> 35:23.480
Yeah.

35:23.480 --> 35:24.480
They'll happily take your ad money.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.480
Right.

35:25.480 --> 35:26.680
I was like, uh, let's just wait.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.320
So that the only thing not resolved.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.760
So the Alice site never had a problem.

35:30.760 --> 35:36.080
The mad botter site now doesn't, but Twitter has not caught up yet.

35:36.080 --> 35:39.120
So unless it has, you know, in the last couple of hours, but yeah.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.120
All right.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.960
So I know optimus gray, there was no malware on the site.

35:42.960 --> 35:45.380
It's just crap forever.

35:45.380 --> 35:47.080
Now here's my question.

35:47.080 --> 35:52.420
When you started this, this, this project, you must have expected that by now trade shows

35:52.420 --> 35:55.800
would be a thing and that you'd be out there shucking and jive and shaking hands.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.680
I have a box of coasters.

35:57.680 --> 36:04.000
Yes, I, I did in the stickers and stuff like that.

36:04.000 --> 36:10.920
I was, uh, yeah, I was thinking, all right, we'll be going to like, like, you know, South

36:10.920 --> 36:13.960
East Linux or somewhere in Denver, right?

36:13.960 --> 36:14.960
We'll be doing something.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.720
No, no, we're not.

36:16.720 --> 36:21.440
So do you feel like that's going to be a, uh, an impedance?

36:21.440 --> 36:24.480
Like it's going to be a softer launch because of that?

36:24.480 --> 36:26.720
Um, I, I don't know.

36:26.720 --> 36:27.720
Right.

36:27.720 --> 36:31.160
This is where I, I'm a little out of my depth.

36:31.160 --> 36:35.480
So I, I hired a kind of like PR consultant lady.

36:35.480 --> 36:39.840
And when I told her that you couldn't tweet the link to the company site, I could hear

36:39.840 --> 36:41.360
her head explode on the phone.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.360
She's like, I quit.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.360
She's like, I hate it.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.360
What did you do?

36:44.360 --> 36:47.000
She's like, I was like, nothing.

36:47.000 --> 36:53.560
So the, the marketing strategy is going to be a social media targeting, giving the big

36:53.560 --> 36:55.920
bad blue app money.

36:55.920 --> 36:57.640
Both big bad blue apps actually.

36:57.640 --> 36:58.640
Yeah.

36:58.640 --> 37:02.420
I historically do not believe in this.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.800
So this is kind of a maiden voyage for me.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.800
Hmm.

37:05.800 --> 37:08.240
You know, I'm, I'm, I've got like savvy cow running.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.240
I'm, I'm all hip now.

37:09.240 --> 37:15.320
Chris, I'm, it's gone or the martini bar, you know, side deals at the trade show days.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.440
Now you're schlepping it with the rest of us on the internet.

37:17.440 --> 37:20.920
I'm, I'm like thinking about CPM and I'm like, I don't, I don't like how this works.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.400
It sounds like I'm going to spend a lot of money.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.400
Yeah.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.900
You said you started thinking like, well, okay, so then, okay, how much is each person

37:25.900 --> 37:26.900
worth to me?

37:26.900 --> 37:29.080
And I don't know about that line of thinking, you know,

37:29.080 --> 37:33.880
And I'm like, do I want to like advertise this on like tech podcasts or is everybody

37:33.880 --> 37:36.480
be like, ah, we could do this in a weekend as developers will.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.480
That's a good question.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.480
Huh?

37:38.480 --> 37:43.680
So I'm, I'm trying, actually, I got to talk to you about that too, but I'm probably going

37:43.680 --> 37:48.140
to hold my horses until the end of the month, see what happens organically.

37:48.140 --> 37:53.040
And I have some existing customers I'm reaching out to, you know, I feel icky giving Facebook

37:53.040 --> 37:54.040
money.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.040
Yeah.

37:55.040 --> 38:01.360
That's the one I've been advised and it's just like disturbing how granular you can

38:01.360 --> 38:02.360
get.

38:02.360 --> 38:05.620
I mean, it must work or else CBS and the wall street journal and the New York times wouldn't

38:05.620 --> 38:08.920
be going after Facebook on a daily basis anymore.

38:08.920 --> 38:09.920
You know, it must work.

38:09.920 --> 38:16.560
It's, it seems kind of like, okay, so, you know, we're, we're a, we're a small business.

38:16.560 --> 38:22.340
So we want to target people we can reasonably kind of access, right?

38:22.340 --> 38:26.440
So okay, let's just say the Southeast United States and like the New York, New Jersey metropolitan

38:26.440 --> 38:30.820
area where I have, you know, existing relationships, stuff like that.

38:30.820 --> 38:35.680
And the company, like company size, you can target the title of the person or what type

38:35.680 --> 38:37.060
of work they do.

38:37.060 --> 38:38.460
Do they have a dog?

38:38.460 --> 38:42.160
I mean, it's, it's really, it's pretty impressive, huh?

38:42.160 --> 38:43.160
It's disturbing.

38:43.160 --> 38:44.160
Yeah.

38:44.160 --> 38:49.720
But I'm going to try it because it's, you know, I would much rather go to like Linux

38:49.720 --> 38:53.800
Fest Northwest, even though I wouldn't be presenting there and just like bump into somebody

38:53.800 --> 38:56.040
who might want something, right?

38:56.040 --> 39:00.640
Or you know, one of the kind of more business oriented chambers of commerce shows I used,

39:00.640 --> 39:02.120
I used to do down here.

39:02.120 --> 39:06.960
If you came to Linux Fest Northwest, you could just sit at the JB table and you would have

39:06.960 --> 39:09.720
a line of people who want to talk to you.

39:09.720 --> 39:10.720
That's yeah.

39:10.720 --> 39:11.720
Yeah.

39:11.720 --> 39:12.720
It's true.

39:12.720 --> 39:21.680
You know, I think, you know, you're, you're right in a sense, like I could see you trying

39:21.680 --> 39:25.880
to pitch us at a tech audience and then be like, Oh, I could, I could build a shell script

39:25.880 --> 39:30.680
that would take that data file and convert, but the reality is the value that you're really

39:30.680 --> 39:35.580
offering is the ability to here's a done thing.

39:35.580 --> 39:40.660
And for a set fixed amount of cost, we can customize said thing and then we can provide

39:40.660 --> 39:44.460
support for that if there needs to be a change for future applications compatibility down

39:44.460 --> 39:52.680
the road, that bulk of work ain't nobody in it got time for nobody with a job today has

39:52.680 --> 39:53.680
time for that.

39:53.680 --> 39:57.160
And the people who would be willing to go home and spend their evenings building that

39:57.160 --> 40:01.160
for their company, I hope they're getting paid a lot because they're very, very, very

40:01.160 --> 40:03.920
dedicated and valuable to that company.

40:03.920 --> 40:09.360
But your real value there is you're, you've solved, if not the entire problem, 90% of

40:09.360 --> 40:15.600
the problem and then you, because you're not slack, because you're not some huge company,

40:15.600 --> 40:21.520
because you are a development shop that is, you know, approachable by a hundred to 200

40:21.520 --> 40:26.480
person company, you can, you can interface with them and have a business relationship

40:26.480 --> 40:32.000
that they can't have with a larger solution or a, you know, a guy named Ted who spent

40:32.000 --> 40:33.800
the night building a bash script.

40:33.800 --> 40:34.800
That's the real value, right?

40:34.800 --> 40:38.960
And we're also not coming in with some platform that's going to like, you know, you don't

40:38.960 --> 40:41.600
have, you don't have to go full Oracle.

40:41.600 --> 40:44.640
I pick an Oracle because it's Oracle, right?

40:44.640 --> 40:46.800
You don't, you don't, you don't have to like replace everything you have, including your

40:46.800 --> 40:47.800
coffee machine.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.960
It's like, no, just Alice kind of just sits there and helps you out.

40:50.960 --> 40:56.520
You want to stick with whatever weird, by the way, the amount of huge businesses that

40:56.520 --> 41:03.000
I have spoken to in my very, very lame sales attempts that are just running on access and

41:03.000 --> 41:04.480
they're ashamed.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.480
You can hear it.

41:05.480 --> 41:08.000
Well, actually that's a, that's, that's, that's access.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.080
Like the IT guy knows what he's doing as well.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.840
You know what the sad thing is?

41:13.840 --> 41:16.840
They're a notch above the folks that are running it all out of a spreadsheet.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.560
That's the sad reality.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.560
Yeah.

41:19.560 --> 41:27.800
I have people in my family, uh, ma who are, I don't know what I would call this, but it's

41:27.800 --> 41:28.800
Excel sorcery.

41:28.800 --> 41:29.800
Sure.

41:29.800 --> 41:30.800
Yeah.

41:30.800 --> 41:34.120
Like I have seen spreadsheets do things that I did not think were possible.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.120
Yeah.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.180
They like have their whole, a whole environment in there.

41:37.180 --> 41:38.180
Yeah.

41:38.180 --> 41:39.180
They're running VB six.

41:39.180 --> 41:41.520
Of course they just don't know it.

41:41.520 --> 41:46.120
This is a, this is exciting because it's a project that you're shipping that is like

41:46.120 --> 41:50.160
the realization of a lot of the technologies we've been covering over the last six months

41:50.160 --> 41:51.320
on the show.

41:51.320 --> 41:53.960
And so now it's like, we're going to see how they actually do in practice.

41:53.960 --> 41:54.960
Yes, we are.

41:54.960 --> 41:59.920
And of course it's done, but obviously I'm adding more integrations, which means more

41:59.920 --> 42:03.880
data formats and we're just going to keep on trucking.

You heard about this big old Twitch leak that happened where they got the source code and

43:37.280 --> 43:38.520
did you see the commit notes?

43:38.520 --> 43:39.520
Oh man.

43:39.520 --> 43:40.520
No, I didn't.

43:40.520 --> 43:41.520
Glorious.

43:41.520 --> 43:42.520
Oh yeah.

43:42.520 --> 43:45.200
One guy committed, I don't know why this works.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.200
Awesome.

43:46.200 --> 43:49.440
Way to go Amazon, goodbye.

43:49.440 --> 43:54.220
So what I thought was interesting is when I read through some numbers that the Wall

43:54.220 --> 43:57.680
Street Journal went through, they did some math.

43:57.680 --> 44:02.760
I was getting a lot of App Store vibes from this and the situation that we've been talking

44:02.760 --> 44:09.760
about with developers I think is happening at an even faster rate with even less oversight

44:09.760 --> 44:11.400
to content creators.

44:11.400 --> 44:13.960
Now check this out, okay?

44:13.960 --> 44:20.000
The top 1% of Twitch streamers made over half of all the money paid out in 2021 so far.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.080
Doesn't that sound like exactly how it works with the App Store?

44:23.080 --> 44:25.360
Are they also selling Smurf Berries?

44:25.360 --> 44:33.080
189 million so far this year, up from 517 million over the same period last year.

44:33.080 --> 44:38.680
Three quarters of the users making any money this year have made less than $120.

44:38.680 --> 44:41.240
Three quarters of the users have made less than $120.

44:41.240 --> 44:44.780
Wow, that sounds like the Android App Store.

44:44.780 --> 44:51.720
And here's what's even wild is the Wall Street Journal's analysis excluded 896,000 accounts

44:51.720 --> 44:56.760
that have either made less than $120 or actually owe Twitch money for some reason.

44:56.760 --> 45:04.480
There's 890 accounts, 890,000 accounts that they basically are excluding from this analysis.

45:04.480 --> 45:08.320
The best paid streamer on Twitch made more than $5 million this year so far.

45:08.320 --> 45:10.600
This is just into September.

45:10.600 --> 45:20.120
Only 0.06% of Twitch streamers received over the US median house income of $67,000.

45:20.120 --> 45:24.000
A quarter of all revenue was earned by the top 1,000 accounts.

45:24.000 --> 45:29.640
The top 1% of Twitch streamers made over half of all money paid out in 2021.

45:29.640 --> 45:31.580
These might be worse than the App Store numbers.

45:31.580 --> 45:32.580
That's what I'm saying.

45:32.580 --> 45:35.080
And it's happening at a faster pace, too.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.400
Amazon's only owned Twitch for a few years.

45:37.400 --> 45:40.560
I'm frantically trying to look up the App Store numbers, but I'm not gonna be able to

45:40.560 --> 45:41.560
do it fast enough.

45:41.560 --> 45:44.860
And let me tell you, my friend, the situation's not great with Spotify and podcasts either.

45:44.860 --> 45:46.160
They're trying to do the same exact thing.

45:46.160 --> 45:50.680
I was just gonna say, Marco Arment was just on Twitter going off about Gimlet, Glimlet,

45:50.680 --> 45:51.680
something like that.

45:51.680 --> 45:52.680
Oh, yeah.

45:52.680 --> 45:53.680
Yeah.

45:53.680 --> 45:54.680
Doesn't Spotify own them now?

45:54.680 --> 45:55.680
Yeah.

45:55.680 --> 45:59.120
And it's apparently he was like an investor and they're doing this kind of lockdown stuff

45:59.120 --> 46:00.600
or paywall, whatever.

46:00.600 --> 46:01.600
Yeah, that's right.

46:01.600 --> 46:03.400
He got a payout when Spotify bought them.

46:03.400 --> 46:04.400
Oh, good for him.

46:04.400 --> 46:05.400
I mean, that's right.

46:05.400 --> 46:06.400
Yeah.

46:06.400 --> 46:07.400
Yeah.

46:07.400 --> 46:08.400
Isn't that nice?

46:08.400 --> 46:09.400
Yeah.

46:09.400 --> 46:12.920
It's happening to content at a pretty rapid pace.

46:12.920 --> 46:17.680
I mean, I just want to say, Mr. Fisher, build that wall.

46:17.680 --> 46:18.680
I know.

46:18.680 --> 46:21.400
Well, Spotify did hit me up with a proposal.

46:21.400 --> 46:26.880
It was like super low ad rates, but it was like guaranteed three ads a show and you get

46:26.880 --> 46:28.720
access to our music library.

46:28.720 --> 46:29.720
And I went, what?

46:29.720 --> 46:31.120
Let me think about that.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.120
But no, I'm not.

46:32.120 --> 46:33.120
No.

46:33.120 --> 46:34.120
Wait, wait.

46:34.120 --> 46:35.120
To like do a DJ show?

46:35.120 --> 46:36.120
No.

46:36.120 --> 46:37.120
But you could.

46:37.120 --> 46:38.120
But yeah, like if you use their...

46:38.120 --> 46:40.080
So you have to switch your publishing platform.

46:40.080 --> 46:43.400
You have to switch to their feed servers and all that kind of stuff.

46:43.400 --> 46:47.360
But if you publish through, I'm not sure about this.

46:47.360 --> 46:52.220
I think you can still have a public RSS feed, but you have to publish through their system.

46:52.220 --> 46:59.360
But if you do that, they give you license like a radio station to their music library.

46:59.360 --> 47:04.760
So you could do a DJ show or we could have like your favorite song as our intro music,

47:04.760 --> 47:06.040
that kind of thing.

47:06.040 --> 47:07.880
But you have to sell your soul.

47:07.880 --> 47:08.880
They own you.

47:08.880 --> 47:13.560
They own the content and they own all the ad deals and they give you a very small cut,

47:13.560 --> 47:14.880
but they give you a lot of small cuts.

47:14.880 --> 47:18.080
I mean, have you ever read the Apple developer agreement?

47:18.080 --> 47:20.640
The soul's already got a couple of markers on it.

47:20.640 --> 47:21.640
I know.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.600
And Twitch is doing the same thing.

47:23.600 --> 47:25.120
YouTube is going down its dark route.

47:25.120 --> 47:33.520
I tell you, the only thing that's really going to save podcasting is if listeners continue

47:33.520 --> 47:37.680
to use and insist they use their own podcast apps, their favorite podcast app.

47:37.680 --> 47:42.240
If they use these, you know, and I, we have people listening on Spotify and I am grateful

47:42.240 --> 47:46.840
they listen, especially if it's the best way or only way for you to listen.

47:46.840 --> 47:51.280
But the best thing you could do is subscribe to the show at coder.show slash subscribe

47:51.280 --> 47:54.340
in an independent podcast app.

47:54.340 --> 47:58.880
That isn't owned by Apple or Amazon or Spotify.

47:58.880 --> 47:59.880
I love overcast.

47:59.880 --> 48:00.880
Right?

48:00.880 --> 48:01.880
It's great.

48:01.880 --> 48:02.880
You'll pry it from my cold dead hands.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.080
Hey, whatever happened to pocket cast?

48:05.080 --> 48:06.080
Are they still around?

48:06.080 --> 48:07.080
Yeah.

48:07.080 --> 48:11.440
They were bought by like a group that NPR was part of and now they're selling it.

48:11.440 --> 48:12.760
They're selling it again.

48:12.760 --> 48:14.080
So that group is selling it off.

48:14.080 --> 48:15.440
They used to be Indie, right?

48:15.440 --> 48:20.560
They were like a couple of folks, I could have sworn, wasn't it shifty jelly was the

48:20.560 --> 48:21.560
name of the corporation.

48:21.560 --> 48:22.560
Good memory.

48:22.560 --> 48:23.560
Yeah.

48:23.560 --> 48:30.720
And then they got bought by NPR and this group of like public radio stations and other folks.

48:30.720 --> 48:37.640
And then NPR pushed hard for tracking in app tracking that would basically ping an HTTP

48:37.640 --> 48:41.540
address when you pause, rewind, fast forward, skip, you know, that kind of stuff to try

48:41.540 --> 48:44.640
to create metrics of where people are listening and not listening.

48:44.640 --> 48:48.440
And they wanted to create an industry standard of tracking in the podcast apps and they wanted

48:48.440 --> 48:51.920
to deploy that in pocket cast first and have pocket cast sort of roll it out and everybody

48:51.920 --> 48:53.960
followed suit.

48:53.960 --> 48:59.440
And thankfully we have enough independent podcast app creators that said no, and they

48:59.440 --> 49:02.800
have enough market share that they could say no.

49:02.800 --> 49:08.120
And so it never took off and the tracking standard never was adopted.

49:08.120 --> 49:11.200
And so I think NPR got kind of frustrated and their group and they've just decided to

49:11.200 --> 49:12.200
sell it.

49:12.200 --> 49:16.200
This sounds a little awful lot like streaming video content where if you want to watch a

49:16.200 --> 49:20.640
Star Trek discovery, God damn it, CBS.

49:20.640 --> 49:21.960
That's exactly what they want to do.

49:21.960 --> 49:26.520
And if you, if you listen in the Spotify app, they have metrics of where you listen, what

49:26.520 --> 49:28.120
you, what you rewind, what you skip.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.880
They know everything.

49:29.880 --> 49:30.880
That's a bit creepy.

49:30.880 --> 49:31.880
Let's see.

49:31.880 --> 49:32.880
Just let me have my pot.

49:32.880 --> 49:38.200
I mean, podcast ads used to be, at least on me, the most, one of the most effective ways

49:38.200 --> 49:39.200
to advertise.

49:39.200 --> 49:43.240
Like, yeah, I buy stuff off pocket ads even today all the time.

49:43.240 --> 49:44.960
I think it's the kind we do though, right?

49:44.960 --> 49:49.340
Like when you hear, like when you, when you turn on a planet money or something and they

49:49.340 --> 49:55.280
blast you with two pre-produced ads that aren't even from the hosts that do the show, like

49:55.280 --> 49:58.060
they don't stick at all for me.

49:58.060 --> 50:00.360
They, they don't register at all.

50:00.360 --> 50:05.600
But if somebody comes on and you know, like, you know, at the beginning of the year I bought

50:05.600 --> 50:07.160
some Warby Parker pants.

50:07.160 --> 50:08.360
I think it's Warby Parker, right?

50:08.360 --> 50:09.360
No, no.

50:09.360 --> 50:10.360
They make pants?

50:10.360 --> 50:11.360
I thought they make glasses.

50:11.360 --> 50:12.360
No, no, no, no, no.

50:12.360 --> 50:13.360
I'm getting them mixed up.

50:13.360 --> 50:14.360
But that's the advertising.

50:14.360 --> 50:15.360
It works.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.360
Warby Parker is the glasses.

50:16.360 --> 50:17.360
Exactly.

50:17.360 --> 50:18.360
But that was an ad.

50:18.360 --> 50:19.360
But no, I'm thinking of Mack Weldon.

50:19.360 --> 50:22.780
I bid on a Mack Weldon deal in a podcast ad, you know, but I don't normally buy it on those

50:22.780 --> 50:25.800
ads that are just pre-rolls and pre-produced and all of that.

50:25.800 --> 50:28.920
I mean, I buy stuff off JB ads all the time, as should you.

50:28.920 --> 50:29.920
That's right.

50:29.920 --> 50:30.920
That's right.

50:30.920 --> 50:31.920
Absolutely.

50:31.920 --> 50:32.920
That's how you do it.

50:32.920 --> 50:33.920
That's how you pay for the tea.

50:33.920 --> 50:34.920
Links in the show notes.

50:34.920 --> 50:39.520
I'm just worried about this and where it's going because really it's just sort of the

50:39.520 --> 50:42.440
trend of everything to get centralized like this.

50:42.440 --> 50:48.400
And I don't know, I guess thankfully we have a very geeky audience, so they're likely to

50:48.400 --> 50:54.960
continue to want things like open RSS feeds and web pages with show notes and stuff like

50:54.960 --> 50:56.760
that.

50:56.760 --> 51:01.120
But maybe not, maybe the average listener won't or maybe it'll change how people consume

51:01.120 --> 51:02.120
the media.

51:02.120 --> 51:06.360
Well, you know, all those Linux guys buying the M1s, that's the gateway drug right there,

51:06.360 --> 51:07.360
Chris.

51:07.360 --> 51:08.360
I have a confession to make.

51:08.360 --> 51:09.360
Yes.

51:09.360 --> 51:16.040
Oh my God, this would be the best show ever.

51:16.040 --> 51:17.160
You bought an M1.

51:17.160 --> 51:19.000
I ordered an M1 last night.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Which one?

51:20.000 --> 51:21.920
I got the Mac Mini fully decked.

51:21.920 --> 51:22.920
Fully decked.

51:22.920 --> 51:23.920
Yes.

51:23.920 --> 51:32.280
Because I've gotten words from the developers of, I'm trying to say it right, Asahi Linux.

51:32.280 --> 51:35.240
They've put the word out that they are very, very close, that they've got a functional

51:35.240 --> 51:36.960
usable desktop right now.

51:36.960 --> 51:38.240
I saw that too.

51:38.240 --> 51:39.240
Yeah.

51:39.240 --> 51:40.800
And they're working on an image and an installer.

51:40.800 --> 51:43.080
It'll probably be out soon.

51:43.080 --> 51:44.080
So I did it.

51:44.080 --> 51:45.080
I did it.

51:45.080 --> 51:49.660
I'm going to, I want to get it in time to try it out when they release it.

51:49.660 --> 51:52.160
So because there's a bit of a delay right now, it's like the end of the month is when

51:52.160 --> 51:53.160
it's going to ship.

51:53.160 --> 51:58.440
If I got it all stock with the crappy amount of storage that they include and the crappy

51:58.440 --> 51:59.440
amount of RAM.

51:59.440 --> 52:00.440
Yeah.

52:00.440 --> 52:03.240
Apple doesn't believe in Photoshop files or audio files or video.

52:03.240 --> 52:04.240
No.

52:04.240 --> 52:05.240
No.

52:05.240 --> 52:06.240
I know.

52:06.240 --> 52:07.240
Right?

52:07.240 --> 52:08.240
And it's like the way it's going to work right now is you have to dual boot.

52:08.240 --> 52:09.320
There isn't like get rid of macOS.

52:09.320 --> 52:12.160
And you'd want to keep macOS for firmware updates and whatnot.

52:12.160 --> 52:16.960
So you need enough disk space to have enough room for both operating systems to live happily.

52:16.960 --> 52:17.960
So you got to upgrade it.

52:17.960 --> 52:18.960
You know?

52:18.960 --> 52:19.960
So I have a confession.

52:19.960 --> 52:20.960
Oh.

52:20.960 --> 52:27.600
I have a problem that I don't know how to solve without selling and replacing my air.

52:27.600 --> 52:30.280
Oh, I have run out of storage.

52:30.280 --> 52:31.280
Yeah.

52:31.280 --> 52:37.320
And when I say I've run out, I had to update macOS there and I had to delete stuff to update

52:37.320 --> 52:38.320
macOS.

52:38.320 --> 52:40.200
Have you tried cloud storage?

52:40.200 --> 52:41.200
Yeah.

52:41.200 --> 52:42.200
No.

52:42.200 --> 52:52.440
I really don't understand Apple's just like ridiculous markup on hard drives.

52:52.440 --> 52:54.240
It's so bad still.

52:54.240 --> 52:55.240
And memory.

52:55.240 --> 52:56.240
It's so bad.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.240
It's so, so bad.

52:57.240 --> 52:58.240
It's so bad.

52:58.240 --> 53:04.600
I mean, I bought the M1 because if it can run Linux effectively, and I think it will,

53:04.600 --> 53:08.840
I may transition it eventually to my home server in my RV, which is currently a couple

53:08.840 --> 53:10.120
of Raspberry Pis.

53:10.120 --> 53:11.120
Right.

53:11.120 --> 53:16.160
And you know, the Mac mini has a pretty good power draw even at full load.

53:16.160 --> 53:21.160
It's like 33 watts and it has pretty low noise and it has really good thermals.

53:21.160 --> 53:28.840
And I could easily pull my two or three Raspberry Pis and put one M1 Mac mini running arch

53:28.840 --> 53:31.160
and let it just, you know, be my powerhouse.

53:31.160 --> 53:33.560
So I think that might be the ultimate trajectory.

53:33.560 --> 53:38.800
So my bet on Asahi Linux is that I just can run it as a headless Linux box.

53:38.800 --> 53:41.680
I mean, I think they'll get the graphical environment accelerated, but even if they

53:41.680 --> 53:43.760
don't, it's still a win for me.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.120
So I decided to pull the trigger.

53:45.120 --> 53:50.960
I don't think the M1 as they are today could function as a desktop for me because absolutely,

53:50.960 --> 53:56.600
especially if I was using a Mac, I would, I would need a lot of virtualization capacity.

53:56.600 --> 54:01.720
So yeah, that we're talking a minimum 32 gigs of RAM, cause you know, I'm probably legitimately,

54:01.720 --> 54:06.320
I often have two or three different VMs going on depending on what I'm working on for, you

54:06.320 --> 54:07.520
know, a show or something like that.

54:07.520 --> 54:09.440
It can be a lot.

54:09.440 --> 54:13.400
So I got, yeah, that'd have to be a factor, but you know, it's coming soon.

54:13.400 --> 54:19.200
I suspect you could always, uh, could always gift this, the air to the kid or to the girlfriend

54:19.200 --> 54:22.600
and then get yourself an M1 X or something.

54:22.600 --> 54:25.960
Why would you ever encourage my podcast ads to buy?

54:25.960 --> 54:27.520
I know I'm the worst.

54:27.520 --> 54:28.520
I'm the worst.

54:28.520 --> 54:29.520
Oh boy.

54:29.520 --> 54:32.000
But yeah, um, I'm excited to try it out.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.320
Although if it comes in a different color or shape, I'll have to, I'll have to give

54:35.320 --> 54:38.280
it a go with macOS for a couple of days just to get a feel for it.

54:38.280 --> 54:43.160
But I suspect by the time I'm receiving it, the Linux project will be ready with their

54:43.160 --> 54:44.160
installers.

54:44.160 --> 54:48.720
I am going to tell you macOS, why did Apple break Safari on iOS?

54:48.720 --> 54:50.920
Oh, you having a hard time?

54:50.920 --> 54:56.320
Well, if I have a field such as the Google for work or whatever they call it now, G suite,

54:56.320 --> 55:02.820
whatever sign in page, and I don't want to be on that page, but somehow the password

55:02.820 --> 55:09.240
field got focus, the keyboard blocks my ability because they've put the URL bar in the bottom

55:09.240 --> 55:14.560
to actually get out of that without having to do a very unintuitive top of the screen,

55:14.560 --> 55:17.240
like slap swipe thing.

55:17.240 --> 55:19.380
There's way too much going on down there now.

55:19.380 --> 55:20.800
It's very non-intuitive.

55:20.800 --> 55:21.800
I don't understand.

55:21.800 --> 55:25.760
I feel like it's something I would do to people as a prank at like a cocktail party.

55:25.760 --> 55:27.640
It does seem like a prank.

55:27.640 --> 55:30.600
I turn on like colorblind mode on people's phones when they leave them unlocked.

55:30.600 --> 55:32.960
Like I honestly thought someone was screwing with me.

55:32.960 --> 55:34.080
I'm like, Reese, you're five.

55:34.080 --> 55:35.080
You're amazing.

55:35.080 --> 55:36.080
Did you just like break my phone?

55:36.080 --> 55:39.960
They put the window selection down there, the URL, URL bar selection down there.

55:39.960 --> 55:43.000
If you're on the iPad with a keyboard, there's a little keyboard thing that's down there

55:43.000 --> 55:44.720
and the task switchers down there.

55:44.720 --> 55:47.040
Oh, they did it to the iPad too.

55:47.040 --> 55:48.520
I didn't update my iPad yet.

55:48.520 --> 55:49.520
Oh God.

55:49.520 --> 55:56.400
It's like, I tweeted a couple of weeks ago about Safari on Mac being just what the hell?

55:56.400 --> 55:59.240
Like a psychedelic nightmare of tabs changing colors.

55:59.240 --> 56:00.240
I think it's great.

56:00.240 --> 56:05.680
I'm just letting you know, you are, you are coming from the sublime world of KDE.

56:05.680 --> 56:06.680
Yeah.

56:06.680 --> 56:07.680
Yeah.

56:07.680 --> 56:08.680
It's true.

56:08.680 --> 56:09.680
You're going to, you're going to hate it.

56:09.680 --> 56:12.680
I tell you, I, I, I use Safari very sparingly, so it doesn't really, it doesn't hit me very

56:12.680 --> 56:13.680
hard.

56:13.680 --> 56:14.680
Like I had a dream.

56:14.680 --> 56:18.640
I'm like, maybe Apple should just buy elementary, like seriously, just huh.

56:18.640 --> 56:19.640
Like elementary.

56:19.640 --> 56:24.240
I know they don't love this comparison, but it's like a good version of Mac OS.

56:24.240 --> 56:25.240
Yeah.

56:25.240 --> 56:26.240
Back when it was good.

56:26.240 --> 56:27.240
Right.

56:27.240 --> 56:28.240
It's like, it's prettier snow leopard, right?

56:28.240 --> 56:29.240
They, I mean, they've done modern improvements.

56:29.240 --> 56:31.480
Of course, snow leopard's super old now, but.

56:31.480 --> 56:35.440
It's like back when Mac OS was designed to be a good interface and not trying to keep

56:35.440 --> 56:40.200
up with yearly trends of design themes that the design department comes up with.

56:40.200 --> 56:45.680
I don't think anybody, like, and I mean literally anybody was like, you know what would be great

56:45.680 --> 56:47.160
in my web browser?

56:47.160 --> 56:52.020
The inability to see that I have other tabs open unless I magically remember.

56:52.020 --> 56:57.160
And also why don't we change my screen's color to neon orange and then black and then blue

56:57.160 --> 57:01.840
and then red because the branding and the best is, so then I of course had to check

57:01.840 --> 57:02.840
the Alice site.

57:02.840 --> 57:04.840
Cause I'm like, is this obnoxiously blue?

57:04.840 --> 57:05.840
It is not.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.400
I don't know why it's not.

57:07.400 --> 57:09.480
I went to the Mad Botter site.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.280
Is it going to be like crazy purple?

57:11.280 --> 57:12.720
It is not.

57:12.720 --> 57:21.000
But somehow my GitLab instance is the most aggressive form of fire orange that I have

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
ever seen in my life.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Yeah.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
It's great.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
It's just great.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.600
I'm Safari and I claim Safari and I GitLab.

57:28.600 --> 57:30.600
Johnny I would never let this ship.

57:30.600 --> 57:32.560
He would be like, what are you doing?

57:32.560 --> 57:36.560
Make it Chrome and you put the Adobe program down.

57:36.560 --> 57:37.560
Sorry.

57:37.560 --> 57:38.560
I miss Johnny.

57:38.560 --> 57:41.860
I want to say thank you to our Coder QA team out there.

57:41.860 --> 57:47.080

57:47.080 --> 57:50.400
He's a busy guy and we just sort of slipped that in on him, but it'll be out in the feeds

57:50.400 --> 57:51.400
sooner than later.

57:51.400 --> 57:55.400

58:02.880 --> 58:05.280
Mr. Dominic, where do you want to send people this week?

58:05.280 --> 58:10.160
Go to Alice.dev and if you all could do me a favor, any little bit of help in this scary

58:10.160 --> 58:13.840
new world of social media helps or retweet, whatever, I appreciate it a lot.

58:13.840 --> 58:14.840
Yeah.

58:14.840 --> 58:16.420
Help celebrate by helping spread the word.

58:16.420 --> 58:20.600
Seems like we need it more than ever these days between getting blocked by social media

58:20.600 --> 58:23.920
and there being no events, definitely could use the help.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.720
