This is Coder Radio, episode 440 for November 15th, 2021.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.420
Hello old friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:19.420 --> 00:25.120
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.120 --> 00:30.200
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru with the Cloud Playground, Azure AWS

00:30.200 --> 00:34.600
and Google Cloud Sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

00:34.600 --> 00:38.600
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloudguru.com.

00:38.600 --> 00:43.860
My name is Chris and joining us hunkered down from his base of development and shenanigans,

00:43.860 --> 00:45.960
it is our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.520
Hello, Mike.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.520
What's up, Chris?

00:48.520 --> 00:49.520
Uh-oh.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.560
You sound a little under the weather.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.600
I have to tell you, I am not feeling well.

00:54.600 --> 00:59.840
So I've had the Rona before and I am fully vaccinated.

00:59.840 --> 01:05.140
So I'm hoping that means it's not the Rona, but I did a home test and it said no.

01:05.140 --> 01:06.960
You do have a kid and family.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.480
They're all vectors of all kinds of disease.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.480
Let me tell you.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.680
Well, especially the five-year-old.

01:12.680 --> 01:19.160
My immune system, honestly, if I could like just inject a purple heart into my bloodstream,

01:19.160 --> 01:22.400
I would because this kid comes home.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.480
Did you wash your hands, Reese?

01:24.480 --> 01:25.480
Yeah.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.480
Did you really?

01:26.480 --> 01:27.480
Oh, no.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.160
Well, go wash your hands.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.980
It's like you're asking them to pull nails to wash their damn hands.

01:31.980 --> 01:34.440
It's like you're asking them to code in Windows.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.440
I mean-

01:35.440 --> 01:38.040
My kid the other day, I won't say which one, so there's three of them, but I won't say

01:38.040 --> 01:39.040
which one.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.040
My kid the other day goes-

01:40.040 --> 01:41.040
I say I name names.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.680
I mean, you're just like, you're a better dad.

01:42.680 --> 01:48.080
The kid comes out of the bathroom and I say, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you didn't wash your

01:48.080 --> 01:49.080
hands.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.040
Dad, I washed my hands like an hour ago.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.040
I'm good.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.000
That's not how it works.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Damn kids.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.600
You know, maybe you could explain to me why my Twitter feed is blowing up today.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.880
Usually when this happens, somebody has bought a new laptop.

02:04.880 --> 02:09.880
So I have made many questionable decisions in my life.

02:09.880 --> 02:15.740
Most of them either involve gin, women, or frankly, I don't know why I can't get this

02:15.740 --> 02:16.740
kid to wash his hands.

02:16.740 --> 02:17.740
I'm sorry.

02:17.740 --> 02:18.740
This is my hobby horse.

02:18.740 --> 02:19.840
This is no longer code radio.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.040
This is goddammit wash your hands.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.040
Yeah.

02:23.040 --> 02:29.520
So my MacBook Air, my beloved, my sweetheart, my darling, your M1 MacBook Air, yes, is going

02:29.520 --> 02:39.500
to a staff member, the wicked Dave, my CTO, because his MacBook, not Air, but do you remember

02:39.500 --> 02:42.000
the dark days of the regular MacBook?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.160
Oh, the butterfly you're talking about?

02:44.160 --> 02:45.160
Yeah.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.160
She's having some problems.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.160
I bet.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.160
You bet.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.640
Can you guess what those problems are?

02:49.640 --> 02:50.800
The Z key or something.

02:50.800 --> 02:51.800
That's what I'm having.

02:51.800 --> 02:52.800
I just gave out on the.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.800
Yeah.

02:53.800 --> 02:59.240
So it's a Z key and it's a command key that are not working and that's causing just like

02:59.240 --> 03:01.040
all kinds of issues.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.160
So like I like Linux.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.160
I don't like the fighting.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.160
I'll be honest with you.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.160
I haven't been happy with the.

03:08.160 --> 03:11.520
You're more in the community to speak to this, but I don't like the nastiness, right?

03:11.520 --> 03:13.640
I think everybody should get along.

03:13.640 --> 03:14.640
It's off putting.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.640
Right.

03:15.640 --> 03:16.640
It's mean.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.960
It seems and it's weird because when you when people DM you and this has been my experience,

03:19.960 --> 03:21.440
I can't speak to yours.

03:21.440 --> 03:25.240
But when people DM you, they're like not like that right there.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.240
Oh, yeah.

03:26.240 --> 03:31.120
Well, if you know Mac OS works for you, it's cool dog or, you know, oh, yeah, if you like,

03:31.120 --> 03:36.200
you know, I mean, frankly, people who are true Linux users know I'm talking about the

03:36.200 --> 03:37.200
Pop OS stuff.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.200
Right.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.200
So.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.200
Yeah.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.200
There's been a spat between GNOME and Pop OS.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.560
And I feel like, you know what?

03:43.560 --> 03:44.560
It shouldn't happen.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.240
And I don't care who's wrong or right.

03:46.240 --> 03:47.240
I'm sure I know.

03:47.240 --> 03:52.520
I know it got covered elsewhere, but I I think that weakens everybody, honestly, unnecessary

03:52.520 --> 03:53.520
conflicts.

03:53.520 --> 03:58.920
And, you know, I am familiar with all of I'm familiar with the tweets that that supposedly

03:58.920 --> 04:03.360
upset the GNOME side and the decisions supposedly upset the Pop side.

04:03.360 --> 04:11.680
And my genuine takeaway from reading everything is that if this conversation had been in person,

04:11.680 --> 04:15.960
it would have been a total non-issue and be probably would it would have been wrapped

04:15.960 --> 04:17.700
up in an afternoon.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.680
And it's so funny because it's like you have to read into everything, though.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.680
That's exactly what I thought.

04:21.680 --> 04:25.680
If this had happened at a conference, this had happened at Linux Fest Northwest, right

04:25.680 --> 04:33.160
at the at the pub after the sessions, it would have been a minute and a half of maybe awkwardness

04:33.160 --> 04:34.720
and then it would just been resolved.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.720
Yeah.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.120
And there would have been no issue.

04:37.120 --> 04:42.280
And legitimately, I think a lot of the offense on the GNOME side came from reading into a

04:42.280 --> 04:48.440
tweet, perhaps imbuing it with some intention that the author maybe did not intend it to

04:48.440 --> 04:50.080
have.

04:50.080 --> 04:55.240
And it's the exact kind of thing that gets lost in low bandwidth text communication.

04:55.240 --> 04:59.580
I mean, I learned my lesson the hard way long, long time listeners will know.

04:59.580 --> 05:04.840
You don't touch anything that's going to start a fight on Twitter because you're always going

05:04.840 --> 05:08.360
to be constrained and they're always going to misunderstand you and think that you're

05:08.360 --> 05:09.360
being mean.

05:09.360 --> 05:13.800
I could see the individual who tweeted saying I didn't expect them to take it that way.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.000
It is one of those things that looking back at it, you kind of go, oh, I guess I see how

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
they took it that way.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.920
Either way, I thought the response was funny.

05:19.920 --> 05:24.040
I don't know if you've noticed, but System76 did respond to all of it by just simply making

05:24.040 --> 05:29.040
a blog post that just is a super long ass list of all of their upstream open source

05:29.040 --> 05:32.960
contributions and they really had no other comment than that.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.200
Obviously people who listen to the show a long time.

05:34.200 --> 05:39.320
I'm friendly with the System76 people, but this is all a waste of energy.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.120
It just is a waste of energy.

05:41.120 --> 05:46.240
And frankly, you know, people who can develop Linux desktops, not even applications, but

05:46.240 --> 05:50.840
actual like operating systems are some of the brightest people in the world and wasting

05:50.840 --> 05:54.160
their time on Twitter fights is you know what I saw?

05:54.160 --> 05:58.120
I saw a lot of just I just saw a lot of comments saying, you know, I'm just sick of this.

05:58.120 --> 06:02.040
I like I'm just I'm leaving Linux or I'm just going to ignore this stuff and just put my

06:02.040 --> 06:03.040
head down.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.400
And I think really it's just focus on the work.

06:04.400 --> 06:08.780
I think that was the message from System76 with that blog post is focus on the work.

06:08.780 --> 06:11.560
So it sounds like you're getting yourself a new work system.

06:11.560 --> 06:14.760
This is the part where Mike forgot what configuration he ordered.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.000
Oh, I got it up right here.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Oh, you do.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.120
Because Mike's been running a fever for a couple hours.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.800
And you blew my Twitter up with this.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.320
Of course, I've seen it go by.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.320
I love it actually.

06:24.320 --> 06:27.520
So yeah, you got to it's called it's pronounced Pangolin, right?

06:27.520 --> 06:28.520
Oh, is it?

06:28.520 --> 06:29.520
I thought it was Pangolin.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.960
I thought it was like a like British or whatever.

06:31.960 --> 06:32.960
Who cares?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.320
I have a hard time with with words.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.480
So I'm not the person to ask.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.400
You went with full disk encryption on the hard drive.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.400
You're doing Pop!

06:39.400 --> 06:40.400
OS 2104 pre-install.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.580
I thought that was interesting.

06:42.580 --> 06:44.040
But this is where it gets juicy.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.040
Wait, why was it?

06:45.040 --> 06:46.040
Why?

06:46.040 --> 06:47.040
Why was that interesting?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.840
I know you have different requirements, especially if you're traveling, but I still am very nervous

06:49.840 --> 06:53.640
about encrypting my home disk.

06:53.640 --> 06:58.120
I'm an old man who had clients who I couldn't recover their data because they lost their.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.120
I know.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.760
But so even my Mac does have to be encrypted.

07:00.760 --> 07:01.760
Right.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.760
I know for you.

07:02.760 --> 07:03.760
It's a different deal.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.760
So didn't you know what the deal was?

07:04.760 --> 07:05.760
I was looking.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.120
Is it OK to talk about other brands or are we going to get in trouble from potential

07:09.120 --> 07:10.120
sponsors?

07:10.120 --> 07:11.120
I don't know.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.120
You tell me.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.120
No, it's fine, of course.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.320
I know you've been to the Dell headquarters, but I was looking at the XPS.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.320
I call it Sputnik.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.320
They don't call it that anymore.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.320
They call it developer edition.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.960
So, OK, so there's a crazy story behind this.

07:21.960 --> 07:22.960
OK.

07:22.960 --> 07:23.960
Do you want to hear the crazy story?

07:23.960 --> 07:24.960
Of course.

07:24.960 --> 07:25.960
All right.

07:25.960 --> 07:32.400
Poor old Mike can't buy servers because reasons, right?

07:32.400 --> 07:33.400
OK.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.960
And those reasons of the chip shortage, but Mike is not going to talk politics here.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.200
I would direct you to unfilter show.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.520
Yeah, I will gripe.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.600
I will gripe about the supply shortage all you like on that show.

07:44.600 --> 07:50.240
And also, my whole team is remote now, but I still have my space in Plant City, which

07:50.240 --> 07:52.360
is effectively a server farm.

07:52.360 --> 07:58.500
Those servers, I regret to inform you, are mostly Thalios and iMac Pro right now at this

07:58.500 --> 08:06.680
point and very other expensive Apple computers running Linux or running Mac server because

08:06.680 --> 08:12.960
the prices on server equipment that I can get from my I mean, I have a Dell rep and

08:12.960 --> 08:15.800
I also called other companies and I'm not trying to pick on Dell.

08:15.800 --> 08:21.700
I like Dell, but are like drug dealer insane, right?

08:21.700 --> 08:24.340
They're crazy.

08:24.340 --> 08:27.480
So I commandeered all the desktops.

08:27.480 --> 08:31.400
Everybody who works remote got issued a laptop and I just said and I just literally in Slack

08:31.400 --> 08:35.680
I was like, you guys don't have desktops anymore to the company's property.

08:35.680 --> 08:36.680
They're now servers.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.440
They're servers now.

08:39.440 --> 08:47.800
And then I had a problem because my man, Dave, my CTO, his MacBook, why I bought him two

08:47.800 --> 08:52.440
butterfly keyboards in two and a half years is beyond me.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.440
They both failed for the same reason.

08:55.440 --> 08:59.600
And sure enough, son of a bear, it failed.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.380
He can't type.

09:01.380 --> 09:03.840
So he remapped the keys to get along.

09:03.840 --> 09:10.160
But you know, he prefers to work on Mac and our policy is you may work on a new system

09:10.160 --> 09:15.560
you want as long as you don't commit Windows line innings to get because that is a hanging

09:15.560 --> 09:17.280
offense.

09:17.280 --> 09:23.500
So I have to give up my M1 Mac Air and I bought a Pangolin from System76.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.560
With a Ryzen in it, which is interesting.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.560
It's pretty cool.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.560
They're all Ryzen.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.560
They're all Ryzen.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.120
So the Pangolin is a pure AMD system.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.720
And there is a method to my madness here.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.840
Granted my fever was 101 when I bought it.

09:36.840 --> 09:37.840
And talk to the sales guy.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.280
So Sam, you did an excellent job here.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.840
Why didn't you just get yourself another M1 MacBook Air?

09:42.840 --> 09:45.040
Why did you go with a Pangolin Linux box?

09:45.040 --> 09:46.600
Yes, this is the big thing, right?

09:46.600 --> 09:52.400
The Air config versus what I got in the Pangolin does not match up at all.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.440
Right, 64 gigs of RAM.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.440
That's pretty nice.

09:55.440 --> 09:58.000
Yeah, 64 gigs of RAM.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
It's a pretty beastly machine.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.360
We have a link in the show notes, I think, definitely in the chat room.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.840
And I want to give it a shot.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.080
So you don't know this yet.

10:06.080 --> 10:12.080
Confession, I did order also a monitor for it, a 1080p because I don't want to fight

10:12.080 --> 10:15.120
with Linux upscaling monitor.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.000
And I have a launch keyboard to go with it.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.840
I'm going to be pretty, I'm going to give it another go.

10:19.840 --> 10:20.840
The Linux stuff.

10:20.840 --> 10:26.560
I think the all AMD with an AMD GPU in there, if this doesn't work for you, I think it's

10:26.560 --> 10:30.720
fair to say you gave it a really good shot because it's a preloaded Linux box from a

10:30.720 --> 10:37.080
Linux first vendor and it's an entire AMD stack with lots of power.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.080
Hopefully it works for you.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.080
We'll see.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.080
Are you going to keep Pop OS on there?

10:40.080 --> 10:41.080
Yeah.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.080
Yeah, I am.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.080
All right.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.080
Will you let us know how it is?

10:44.080 --> 10:46.240
Also, just a shout out to some friends of ours.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.000
They don't sponsor, never have anything like that, no kickback.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.240
But if you're looking for a used server, unixsurplus.com, just going to put that out there.

10:55.240 --> 11:01.040
That's where I've bought some of my stuff in the past and I like it.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.640
Linode.com slash coder.

11:02.640 --> 11:07.080
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

11:07.080 --> 11:08.080
show.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.080
It really makes a difference.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.600
Linode.com slash coder.

11:11.600 --> 11:15.240
Linode is where we host everything that we've built for the last couple of years, but it's

11:15.240 --> 11:18.140
also where I host my personal stuff.

11:18.140 --> 11:21.600
It was a Linode weekend.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.880
It really was.

11:22.880 --> 11:29.240
On Friday, I got on my sync thing Linode, which is one of the $5 a month boxes, which

11:29.240 --> 11:34.380
does sync thing and some SSH jump post stuff for me and occasionally other random tasks.

11:34.380 --> 11:38.200
Sometimes I want to pull down the stuff I still have in Dropbox and I want to put it

11:38.200 --> 11:39.200
on a cloud box.

11:39.200 --> 11:42.480
I do like the Dropbox command line version on that box.

11:42.480 --> 11:46.540
I could tell it still had some horsepower to spare because you get a surprising amount

11:46.540 --> 11:49.360
of performance out of a $5 a month system.

11:49.360 --> 11:55.760
I pulled down a Starbound Docker compose file and it looked pretty good and fired up Starbound

11:55.760 --> 11:57.800
on my Linode.

11:57.800 --> 12:02.680
My kids and I have a persistent Starbound world, which is a fun, very, very adorable

12:02.680 --> 12:07.960
little game, although it lacks controller support on the PC, which is just atrocious.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.000
It runs great on Linode because it doesn't take a ton of resources for us to play on

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
there.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.120
The system already had... I don't need anything more.

12:15.120 --> 12:20.480
I think this Linode is going to become like my junk drawer server, you know what I mean,

12:20.480 --> 12:24.320
where I just have a bunch of different stuff on there that it just runs great.

12:24.320 --> 12:33.320
Then on Sunday, I set up a CentOS Stream 8 box because I decided to try out a Docker

12:33.320 --> 12:39.480
container of Windows 2000 that you can RDP into.

12:39.480 --> 12:45.040
How awesome would that be to have a Windows 2000 machine running in a Docker container

12:45.040 --> 12:47.520
up on Linode that I can RDP into?

12:47.520 --> 12:49.560
Just seems like the ultimate cloud workstation.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.960
What else could you possibly ever want?

12:51.960 --> 12:56.000
I thought, well, what a great opportunity to try out CentOS Stream 8 a little bit more.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.200
I did just that.

12:57.200 --> 13:02.560
I set it up and I got Docker installed on there and it's so quick and it's such a thrill

13:02.560 --> 13:07.880
when you've just done a fresh install on Linode and then you do a system update because the

13:07.880 --> 13:15.000
updates download from their local LAN because they've mirrored the repositories there.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
You just get essentially download speeds that are so fast that the only limitation is how

13:20.000 --> 13:22.400
fast your SSH terminal can update the results.

13:22.400 --> 13:26.200
I mean, it's happening faster than the terminal can even update the results.

13:26.200 --> 13:30.920
They're just such screamers and Linode has recently been rolling out MVME upgraded storage,

13:30.920 --> 13:34.440
which is awesome and they have 11 data centers to choose from.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.840
So you're going to find something that's close to you that's just a few hops away either

13:37.840 --> 13:40.680
from you or your clients, depending on what you're doing.

13:40.680 --> 13:43.980
You know, I can sit here and tell you all day long about the various ways we use Linode

13:43.980 --> 13:44.980
also for JB.

13:44.980 --> 13:48.120
It's critical to our infrastructure now, but I think that a hundred dollars will speak

13:48.120 --> 13:49.120
for itself.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.120
So go there and try it out.

13:50.120 --> 13:54.320
So go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 and you support the show.

13:54.320 --> 14:00.100
It's linode.com slash coder, get 60 day credit on a new account and support the show, linode.com

14:00.100 --> 14:03.840
slash coder.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.400
So old grumpy developer, he's got some questions for us.

14:07.400 --> 14:10.080
He worries he's becoming the resident old man in his groups.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.680
He says, Hey guys, longtime listener here and I've always appreciated your non BS response

14:13.680 --> 14:15.400
to things happening in the tech world.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.360
So I'd love your opinion on something that's showing up all over my tech channels these

14:18.360 --> 14:19.800
days.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
Web three.

14:20.800 --> 14:26.120
Now I'm all for better payments on the web and depending on the application, decentralization

14:26.120 --> 14:27.520
can be great.

14:27.520 --> 14:32.440
However, it seems that their answer is just throw everything, including code data, everything

14:32.440 --> 14:34.280
into the blockchain.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.280
Really?

14:35.280 --> 14:38.040
This sounds like a proof of concept, but it's been months.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.040
Actually it's been years.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.740
It's been months of talking about how it's going to kill the web as we know it.

14:41.740 --> 14:45.960
And yet when you ask people for some solid examples, the answer is just do some, do your

14:45.960 --> 14:46.960
research.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.640
God, crypto.

14:48.640 --> 14:52.520
Have I just become the resident old man in these circles shaking my fist at these crazy

14:52.520 --> 14:53.520
kids?

14:53.520 --> 14:54.520
What's your take?

14:54.520 --> 14:59.080
Is web three an actual movement and a thing we should be paying attention to or just a

14:59.080 --> 15:04.100
niche thing for the crypto bros and shady businesses?

15:04.100 --> 15:10.960
And I should mention today as we are recording Coinbase, one of the largest online exchanges

15:10.960 --> 15:19.040
for crypto, its co-founder and an ex Sequoia partner announced paradigm one, which is a

15:19.040 --> 15:28.000
$2.5 billion fund that's going to, I guess, essentially VC web three companies.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.440
And it's $2.5 billion that they're a fund that they're launching today.

15:32.440 --> 15:41.320
Also the web three foundation has a series of grants they've given out to nearly 300

15:41.320 --> 15:42.320
projects.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.640
I have information about that in the show notes, including how you could apply for one

15:45.640 --> 15:47.260
of these grants.

15:47.260 --> 15:51.200
Web three, have you been sucked into any of this hype cycle about web three at all?

15:51.200 --> 15:55.760
I have been very Clint Eastwood skeptical.

15:55.760 --> 16:01.080
So there's a problem in the industry right now where mobile has been dominated by a duopoly

16:01.080 --> 16:03.440
of Apple and Google agreed.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.800
And if your Facebook, Microsoft or frankly anybody else who wants to make money and not

16:07.800 --> 16:14.600
give 30% to Apple and Google, you need to manufacture another paradigm.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.840
When I hear web three, I hear Metta.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.640
It's the same bull only Metta is corporate owned by a few giants.

16:20.640 --> 16:25.040
And I think a lot of the people behind web three envision a blockchain powered, decentralized

16:25.040 --> 16:26.600
future utopia.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.680
And this gets a little nasty because I know you personally know one of those people or

16:30.680 --> 16:35.780
at least someone I'm connected to on LinkedIn who is really, really enthusiastic about it.

16:35.780 --> 16:40.200
But it's weird because he made all his money on a very simple, you know, when you come

16:40.200 --> 16:43.640
down to it, SaaS service for a niche.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.560
I don't think that web three is a thing.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.400
I think it's a marketing term.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.400
That's nice.

16:49.400 --> 16:53.020
I can't say it all ends in tears because it doesn't.

16:53.020 --> 16:56.760
But it's just like a harder way to do simple things in my opinion.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.320
I think it's got a few things going for it.

16:59.320 --> 17:03.240
But like all of these things that are this huge thing, I think one or two things will

17:03.240 --> 17:09.440
shake out as technologies that people adopt and the other two hundred and ninety seven

17:09.440 --> 17:11.400
will all disappear and go nowhere.

17:11.400 --> 17:15.740
One I will say, like the gentleman I'm thinking of, I believe this gentleman has a lot of

17:15.740 --> 17:19.680
power to raise VC money and he will be successful because he has money.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.680
Right.

17:20.680 --> 17:21.680
True.

17:21.680 --> 17:25.560
A lot of the stuff I've seen with three is just like tacking on a crypto and the blockchain

17:25.560 --> 17:29.000
that already exists and saying it's web three.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.960
I don't even believe in Web 2.0.

17:31.960 --> 17:35.840
I'm just like, dude, the Dom existed for a long time.

17:35.840 --> 17:40.480
The only reason the Dom isn't 100 percent dominant and I could make a good argument

17:40.480 --> 17:46.280
that it is, is because Apple's a little bitch about JavaScript engines on iOS.

17:46.280 --> 17:54.440
The problem is that there's one very big platform, very big vendor that has a stake in having

17:54.440 --> 18:00.120
the subscription model app development economy continue to work.

18:00.120 --> 18:07.160
Today, Roblox announced they're they're spending a huge amount of money on online education

18:07.160 --> 18:09.240
in what they are also calling the metaverse.

18:09.240 --> 18:13.200
Don't you think it's interesting you have Web 3.0 and the metaverse happening around

18:13.200 --> 18:15.000
the same time and they're not the same thing.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.720
They're the same bloody thing.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.740
They're not one in one key way, in one key way.

18:19.740 --> 18:24.800
One is like this utopian crypto backed like we made a bunch of money and now we want to

18:24.800 --> 18:25.800
become utopian.

18:25.800 --> 18:26.800
Yeah.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.800
These people think that.

18:27.800 --> 18:28.800
No, they don't.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.800
That's the.

18:29.800 --> 18:30.800
Yeah, I know.

18:30.800 --> 18:31.800
But this is what they're.

18:31.800 --> 18:32.800
Let me tell you what they're selling.

18:32.800 --> 18:37.000
What they're selling is Web 3.0 is private by default because all your information is

18:37.000 --> 18:38.200
central in a blockchain.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.600
So not each company storing it.

18:40.600 --> 18:44.440
Therefore they're giving up all of the data they collect on you and you are allowing certain

18:44.440 --> 18:48.120
information via controls and then that information stored in the blockchain.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.200
That kind of stuff.

18:49.200 --> 18:54.120
I seem to remember somebody telling me that someone else was doing this for open source

18:54.120 --> 18:58.040
and Linux and then all of a sudden that person sold out.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.520
Oh, I'm not saying I don't buy it.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.240
I don't buy it.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.240
They're all shysters.

19:03.240 --> 19:07.400
It's all anybody who can get V.C. money is in for themselves.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.240
I mean, come on, dudes.

19:10.240 --> 19:13.000
Web 3.0 define what is our new technology?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
No, blockchains went around.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.880
It's I think you have two camps.

19:17.880 --> 19:21.860
You have people who are delusional and think that companies like Microsoft and Apple and

19:21.860 --> 19:27.320
Amazon would give up power and decentralize it to a bunch of, you know, to the blockchain.

19:27.320 --> 19:28.320
That's never going to happen.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.280
And then you have people that actually, you know, know it's never going to happen or just

19:31.280 --> 19:32.280
grifting.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.040
I think those are two camps in this group.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.920
OK, I think I have a special experience in this.

19:37.920 --> 19:45.660
Because I'm I'm old enough to have been right there at the beginning of the app store, right?

19:45.660 --> 19:47.640
It was a utopia.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.720
Or so we thought.

19:48.720 --> 19:53.960
But it turned out, thank you, Epic, for suing Apple, that it was all from the beginning.

19:53.960 --> 19:58.320
They were using the app to make bigger deals with other companies and control the ecosystem.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.320
Web 3.0 is not.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.320
You know what 3.0 is?

20:00.320 --> 20:06.480
It's somebody who made their money, sold out, everybody over that wants to now cleanse their

20:06.480 --> 20:07.520
reputation.

20:07.520 --> 20:08.520
That's what Web 3.0 is.

20:08.520 --> 20:09.520
Yeah.

20:09.520 --> 20:13.280
And be responsible for building the next generation of some technology platform so they can make

20:13.280 --> 20:15.240
their make it into history books.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.000
It's not the next generation.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.480
You could do the same thing with regular rest.

20:19.480 --> 20:24.120
It's putting something on the block chain does not inherently make it more secure.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.120
It doesn't make it better.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.640
It, in fact, makes it slower and dumber.

20:27.640 --> 20:28.920
That's dumb.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.600
Here's the thing, though.

20:30.600 --> 20:36.200
Having a decentralized, trusted way for companies to share data and do payments, that idea is

20:36.200 --> 20:37.440
appealing to a lot of people.

20:37.440 --> 20:41.740
And that's why I think this Web 3.0 stuff has been picking up momentum since 2018.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.800
And it's just been getting the ball has just been bigger, the snowball has gotten bigger

20:44.800 --> 20:45.800
and bigger.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.480
And I think they're touching on key issues that people are concerned about, like control

20:48.480 --> 20:49.480
of privacy.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.640
Oh, I know.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.880
But people care about that.

20:51.880 --> 20:52.880
And so they're playing to that.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.880
Fry me some bacon.

20:53.880 --> 20:54.880
Give me my bacon.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.440
Here you go.

20:56.440 --> 21:01.240
I have some possum bacon from Tampa, maple possum bacon.

21:01.240 --> 21:06.080
It's they're trying to make their rehash ideas sound like new ideas.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.480
It's all.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.440
Don't listen to it.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.640
I was there for the whole mobile boom.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.360
I was there when the shysters would sell.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.560
They would try to sell Adobe Air to people.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.560
Oh, yeah.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.560
And saying it was like flat.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.920
I mean, it's these are people who've already made their money.

21:21.920 --> 21:22.920
Yeah.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.360
That have no business in this industry.

21:24.360 --> 21:28.080
And if we didn't have conflicts, I would go after a very specific person.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.160
So it's.

21:30.160 --> 21:34.800
If these people weren't rich from either, you know, selling Bitcoin or cashing out their

21:34.800 --> 21:39.640
V.C. businesses, this Web 3.0 thing wouldn't be going anywhere because the industry doesn't

21:39.640 --> 21:42.440
necessarily want this, but these people want it.

21:42.440 --> 21:45.960
And because they're rich, these people, you know, who else is a fraud?

21:45.960 --> 21:50.320
Gainer, Vaynerchuk, whatever his name is, Gary, these people, Gary, thank you.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.440
These people hustle.

21:51.440 --> 21:54.400
And this dude I'm thinking of in particular wants to be the next one.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.400
Yeah.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.400
Yes.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.400
We could talk about this offline because, you know, exactly what I'm talking about.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.400
Yeah.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.400
I do know who you're talking about.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.400
Yes, I do.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.400
It's it's the same.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.400
Yeah.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.400
You know what?

22:03.400 --> 22:05.580
We're just going to go through emails because it's nonsense.

22:05.580 --> 22:10.880
It's the same technology hasn't changed since the 80s.

22:10.880 --> 22:15.000
Well, and humans, let's be honest, that's at the core of the problem.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
It's humans.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.320
And once you understand human nature and human motivations, and especially once you've had

22:19.320 --> 22:22.680
a peek behind the curtain at these industries, you really kind of.

22:22.680 --> 22:23.680
Wow.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.320
You managed to get another Swift episode out of me.

22:25.320 --> 22:26.320
Thank you, Fever.

22:26.320 --> 22:31.880
Let's do just a couple more emails because we had a couple of spicy ones that are calling

22:31.880 --> 22:33.420
Apple out hardcore.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.960
And it's a different bend on the story than I think we've taken.

22:35.960 --> 22:40.840
So Trev writes in, I just wanted to add my two cents on what I think is Apple's hypocrisy.

22:40.840 --> 22:44.960
We're supposed to trust whoever they say we should trust.

22:44.960 --> 22:48.560
But then, heaven forbid, I'm allowed to use my own device the way I want.

22:48.560 --> 22:51.700
I'm referring, of course, to the new back door they've opened up for three letter agencies

22:51.700 --> 22:55.440
via iCloud bastions of privacy and security.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.440
My arse.

22:56.440 --> 23:01.620
So Trev says, at the end of the day, you can't trust Apple because the way they've engineered

23:01.620 --> 23:07.320
the iCloud backups when you use iCloud messages, it makes it possible for them to get access

23:07.320 --> 23:13.000
to things like your messages and, if you use iCloud backup, your backup of your phone from

23:13.000 --> 23:18.320
the cloud, essentially giving three letter agencies a back door into every iPhone.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.200
I just got an iMessage from Fort Meade.

23:20.200 --> 23:23.400
They want us to shut the f*** up right now.

23:23.400 --> 23:28.120
Daniel is a web dev from Hungary, and he feels like forcing Apple to enable sideloading would

23:28.120 --> 23:29.120
actually be a really bad thing.

23:29.120 --> 23:33.520
He says, I just cannot agree with the idea that giving the government the power to change

23:33.520 --> 23:39.200
some company's software to benefit a few people is ever going to be a good thing.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.600
Daniel, you are a beautiful man.

23:41.600 --> 23:45.520
I've never met you, nor have I seen you, but your spirit.

23:45.520 --> 23:52.960
He's from Hungary, but he sounds like maybe like a legacy American patriot who's like

23:52.960 --> 23:53.960
small government.

23:53.960 --> 23:57.320
Honestly, he sounds like he's from Utopia.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.880
He says, okay, but here's his argument.

23:58.880 --> 24:04.040
If it was okay to force Apple to allow sideloading, then isn't it just the same?

24:04.040 --> 24:07.800
Isn't the same logic that Apple should be forced to allow NSA backdoors directly into

24:07.800 --> 24:09.040
the phone?

24:09.040 --> 24:11.120
Isn't the NSA also working to benefit people?

24:11.120 --> 24:12.960
So have you ever heard of phone companies?

24:12.960 --> 24:14.440
Yeah, I have.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.440
Yeah.

24:15.440 --> 24:19.280
Just, Daniel, you are a beautiful soul.

24:19.280 --> 24:22.920
You're deeply confused, but you're a beautiful soul.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.000
They already do.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.160
Everything you've described is already happening.

24:26.160 --> 24:30.840
Welcome to the Thunderdome, and it's not just the US, by the way.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.720
They don't need to build a backdoor into the phone.

24:32.720 --> 24:33.720
What do you mean?

24:33.720 --> 24:34.720
It's already there.

24:34.720 --> 24:35.720
It's already there.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.720
Once it hits the server, you're done.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.160
I think that's just it.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.680
We forget that, but it matters.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.680
All right.

24:42.680 --> 24:45.880
So I want to say we're holding on to some productivity tips that have come in this week,

24:45.880 --> 24:47.840
and we're going to round up of them next week.

24:47.840 --> 24:51.600
We've gotten some good ones so far that are like good tips for speeding up people's development

24:51.600 --> 24:52.600
workflows.

24:52.600 --> 24:56.120
We've had a few ideas for tools that you could add, like the hook up to your machine, actually.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.240
But we'd like more so we can feature them next week.

24:58.240 --> 25:02.000
So whatever platform you use, whatever apps you like or tools that have changed your game,

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
let us know.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.260
Maybe it's something that just improved your workspace.

25:05.260 --> 25:09.840
Help a fellow coder out, coder.show slash contact, and then in 4.11, we'll round some

25:09.840 --> 25:11.400
of those up and cover them.

25:11.400 --> 25:15.600
We've gotten some good ones in, but I think maybe we're probably so far going to read

25:15.600 --> 25:19.360
three or four on there, so we could use a few more, so that way we could do a nice complete

25:19.360 --> 25:22.920
roundup.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.000
Shortcut.com slash coder.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.720
Have you really ever been happy with your project management tool?

25:27.720 --> 25:33.000
I mean, let's be honest, most are either too simple or they're so complex that you have

25:33.000 --> 25:38.920
to essentially have somebody in charge of just prodding everyone to use it all the time.

25:38.920 --> 25:43.320
Shortcut, formerly known as Clubhouse, is different because it's worse.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.280
No, of course it's not.

25:45.280 --> 25:46.760
No, it's way better.

25:46.760 --> 25:50.220
Shortcut is a project management tool that's built specifically for software teams.

25:50.220 --> 25:53.980
It's fast, it's intuitive, it's flexible, it's powerful, and it has a lot of other nice

25:53.980 --> 25:54.980
things going for it.

25:54.980 --> 25:58.520
Here's a few of the highlights that I think are great, especially if you have a team that

25:58.520 --> 25:59.900
has a team-based workflow.

25:59.900 --> 26:05.020
Individual teams can use Shortcut's default workflows or customize them.

26:05.020 --> 26:06.840
That's totally optional too.

26:06.840 --> 26:10.480
And they have organizational-wide goals and roadmaps.

26:10.480 --> 26:14.600
The work in these workflows is automatically tied into larger company goals.

26:14.600 --> 26:20.760
It takes just one click to go from a team roadmap to an individual update and vice versa.

26:20.760 --> 26:24.620
And the other thing you have to love is the type VCS integrations, whether you use GitHub

26:24.620 --> 26:29.120
or GitLab or Bitbucket, Shortcut ties directly to those so you can update your progress from

26:29.120 --> 26:30.120
the command line.

26:30.120 --> 26:34.200
Actually, speaking of using the keyboard, it has a very keyboard-friendly interface,

26:34.200 --> 26:35.200
and I love this.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.120
I think this is a great power user tool.

26:38.120 --> 26:42.380
They have what they call the PowerBar, probably appropriately named, allowing you to do virtually

26:42.380 --> 26:44.920
anything without having to touch your mouse.

26:44.920 --> 26:45.920
Just throw it away.

26:45.920 --> 26:46.920
Just use the keyboard.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.840
I think also iteration planning is fantastic.

26:48.840 --> 26:49.840
You can set weekly priorities.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.960
Oh, man, I could use that.

26:51.960 --> 26:55.600
And then let Shortcut run the schedule for you with, you know, a company burn down charts

26:55.600 --> 26:58.200
and other kind of reporting that just makes it great.

26:58.200 --> 27:03.200
So go give it a try today at shortcut.com slash coder, again, at shortcut.com slash

27:03.200 --> 27:04.200
coder.

27:04.200 --> 27:08.680
That's where you go to sign up and support the show, shortcut.com slash coder, again,

27:08.680 --> 27:10.480
formerly known as Clubhouse.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.480
Let's be honest.

27:11.480 --> 27:19.000
You shouldn't have to project manage your project management, shortcut.com slash coder.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.720
The developers are really upset this week because it seems like Apple is buying Google

27:23.720 --> 27:30.560
ads out from underneath them to redirect users to subscribing via the App Store platform

27:30.560 --> 27:34.260
instead of the developer's website, where it would likely be cheaper and they would

27:34.260 --> 27:37.240
generate more revenue.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.640
Apple has just sneaky bought a few ads here and there.

27:39.640 --> 27:40.640
A few.

27:40.640 --> 27:44.040
To sort of capture search results and send them to the App Store.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.080
I don't care who you are.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.080
This just doesn't look good.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.440
Well, no, it's not great.

27:49.440 --> 27:50.440
And it shows you.

27:50.440 --> 27:52.600
I'm going to try to be calm here.

27:52.600 --> 27:59.720
I'm going to say that the reality of iOS is that the real business that Apple is in is

27:59.720 --> 28:05.280
the business of collecting in-app purchases or just I would say just monetize the iPhone

28:05.280 --> 28:06.280
in general.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.280
Right.

28:07.280 --> 28:09.840
But well, I would go a little further.

28:09.840 --> 28:15.280
Like your description was fair, but I think it was a little diplomatic.

28:15.280 --> 28:18.240
They are not saying this is Apple doing it.

28:18.240 --> 28:22.440
They're making it look like it's the actual app developer themselves putting up these

28:22.440 --> 28:23.440
ads.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.440
Wow.

28:24.440 --> 28:25.440
Really?

28:25.440 --> 28:26.440
Yeah.

28:26.440 --> 28:30.960
Which they're using the app developers trademarks or logos, et cetera.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.800
And the app developers aren't happy.

28:32.800 --> 28:36.760
But because it's Apple and no one wants to get kicked off the store, I mean, you can

28:36.760 --> 28:38.320
read the article in Forbes.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.720
It's a chilling effect.

28:39.720 --> 28:43.000
Honestly, Apple is no longer a computer company.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.920
They're a middleman company.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.220
That's what they are.

28:46.220 --> 28:47.940
They're here to collect their tax.

28:47.940 --> 28:51.640
They're the IRS of businesses, of software businesses.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.840
They're here to collect their tax.

28:52.840 --> 28:53.960
And that's what they do.

28:53.960 --> 28:57.160
And it's a bigger business than the Macintosh business, by the way.

28:57.160 --> 29:02.360
So you're right, reading the details, they ran the ads for the app as if the developer

29:02.360 --> 29:03.360
had ran them.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.320
So it'd be like an ad for Overcast on Google ads.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.320
Yeah.

29:07.320 --> 29:08.320
Overcast is a small app.

29:08.320 --> 29:12.440
Let's take Tinder, which is a huge app, because everybody on an app was looking to get some

29:12.440 --> 29:14.400
app during the COVID, right?

29:14.400 --> 29:17.080
Ah, it's so scummy, right?

29:17.080 --> 29:18.520
They pretended to be Tinder.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.840
No, I am not a Tinder user anymore.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.520
I mean, that's how Chris and I met.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.520
But you know, it's fine.

29:24.520 --> 29:25.760
That's a joke.

29:25.760 --> 29:31.960
The other part of this is that by buying these ads, they are driving up the cost of legitimate

29:31.960 --> 29:36.960
ads from the actual app developer for the name of their own goddamn app.

29:36.960 --> 29:39.440
That seems really shady.

29:39.440 --> 29:44.680
Honestly, this is the reason, not the reason, but this is a reason I bought a Pangolin instead

29:44.680 --> 29:53.240
of a Mac today, because I don't believe that Apple is a software company or frankly a computer

29:53.240 --> 29:54.480
company anymore.

29:54.480 --> 30:00.040
They are a revenue maximization company and frankly, a middleman company.

30:00.040 --> 30:03.040
It really is a shady thing to do because I hadn't thought about.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.040
It's super shady.

30:04.040 --> 30:05.040
There's no excuse for this.

30:05.040 --> 30:08.280
I hadn't thought about raising the price for developers to advertise their own app.

30:08.280 --> 30:11.560
That really is just the worst.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.760
Wow.

30:12.760 --> 30:18.720
And you know, they made those first party app tracking changes and guess what?

30:18.720 --> 30:20.480
Now Apple's ad sales are way up.

30:20.480 --> 30:27.720
In fact, AppsFlyer, which is an app marketing survey business, says that really now developers

30:27.720 --> 30:32.760
are kind of forced to use Apple's ads if they want to take advantage of any first party

30:32.760 --> 30:33.760
information.

30:33.760 --> 30:38.800
So it's no surprise that now the number one player in this area is becoming Apple.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.160
They've also taken a good chunk out of some of the social networks.

30:41.160 --> 30:44.520
Facebook claimed that they were taking a bit of a hit.

30:44.520 --> 30:49.640
It seems like it was clearly a motivated move that, geez, it just had the side benefit.

30:49.640 --> 30:53.440
I mean, you could argue it's for users, but yeah, we said it at the time.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.080
This is going to increase their ad sales.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.240
What are you talking about?

30:56.240 --> 30:58.560
This is going to increase their in-app purchase revenue.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.280
There is no excuse for this.

31:00.280 --> 31:04.440
They decided to do a solid to the biggest grossing apps in their store that we're also

31:04.440 --> 31:06.420
offering outside of app purchases.

31:06.420 --> 31:07.420
Give me a break.

31:07.420 --> 31:08.420
I know.

31:08.420 --> 31:09.660
This challenges credulity.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.880
This is why the Mac is honestly so neglected.

31:12.880 --> 31:17.600
Yes, the hardware is great, blah, blah, blah, but the software is kind of, it doesn't meet

31:17.600 --> 31:18.600
the hardware for sure.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.720
Yeah, I was thinking like things are good now, right?

31:21.720 --> 31:23.400
With things are getting better.

31:23.400 --> 31:28.700
Monorays, a pretty good release, as long as you don't change your mouse cursor size.

31:28.700 --> 31:33.760
And the M1 hardware and the M1 Max and Pro updates seem really solid.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.760
So do the new MacBooks.

31:34.760 --> 31:38.720
They've come back on a few decisions they've made that were awful, and now the MacBooks

31:38.720 --> 31:40.560
seem really competitive.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.920
But how long will it last?

31:42.920 --> 31:50.040
Because this is ultimately, let's say the Mac were to enjoy just a renaissance like

31:50.040 --> 31:51.040
nobody ever saw.

31:51.040 --> 31:57.080
And this is hypothetical, but let's just say it shoots up to 30% of the PC market, right?

31:57.080 --> 31:58.680
Well what's Apple going to do?

31:58.680 --> 32:01.680
They're going to do exactly what they're doing to iPhone users right now.

32:01.680 --> 32:05.520
They're going to try to start monetizing the Mac user in every single way.

32:05.520 --> 32:10.200
Because once they reach market saturation of potential customers for their devices,

32:10.200 --> 32:14.320
because they are very expensive, and because they have a very unique ecosystem, not everyone's

32:14.320 --> 32:15.320
going to buy it.

32:15.320 --> 32:19.080
So they reach market saturation, and the only direction they have to go then is to monetize

32:19.080 --> 32:20.920
all those billions of users.

32:20.920 --> 32:24.800
And this is why I'm going back to Linux.

32:24.800 --> 32:25.800
It's the long-term bet.

32:25.800 --> 32:30.240
You're going to have a good time for a short term, is my bet, with the Apple platform.

32:30.240 --> 32:35.760
It's got probably years of interesting growth ahead of it, but it won't last forever.

32:35.760 --> 32:39.800
And if you look at the long time scale, you know Apple's a 30-year plus company, it took

32:39.800 --> 32:43.840
them about 20 years, and then they took their eye off the Mac for a bit.

32:43.840 --> 32:46.520
And now they're just after 10 years getting back to it.

32:46.520 --> 32:51.660
Yeah, but see, I think they really are a services company now.

32:51.660 --> 32:55.040
They're looking for that sweet, sweet recurring revenue.

32:55.040 --> 33:00.300
And you know this because the background of our conversation has been the chip shortage.

33:00.300 --> 33:04.400
Apple is the richest company in the world, or maybe they dropped, I don't know, but they're

33:04.400 --> 33:06.360
one of the top three.

33:06.360 --> 33:10.780
They could just like, with magic, open factories, right?

33:10.780 --> 33:13.640
Because I don't care what you say, if you're willing to throw obscene amounts of money

33:13.640 --> 33:16.160
at a problem, those problems get solved.

33:16.160 --> 33:20.360
If you think about what this means long term, it's bad for Apple users long term.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.320
This is not a good thing to see Apple doing.

33:22.320 --> 33:27.760
And if you doubt the seriousness in which Apple sees this, just look at how serious

33:27.760 --> 33:33.720
they are investing in Apple TV, and how all in they are with Apple TV.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.240
There's only one reason, services.

33:36.240 --> 33:40.040
It's services, and that shows you like how far are they willing to go?

33:40.040 --> 33:42.960
They're willing to become a new HBO.

33:42.960 --> 33:47.240
They're willing to basically build HBO inside their company and produce content to drive

33:47.240 --> 33:48.240
up services.

33:48.240 --> 33:52.640
You don't have to deal with any of those nasty labor unions, or workers, or people who might

33:52.640 --> 33:55.320
get hurt on the job building your desktops, right?

33:55.320 --> 33:59.700
Seriously, like, yeah, I mean, I know I'm gonna put my foot in the fire here, but this

33:59.700 --> 34:03.800
is why I have a very sympathetic eye to System76.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.120
You know what, they're doing a lot of their work.

34:06.120 --> 34:10.820
I know they buy, you know, the laptops from overseas, and they just do whatever they do

34:10.820 --> 34:12.000
with them.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.620
But they build their Thaleos and some of their other equipment in the US, right, the launch

34:15.620 --> 34:17.800
keyboard in Denver.

34:17.800 --> 34:21.960
They do a fair amount of QA and firmware work, and there's quite a bit of back and forth

34:21.960 --> 34:25.840
with the vendor to just fix small compatibility, niggling issues.

34:25.840 --> 34:29.440
But you're right, they don't build the motherboards or the chassis or anything.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.320
But they're getting there, right?

34:31.320 --> 34:35.120
They've even said on their roadmap is to get there.

34:35.120 --> 34:39.660
Carl and I had a conversation about it when I was there in Denver, and he's pretty frank

34:39.660 --> 34:40.660
about it, really.

34:40.660 --> 34:46.120
Like, the launch is a step to figuring out how to build an electronic device like this,

34:46.120 --> 34:48.720
and it was the baby steps to launching a laptop.

34:48.720 --> 34:52.320
It's all in the end goal to sort of building a laptop.

34:52.320 --> 34:55.940
I think he'd be pretty pleased if they had something that was getting close to shipping

34:55.940 --> 34:56.940
in two years.

34:56.940 --> 34:58.640
So that's kind of the timeline we might be looking at.

34:58.640 --> 34:59.640
I actually think too.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.080
I mean, you might know more than I do.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.480
I feel two years is...

35:02.480 --> 35:03.960
Oh, I think it's optimistic.

35:03.960 --> 35:04.960
Yeah.

35:04.960 --> 35:09.360
Yeah, I, you know, but like they're making the effort.

35:09.360 --> 35:14.320
People can listen to old shows and me rant about Tim Cook when I don't have a fever,

35:14.320 --> 35:20.480
or when I do, frankly, but I don't like what Apple has become.

35:20.480 --> 35:26.200
You know, they were a company started with two buddies out of a garage in California,

35:26.200 --> 35:33.380
and they've become this thing that knows neither, you know, state, country, friend.

35:33.380 --> 35:38.440
It's all about extracting revenue from other people's labor, and that seems...

35:38.440 --> 35:40.200
Apple is a nation onto its own now, really.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.200
Right.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.200
They're their own country.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.200
In fact, they tax as they see fit, which...

35:45.200 --> 35:46.200
Right.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.680
That's exactly where I was going.

35:47.680 --> 35:48.680
Right.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.920
Here's my problem.

35:49.920 --> 35:53.400
They are such a relevant player that, A, they come up all the time because of how significant

35:53.400 --> 35:56.040
they are in the market, and B, they touch everything.

35:56.040 --> 36:00.320
It's like Google, the federal government, Amazon.

36:00.320 --> 36:04.800
It's almost impossible to not interface with them in some way.

36:04.800 --> 36:08.080
Apple maybe is the one you could get away from the most out of the tech giants, I'd

36:08.080 --> 36:09.080
argue.

36:09.080 --> 36:10.400
I'm not saying I wouldn't interface with them.

36:10.400 --> 36:17.120
I mean, I'm just saying, do we need to develop for their platforms?

36:17.120 --> 36:21.880
I guess I'm feeling a little like we've already reached a dystopia we just don't realize.

36:21.880 --> 36:22.880
It's dystopia.

36:22.880 --> 36:27.840
It's just a boring dystopia because we have this situation where governments and companies

36:27.840 --> 36:33.120
and all of this are just unavoidable, and if you have moral objections to how they operate,

36:33.120 --> 36:34.800
you have no choice.

36:34.800 --> 36:38.920
They are such a significant player now that they will still have some influence in your

36:38.920 --> 36:39.920
life.

36:39.920 --> 36:40.920
It's a little sad.

36:40.920 --> 36:44.160
Sure, but the world has always been hell until somebody said no.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.800
The last time somebody said no was Winston Churchill and the people of England, and they

36:47.800 --> 36:50.560
said no, and they saved the world.

36:50.560 --> 36:54.760
Why can't us as engineers and software developers just say no?

36:54.760 --> 36:56.200
I think that's where we should end it.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.200
Go ahead.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.200
Let me tell you about Web3.

36:58.200 --> 36:59.200
No.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.200
Okay.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.200
I'm just kidding.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.200
You're right.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.200
We should wrap it up there.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.200
We have more for next week, but we'll let you go.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.960
You got to get rested up and get healthy.

37:05.960 --> 37:09.120
Our friends over at Web3 will solve all of the problems for us in the meantime, so I

37:09.120 --> 37:12.080
think when we come back, it'll all be solved.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.880
I have many, many doubts.

37:13.880 --> 37:14.880
Yeah.

37:14.880 --> 37:15.880
Yeah.

37:15.880 --> 37:17.280
And of course, you can find Mike on Twitter.

37:17.280 --> 37:18.280
He's at Dumanuco.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.800
His company's at the Mad Botter Inc.

37:19.800 --> 37:22.760
And go check out Alice, his latest project, Alice.dev.

37:22.760 --> 37:26.780
I'm at Chris LAS, the whole network, because there's a whole network of shows like Linux

37:26.780 --> 37:32.160
Action News and Linux Unplugged, at Jupiter Signal, and of course, at Coder Radio Show

37:32.160 --> 37:35.840
