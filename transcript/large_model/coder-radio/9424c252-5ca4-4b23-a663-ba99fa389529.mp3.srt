00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
This is Kota Radio, episode 334, recorded on November 26th, Crazy 218.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,120
Hey y'all, it's Chris and I'm fixing to do a Kota Radio from a Texas location in the future

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,320
for all you out there that are concerned about programming and maybe want to take a pragmatic

4
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,200
look at that and the art and the business of it even and maybe it's related technologies. My name

5
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,480
is Chris and pre-recorded in the future from the beautiful Pacific Northwest and I'm joined this

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,680
week by my established host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike. Hello, Chris and this is Mike from the

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,960
future. No. Who's probably using his powers of darkness to make Swift run on every platform.

8
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,280
You know, when you and I talk to each other from the future, I get excited because there's so many

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,120
potentially amazing things that could yet to be happened. Those are my least favorite episodes

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,720
of Star Trek. Really? Really? Because nothing like the crazy comb badges and the beard.

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,880
Unless we have different facial hair. Right. My dream has been to have not a goatee, but like

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,200
an evil goatee. You know what I'm talking about? Oh, okay. Okay. See, in this episode, I thought

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,880
you had a mustache and I had the soul patch. Is that not this episode? Well, you are very

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,080
soulful, gentlemen. Well, I suppose, Mr. Dominic, but either way, we are both in the middle of

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,600
travel and so we are pre-recording an episode and a soul patch or not. Actually, I got a question

16
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,200
for you. Do you bring a razor with you? I do. It turns out I can totally bring my razor with me.

17
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,440
Electric or old school? I'm old school. Okay. Why? Are you electric? Yeah. I stashed.

18
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,080
Absolutely. Truth. A hundred percent truth. I stashed an electric razor at Linux Academy

19
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,760
and I would do this anywhere I go frequently. I have one at the RV, I have one at the studio,

20
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,880
and I have one in Texas. I just go get the cheapest electric razor possible from the store

21
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,400
and I buy one and I save it in the location I'm traveling. Truth. I keep a go bag in my trunk.

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,800
Oh, that's why the Qt Corporation has had such a hard time tracking you down.

23
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,360
Yeah. So, long-time listeners, meaning within the last 30 days,

24
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,640
or depending on when in the future. You know what, Chris, this is the future.

25
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,440
No, no. This Qt saga has been going on for like a solid six months at this point.

26
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,600
Let's not. This has been the 30 years war. All right. I don't even know where to begin.

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,760
I was evaluating using Qt for a recently launched product.

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,600
And then you talked about it on a fairly well-listened podcast.

29
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,440
I didn't know it was fairly well-listened. You didn't know? Okay.

30
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,280
I haven't asked for numbers in months because the less I know, the less liable I am.

31
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,160
True, true. Fair enough. No. So, there was a misunderstanding between myself and a sales rep

32
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,840
from Qt. Basically, it was about what defines an embedded device. Now, since my product's

33
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,000
completely public, I'm happy to discuss Gryphon. We all know Gryphon. I mention it every week

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,400
because, yay. Gryphon runs on Microsoft Surface tablets and other tablets with Linux, right?

35
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,520
It is a radar display software made in partnership with a wonderful company in North Carolina

36
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,560
who does radar display systems. Or, I'm sorry, radar hardware systems. We do the displays at

37
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,480
TMB. Right. TMB is the mad botter. Google it. Buy something. Unless you're from Qt, then don't.

38
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,280
Don't. Apparently.

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:12,320
Well, I wrote the application in Qt that I had to throw out after a conversation with a Qt sales rep

40
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,720
who told me that I needed an embedded license. Now, the initial version of this application

41
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,240
ran on Microsoft Surface tablets on Windows. I don't know about you, but there's nothing

42
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,440
embedded about an i7. Yeah, fair enough. That's a desktop PC. That's a desktop.

43
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,400
After months of back and forth, I finally got from on high, from the good folks in Boston,

44
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,080
what the hell they mean by embedded. Is this a phone call? Is this an email thread? What are we

45
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,320
talking about? This is a number of phone calls. It got down to, when they say embedded,

46
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,640
they consider embedded if I sell them the actual hardware. What? What? Sell who the hardware?

47
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:06,400
There was a fundamental misunderstanding. I do not resell Surface tablets. No. Or the

48
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,440
generic Linux tablet in my business. I am not a hardware vendor. I am a pure software vendor.

49
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,120
I would assume, ideally, it's the customer that's buying tablets and then deploying the software

50
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,160
on those tablets. To my specifications, yes. The original sales rep misunderstood that

51
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,360
and thought I was building these tablets and selling them. Like as integrated devices.

52
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,000
Right. So if I were, well, it's not just integrated devices though. So in a world where I bought,

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,600
let's say, a hundred Microsoft Surface Pros and then sold them to some, you know, the Navy,

54
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:49,920
let's just make up, make something up. Right. Then they claim I need a cute embedded license.

55
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,760
That's or you can go LGPL, but then, you know, the sales reps don't like to talk about it.

56
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,320
Actually, neither do you. Let's be honest. Yeah. It's got, I'm a little afraid of the LGPL.

57
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,640
I'm like, no, let's talk about BSD or MIT or Apache. Come on guys. Let's play ball here.

58
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:13,360
We can all be friends. Yeah. So, but that's not what I was doing. Right. So this is,

59
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,720
you know what, this is almost like a programming error where you have one little piece of data

60
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,960
that was wrong. Right. That led to a big problem. So the irony is I could totally have done what I

61
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,880
was doing in Qt and been fine. I wasted, well, I didn't waste, but you know, the original

62
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:39,120
couple of weeks in Q whatever it was a good proof of concept and it, I don't even know what to say.

63
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,520
Like I, the funny part is I still don't agree with them on the definition of embedded, right? Like,

64
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,360
but, but even that aside, so folks, if you were concerned and I do feel kind of bad because I

65
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,920
should have probably gone higher up on, you know, as a technical resource, certainly if you're

66
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,520
writing software, as long as you are not, you're fine. As long as you're dynamically linking,

67
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,720
basically, I met an attorney, this is not legal advice. Well, I appreciate that. They wanted to

68
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,440
actually clear the record with you. Yeah. That was several hours of phone conversations. So,

69
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,560
you know, if you look at like some of the most successful magazines in the world,

70
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:24,800
they might have an annual distribution of say 180, 200,000 unique. I think I'm going to yell that by

71
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,600
daddy here. Hang on. I'm just letting you know, I'm just putting things in perspective. So, you

72
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,560
know, that would be a successful magazine. Like maybe the world's most successful magazine might

73
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,120
make it. Wait, you said 180. Yeah. See the reality is they like to pretend like it's millions,

74
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,440
but people that actually are receiving the magazine, it's a hundred and eighty thousand.

75
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,360
A month. This explains a lot of the hate email I get. So our numbers, our numbers are much, much,

76
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,800
much, much, much higher than that. So you got to think of our numbers around the 500,000 mark. You

77
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,200
see, I just, I was just, I just dropped my pen. I was just doing a little quick math, but yeah.

78
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:06,640
So we have, we think about us like, think about it as like the most successful technology magazine

79
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,960
in the market. That's our reach. It's the most successful magazine in the world.

80
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,680
In the market. That's our reach. It's not like the world's most successful website,

81
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,880
like maybe ours, Technica, like technically because they get millions, but it's seriously ours.

82
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,880
I don't know. I'm just giving you an example. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're right. But like,

83
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,200
but it's, it's, it's, so it's, it's somewhere between like the most successful tech website

84
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:38,240
and the most successful magazine. So basically I subscribed to Linux user and developer and I'm,

85
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,840
I should believe, and it's weird that we're doing this on the air, but I should believe that we have

86
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:49,360
more distribution than they do without doubt. So this is the part where everybody gets the

87
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,360
right comments. Mike doesn't know how many people listen to the show because we don't focus on that.

88
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,240
That's not, Mike doesn't know how many people listen to the show. That's not what that's,

89
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,960
well, that's not what our whole network's about. That's all I thought it was like,

90
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,120
maybe like 2000 a month. Yeah. No, I'm looking, I'm, oh really? No, I'm looking, I thought it

91
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,280
was super low. Yeah. I, I thought we went, okay. I am looking at the most conservative numbers

92
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,000
I have right now. I'm not even, I'm not even looking at like the optimistic numbers where

93
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,400
maybe somebody downloads it at home and then continues listening at work. It is the most

94
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,800
conservative numbers you download behind a gnat. We're counting it once kind of thing.

95
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,120
What if they go into like Stitcher? We're not even counting. I've heard not counting

96
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,960
this is not counting a YouTube Stitcher or any video downloads either. Yeah. This explains when

97
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,720
I go to things like, like DevFest Florida. And if I wear like a coder t-shirt or a DMV shirt.

98
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,480
And by the way, I should mention, I should mention this is just for 2018,

99
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,320
right? So the, the show has had six years of run. Wait a minute. Cheesy Bacon saying we're

100
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,800
bigger than PC world. That's not possible. PC world's millions. It's gotta be. Well,

101
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,040
I mean, this is just one show on Jupiter broadcasting. Oh, see, let's not, let's not

102
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,080
get drunk now. He's like, no, no, I, I actually haven't released these numbers yet, but, um,

103
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,800
LAN just surpassed 2.2 million downloads for 2018 and Linux unplugged just surpassed

104
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,720
1 million downloads for 2018. Well, let me tell you something. Our original deal still stands.

105
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,920
I will be using these facts to advertise to you.

106
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,920
Yeah. All right. Moving forward. Yeah. It's been a, 2018 has been a really good year.

107
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,720
You know, we focused. What if it's all hate mail? I mean, I get like several thousand hate

108
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,040
mail. Actually, I'll say this. I feel like we've had the best Twitter engagement that we've ever

109
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,200
had on the show. Like, you know, we had a really good one that I didn't put in the notes, um,

110
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,000
regarding me being elderly and angry. I feel like, but I feel like the people that are engaging with

111
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,400
us on Twitter, like it's just like, it feels like a real genuine connection I'm having with somebody

112
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,920
else in the field. Like I've, I've the last like two months on Twitter for this show have been

113
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,920
great. They've been the best they've ever been. Yeah. I tell you what I, you know, I, it's funny

114
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:05,120
because time dilation aside, I was unavailable for one week. Yeah. And, uh, and you and I have been

115
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,520
tasting, we have to stop. Have you read the book salvation by Peter Hamilton yet? No. All right.

116
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,320
It's a sci-fi novel about this fabulous technology called portals, which, you know, what portals are.

117
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,760
All right. Is this on audible? Hold on. You've already got me. But imagine all the time you and

118
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,360
I spent in airport security and lounges and like just waiting to get on planes and on planes.

119
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,600
If you have to go to Texas, I have to go to Texas. I have to go to New York or North Carolina or

120
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,880
wherever. You just walk on and you're there five steps, you know, in, in a funny way,

121
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,040
in a really backwards, funny way. This is why I prefer to drive because I know I prefer to drive

122
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,600
completely. It takes way, way longer, but I'm immediately applying time to accomplishment.

123
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,920
Do you know what I mean? Like, well, I just listen, I get to, I get to like not be groped

124
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,680
by the TSA. That's my whole thing. You got to get pre. What do I search for on audible?

125
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,880
What do I, what should I say? Salvation by Peter Hamilton. I'll just put a link in the

126
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,040
chat. No. Yeah. I'm getting this. So this is, this is happening. It's so good. I mean, it's,

127
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,920
I was so mad. I didn't know it came out this year. I was so pissed because I went to buy the second

128
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,080
for the second. It's a trilogy. Yeah. I mean, I'm flying out on Sunday. This is what I'm going to

129
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:21,760
listen to. So it's 19 hours. Holy crap. I don't know. I've been, you know what? I dropped my

130
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,520
Kindle on so many planes. I got woken up by so many people saying, Mr. Are you okay? Really?

131
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,120
Best thing to do is to answer. That's a simple question with a very complicated answer.

132
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,560
I love that. I'm going to steal that. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to put a link to that in

133
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,560
the fact. If we ever do t-shirts or coffee cups again, we should say code radio. That's a simple

134
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,360
question with a very complicated. That is good. We should do. We, I actually said a client,

135
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,440
although you're stealing my sales pitch here, but that's yeah, that's good. I've been thinking we

136
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,320
should like do like a refresh on our look to like represent like, I agree. Yeah. We got to like

137
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,480
represent, right? Like the show has very 2012. It's very iOS like seven. Right. So we need to

138
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,160
refresh the look, but I, uh, we, yeah, we should talk more about that. Um, so me and Q are good

139
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,240
now. I'm sorry. Oh, I love you. Are you, I'm really not sorry. Actually. It's kind of your

140
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,200
fault, but let's just let it go. Yeah. There's been a lot of confusion there. So if you had a

141
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,160
time machine though, would you still be, I got to ask, would, if you had a time machine, would you

142
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,440
still be using cute? If you could go back now knowing what, you know, right. That's a good

143
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,760
question. Um, let me think about my answer. That is a simple question with a very complicated answer.

144
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,280
That's so true, right? So set it right up there. All right, let's jump to Leo. So Leo writes in,

145
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,520
he went over to a quarter radio, Nope. Coder dot show slash contact. He might've gone to

146
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,920
coder radio dot red dot com. Anyways, fun fact. I own the quarter radio domain so I could just

147
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,360
redirect that. You should. Yeah. Yeah. Dakota dot show. Uh, he says, hello, I love the show,

148
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,920
even though I'm not much of a programmer, I'm 24 and I'm turning 25 next year.

149
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:09,440
And my question is simple. Oh, I know, right? And then what I love is that he's 25 asking this,

150
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,800
he says, is it too late for me to get into programming in order to get a job? I've

151
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,000
dabbled with learning C plus plus in Java before, uh, and in my free time,

152
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,560
but due to events in my life, never passed the learning phase to the development phase.

153
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,640
What do you think? Is it, is it too late at 25? That's a simple question with a one word answer.

154
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,560
No, it's not too early. It's super not too late. It's super, super duper, not too late. If you

155
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,040
were writing this email and you were 40 years old, I would say it's not too late. I would give you

156
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,480
the exact same answer, right? It's, you know what, figure out what you want to do, what kind of

157
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,320
development you want to do, what technology you're passionate about. Obviously listen to JB, so you

158
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,920
might be a bit of a hippie. You might, your beer may be several feet long, but whatever, right?

159
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:05,760
Like if he, if you, um, maybe I wouldn't recommend diving directly into C plus plus,

160
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,920
although you said John, cause it's more ways to get hurt there. But you know, the future is,

161
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,600
well, as last as Chris would tell you with the home pot, no, it's rest. Oh, savage. No,

162
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,840
but really that was, that was brutal. You caught me off guard with that one. Misa very upset with

163
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:30,800
you, Chris. I mean, I don't know. We figure out what you want to do. Java's fine. I, although I

164
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,520
would say if you want to learn Java, take a look at Kotlin cause that's, I mean, we have a

165
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,840
story in the doc for the show that we're going to ignore it like we traditionally do, but Kotlin's

166
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:46,320
gaining momentum and mind share at a rate that's shocking. Right. It's so if you really like the

167
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,360
Java ecosystem, I would, um, maybe some Android Devon Kotlin, Chris, what do you think? Yeah. You

168
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,400
know, I actually feel like we should take a moment and maybe we should just reduce expectations. Um,

169
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:05,200
I feel like we need to, we need to have some lowered expectations

170
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,880
because when you're outside the industry, there is this mystique about software developers,

171
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,120
like they have God mode privileges in life where they can spontaneously create life from

172
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,840
applications. It's not how it works. In fact, Leo, if you're asking these questions, you're probably

173
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,000
further ahead than most people that were in actually already in the software development

174
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,480
field. And I don't mean to be, can you pass fizzbuzz? I don't mean to be disrespectful to

175
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,960
people listening to the show, but many people in the software development field don't have any

176
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,320
idea what they're doing and they're just Googling it as they go along. And if you're going to talk

177
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:52,320
about me directly, that's what Linux unplugged was for. Yes, I heard it the other week. You know,

178
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,360
it's just one of those things though where like you have to learn as you go. And if you're asking

179
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,080
these questions and you have a passion for this field, then you may be more qualified than 75%

180
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,360
of the people that are already in the field. The fact that you're listening to podcasts in

181
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,360
a show called Coder Radio, hell, if you were just listening to that awful BSD Now show,

182
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,920
that would be fine too. So I think Leo is probably better off than most people. And then he's asking

183
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,600
if he's too young at 25. Chris, I will bet you a beer. Leo, you should email me again, email me

184
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,080
directly and copy crazy man over here on it. We will send you fizzbuzz online. If you pass it,

185
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,640
Chris owes me a beer. And if you fail it, I owe him a beer. Dude, I bet you by Linux Fest Northwest,

186
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,280
he has a job. Oh, that's way away. I bet you by Jan one, he has a job. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So

187
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,560
the next one comes in from a guy named Ryan. He says, please discuss how you evaluate open source

188
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:53,600
libraries, frameworks, or software for inclusion in your own projects, especially if those projects

189
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:01,120
are part of a production system. Thanks. And keep up the awesome work. So I think what Mike does is

190
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:08,640
he, he evaluates them from a position of fear. That is correct. I curl up into a defensive crouch.

191
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,960
And unless I see the following letters, I ignore them. MIT, PSD, or Apache. And it better be Apache

192
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,680
too. I think that we should all make those businesses fail. Now, why? I, this seems unreasonable.

193
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,560
Well, we just talked about my whole thing with Q right? Like, cause the LG, it's hard and confusing

194
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:37,040
and it could cost you a lot of headaches. If you get it wrong, it's negative in the freedom.

195
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,560
Now that's just the licensing side thing. Yeah. Let's assume that you're not as a,

196
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,760
let's say conservative with my patented high pitch, which it makes me sad now that I know

197
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,760
how many people heard that. I should grab that. Somebody needs to grab that and send it to me.

198
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,640
Conservative? Go grab that. I'll soundboard it. You know, I will not pull in a gem or I'm using

199
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,680
gem, obviously Ruby gems, but let's just use the word gem to mean package, or we could just use

200
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,920
package. That hasn't been updated in like a year from GitHub. Oh God, dude. Cause I'm not crazy.

201
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,120
Oh, I mean, I don't do anything. And we've talked about this before. I don't do anything below

202
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,520
version 1.0. Sure. As rule, that's an arbitrary rule, but it helps me weed out the, like, for

203
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,920
instance, I have a package called Kurt Kurt's JS named after Kurt's from the heart of darkness.

204
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:34,960
That's a JavaScript package. It's 0.02 or 0.01 or 0.0. No, sorry, 0.0.2. So I wouldn't even ship

205
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:44,080
that. Um, it's on GitHub if you're really curious, but yeah, that, I mean, I don't know. I do tend

206
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,160
to like look at the code. I mean, I don't do a deep analysis of it. Um, but again, I am pretty

207
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,320
conservative on this. I tend to use packages. For instance, if I'm on Cocoa pods, I don't go off the

208
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,240
beaten path. I use packages that are generally accepted by the iOS community. If I'm in rails,

209
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:11,600
again, I tend to try to use the bigger gems. Um, I have rolled my own gems for private use or for

210
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,720
private customers once or twice, but I don't think that's really what you're asking about because

211
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,960
that's kind of a different ball game. Yeah. I don't know, Chris. I feel like in a way, this is

212
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,440
like, how much risk do you take on your dependencies is really what, what the, uh, what, uh, Ryan is

213
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:34,880
asking here, man. And I, I take very little. I, yeah, I, I, uh, I would agree that that's the way

214
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:43,040
to go. I just had a conversation this morning about a, uh, a series of different exploits that

215
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:49,600
are in different, um, repositories for, for a lot of different open source projects. We're thinking

216
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,080
about doing like a, uh, uh, uh, an overall recap for tech snap on like, these are all open source

217
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,080
projects that you use that have software repositories built into them that have

218
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,560
vulnerabilities. And it's just, can I just stop real quick? Yeah. So how many times are you going

219
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,520
to mention open SSL? Is it like one for open a cell or is it, or is it, is it chronological?

220
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,080
How many, I mean like how many different versions and like all of it, it's just, it's really

221
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:21,440
staggering. It's, it's humbling when you look at it. And I, I don't know, I don't know exactly how

222
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,160
to tackle it because the argument is a little stale at this point. It's the same argument you

223
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,560
could apply to Docker hub, the same argument you could apply to Ruby, the same argument you could

224
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,600
apply to snaps or flat packs, everything, every, every development platform has some sort of

225
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,440
package manager, right? That's why I'm trying to not say jam, but coding in Ruby this morning.

226
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,800
Yeah. Yeah. I, I know, I know. And West put it in a really good way. He's like,

227
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,840
right now we're still in the ascent of all of these platforms where they are trying to solve

228
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,680
a problem. They're optimistic. They're enthusiastic. They're, they're really pushing forward and it's

229
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,920
the ascent, but there will be a reckoning. There will be a winter where all of this comes due. And

230
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,400
the sysadmin, I don't know, it's not even the sysadmin. I was going to say the sysadmin in me,

231
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,600
but really it's the, maybe it's the, maybe it's the, maybe it's the sysadmin, but I don't know.

232
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,160
Maybe it's the, maybe it's the pen tester. Maybe it was the security auditor, whatever it is. Like

233
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,880
there's a part of me that is getting extremely anxious by all of the software that is built

234
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,480
on what feels like, if you'll excuse the cliche, a house of cards.

235
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,920
Yeah, I feel the same way. I wish in fact, one of us disagreed, but.

236
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,440
Yeah, I know, right?

237
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,960
I, I have come to the point where you gotta remember I, I've been doing this on a limited

238
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,840
number of platforms for a long time, right? So for instance, when I didn't like what happened to ASI

239
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,600
HTTP, which was a great networking platform on iOS back in the day, and we're going back to like

240
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,440
2010 here, I wrote my own called MD networking. And I used that for several years until Alamo

241
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,760
fire came out or actually wasn't even called Alamo fire. Alamo fire is the new version. It

242
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,520
was called AF networking, but I, I really don't like to have a bunch of little dependencies,

243
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,080
right? I just, I don't trust it.

244
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,760
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And you get bit in the butt a few times and, you know, you develop that,

245
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,920
that persuasion. Ryan W writes into the show. He says, hey guys, great show. I started listening

246
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,680
a few months ago and loved the show. Finally, someone I can talk nerd with. He says, I just

247
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,880
wanted to provide some insight on the part of Coda radio about how Red Hat employees felt

248
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,680
let down as they didn't find out about the-

249
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,960
Somebody said Red Hat, take a shot.

250
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,120
I know, right? As they didn't find out about the announcement until well after the announcement

251
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:53,680
was made. Well, I worked at Intel and this happens all the time. Since IBM and Red Hat are public

252
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:00,000
companies on the stock market, they aren't allowed to say anything or warn their employees. You can

253
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,760
imagine insider trading and media leaks that would be possible if everyone was formed ahead of

254
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,880
time. Intel-

255
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,240
I did imagine I had my Robinhood app open ready to roll. Damn it.

256
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,120
Intel is the first public company I've worked at. So I've always felt a little let down when Intel

257
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:23,280
makes a big announcement like the hardware bugs found this year or our CEO getting fired out of

258
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:30,240
nowhere and product announcements that came what seemed like to me as an employee out of nowhere,

259
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,760
et cetera, et cetera. It goes on. I think that's just life in a public company. Unfortunately,

260
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,480
one thing that I think of, didn't Red Hat recently denounce ButterFS and then Facebook open source

261
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,400
all of their code, which includes ButterFS, which they clearly are using, which they think is a

262
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:57,360
great file system? I wonder if that was IBM's doing. And I bet both companies agreed they were

263
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,800
in talks at that point. Just a theory. I don't know. Well, I don't think any of that about

264
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,200
ButterFS is true. See our coverage of Project Stratus. Yeah, I don't buy that. I mean, I don't

265
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,840
want to get into the file system thing, but- You know, I'll just say from a recent acquisition

266
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,640
that I have some familiarity with that, yeah, you do go through the majority of the process without

267
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,800
informing the general staff. Now, in the case of the situation that I was familiar with, the general

268
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:34,160
staff had a solid 30 days, heads up, and nobody seemed to leak it. It did actually leak the morning

269
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,880
of the announcement, which was delayed by a week because I was in the hospital, not that I have

270
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:46,720
direct experience. So the company knew for a solid five weeks, like all staff knew. What kind of a

271
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,320
JB? Yeah, I am. Yeah, we all knew. Well, I had to let you guys know, of course. I didn't want to

272
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,120
surprise you and like- Well, I spent a month not making fun of Linux hippies. I thought I was

273
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:04,480
telegraphing that. I didn't want to get fired immediately like that, geez. So there are obviously

274
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,880
different ways of handling those kinds of announcements, and it changes as the company

275
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,240
scales. But I'm not, I don't know, man. I feel like the Red Hat thing was still a bit rushed,

276
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,920
like the staff is the number one asset of that company. And so if you piss them all off and they

277
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,560
leave, you've basically devalued the company. So you've got to handle that. Yeah, I mean,

278
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:39,440
you know, I have nothing nice to say about the Red Hat IBM thing. Not that this show has ever

279
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:47,120
been nice, but I feel like it's almost a waste. Now why? IBM is a bad company doing bad things.

280
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,760
Really? Really? Isn't this them? What about them seeing the light? No bullshit.

281
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,480
I will eat my hat if domestic and high wage country Red Hat employees don't get whacked.

282
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,560
What's your timeline here? I don't know what my timeline is. It all depends on the... See,

283
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,240
I am not a finance guy. It all depends on the financial machinations and contracts and things

284
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:19,600
like that. I just... I don't know. I knew some people who used to work for IBM. I've seen what

285
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,960
they can do when they decide... You know, IBM is effectively a consulting company.

286
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,520
And I have no disrespect for some of the great work they've done, Watson, things like that,

287
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,240
but they're bread and butter straight up consulting.

288
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,280
And sales, yeah. They're basically an offshoring shop,

289
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,360
which if you're a long time listener, you know I'm not a big fan, though I've learned to make

290
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:54,560
my peace. I will tell you... Can I take a side tangent here? Always. Always. Okay. So Disney...

291
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,400
I live in Florida now. Disney had a very large IT and development shop down here. It was there. It

292
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:08,320
was in-house. So it was Disney, whatever they called it, right? Cool. And they did what was

293
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,800
called in the papers as pulling an IBM. They fired all the Floridian workers and offshored everything

294
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:22,000
to India and the Far East. They framed it as pulling an IBM. The local news... Well,

295
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,760
you got to remember... I'm in the South, buddy. Yikes, though. That's... Yeah.

296
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:36,320
It's... And I have to say, that is not good for a tech community in any local area.

297
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,680
So I hope IBM is as good as their press release. That's all I'm going to say on it.

298
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,920
Wow. Wow. I don't know. I thought you'd be all on board, Mr. Business, Mr. Capitalist.

299
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,840
I thought you'd be all on board with this. I think you should rewind to 2014 and tell

300
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,120
me exactly how I feel about it. By the way, if you're a new listener, I urge you... What year

301
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,240
was Swift released? I urge you to listen to that WWC episode. We should do more live shows just

302
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,280
in case that happens. No, I don't think we should. In fact, I don't... I don't know, man. I agree

303
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,320
in one way, but the other way, it's like a cornerstone of these shows. We should...

304
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,920
I mean, you're Mr. Numbers today. I have to imagine that's one of our more popular episodes.

305
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,280
You know, I don't have numbers on that one. That is a good question.

306
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,880
I can tell you, I got a lot of interesting... And when I say interesting, I mean,

307
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
you know... Career ending.

308
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,200
Whenever you have an episode where someone can email you and say that you're a rapacious

309
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,960
capitalist who only cares about himself, and then another one can say that you're a communist hippie

310
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,760
who hates progress. You did a good episode right there. You hit a good mark. I think that we could

311
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:52,480
all make those businesses fail. That's a two RMS... Yeah, that's a double RMS.

312
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,000
So if you haven't heard it, say that I was a little surprised and upset by Swift.

313
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:07,600
Let's just go with that. Yeah. All right. Well, bringing us back to the end of 2018,

314
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,120
I have to ask you, what are you going to do? What are you going to do to make sure that 2019 isn't

315
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,720
yet another year where you struggle with hardware? Because I got to be honest, I think I'm pretty

316
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:27,440
much there, man. As of like three months ago, I think I landed on my ideal hardware setup.

317
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,520
I haven't been on this show bitching about my hardware setup. And the recent discussion I had

318
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,960
about the iPad Pro really only augments what I'm already doing. But you, on the other hand,

319
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,120
just burned through a couple of laptops and your prospects are looking bad. I just want to say for

320
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,400
the end of the year episode this year, I want to go through every machine I've destroyed this year.

321
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:52,560
Yeah. We should have some heart music underneath. Like the end of the Hunger Games where they fire

322
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,560
the cannons every time someone dies. Yeah. I currently do not have a laptop because of

323
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:06,720
time dilation, but when you hear this, I'm almost sure I will have a MacBook Pro. So I did acquire

324
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,800
a System76 Aurex when I got back to Florida. Thank you time dilation. And I have been reviewing it

325
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,800
and I do not like it. It is not a bad machine. It is not appropriate for my very heavy travel

326
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,520
schedule. All right. Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.

327
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,080
So what's the price range for this system?

328
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,040
According to the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

329
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,560
Oh really? You don't want to say because you're embarrassed how expensive it is.

330
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,320
It was, I was in MacBook Pro territory. Holy. It was. How much RAM? How much RAM?

331
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,480
32 gigs. Oh. All right. So I could just tell you, I tweeted it out. So it's not like it's a big deal.

332
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,680
Ah, geez. I got to go on my own Twitter. That's like, see, going on my own Twitter is like the

333
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,520
morning you wake up with a bottle of Hendrix next to you and you're like, oh no. And then all of a

334
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,240
sudden it's all Kara Swisher just right down the damn line. It really is. It's crazy. We're never

335
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,040
letting that die. You and her. We just can't. Although we agreed. Uh-uh. We got along. Yeah.

336
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:09,120
Recently it's been nice. I got to say. It's gotten pleasant. All right. So I have a problem here

337
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,880
because I don't use Twitter very much. Like looking at people's feeds other than replying.

338
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,280
I thought I posted a picture. Can I just link to that? Yes. Oh, here it is.

339
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,840
I conveniently didn't include the price. Hold on. Chris and Mike get old on Twitter real quick.

340
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:33,680
Let's see. Let me see. So it's a, yeah. How much is it? I just, I like how Coyote thinks Mike

341
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:39,840
802 was me. It is not me. No, no. I like that they're fighting though. He's fighting. He's

342
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,240
fighting like it is you. Oh, come on. Tell me the specs and let's see if I can guess it. And then

343
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,320
you tell me how close I get. All right. I'll just read it. Okay. Papa Wesley. That doesn't matter.

344
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:58,160
Right. Six a gigabyte GTX 10 60 with a 12 80 CUDA 15.6 mat 10 ADP. I did not go for the 4k

345
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,440
4.1 I seven blah, blah, blah. 12 friends. You went big on that. Oh, did I go big, Chris? Uh,

346
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:14,000
32 gigs. It was $30 off. I just want to say that, uh, 500 gig NVME $25 off, no additional M2 drive

347
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,400
and a 1.1 terabyte 2.5 SSD. Hmm. Huh. That's tricky. So you upped the CPU and you up the

348
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,800
storage and you compromised on the screen is what I'm hearing. Uh, actually on Linux, I,

349
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:34,320
I actually prefer the, uh, the map, uh, the 10 80 rather, but I mean, from like a price standpoint,

350
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,680
it's a compromise. Yeah. The 4ks sucks on the next, but we can keep going. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm

351
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:50,480
going to guess, um, so you said 512 MVNE 32 gigs of Ram 4.2 gigahertz. I seven 15.4 inch 10 ADP

352
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,880
display. How you didn't say, but remember prices, right? Rules here. Okay. I'm going to say,

353
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:08,800
I'm going to say $2,200. How did you just configure it? No, no. I just totally $2,232.9.

354
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:18,240
I brought up the receipt. Yeah. That's the sign. We buy too many computers, dude. I was like,

355
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,760
did he just like go into the thing and build it? Yeah. That's a bad sign. That's not a good. So

356
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,800
that's not something to be proud of. So I have no idea what's going on in the chat room,

357
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,520
but we're just going to ignore it. So I'm going to do a quick review of the Oryx pro people who

358
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,640
yell at me and read it every week for talking about hardware. Now that I know that you're a

359
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,160
vast minority of listeners, which Chris should never have told me, we're going to do this all

360
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:48,240
the time. Uh, it is a great machine. I actually like it a lot. Even it is not appropriate for me.

361
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:54,240
And let me tell you why I am not a hundred percent developer anymore. Oh, oh, here we go.

362
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,160
Right. I am half a sales guy because I have to travel as we know much of the chagrin of lady

363
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,920
Angela all the time, whether I'm driving somewhere else in Florida or flying to Texas or New Jersey

364
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,600
or Pennsylvania, wherever I'm going. Right. I need a machine that ha that is small enough that I can

365
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,120
fit in a briefcase and has battery life. That's long enough that if I get in a bind and I don't

366
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,800
have good access to a power outlet, I can function for at least like five or six hours. Yeah. And

367
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,400
that is unfortunately fairly common. Like you can even get unreliable power when you're traveling,

368
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,040
like that the whole rain, the plane may not have a plugin at all, or like you got to unplug at

369
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,960
certain points in time or you get a seat when you're waiting to board that doesn't have a plugin.

370
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,760
I mean, you know, last week we talked about, um, you know, my difficulties and travel with delays

371
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,480
and whatever. This was, this is the thing that pushed me over the edge. In addition to me frying

372
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,240
out my Gallego pro. So you, you, you kill a Gallego pro and your, your thought process is

373
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:06,000
I'll go order an Oryx. Have you ever noticed that I drink a lot? I'm half kidding. That would make

374
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:16,880
some sense. Yeah. So, okay. Longtime listeners know that I've had two perverse dreams pro level

375
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,760
tablets, which cost me $40,000 and laptops as desktops, but also with the battery life of

376
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,560
ultra books that has cost me. Actually, I think we're almost tied at this point. I think we're

377
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,280
getting there. The laptops are getting there. Yeah. I mean, I mean, to be fair, like, so when

378
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,000
you own a small business and you've got contractors and you've got employees, there's never really

379
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,680
like a wasted computer. I'm not trying to give you an excuse, but I'm just the irony. I am not

380
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,640
actually going to return the Oryx. It's just going to be given to a dev who works here. Yeah. Right.

381
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,200
Yeah. So it's like, it's not that it's, it's not, you can't say that it's money well spent,

382
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,360
but it's not a total loss either because now somebody else on your team has a new computer.

383
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,720
Right. So like, that's, I'm not saying that's how I justify it, but it's a factor. It is. And also

384
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:14,080
the tax write-off is a factor as well. Well, yeah. I mean, let's not go into that, but I mean,

385
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,680
you know, Chris, this has been a rough journey for me on this whole hardware stuff. It has. Yeah.

386
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,440
I really wanted it to be the case that I could buy one laptop

387
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,280
that would have the expansion capabilities and do everything I need.

388
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:35,360
And that's just not the case. Right. It's just wrong. Yeah. So I had to read.

389
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,280
You're crazy. You're wrong. And the answer is right in front of you and you just don't see it.

390
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,800
All right. Tell me what it is. No, no. I mean, I don't want to interrupt. I want to hear what

391
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,880
you did, but then I'm going to tell you how wrong it is. I can tell you what I did. I ordered the

392
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,960
Oryx because I was frustrated that my Gallego was dead. Sure. And, you know, I wanted a laptop.

393
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,120
I've been happy on Linux. The other the only other real alternative for me is a MacBook,

394
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:05,280
which tweet me tomorrow. I don't know. I mean, my Gallego was dead. I gave away my MacBook Pro

395
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,440
as people listen last week show now. So what option did I have? Are you going to tell me

396
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,280
about the USBC daisy chain dongle lifestyle? I am. Oh, get out of town. No, no, no. I am

397
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,320
going to tell you about it. I'm going to tell you about it. And you need to listen, son.

398
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,840
Now, I understand. OK. Yeah. It's not an intervention, though, right?

399
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,640
No, it is. It is. OK. OK. Let me hear it then. I mean, I appreciate that both you and I are

400
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,240
scheduled to attend a System 76 event in Denver, Colorado. And what I'm about to say, I don't I

401
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,720
don't think I don't think. Well, I'm not. Yeah. Yeah. No, you were going to. But now that I was

402
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,440
going to. But you can't weddings. And I don't think they appreciate any of it. No, no, no.

403
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:54,640
So here's the thing. You got to you just got to wrap your head around Thunderbolt three,

404
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,160
son. You just got it. You just got to embrace Thunderbolt three. So let me tell you something.

405
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,240
I got the iPad pro now, and that's where I have shunted all of my electron based application

406
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,760
workflows to the iPad where I have native applications and I have 24 hours of battery life.

407
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:17,200
Then on the old laptop, I have gone with a Lenovo ThinkPad T480 that has a Thunderbolt

408
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:24,320
three port and attached to that Thunderbolt three port. Brace yourself. I have an NVIDIA

409
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:32,480
GPU Lenovo doc. Oh, my God. You're going external GPU. I got an external GPU, baby, with two

410
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,720
monitors. Sick bastard. What are the specs on the GPU? Well, it's nothing. It's a GTX 1060,

411
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,040
I think. I mean, it's not it's not like it's not a blow your face off graphics.

412
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,240
But it means when I when I take the laptop and I unplug it from that Thunderbolt three cable,

413
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,520
I've got Intel everything and I've got like eight to nine hours of battery life in a Linux machine.

414
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:02,080
And it's a 1080p display. I give you that. But I've got Ethernet built in. I've got USB-A. I've

415
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:09,120
got USB-C. I've got Thunderbolt. And I have got one of the best keyboards I've ever had in a computer

416
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:16,560
ever. It is a great frickin keyboard. And whenever I come back to my office, I plug in. Bob's your

417
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,280
uncle. I've got a GPU. I've got two extra monitors. I've got a couple of USB devices. I've got some

418
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,640
big speakers and I'm good to go. And if I need to do something on the NVIDIA graphics, it's all

419
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,080
built in. The NVIDIA driver just detects it. I switch over from the Intel stuff to the NVIDIA

420
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:40,800
stuff. And Richard's my uncle. I'm off to work. And it it really is. I mean, it's just it's so

421
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,320
much it's so much simpler than what you're trying to get at. You are going at this from a 2002s

422
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:53,520
perspective. And in 2018, you get yourself a tablet that runs iOS, which iOS equals mainstream

423
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,200
applications. I travel like a maniac right now. That's one of the reasons we're even recording

424
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:06,160
right now is because as we record this, I'm in the air. And well, I mean, as it releases. So I

425
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,320
book all of these flights and I book where I park my car, the lot that I park my car at. I book the

426
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,760
rental when I get to Texas. I book the hotel. I book the flight. I book the lounge. I book

427
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:24,800
the food I want to eat on the flight. All of it is done with apps, not a Web page, not a program

428
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,760
with a Web, with a with an app that is probably a Web app inside an app, to be honest. But it is

429
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:38,240
an app. And I do all of that with my little toy computer that doesn't hook up to Thunderbolt,

430
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:44,160
that just does those things, it runs those proprietary service specific applications.

431
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,120
And then on my computer, where I can run anything I want, I have a Lenovo ThinkPad T480 that is

432
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,520
pretty powerful. It's got 32 gigs of RAM. It's got an i7 mobile processor in it.

433
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:02,240
It's got a terabyte NVME drive and a 1080p screen with, like I said, one of the best keyboards I've

434
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,960
ever used in a computer. And then if I need more than that, when I'm sitting down at my desk,

435
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,040
I hook it up over Thunderbolt 3. I go into a dock, multiple monitors, one of them is horizontal,

436
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,280
one of them is vertical, and I got an NVIDIA card built into the damn thing.

437
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,080
And I'm hooked up to Ethernet. And what you're trying to do, where you're trying to put all

438
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,240
the power in the laptop, it's never going to work, my friend. You've got to break it up.

439
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,480
But don't you have like, wait, wait, wait, wait.

440
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,360
It's never going to work.

441
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,000
No, I know it's not going to work. So my answer is tower,

442
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
travel laptop with good battery life, right?

443
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
Yeah, that would work. That would be great. That would also work.

444
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,680
So it's like Linux power tower, MacBook, or MacBook Pro.

445
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,080
Yeah.

446
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,640
That seems like the answer.

447
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,440
You're not including the tablet in there, though. So I think-

448
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,360
Well, and the tablet. I mean, the tablet is, ironically, I don't mention the tablet. The

449
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,640
tablet's what I use probably most of the time, right? If I'm tapping at an email, whatever.

450
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,240
Right. Or booking a flight.

451
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,120
But every once in a while, I need to like make a build on the fly or like SSH. Although,

452
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,240
ISSH we talked about last week. So things are changing. I will give you that. I just don't

453
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,720
feel like I'm there yet for the iPad to be my travel.

454
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,280
No, no, absolutely not. But I think trying to buy something like the Oryx Pro, it's just-

455
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:20,000
It was the wrong thought process for me. Now, if you just like want a laptop to move around

456
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,920
rooms, but you basically work at home or you work in an office, I actually think it's a great

457
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:32,160
dev state. Compiling, spoiler alert, we're doing a follow-up product to Alice. Compiling that on it

458
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:39,840
was really, really, really fast, but it doesn't have good battery life. At least not. And it does

459
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,480
have a clever thing where you can switch from Intel to the Nvidia card, which does improve

460
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,800
your battery life, but it's not enough for someone who travels like you and I do, I feel like.

461
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,680
Yeah. If you're moving from one room to another room, if you're doing a 30-minute meeting with

462
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,880
your laptop, it's great for that. If you have a power cord at your desk at work and you have a

463
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,320
power cord at your desk at home and you're moving your laptop between work and home, it's good. It's

464
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:09,840
great. It's great for that. I say that as I have an Oryx and a Bonobo out in the other room right

465
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:16,400
now and they're both hooked up to power. This is one of the weird situations where the Oryx

466
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,800
is a great machine for the people who work for me, but not for me. Because I'm the only guy who

467
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,960
actually goes on the road into the sales right now. Yeah. I mean, for me, I feel like you're

468
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,760
still not quite... I'm not hearing the gospel. You're not wrapping your head around the good

469
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,320
word of Thunderbolt 3. Well, so the thing is, is you invest in one dock and then you have multiple

470
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:49,600
machines that take advantage of that singular investment. So not that I emailed the Apple rep

471
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:56,080
that works with me during recordings, but I asked him to spec out and quote out a 15-inch Mac Pro

472
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:03,360
with a Radeon card. Is it that you're telling me that I should go... And I prefer the 13-inch form

473
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:08,160
factor for any laptop, frankly. In fact, the Gallardo... When you're in a hotel room, when

474
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,240
you're on an airplane, when do you need a video card? Have you ever needed a video card in those

475
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,240
particular instances? Well, there was that one time me and you were in that hotel room that we

476
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:23,280
don't talk about. Yeah. That thing is GPU accelerated for Intel as well. I was... Wow.

477
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,680
Jeez. Hey, all right. Hey, first-person VR virtual porn is extremely GPU intensive.

478
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,040
It's true. We've established that we've never actually met, so...

479
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,960
Actually, have we said that on air? We did on air. We did on air on the last show.

480
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,520
Well, I thought we did. That might've been pre-show for all I know.

481
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,560
Oh, geez. I know. That's why people got to show up over at jblive.tv and listen.

482
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,720
No. You actually make a tremendously money-saving point here. When I am traveling,

483
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,400
I am effectively a sales guy. I need to be able to run the software, but I don't necessarily

484
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,560
need to be able to build everything. You're in ration mode, in a way. You're just surviving.

485
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:13,120
Am I a MacBook Air customer? Well, no. You're an Intel video customer. Think about that,

486
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:19,200
because you can take a machine that is basic graphics with a good processor and a good amount

487
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,920
of RAM, and then when you get home, you plug it in over Thunderbolt 3, you got a nice GPU,

488
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,920
you're good to go. And it's working really good on Linux. I don't have a lot of experience with

489
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,680
Windows or Mac OS, but on Linux... It's terrible. It's terrible on Windows.

490
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,640
The only tip I give you on Linux is to make things really smooth is

491
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,000
is plug in the dock when your laptop is powered off and boot up that way.

492
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,680
So you don't... I mean, this is nothing to do with code radio, but it's just a tools episode.

493
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,480
You don't experience any latency with GPUs over USB Thunderbolt?

494
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,040
Well, no, it's not.

495
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,080
USB-C Thunderbolt.

496
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:00,800
So Thunderbolt 3 is a PCI connection. So the video card is on essentially like a PCI 4X

497
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,240
lane, which granted isn't 16X, but it's still better than what...

498
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,560
I thought it had like less throughput than a regular PCI Express.

499
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,480
It does, but it's still on the PCI bus. So it might be 2X or 4X depending on the laptop,

500
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,960
but it's still better than what the integrated graphics is.

501
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,600
It's nice. It even accelerates just the built-in screen. So even if I didn't have external

502
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:33,280
monitors, my built-in screen gets the graphics. It's doing round trip. There's enough bandwidth

503
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,080
that it can send the stuff to the GPU and the dock and then send the results back.

504
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:43,200
And then the Intel card must be doing some sort of buffer pass and it's just dumping

505
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,880
it on the screen. And I am able... Even on my built-in screen, I can take advantage of external

506
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,920
graphics.

507
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,240
So the specific use case I was thinking about and leaking from the top five here,

508
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:02,160
compiling ML.net on a laptop on the road, if I need to change something.

509
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,920
I guess you could always bring... So in the case of the Lenovo graphics dock, it is the

510
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:14,400
same size of an average Thunderbolt 3 dock. It's pretty small, but there's some huge docks,

511
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,600
like Blackmagic makes one.

512
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:21,920
The pain of doing that on the Galego was... I mean, it was significant. Because the Galego,

513
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:28,400
like you were saying, it's an i7, but it's an Intel i7. It was a serious process.

514
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

515
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:35,120
But on the Oryx, I mean, this is where I would be positive on the Oryx. It was lickety-split.

516
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,680
Right. That was the idea, right? Is you take advantage of the built-in. So I could... This

517
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:46,560
graphics GPU dock that I have for my ThinkPad, it would take up as much space in my bag as

518
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,280
an audio interface. I mean, it's no big deal. It's totally packable.

519
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,960
That's what you're saying.

520
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,400
I don't think you need to, right? I mean, I don't really think you need to. If you go

521
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,000
back to your desktop idea, you could also just remote desktop into a machine that has

522
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:09,840
a great built-in GPU. But then you need good remote connectivity. Which, I don't know, man,

523
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,120
that's tricky, like when you're doing like a...

524
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,760
Well, I always carry a MiFi, so it's like not...

525
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,160
Yeah, but it matters more like, okay, the demo is up, you got to do the demo, and you

526
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,360
got a few minutes. There's sometimes where it's really, really, really, really nice to

527
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,600
have that processing local, especially if you're on a deadline, if you're about to give

528
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,800
a demo. That's where having the local processing really matters.

529
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,880
I mean, once or twice a year, I get into these situations where I'm doing a demo, and there's

530
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,880
an error, and I notice it the night before the demo, and I want to fix it, recompile

531
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:38,880
the whole thing.

532
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,640
But the night before, you could do remote desktop.

533
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,080
Right.

534
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:47,280
So yeah, that might be a solution that works for you. You got to embrace it. You got to

535
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,920
think about it. You got to change the way you're thinking about this, because this isn't

536
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,120
going to... You can't go through 2019 like this. You can't do it.

537
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,360
This is a coder intervention. Somebody bang suggested.

538
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,000
You got to.

539
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,640
All right.

540
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,280
Yeah.

541
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,480
All right. Let's be positive. How about we go to the GitHub top programming languages

542
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,200
chart?

543
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,600
Oh, yeah. Where is this now?

544
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,200
The link from the show notes, 334.

545
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,600
I'll tell you what, you're talking about... Are you talking about the DigitalOcean survey

546
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,640
that they did?

547
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,760
I'm talking about the GitHub one.

548
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,120
No, there's no GitHub one linked in the show notes.

549
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,600
Yeah, there is.

550
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,280
No, there's not.

551
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,160
I'm looking at it.

552
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:22,560
No.

553
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,680
You're not in the right doc, buddy.

554
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,320
No, I'm in 334. What are you talking about?

555
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,520
I'm in 334.

556
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,160
Yeah. Yeah, I don't see you here. You're in...

557
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,120
I don't see you here.

558
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,040
This is the part of the show where Mike live slacks Chris the doc.

559
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,160
You got to give us credit though. For 334 episodes, we've actually never had that problem.

560
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,320
We've been working on a doc this whole time.

561
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:49,200
This whole thing, really, this is how you can tell how closely we follow the script on this show.

562
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,240
Yeah. That would be the doc that I just sent you.

563
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,960
A little sauce has been revealed, but it's for the better, I think.

564
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,720
I think the audience should know. Well, they should know.

565
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,600
Well, anyway, while Chris opens the doc, so the top three fastest growing languages

566
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,040
by contributors as of September 30th, 2018. Number one, guess.

567
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,120
In fact, it's good you didn't see the doc, Chris. Guess.

568
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:09,840
Oh, yeah, you're right.

569
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,160
I would normally say, if this was like three years ago-

570
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,880
It's not Rust. I may help you. It's not Rust.

571
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,440
No, I would have said that last year. I would have said that last year.

572
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:17,760
Okay.

573
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,200
But if this was three years ago, I would say JavaScript. Sure.

574
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,600
Nope. Not even top 10.

575
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,000
If this was last year, I would say Rust.

576
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,840
This year, I got two contenders in mind. And I don't feel-

577
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,440
Tell me the two before you make a pick.

578
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,760
All right. I don't feel strong about either one of them.

579
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,560
It's Go and Swift.

580
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,760
Go is in the top 10. Swift is not even.

581
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,360
Really? Really?

582
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:45,920
Kotlin.

583
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,320
No. Really?

584
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:53,120
Absolutely. According to GitHub, it has 2.6 times the contributors over last year.

585
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,720
Kotlin coming in for the win by a big margin.

586
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,840
Kotlin coming in hard. Before that, number two is HCL, which is a specialty thing.

587
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:06,480
Sure. That we don't cover here.

588
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,600
No. TypeScript. Pretty popular though.

589
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,880
Fucking TypeScript. Yeah.

590
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,120
I mean, I'm sorry. Linuxing TypeScript. Ah, geez.

591
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,240
PowerShell, though, number four, and then Rust at number fricking five.

592
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,520
All right. I have a bone to pick with number four.

593
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:21,840
Oh, yeah?

594
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,600
PowerShell scripts are effectively C-sharp scripts. That's-

595
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,560
Yeah. Fair enough.

596
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,520
It's, yeah.

597
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,000
Hello.

598
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,720
And number five-

599
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,280
I mean, if you're counting PowerShell scripts, then you better count Bash scripts.

600
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,840
As what? C?

601
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,720
If you were counting Bash, Bash would be number one on this list.

602
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,080
Oh, sure. All right. Fair enough. Yeah. I mean, their list is a little weird.

603
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:42,320
Yeah.

604
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:50,960
What I thought was really interesting here is though, top programming languages by contributors,

605
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,680
right? So the list we just did was top by growth.

606
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,360
Right? Who had the biggest growth year over year.

607
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:57,600
Yeah.

608
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:02,320
This is absolute top. Give me your number one. And you had it right last time.

609
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,200
Oh, JavaScript.

610
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,320
Dominant. Dominant. Yeah.

611
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:07,600
Number two.

612
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,720
Java.

613
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:16,560
Damn. Number three. Number three, we had a switch. We actually had a switcheroo here.

614
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,520
The current number three.

615
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,280
TypeScript?

616
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,320
Python. But who did it dethrone?

617
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,080
PHP.

618
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:32,720
PHP. Yes. Savage. All right. The current number... Holy shit. Current number... This

619
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,640
is a very confusing chart. Current number five. And we'll stop at number five. Number

620
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,040
six is C sharp. So it's not C sharp. Number five.

621
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,080
It's either PHP or TypeScript.

622
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,160
C++.

623
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,080
No. Oh, I didn't even get close.

624
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,400
And I attribute that to IoT. I think there's a lot of C++... There's been some sort of

625
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,040
renaissance.

626
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,240
Okay. Yeah, I could see that. Yeah. That makes sense.

627
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,560
TypeScript is number seven?

628
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,160
Okay.

629
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,280
And Objective-C.

630
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:03,680
Yeah.

631
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,720
Objective-C.

632
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,280
Oh, yeah? How's Objective-C doing? Good, right?

633
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,920
Things have been better.

634
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,280
Solid. It's doing real good.

635
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:09,600
Oh.

636
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,920
You know, we've hit some hard times.

637
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,520
Yeah. It gets even worse when you look at people that are contributing to the projects.

638
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,160
Like, obviously, Objective-C is not even on the radar.

639
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,120
It's so much worse. Objective-C has the only... All it has is legacy now, right?

640
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:25,520
Yeah.

641
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,640
Yeah. All right. And we'll do the last one.

642
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,200
Okay.

643
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,560
Top programming languages by repos created from 2008 to 2018.

644
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,360
Give me your number one.

645
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,640
So from 2008, it's got to be JavaScript.

646
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,920
Yes, JavaScript. By a mile.

647
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,800
Yeah, yeah.

648
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,120
Next.

649
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:53,440
Next is going to be... Next is going to be a gap, right? Because, like, nothing compares to

650
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,000
JavaScript.

651
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,960
There's the Grand Canyon between one and two.

652
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,000
Is there? Yeah, okay. Okay.

653
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,720
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

654
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,640
You know, I'm going to say Google made the right call. I'm going to say it's Java.

655
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,240
It is Java.

656
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,680
Of course it's Java. They've had a good decade, really.

657
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:18,160
Yeah. And then going off this chart, it looks like after that, there is essentially a gulf.

658
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:24,400
After that is Python. And then way, way after that is PHP and Ruby.

659
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,240
Didn't really expect to see much else there.

660
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,280
But I don't know. We'll link to it in the show notes if you want to check it out.

661
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,720
Coder.show slash three, three, four.

662
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,880
Kotlin, though, is really the standout performer, isn't it? That's the kind of takeaway.

663
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,880
Yeah. Yeah. For new repos created, Kotlin's definitely very quickly gaining mindshare,

664
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,920
is how I would put it.

665
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,520
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what to make of it. Because I can't help but think about

666
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,800
Kotlin with the context of Fuchsia. And Fuchsia is this potentially looming

667
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:02,880
total replacement for Android. And then would the Java apps be anything more than just a

668
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,720
supported runtime? Would there be a totally new way to create applications? There's so

669
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,440
many questions.

670
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,600
Yeah. So I think of Kotlin more as a way to clean up legacy Java, like Spring development

671
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,400
and things like that.

672
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:14,720
Right.

673
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,960
Make it a little easier to deal with. As you know, Chris, a couple years ago, or is it

674
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,760
one year, year and a half, something like that, two years, I had a project. I was working,

675
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,760
I think, with California or something like that, where I shipped a Spring app. And it

676
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,520
was an old Spring app. The way to update it was to actually switch it to Kotlin. And this

677
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:40,320
was when Kotlin just hit 1.0. To make it easier to deal with, easier to reason with, and just

678
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,840
writing tests against it was a lot easier. This is a large enterprise scale application.

679
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,000
And? You just leave me hanging?

680
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,640
I can't tell you what it did.

681
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,520
Oh, really? I'm like, okay, okay.

682
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:01,520
I can tell you that rewriting legacy Java code into Kotlin made life easier for everybody.

683
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:06,800
I can tell you that the Kotlin code was actually more performing because they were on Java 1.4.

684
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,600
Oh, really?

685
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:15,200
So, but we were able to, by leveraging Kotlin's ability to pull in the name of Java Jars,

686
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,640
we were able to still leverage some of the proprietary libraries they built.

687
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,200
Hmm. Hmm. You secret agent. You mysterious man.

688
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,200
No, that's not me. No, no, no, no. That is Alan Jude. I want to make this perfectly clear.

689
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,520
Oh, really?

690
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,520
And all I have to say is Putin 2020.

691
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:35,600
Yeah, I agree. I'm on board Putin 2020 and Putin Jude. Putin Jude.

692
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,000
You know, this might be why my TSA pre-check has not been approved yet. Now that you told

693
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,160
me about the listener numbers, what are the odds that there's not a TSA guy that says,

694
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,000
I don't know about this guy. Maybe we should make him take his shoes off and open his back.

695
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,680
Just in case for some Russian propaganda.

696
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,360
You never know, Mr. Dominic. In fact, if you have to run from the law,

697
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,680
there's only one place people should follow you, and that's probably besides coder.show

698
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,280
slash subscribe, but also.

699
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,280
At Dominic.

700
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,200
Yeah, there you go. There you go. You got it. You got it. I'm at Chris Elias, and those

701
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:13,120
adventures, like I talked about, are all linked and described at coder.show. That's the main

702
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:18,560
resource in this episode. Coder.show slash three, three, four. Thanks so much for tuning

703
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:23,280
this week's episode of the Coder Radio Program. We'd love to get your contact at our feedback

704
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,360
page. I don't know, you do the math on that. And we'd love to have you join us live, jblive.tv,

705
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,680
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for that lifetime. Thanks so much for joining

706
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:53,680
