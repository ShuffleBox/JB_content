This is Coder Radio, episode 472 for June 27th, 2022.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.840
Hello friends, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.840 --> 00:24.600
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.600 --> 00:30.280
My name is Chris and joining us from his base of operations, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.280
Hello Mike.

00:31.280 --> 00:35.240
Yes, unfortunately, my wings doth had been clipped.

00:35.240 --> 00:38.560
I thought this was going to be like one of those crazy energy shows where you were like

00:38.560 --> 00:40.200
remote from your mom's house.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.320
I was supposed to be.

00:41.320 --> 00:46.400
So I had a fabulous trip planned for my son, a six-year-old by the way, who if you paid

00:46.400 --> 00:54.840
attention on Twitter, he has the most, if I say so myself, the most balling Pokemon card

00:54.840 --> 00:55.840
binder.

00:55.840 --> 00:56.840
Binder?

00:56.840 --> 00:57.840
Do they still call him that?

00:57.840 --> 00:58.840
Oh yeah.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.840
Yeah.

00:59.840 --> 01:00.840
You got to organize them all in the binder for sure.

01:00.840 --> 01:04.560
He's very, very annoyingly, let me tell you something.

01:04.560 --> 01:10.240
This kid, a fighting type and a fire type, shath never be on the same page.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.240
Oh man.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.520
My kid got into this big time too.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.560
He's still into it really.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.000
It's damn fortunate though.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Five bucks a pack.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh yeah.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.200
It's a Florida, cigarettes are free, abortions are illegal, but cigarettes are free.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.160
You know, you just buy a pack of camels, it's cheaper.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.160
But Pokemon.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.160
Pokemon.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.160
You got to pay for them all.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.160
You got to pay, you got to pay for all.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.640
And I thought there was 151 Pokemon.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.560
I was corrected.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.600
There are like 600 Pokemon now.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.600
Oh yeah.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.480
Well they keep having all these Pokemon derivatives.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.600
They're like crypto.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.800
So we bought the Pokemon sword and shield because obviously we want to both attack and

01:42.800 --> 01:43.800
defend.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
Yeah.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.720
Like what happened to Pikachu?

01:46.720 --> 01:48.840
And they're both, they're both like 50 bucks.

01:48.840 --> 01:49.840
Sword and shield.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.840
You got to buy two $50 games.

01:51.840 --> 01:55.720
And then they just came out with some DLC that hit right before our road trip.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.040
So of course my son comes to me.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.040
He can hear you.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.040
No, no.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.040
Oh yeah.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.040
You're right.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.040
I probably shouldn't give him any tips.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.680
I shouldn't give him any tips, but I got, I got hit up for the DLC right before the road

02:03.680 --> 02:04.680
trip.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.680
Go figure.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.680
Oh, I'm about to get hit up for it.

02:06.680 --> 02:11.440
I disabled the wifi on the Nintendo because old man Mike is, daddy Mike is buying the

02:11.440 --> 02:16.720
SD cards cause I'm not around with any online stuff here.

02:16.720 --> 02:22.480
I'm sure dear listeners, you can tell that your good friend Mike is in a mood because

02:22.480 --> 02:25.280
I have spent a fortune this week.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.720
Should I tell them how much I spent on the plane tickets or is that too much?

02:27.720 --> 02:28.720
Oh yeah.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.120
I'd be curious to know cause I know it's crazy right now.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.120
$2,459.

02:32.120 --> 02:36.840
Oh, you could, that's like a, that's like a decked out Mac book.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.120
It's actually not, which is the worst part of that.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.120
I suppose so.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.120
Yeah.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.640
So I told my kid like, this is his treat, you know, his birthday present, everything

02:43.640 --> 02:45.880
rolled into one, my birthday present.

02:45.880 --> 02:46.880
Nope.

02:46.880 --> 02:47.880
Cancel that out.

02:47.880 --> 02:54.040
Cause my boy presented with a cough and no fever for two days, man.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.040
Right before the train.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.800
Can I, can I have someone to filter here?

02:56.800 --> 02:57.800
Yeah.

02:57.800 --> 02:58.800
What do you got?

02:58.800 --> 03:02.120
So I took them to two different doctors in two days.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.760
Neither of them would treat the boy.

03:03.760 --> 03:04.760
What do you mean?

03:04.760 --> 03:05.760
They wouldn't treat him.

03:05.760 --> 03:06.760
They wouldn't treat him.

03:06.760 --> 03:07.760
I mean, they were nice.

03:07.760 --> 03:08.760
They examined them.

03:08.760 --> 03:09.760
They were kind, whatever.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.760
They would not, uh, they threw up their hands.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.840
You know what they said?

03:13.840 --> 03:14.840
You know what they said?

03:14.840 --> 03:18.480
They say, if he gets any worse, you can come back, but otherwise stay home if he gets,

03:18.480 --> 03:19.760
but what else could it be?

03:19.760 --> 03:21.960
What, what was their excuse for not treating him?

03:21.960 --> 03:23.120
Oh, it's going to be COVID.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.600
It's going to be, you know, it could be COVID man.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.600
Yeah.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.800
So this kid is crying.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.800
This kid is upset.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.400
This kid's not feeling well.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.960
My whole life just took a detour, which is fine.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
It's being a parent.

03:33.960 --> 03:34.960
Yeah.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.280
But this morning we get up.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.080
Boy has a hundred, a hundred and something fever.

03:40.080 --> 03:46.120
So me and my fiancee Mariah are, listen, it's, you know, it's like when an aircraft carrier

03:46.120 --> 03:49.760
is getting bombed, everybody get off the ground, fly, fly, fly, right?

03:49.760 --> 03:50.760
Everybody's moving.

03:50.760 --> 03:51.760
Yeah.

03:51.760 --> 03:52.760
We gotta, we gotta respond.

03:52.760 --> 03:53.760
Everybody has a job to do here.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.760
Let's go.

03:54.760 --> 03:55.760
Figure this out.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.760
Get him to the doctor.

03:56.760 --> 03:57.760
Oh, I can't see him until a few hours.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.280
I have never wanted to kill an old person more in my life.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.280
Yeah.

04:01.280 --> 04:05.040
I know like that parental instinct protect kicks in and you're like, you don't understand.

04:05.040 --> 04:10.360
I mean, I, I know this is not woke, but super dad mode is like, I will destroy this building.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.360
Yeah.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.360
I'm not joking.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.400
Give me my stapler back and give my kids some antibiotics.

04:15.400 --> 04:22.280
So after several days of the same three doctors refusing to give my son antibiotics, guess

04:22.280 --> 04:23.280
what they told me today?

04:23.280 --> 04:24.280
Okay.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.280
What?

04:25.280 --> 04:26.280
Oh, well, yeah.

04:26.280 --> 04:27.760
I guess he needs antibiotics.

04:27.760 --> 04:28.760
Yeah.

04:28.760 --> 04:29.760
Yeah.

04:29.760 --> 04:30.760
Huh?

04:30.760 --> 04:31.760
Funny.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.400
But the boy, a six year old gets to suffer.

04:33.400 --> 04:37.000
It's like using Linux, like, does he need to suffer?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.520
But he, no, no, he doesn't.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.440
It's like forcing someone to use Linux.

04:40.440 --> 04:44.200
I mean, it's terrible, but don't you, don't you force him to use Linux though?

04:44.200 --> 04:45.200
Don't you have him?

04:45.200 --> 04:49.960
You actually, he, he, he, he requests Linux because only he doesn't know this and we'll

04:49.960 --> 04:54.840
never tell him, but, uh, only on the Linux on the Thaleo it's Sonic mania.

04:54.840 --> 05:00.360
Let me tell you, my son is very, in fact, Chris, we just saw Sonic the Hedgehog two

05:00.360 --> 05:04.680
at home streaming on a Peacock or Paramount or whatever.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.040
That's a fun movie.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.040
We loved it.

05:07.040 --> 05:11.600
First of all, I have to say, I don't get why everybody says Knuckles talks weird.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.560
Knuckles seems super reasonable to me.

05:13.560 --> 05:16.260
That Knuckles is always how I pictured Knuckles in my head when I was playing the game.

05:16.260 --> 05:17.260
It was great.

05:17.260 --> 05:19.840
It was a great, a great time.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.720
But yes, so I am not in New Jersey.

05:21.720 --> 05:29.680
I am down South with my reptilian brethren and this is all somehow, somehow Wes's fault.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.680
Yeah, of course.

05:30.680 --> 05:34.280
Once I figure out how Clojure was involved, you won't, you won't believe what Wes did

05:34.280 --> 05:35.280
to me.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.280
Oh, tell me, tell me.

05:36.280 --> 05:41.080
I, last week we prerecorded because I was taking the family on an annual trip to Bozeman,

05:41.080 --> 05:42.080
Montana.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.920
It's the best swimming around in Bozeman, Montana.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.000
The kids just look forward to it all year round.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.080
Like school gets out and they're immediately asking how many days until we go to Bozeman.

05:51.080 --> 05:55.440
Few days before we left, I started to realize I was coming down with something.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.900
I wasn't sure what it was.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.680
But as time went on, I started to realize I was getting actually pretty sick.

06:01.680 --> 06:05.880
And I got about as sick as I did the first time I got COVID before the vaccine was out.

06:05.880 --> 06:06.880
Oh Jesus.

06:06.880 --> 06:10.340
And this is my third time, my third time around with it.

06:10.340 --> 06:11.340
You have COVID?

06:11.340 --> 06:12.340
I'm pretty sure I had COVID.

06:12.340 --> 06:13.340
Yeah.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.840
I did not end up getting myself tested because I just stayed at home and isolated.

06:15.840 --> 06:16.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:16.840 --> 06:17.840
Oh my God.

06:17.840 --> 06:18.840
They didn't want to see me.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.520
So it was like, well, okay.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.600
I don't, I don't really have like a standing doctor I go to anyways.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.460
So when that kind of thing happens, I just go to lockdown now because this is potentially

06:27.460 --> 06:30.200
my fourth time around with it, fully vaccinated.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.200
And I still get it.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.540
And it was this time, it was almost as rough as it was the very first time.

06:35.540 --> 06:38.820
The last couple of times I think I potentially had it were pretty mild.

06:38.820 --> 06:40.400
So you know my deal with COVID, right?

06:40.400 --> 06:45.680
The first time I took a stroke and you remember because I was, I was, I was in bad shape for

06:45.680 --> 06:46.680
a couple of days.

06:46.680 --> 06:47.680
Yeah.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.480
Like full on mentally disabled mode.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.360
And the second time I just threw up a lot.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.360
I don't know why.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.560
I didn't know it could affect your stomach.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.560
Yeah, it does.

06:55.560 --> 06:56.560
It can.

06:56.560 --> 07:00.280
I don't believe you now because trust me, I lost about 50 pounds.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.280
I was just thrown up.

07:02.280 --> 07:05.900
This time I got all the traditional symptoms people are getting.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.720
I'm still slightly plugged up today.

07:08.720 --> 07:14.480
My ears have cleared up a little bit, but I still, you know, I, I got myself good enough.

07:14.480 --> 07:18.080
We went on the trip, but the first couple of days of the trip, which were drive days,

07:18.080 --> 07:19.320
the first few days were just drive days.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.320
Sure.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.320
Sure.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.320
I felt like hell.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.320
How was the trip by the way?

07:23.320 --> 07:24.320
Oh, it was great though.

07:24.320 --> 07:25.320
The trip turned out great.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.320
They really was a, it was a good trip.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.640
You were, you were well enough.

07:27.640 --> 07:32.280
This is, see, this is just Chris and Mike hanging out that the advertisers pay for now.

07:32.280 --> 07:36.800
I feel, I don't mean to need to move off this, but I feel I should just say one thing.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.600
It is abnormal to take a stroke from COVID.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.960
That is because for new listeners, Mike has a born in heart problem.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.200
Very bad.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.200
Mike's been butchered.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.200
You can listen to the old episodes.

07:47.200 --> 07:52.680
A guy named Alex on Twitter is for some reason reviewing all the old episodes.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.640
How great has that been though?

07:54.640 --> 07:57.880
It's been pretty great because you know what he says, you know, cause he finds like these

07:57.880 --> 08:01.880
old nuggets and it's like, I was so tempted to talk about it in the show cause I'm kind

08:01.880 --> 08:02.880
of glad you brought it up.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.360
I'm sort of dying to talk about it.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.360
Yeah.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.360
Okay.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.360
All right.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.360
Good.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.360
So I mean, cause you know, we love it.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.360
We love it when we nail it.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.840
And it's so, so this, so Alex has been listening to the bad catalog and tweeting clips of like

08:12.840 --> 08:13.840
past predictions.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.400
What was, he got a good one.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.400
You had a really good call.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.220
There was a couple of mine too, but there was one that you made that was the weird one

08:19.220 --> 08:20.480
that he missed was though.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.480
What?

08:21.480 --> 08:22.480
Docker.

08:22.480 --> 08:27.480
And he might, but he's way, but he's like eight years back in that catalog right now.

08:27.480 --> 08:28.480
He's yeah.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.880
But Docker, the Docker thing was before your Apple arm transition call.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.720
That might've been before I had kids.

08:33.720 --> 08:34.720
The Docker one.

08:34.720 --> 08:35.720
I don't know.

08:35.720 --> 08:36.720
It's all, it's all blurry.

08:36.720 --> 08:37.720
No, you just had a kid.

08:37.720 --> 08:38.720
Okay.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.720
Yeah.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.720
Probably.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.720
Yeah.

08:41.720 --> 08:42.720
Oh, it's been a long time.

08:42.720 --> 08:43.720
So, all right, let's get into the feedback.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.840
Speaking of feedback, we did get sent into the show, but yeah, Alex and his, you know

08:47.840 --> 08:50.840
what Alex, Oh man, if you're listening, but by the time he gets to this, it's going to

08:50.840 --> 08:51.840
be years later.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.840
Dude.

08:52.840 --> 08:53.840
You know what?

08:53.840 --> 08:59.400
I'm going to cause Alex DMS me sometimes because he's a, Alex is a Linux user by the way.

08:59.400 --> 09:04.000
I just, and by the way, didn't nobody see my Twitter today of the beautiful package

09:04.000 --> 09:09.320
that an angel named Gabriel, which is also the ups guys name at my head.

09:09.320 --> 09:10.320
Yes.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.320
What?

09:11.320 --> 09:12.320
What?

09:12.320 --> 09:13.320
What did you get?

09:13.320 --> 09:14.320
I was too busy.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.320
I was distracted by the dev one and the cat.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.320
That was the package.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.320
Not the cat.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.320
Okay.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.320
The cat is sort of a, a freeloader.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.320
Yeah.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.760
So I mean, it's the internet, so it's always safe to have a cat in the picture.

09:22.760 --> 09:23.880
I've done the metrics.

09:23.880 --> 09:28.200
It's, it's almost necessary to have the cat in the picture actually, but the dev one,

09:28.200 --> 09:33.840
and let me tell you this step one, I can say with apologies to the HP crew, it does work

09:33.840 --> 09:34.840
on USB charging.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.840
Good.

09:35.840 --> 09:39.080
So that was, it took about a week to get that turned around a week and a half.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.080
So I wrote my review.

09:40.080 --> 09:44.080
I don't know if you have a link in the show notes on a, on my blog, dominicm.com.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.200
I can't, I literally don't know cause I'm.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.200
We will.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.200
Okay.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.360
Chris did all the work because I was dealing with kids stuff.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.360
Love you, Chris.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.360
Loving you.

09:52.360 --> 09:55.400
Well, I have two dev ones in the house now.

09:55.400 --> 10:01.160
One is the review one, but I don't like to put like confidential stuff on review units.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.040
I feel that's not a good idea.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.040
Yeah.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.040
That one works fine.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.920
What idiot puts Captain Planet Giffies in their blog?

10:07.920 --> 10:09.400
Oh, that's my website.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.720
Oh, this is already my favorite review you've ever done.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.280
This is, this is already my favorite.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.280
It was the Captain Planet Giffies in the pictures.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.280
Yeah.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.280
It's good overall, actually.

10:18.280 --> 10:19.520
This is the high quality post.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.240
I have a Gen Zer in my house now.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.840
So my Giphy game is just, it's going up.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.040
Prepare, prepare yourself.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.040
I'm ready, dude.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.040
Okay.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.040
So I got mad.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.800
I returned one because you know, Mike's unreasonable, whatever I write about in the post.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.280
I was a bit of a jackass.

10:37.280 --> 10:38.280
I bought another one.

10:38.280 --> 10:44.520
It is quicker, amazingly to buy a def one than to get an exchange.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.700
I don't doubt it.

10:45.700 --> 10:49.000
Their supply chain game is, is like on point.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.160
36 hours.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.160
That's crazy.

10:51.160 --> 10:57.400
I ordered, I ordered one and I think we put the order in like, yeah, it was maybe 36 hours

10:57.400 --> 10:58.400
later.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.400
It was here at our doorstep.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.200
It was really impressive.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.200
Supply chain?

11:02.200 --> 11:03.200
What supply chain issues?

11:03.200 --> 11:05.600
So wait, wait, you ordered one?

11:05.600 --> 11:06.600
I ordered one.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.080
I'm not going to use it personally.

11:08.080 --> 11:14.040
I ordered one for Brent because he's had machine troubles for years and it's been kind of affecting

11:14.040 --> 11:15.120
production.

11:15.120 --> 11:18.480
So he's going to do an extended review for Linux Unplugged, ship him one.

11:18.480 --> 11:24.880
He is, if you ever, if you ever need a guy to do like a few hours of QA, you should hire

11:24.880 --> 11:25.880
him.

11:25.880 --> 11:30.480
He is like, I'm seriously considering giving him the title of chief QA officer at JB because

11:30.480 --> 11:33.240
if anyone will find a problem, it's him.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.720
I'm legit going to hire Brent when I know Brent from our Slack.

11:36.720 --> 11:40.020
And two, I drink a lot and I write a lot of code and that's not a-

11:40.020 --> 11:41.020
There you go.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.020
He'll find a bug.

11:42.020 --> 11:44.080
Some of those UFOs are literally my fault.

11:44.080 --> 11:47.440
They're just drones going wacky.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.360
So anyway, my father's computer woes.

11:50.360 --> 11:54.160
I can't remember the listener's name, but he sent in a, I'm sorry, I should've grabbed

11:54.160 --> 11:57.000
the name, a ThinkPad, which we'll have linked in the show notes.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.680
I don't love this machine that was linked.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.760
It's like a $380 ThinkPad.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.160
My father hates it more.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.160
Keep going.

12:03.160 --> 12:04.260
Oh really?

12:04.260 --> 12:05.600
You know what he hates?

12:05.600 --> 12:06.600
What?

12:06.600 --> 12:09.780
Why would anybody want a laptop that looks like a spoiled clam?

12:09.780 --> 12:12.760
So laptops, just not going to happen.

12:12.760 --> 12:13.760
Really?

12:13.760 --> 12:16.000
Like a used MacBook or something.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
An Apple?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Oh really?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Oh, okay.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
What about like a Limor?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.280
You know, I think they're about to update the Limor.

12:23.280 --> 12:26.920
He wants to know if IBM still makes computers.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.400
He's 79 years old, dude.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.800
I think I want to have a long conversation with your dad.

12:30.800 --> 12:31.800
You would love my dad.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.800
Actually, you being my dad at a bar, we'd all get along very well.

12:34.800 --> 12:38.320
I'm thinking I'd also probably figure out a lot about you by talking to your dad.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.080
I'm starting to see, I'm starting to hear some similarities here.

12:41.080 --> 12:46.720
I mean, I have, okay, so I appreciate the feedback.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.360
The man wants a tower.

12:48.360 --> 12:55.680
He wants the tower to be a tan, just a straight tower, no lights, quote, no bullshit.

12:55.680 --> 12:59.080
What happened to the CD-ROM drive and where's my floppy disk drive?

12:59.080 --> 13:02.840
You know, I mean, in terms of like backing up your config files, a floppy disk could

13:02.840 --> 13:03.840
be useful.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.720
We're making fun a little bit, but he used to have, not the floppy disk, what's the

13:06.720 --> 13:07.720
bigger one?

13:07.720 --> 13:08.720
The super disk, the skin?

13:08.720 --> 13:09.720
The zip drive?

13:09.720 --> 13:10.720
Zip drive.

13:10.720 --> 13:11.720
Yeah, those are great.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.120
That shit holds a lot of, and he's an accountant, right?

13:14.120 --> 13:15.120
So it's just texts.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.600
I mean, it's effectively text files.

13:16.600 --> 13:20.920
Well, I mean, after you format them, it's like 97 megabytes, but yeah.

13:20.920 --> 13:30.080
Well, you know, so I'm going to be making a call to Canada for Linus Tech Tips to build

13:30.080 --> 13:33.300
the most powerful computer the 80s could never have built.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.240
That would actually be a fun project.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.480
But it's going to look like it's from 1986.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.040
That's where we're going here.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.000
Man, that would be a fun project.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
We should do that.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.480
Like, yeah, if we had a video.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.480
We should just do it.

13:45.480 --> 13:46.480
F**k them.

13:46.480 --> 13:47.480
We should just do it.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.480
Who needs the Canadians?

13:48.480 --> 13:49.480
Who needs the Canadians?

13:49.480 --> 13:53.160
Also, Canadians, never install Steam on Linux.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.160
Never install Steam.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.240
You know Steam is going to blow up your whole thing.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.240
It's not for Canadians.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.280
It's for Americans only.

13:58.280 --> 13:59.280
Everybody knows that.

13:59.280 --> 14:03.560
So Jacob wants your idea on ways for non-Apple developers to collect feedback.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.720
He says, you know, getting the right amount of feedback is not easy.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.580
Apple kind of holds your hand in this process and creates a solution.

14:10.580 --> 14:11.580
Some background here.

14:11.580 --> 14:15.260
He says with WWDC behind us, we're now in beta for the new Apple software.

14:15.260 --> 14:19.720
Their feedback app really lowers the bar for non-technical folks to report issues.

14:19.720 --> 14:24.760
In contrast, I have no idea how I'd ever report an issue with a Windows app or maybe something

14:24.760 --> 14:25.760
in the Linux community.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.760
It seems all over the map.

14:26.760 --> 14:31.400
It seems like feedback is a crucial part of ensuring software delivers the intended value.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.920
What are some good techniques to ensure that the barriers to feedback are set at appropriate

14:34.920 --> 14:35.920
levels?

14:35.920 --> 14:39.960
In other words, how do you get great feedback from your users?

14:39.960 --> 14:41.160
Have you thought about this much?

14:41.160 --> 14:42.160
Because this is...

14:42.160 --> 14:44.980
I suffer with this, yes.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.220
This is a problem.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.920
If you figure it out, please let me know.

14:47.920 --> 14:48.920
Right.

14:48.920 --> 14:55.400
I, okay, I had a conversation about three months ago.

14:55.400 --> 14:59.760
Brilliant woman, smart lady on the phone, but she's one of the employees at one of my

14:59.760 --> 15:01.700
customer shops.

15:01.700 --> 15:08.080
And she said, Mike, this goddamn website is broken.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.460
Okay.

15:09.460 --> 15:10.460
Not a problem.

15:10.460 --> 15:11.460
We're here for you.

15:11.460 --> 15:18.080
If you pay us, right, like, no, you know, the normal customer service stuff.

15:18.080 --> 15:22.600
And then she says, yes, it's broken on my, and then she answers random Android phone

15:22.600 --> 15:23.600
here.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.600
Mm-hmm.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.600
Why is it broken?

15:25.600 --> 15:26.600
I can't log in.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.360
You're not, you're not supposed to be.

15:30.360 --> 15:34.600
So it's a real specific case, but this is, I think, an illustrative example.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.840
We user agent limit the login.

15:36.840 --> 15:41.480
So yes, of course you can spoof it, but we don't allow mobile devices because they want

15:41.480 --> 15:44.940
people would do a buy IP address.

15:44.940 --> 15:49.800
It's basically an administration website for their company on their physical soil.

15:49.800 --> 15:50.800
Sure.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.860
And so they don't want just random IPs on a carrier network.

15:54.860 --> 15:58.040
So the way we've done it is we block all carrier IPs.

15:58.040 --> 16:02.440
We block anything that is not a desktop or a laptop computer, right?

16:02.440 --> 16:05.160
Like Chrome, regular Chrome.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.840
And yeah, that's, I mean, but this was a serious bug.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.200
Like people were mad.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.160
It was a hell of a thing.

16:14.160 --> 16:17.640
I don't know how you do, could do, and to get the feedback, the way I got the feedback

16:17.640 --> 16:18.800
is I called her, right?

16:18.800 --> 16:21.800
I just straight up got on the phone.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.800
Yeah.

16:22.800 --> 16:26.800
You know, we did have a blog article we read weeks ago that just talked about sometimes

16:26.800 --> 16:31.460
the best way is just to contact your users directly, but you got to collect that information

16:31.460 --> 16:32.460
too.

16:32.460 --> 16:37.800
I mean, I would suggest if, if you can make people sign up for an account and then save

16:37.800 --> 16:42.920
that information, you can maybe do like an email form, but it's tough, man.

16:42.920 --> 16:47.240
It's when I used to have code journal, the feedback I got was like nasty shit on the

16:47.240 --> 16:48.240
app store.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.240
You know what I mean?

16:49.240 --> 16:54.400
Like some edge case that I had never tested or whatever, which I know is not the answer

16:54.400 --> 16:56.880
you're looking for, but it's a problem.

16:56.880 --> 17:00.960
I would like others ideas and input coder.show slash contact or boost in your thoughts.

17:00.960 --> 17:01.960
All right.

17:01.960 --> 17:07.120
So Peter writes in and who wants our take on a topic that I think when you, when you

17:07.120 --> 17:15.600
reflect on how our kids respond to things like Robux and Pokemon and DLC downloads,

17:15.600 --> 17:22.080
it's not that crazy to consider that people will be willing to spend money on fashion

17:22.080 --> 17:23.080
in the metaverse.

17:23.080 --> 17:25.240
And so Peter wanted to know what we thought about this.

17:25.240 --> 17:29.160
Meta is launching an avatar store with designer clothes.

17:29.160 --> 17:36.640
So like clothing designers are working with meta to create fashion that you can purchase

17:36.640 --> 17:38.840
in the metaverse.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.000
And I don't know if this is the implementation, but I think this is actually going to be a

17:42.000 --> 17:43.720
thing in a big way.

17:43.720 --> 17:51.140
In fact, I would think by the time that my kids are my age, the virtual economy is probably

17:51.140 --> 17:53.880
going to be larger than the physical economy.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.940
You've described hell, but keep going.

17:55.940 --> 18:02.460
And I think the reason for that is just there's so many efficiencies and incentives for these

18:02.460 --> 18:06.620
companies to get in the business of selling us virtual goods.

18:06.620 --> 18:08.360
It is such a boondoggle for them.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.080
It is such an opportunity.

18:10.080 --> 18:14.640
And there's also just the great ESG aspect of it.

18:14.640 --> 18:20.560
You know, if they're selling you virtual clothes, then that's a benefit to the environment because

18:20.560 --> 18:24.680
they're using less resources, less natural resources, less farming.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.680
No, no, no.

18:26.680 --> 18:27.840
It's better for the environment.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.240
It's virtual.

18:29.240 --> 18:32.280
It's good for struggling economies when the West is really struggling right now.

18:32.280 --> 18:35.240
We need new markets and it's not manufacturing, right?

18:35.240 --> 18:36.600
It's not building things.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.720
Or we could like decide that we don't want to lose.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.720
But that's a different conversation.

18:39.720 --> 18:40.720
Right.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.720
Yeah.

18:41.720 --> 18:42.720
Yeah.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.720
Well, let's just assume that's not happening.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.720
Let's just assume we're going into a future where.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.720
Let's assume failure.

18:45.720 --> 18:46.720
Great.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.720
Yeah.

18:47.720 --> 18:48.720
We're kind of into a failed.

18:48.720 --> 18:49.720
Yeah.

18:49.720 --> 18:54.000
I mean, the economy was super strong and people were great and we, you know, we had huge manufacturing.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.480
I still think there would be this huge push to sell virtual goods.

18:57.480 --> 19:01.040
I think it's just too great of an opportunity and everybody's going to get on board and

19:01.040 --> 19:02.160
they're going to get people hyped.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.160
I hate it.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.660
There's only one virtual good you should buy.

19:05.660 --> 19:09.320
And that's a quarter radio rope in the metaverse.

19:09.320 --> 19:14.140
We should be like the the cultists of Cthulhu with our black rope.

19:14.140 --> 19:19.120
So I completely reject this because it lacks the one.

19:19.120 --> 19:24.400
Frankly, I would say uniform clothing option that is necessary for any reasonable life.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.400
The rope.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.400
Of course.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.400
Well, here's why.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.000
I'll play devil's advocate.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.240
If there was a world in where you had a singular avatar that represented you across all services,

19:35.240 --> 19:37.000
all social media platforms.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
He'd be wearing a rope.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Yes.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Yes, he would.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Yes.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Sure.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.920
But if there was that one avatar and you could modify it and you bought yourself an outfit

19:45.920 --> 19:50.520
and it worked across all platforms, I could almost see an argument because that's like

19:50.520 --> 19:52.940
a virtual representation of yourself.

19:52.940 --> 19:56.960
But what we're going to get and we all know this is the case, what we're going to get

19:56.960 --> 20:01.640
is like a dozen of these services with all of them selling their own avatar clothing.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.240
You mean Apple's not going to integrate with Facebook?

20:04.240 --> 20:05.240
Shocking.

20:05.240 --> 20:06.240
Right.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.240
Exactly.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.240
And Google and they're and they're all going to have once once VR meetings become the new

20:10.240 --> 20:11.240
hotness.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.120
You know, you and I really want that to happen.

20:13.120 --> 20:17.160
I feel like I think we're going to be crying in a couple of years.

20:17.160 --> 20:18.160
I think.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.160
Yeah, they're going to screw it up.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.160
It's not going to work.

20:20.160 --> 20:24.040
Because how does Jupiter Broadcasting and the Mad Botter have a VR meeting?

20:24.040 --> 20:28.560
If I'm not saying this is true, but if Jupiter Broadcasting is on, let's say, Microsoft Teams

20:28.560 --> 20:30.800
and the Mad Botter is on Google Work, how do we have a meeting?

20:30.800 --> 20:31.800
Right.

20:31.800 --> 20:32.800
Well, you already have that problem today.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.440
It's like, OK, well, so let's set up a call.

20:34.440 --> 20:35.440
Great.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.440
How do you want to connect?

20:36.440 --> 20:37.440
Do you want to use Zoom, Google Hangouts?

20:37.440 --> 20:38.440
You want to use JetSea?

20:38.440 --> 20:39.440
Do you want to use a phone call?

20:39.440 --> 20:40.440
Like, what do you want to do?

20:40.440 --> 20:41.440
Oh, FaceTime?

20:41.440 --> 20:42.440
OK.

20:42.440 --> 20:43.440
All right.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.440
All right.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.600
You know, it gets just all these crazy services right now.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.600
None of them work together.

20:46.600 --> 20:49.480
So, yeah, of course it's going to be like that.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.400
You know, I got an email that asked me, like, hey, we kind of stopped talking about the

20:52.400 --> 20:55.240
virtual office and it's because of this stuff.

20:55.240 --> 20:58.120
Because we thought about it, talked about it and got really depressed.

20:58.120 --> 21:03.480
Like, there is, if it could just be something that was truly decentralized, that was an

21:03.480 --> 21:11.320
open protocol, that it was like the web, you know, like TCBIP and HTTP, yeah, OK, it could

21:11.320 --> 21:12.320
work out.

21:12.320 --> 21:16.360
But I think you and I being in a virtual room together, a virtual studio, it would be awesome

21:16.360 --> 21:19.720
to actually make it a virtual studio so it felt like we were doing this together, being

21:19.720 --> 21:22.100
able to see each other, use hand movements.

21:22.100 --> 21:24.260
I actually think there would be a benefit in production there.

21:24.260 --> 21:25.260
But you're right.

21:25.260 --> 21:26.260
I don't.

21:26.260 --> 21:27.260
It's always going to be this.

21:27.260 --> 21:28.260
I don't.

21:28.260 --> 21:29.260
Because you're from the Northwest and I'm from New Jersey and you will think that I'm

21:29.260 --> 21:31.880
assaulting everything in the room as I talk.

21:31.880 --> 21:36.620
You will think that I've gone full, you know, I've gone full Keanu Reeves and John Wick.

21:36.620 --> 21:37.620
They killed my dog.

21:37.620 --> 21:38.620
And you know what?

21:38.620 --> 21:39.620
**** these guys.

21:39.620 --> 21:40.620
I'm going for it.

21:40.620 --> 21:41.620
Yeah, you might be right.

21:41.620 --> 21:45.920
That's what our three New Jersey listeners were like, I get that joke.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.520
So yeah, we're not happy about it.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.800
You know what it is, man, is I'm struggling not to just have like a super negative take

21:50.800 --> 21:54.360
on it because that's I'm more than happy to do it for you.

21:54.360 --> 21:59.560
Yeah, it just feels cliche, like, you know, it's I don't want to be new technology bad,

21:59.560 --> 22:00.560
right?

22:00.560 --> 22:01.560
Because that's so easy.

22:01.560 --> 22:02.560
It's so common.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.560
New technology bad.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.800
But it's not new technology.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.480
It's not new technology, right?

22:06.480 --> 22:07.480
It's old.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.880
It's a number of older technologies packaged up.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.720
See, this is the problem.

22:11.720 --> 22:15.720
And I'm going to quote what is it and and recent Horowitz or what the guy's name is?

22:15.720 --> 22:16.720
I don't remember.

22:16.720 --> 22:21.280
But they promised us flying cars and they gave us Twitter.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.800
We haven't had any real new technology in a long time.

22:23.800 --> 22:28.560
And don't even lay that blockchain crap on me because I I'm very sorry for all of your

22:28.560 --> 22:32.480
college funds, by the way, that seems to have gone the wrong way.

22:32.480 --> 22:35.280
You know, he's a big blockchain guy, that Horowitz.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.280
He's a big.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.440
Oh, but he you know, but he's a big everything guy.

22:38.440 --> 22:42.760
If I said blueberry pie, the man probably owns like three bakeries, right?

22:42.760 --> 22:43.880
I just may be.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.120
You might be right.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.700
Just a quick aside about the crypto thing.

22:47.700 --> 22:53.280
If this crash means that we lose some of these ridiculous coins out there and some of these

22:53.280 --> 22:55.400
scams, that's a correction.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.400
It is.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.400
It is a correction.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.720
And the fact that some people in that space are stepping in and bailing out some of these

23:00.720 --> 23:03.400
projects and some of these companies, it's a damn shame.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.400
Super bad.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.400
Let them burn.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.400
We need a forest fire.

23:06.400 --> 23:12.680
Yeah, it 2021 and 2020, we're just it got out of control.

23:12.680 --> 23:16.720
And it's it's a beast beyond any regulatory body's ability to manage.

23:16.720 --> 23:20.360
Do you know what the biggest crypto coin is, though, right?

23:20.360 --> 23:21.360
Stable coins.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.680
The biggest digital dollar?

23:22.680 --> 23:23.680
No, there's one.

23:23.680 --> 23:24.680
What?

23:24.680 --> 23:25.880
USD, baby.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.680
Most dollars are not physical.

23:27.680 --> 23:28.680
They're not paper.

23:28.680 --> 23:29.680
Right.

23:29.680 --> 23:31.960
It's it's this is a losing fight.

23:31.960 --> 23:37.960
I love Bitcoin because we all want to purchase Ayahuasca on the Internet and not be tracked.

23:37.960 --> 23:42.240
Yeah, I actually still I still am fairly confident long term in Bitcoin.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.160
But the rest, I think I'll need to die.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.880
I like the underlying technology.

23:45.880 --> 23:50.720
I think the idea that the government would ever allow and I mean our government would

23:50.720 --> 23:56.400
ever allow you to have a transaction that they can't trace is right.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.520
Well, let's make no mistake, though.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.040
Every transaction on Bitcoin is public.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.040
It is horrible.

24:02.040 --> 24:07.040
And also, didn't the FBI like seize a bunch from that?

24:07.040 --> 24:08.040
Yeah.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.040
They just took it.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.040
Right.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.040
This is.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.040
Yeah.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.040
Yeah.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.040
They're like one of the biggest holders of Bitcoin at this point, because of all the

24:14.040 --> 24:15.040
Bitcoin they seized.

24:15.040 --> 24:20.480
So that's supposedly they're going to sell it with apologies to Attorney General Garland.

24:20.480 --> 24:21.480
Sell your coin, my friend.

24:21.480 --> 24:22.920
I don't know what to say.

24:22.920 --> 24:26.760
I say this dip is a great opportunity to buy some stats and boost the show.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.520
And we'll see how things play out long term.

24:28.520 --> 24:29.520
That's my robes.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.720
My robe coin, you know what?

24:31.720 --> 24:32.720
Robe NFT, man.

24:32.720 --> 24:33.720
No, I didn't.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.200
I actually was thinking about it.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.640
This show is just off the rails.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.080
We sell robes.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.080
We did.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.080
No, we should.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.080
We are.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.080
We're doing it again.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.080
We did.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.080
Yeah.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.080
We got to get back.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.080
I agree.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.080
We got to get every day at two in the morning.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.080
I'm going to call you and we're going to until you just do it.

24:50.080 --> 24:56.320
We also need to sell cocktail glasses and Coderadio branded headphones that the Bluetooth

24:56.320 --> 24:58.800
does not suck on Linux.

24:58.800 --> 24:59.800
That's the full set.

24:59.800 --> 25:00.800
No.

25:00.800 --> 25:01.800
No pants, though.

25:01.800 --> 25:02.800
Are you thinking wireless headphones?

25:02.800 --> 25:04.800
I'm thinking wireless, my man.

25:04.800 --> 25:05.800
Hmm.

25:05.800 --> 25:06.800
So you're coding.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.000
You're loaded.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.360
You're listening to Coderadio.

25:10.360 --> 25:14.220
You're correctly angry at Swift.

25:14.220 --> 25:18.720
And you love Objective-C. I think I know who the customer for this might be.

25:18.720 --> 25:19.720
Craig Federighi.

25:19.720 --> 25:20.720
Hang on.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.520
I got to unbutton one more button.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.520
Make sure.

25:24.520 --> 25:25.520
All right.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.520
I'm down to.

25:26.520 --> 25:27.520
There you go.

25:27.520 --> 25:28.520
All right.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.520
I'll take that hair.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.520
All right.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.520
You know what?

25:31.520 --> 25:32.520
Craig Federighi's hair, I don't even want to try.

25:32.520 --> 25:36.160
He's, you and Craig, actually, you're the one who could step up to Craig Federighi.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.160
I'll take him on.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.120
I mean, you know, because he's got a, you know, he's got a crew doing that swoop before

25:40.120 --> 25:41.120
he goes out there.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.120
Right.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.120
And this is all natural, baby.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.120
There ain't no crew here doing this.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.120
He's got like eight hairdressers.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.120
Right.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.120
Right.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.120
This is one man.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.440
And this is one man not trying very hard.

25:49.440 --> 25:52.480
So if I tried hard and got a crew, I think I could out hair him.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.480
You know where we're selling all of this?

25:54.480 --> 25:55.960
In our sponsor Metaverse.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.520
Hey, that's right.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.520
Metaverse.

25:58.520 --> 25:59.560
Go to the Metaverse.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.040
Get yourself an avatar.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.800
Actually, instead of the Metaverse, go to our Matrix chat.

26:03.800 --> 26:07.960
I have set up a space for meetups.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.240
We have a London meetup coming up.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.920
So there's a dedicated London chat room.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.880
I have a Pacific Northwest chat room.

26:12.880 --> 26:15.400
And I have a virtual like mumble chat room meetups.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.080
I just want to pass this along as we do future meetups.

26:18.080 --> 26:21.000
There will be one in September as well on the West Coast.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.120
We'll have discussions in our Matrix chat room.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.920
And you know, just want to get the word out there.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.560
How do I get in there and troll people?

26:28.560 --> 26:29.560
Good question.

26:29.560 --> 26:33.200
So go create an account at matrix.org if you don't have a Matrix account already.

26:33.200 --> 26:38.080
And then our server is just jupiterbroadcasting.com, so you'll search it up and I'll put a link

26:38.080 --> 26:39.080
in the show notes.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.080
So once you have an account, you click it.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.080
It'll take you right to our system.

26:41.080 --> 26:42.080
It is slick.

26:42.080 --> 26:47.480
You just first have to get an account and we have closed accounts on JB, although if

26:47.480 --> 26:49.860
you wanted to wait a little bit, we could probably get you one.

26:49.860 --> 26:53.960
But we have account creation closed on the JB server for the time being just to kind

26:53.960 --> 26:55.720
of keep things under control.

26:55.720 --> 26:58.120
I mean, can I send them pictures of snow leopards?

26:58.120 --> 26:59.120
Yeah, definitely.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.120
Yeah, definitely.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.120
It supports markdown, too.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.440
So you could even have bullet points about snow leopard.

27:03.440 --> 27:07.880
OK, well, that's really all I care about.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.560
Linode.com slash coder.

27:09.560 --> 27:13.400
Go there to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there

27:13.400 --> 27:14.760
to support the show.

27:14.760 --> 27:18.440
You guys know the Linodes where we've built everything for the last two and a half going

27:18.440 --> 27:22.160
on two point seven years.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.160
I love it.

27:23.160 --> 27:27.480
I mean, I just don't see myself building anywhere else because Linode strikes the balance right

27:27.480 --> 27:34.320
with performance, with price, with support and honestly for us, flexibility.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.840
Sometimes I just want to do a one click deployment with like an Ubuntu box and Docker or Debian

27:37.840 --> 27:41.760
and Docker and sometimes I want to build it up from scratch and they let me do that full

27:41.760 --> 27:42.760
range.

27:42.760 --> 27:48.440
When I needed to do some crazy custom Linux distro for a VPN setup I had, it was no problem.

27:48.440 --> 27:52.440
You know, Linode's been rolling out upgrades the entire time I've been a customer, too,

27:52.440 --> 27:55.760
which is pretty damn impressive when you consider they're nearly 19 years old, but yet they're

27:55.760 --> 28:00.240
still investing, they're still improving, they're staying competitive.

28:00.240 --> 28:03.320
While they're 30 to 50 percent cheaper than those hyperscalers that want to lock into

28:03.320 --> 28:06.920
their crazy platforms, MVME was a game changer for us.

28:06.920 --> 28:10.800
But I think the biggest thing for us is going to be this managed database service they offer

28:10.800 --> 28:11.800
now.

28:11.800 --> 28:15.760
Started back in May with MySQL, but now they've expanded it to Postgres and Mongo.

28:15.760 --> 28:20.320
And this week, and I'll have a link in the show notes, they released a guide to migrate

28:20.320 --> 28:25.000
your Postgres existing database to the managed database system.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
This to me is a no-brainer.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.360
I mean, JB has been and can run and manage our own databases.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.360
We absolutely have.

28:31.360 --> 28:34.440
Probably one of our most active databases now is our matrix server database.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.540
Pretty crazy.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.320
But why not defer to Linode's expertise?

28:39.320 --> 28:42.800
Their infrastructure, their people that know how to run this kind of stuff.

28:42.800 --> 28:46.040
And I can also reorganize some of our Linodes as a result of this, too.

28:46.040 --> 28:49.040
So there's going to be optimizations in that regard.

28:49.040 --> 28:52.840
So it's just a great opportunity if you need a MySQL, Mongo, or Postgres database and you

28:52.840 --> 28:56.920
want somebody that's a real expert to just take care of that back end for you so your

28:56.920 --> 28:57.920
database just works.

28:57.920 --> 28:58.920
It's database as a service.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.880
It's here and it's at Linode.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.380
So get started by going to linode.com slash coder.

29:03.380 --> 29:05.120
Get that hundred bucks.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.560
Try out the database as a service.

29:06.560 --> 29:09.640
Try out deploying a super fast rig or a value rig.

29:09.640 --> 29:12.580
I mean, with a hundred dollars, you can really kick the tires and try it.

29:12.580 --> 29:14.040
That's confidence on Linode's part.

29:14.040 --> 29:15.360
They know you're going to like it.

29:15.360 --> 29:18.320
And it's just a great way to learn something and support the show.

29:18.320 --> 29:23.560
linode.com slash coder.

29:23.560 --> 29:29.260
So GitHub Copilot has launched and it is 10 bucks a month.

29:29.260 --> 29:32.920
And I'm flying with my drunken robotic friend.

29:32.920 --> 29:33.940
You signed up.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.480
You actually signed up.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.980
I paid for a year.

29:36.980 --> 29:40.360
And this is the dumbest pair programming partner I've ever had.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.360
You went right in.

29:41.360 --> 29:46.400
How did you go from this is horrible and going to get me in legal trouble to here's a year

29:46.400 --> 29:48.520
of subscription.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.320
How did you make that jump?

29:51.320 --> 29:57.240
My stepdaughter is a Gen Z. She's 14 and she introduced me to the phrase YOLO.

29:57.240 --> 29:58.600
And you know what?

29:58.600 --> 30:05.720
If there's anything that our friend Alex listening to all the CoderRadios might learn, I seem

30:05.720 --> 30:07.720
to without saying it be very YOLO.

30:07.720 --> 30:08.720
And you know what?

30:08.720 --> 30:10.720
I wanted to see how good this Codepilot is.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.120
Let me tell you something.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.120
It's pretty fucking bad.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.120
Really?

30:14.120 --> 30:16.840
Is it pretty, but is it like dumb?

30:16.840 --> 30:17.840
Just like bad code?

30:17.840 --> 30:20.440
It's like the drunkest junior developer I've ever met.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.560
And let me tell you something.

30:21.560 --> 30:27.400
Having been a very drunk junior developer myself in the past, I don't understand what

30:27.400 --> 30:28.400
I paid for.

30:28.400 --> 30:32.680
Well, they describe it as a coworker who might need a little review.

30:32.680 --> 30:35.960
That's what you paid for, according to Microsoft.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.360
So you're saying it's not actually like a coworker.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.840
I'm saying don't, don't do it.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.440
The other problem I would have with it is not only is it not going to give you very

30:44.440 --> 30:49.560
good suggestions, but couldn't it be putting you into some kind of potential legal ambiguity?

30:49.560 --> 30:54.240
No, because the only thing I'm using it for is a video game I'm running for my son.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.600
Well, I can't say video game.

30:55.600 --> 31:01.800
It's a Minecraft mod because my son has very sadly picked up the Pokemon problem, but he

31:01.800 --> 31:03.720
wasn't happy with just regular drugs.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.920
He had to go to f***ing Fentanyl.

31:05.920 --> 31:08.360
And when I say Fentanyl, I mean Minecraft.

31:08.360 --> 31:11.340
Yeah, boy, that is, that is the good stuff.

31:11.340 --> 31:13.400
And now he wants to code some mods.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.400
Yep.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.400
That's always the direction it goes.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.400
Been there.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.400
Been there.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.120
Have fun in the dot Minecraft directory.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.920
You'll be in there for years.

31:20.920 --> 31:21.920
I'm super curious.

31:21.920 --> 31:24.840
How do I get a Minecraft mod on the Xbox S?

31:24.840 --> 31:25.840
Is that even possible?

31:25.840 --> 31:26.840
Oh, no.

31:26.840 --> 31:27.840
No, you got to buy.

31:27.840 --> 31:28.840
That's bedrock edition.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.440
And you can only, you can just buy those mods.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.440
You don't get to actually do those mods.

31:32.440 --> 31:33.760
Only the Java edition.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.760
Can you actually.

31:34.760 --> 31:35.760
So I have to buy another.

31:35.760 --> 31:40.840
Well, I used to have a license, although God knows where it is to the Java Linux edition

31:40.840 --> 31:41.880
on my old.

31:41.880 --> 31:42.880
But we're going back.

31:42.880 --> 31:46.880
I mean, this is like Coder Radio episode six, right?

31:46.880 --> 31:50.360
We're going way back when I played around Minecraft.

31:50.360 --> 31:54.080
You might as a Xbox, if you bought it on the Xbox, you might get access to both if you

31:54.080 --> 31:56.620
log into the Xbox account on the on the web.

31:56.620 --> 32:01.360
So if anybody is looking for some intern work doing some Java and Kotlin development.

32:01.360 --> 32:06.040
So you know, before we get off Copilot completely, I thought this was a poignant tweet.

32:06.040 --> 32:10.140
Senior oops engineer on Twitter wrote GitHub Copilot is incredible.

32:10.140 --> 32:12.680
It just sells code other people wrote.

32:12.680 --> 32:17.280
But because it's an A.I., it apparently is allowed to launder that code without being

32:17.280 --> 32:19.500
a, quote, derivative work.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.320
What an amazing grift.

32:22.320 --> 32:27.760
And your your buddy, Drew DeVault, not Drew, our editor, but Drew DeVault said that free

32:27.760 --> 32:32.320
software licenses impose obligations on the user in terms of governing attribution, sub

32:32.320 --> 32:37.680
licensing, distribution, patents, trademarks, relationships and with relationships like

32:37.680 --> 32:42.180
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and GitHub's Copilot is trained on software governed by

32:42.180 --> 32:47.640
these terms, he writes, and it fails to uphold them and enables customers to accidentally

32:47.640 --> 32:50.200
fail to uphold these terms themselves.

32:50.200 --> 32:54.980
Essentially, the argument comes down to whether or not the model constitutes derivative works

32:54.980 --> 32:56.840
of its inputs.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.760
Microsoft argues it does not.

32:58.760 --> 33:06.360
However, these licenses are not specific regarding the means of derivation or derivation.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.360
So essentially the licenses don't say this is a derivative or this is not.

33:09.360 --> 33:11.040
They just say any derivative.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.920
And so Microsoft is attempting to kind of walk that line.

33:13.920 --> 33:19.120
But Drew argues that it's kind of clear since these licenses are not specific and essentially

33:19.120 --> 33:20.560
are meaning any kind of derivative.

33:20.560 --> 33:21.560
Any terrified work.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.560
Right.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.560
There you go.

33:23.560 --> 33:24.560
Is that a word?

33:24.560 --> 33:25.560
I don't know.

33:25.560 --> 33:26.560
Derived.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.560
Yeah.

33:27.560 --> 33:28.560
Derived.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.560
Derived.

33:29.560 --> 33:30.560
Derived.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.560
There you go.

33:31.560 --> 33:32.560
Derived is it.

33:32.560 --> 33:33.560
Yeah, I said it wrong.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.560
It just doesn't work.

33:34.560 --> 33:35.560
So who cares?

33:35.560 --> 33:38.320
It seems like today's problem.

33:38.320 --> 33:42.080
Like if anything, isn't the problem actually once this thing works, which probably isn't

33:42.080 --> 33:43.080
inevitable.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.560
I mean, I've been spending, what, 10 years now.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.520
Oh, hey, happy anniversary, my love.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.920
It was in June when we started.

33:49.920 --> 33:50.920
Wow.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.280
We just blew right past that.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.280
How about that?

33:53.280 --> 33:54.280
We missed it.

33:54.280 --> 33:58.840
But, you know, I've been bitching and people have been yelling at me that I say open source

33:58.840 --> 34:03.940
needs to be paid for and it shouldn't be free as in beer, it should be if you believe in

34:03.940 --> 34:07.920
free as in freedom, you got to get that, got to get the couple of shekels, you got to get

34:07.920 --> 34:09.720
some money.

34:09.720 --> 34:13.320
But when you don't do that, this is what happens and I don't know.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.320
I don't know.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.960
To me, it's like knocking the milk carton off the table and crying that there's milk

34:16.960 --> 34:17.960
on the floor.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.680
So why did you pay for a year of it?

34:19.680 --> 34:22.800
I was DMing with Linux users.

34:22.800 --> 34:23.800
I was, I don't know.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.920
I mean, I actually am kind of glad you did because, you know, we get some real hands

34:26.920 --> 34:27.920
on.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.180
No, no one's glad I did.

34:29.180 --> 34:30.180
Let me tell you something.

34:30.180 --> 34:31.180
All right.

34:31.180 --> 34:34.040
I'm going to tell you about the game I'm writing for Minecraft.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.040
We're doing two things.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.800
We're doing a game in Unity, which I hate Unity.

34:37.800 --> 34:41.400
So we're probably just going to do it in monogame, which is for folks who don't know X name.

34:41.400 --> 34:45.240
I'm basically trying to teach my son programming, right?

34:45.240 --> 34:51.680
So that's all C sharp, but it doesn't even match the style of your code correctly.

34:51.680 --> 34:53.600
It's really sloppy.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.800
Like it's, I thought it would help him.

34:56.800 --> 34:59.800
I put it on the laptop that he and I work on together.

34:59.800 --> 35:06.400
I honestly thought it would be something for, you know, he's six, right?

35:06.400 --> 35:08.880
So if he's struggling, I don't want him to feel bad.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.260
I know it's hard.

35:10.260 --> 35:13.900
C sharp is a gigantic language, frankly.

35:13.900 --> 35:16.320
It's not a good language like objective C.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.320
I do now.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.320
I mean, I have been for weeks.

35:18.320 --> 35:19.320
Are you kidding?

35:19.320 --> 35:20.920
I mean, you've trained me now.

35:20.920 --> 35:25.080
Well, but it's, there's like a lot of stuff, like for instance, string.

35:25.080 --> 35:28.000
How many ways are there to concatenate a string?

35:28.000 --> 35:30.760
And objective C zero, because you shouldn't be doing it.

35:30.760 --> 35:31.760
Sorry.

35:31.760 --> 35:32.760
There's actually a number of ways.

35:32.760 --> 35:33.760
I'm being a dick.

35:33.760 --> 35:34.760
I don't know.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.920
I thought copilot could help the kid out.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.160
And all we're doing is we have something working.

35:39.160 --> 35:43.280
It's the little dude jumps from platform to platform.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.880
It's very more ghetto Mario S you know, it's good.

35:46.880 --> 35:52.640
And then we tried a Minecraft Moz, which I now understand why that doesn't work.

35:52.640 --> 35:57.960
The problem is the kid is very eager to hit tab and just like let it auto complete nonsense.

35:57.960 --> 35:59.200
Yeah, I would be too.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.600
We accidentally got a barometer in the game somehow.

36:02.600 --> 36:03.600
Yeah.

36:03.600 --> 36:04.600
Oh man.

36:04.600 --> 36:05.600
Yeah.

36:05.600 --> 36:06.600
Okay.

36:06.600 --> 36:11.520
Well, I mean, I'd be curious if you checked back in with it in like six months to see

36:11.520 --> 36:12.520
if it's gotten any better.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.480
Cause that's my fear is it actually gets good.

36:14.480 --> 36:18.640
I'm hoping he just gets better and starts running Fedora like a real man.

36:18.640 --> 36:19.640
Oh God.

36:19.640 --> 36:25.320
Speaking of.net and whatnot, I just wanted to mention that friend of the show, Jeffrey

36:25.320 --> 36:29.520
Snover, who they called me down to Microsoft, we had, I think we were critical about something

36:29.520 --> 36:30.880
and they wanted to chat with us.

36:30.880 --> 36:34.840
And so they invited me down there and I did an interview with Jeffrey and they let me

36:34.840 --> 36:39.360
talk to anybody I wanted with the recorder on that, you know, didn't hide anything.

36:39.360 --> 36:43.760
And it was really great because I got a real genuine insight into the transition Microsoft

36:43.760 --> 36:46.520
went through over the last seven years.

36:46.520 --> 36:48.600
And Jeffrey was a big part of that.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.040
Really big part of that.

36:50.040 --> 36:54.280
Jeffrey was also critical in Microsoft's adoption of PowerShell.

36:54.280 --> 36:57.180
In Microsoft looking at the data center in a different way.

36:57.180 --> 37:01.240
In Microsoft looking at the data center possibly from a command line first perspective instead

37:01.240 --> 37:02.440
of gooey in the data center.

37:02.440 --> 37:03.440
Oh yeah.

37:03.440 --> 37:04.440
Yeah.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.600
And also just a lot of Linux adoption and open source culture adoption.

37:06.600 --> 37:13.600
So Jeffrey tweeted about four hours ago as we record, after 22 awesome years at Microsoft,

37:13.600 --> 37:18.840
18 of which were awesome in a good way, it's time for me to try something new.

37:18.840 --> 37:19.840
So he's moving on.

37:19.840 --> 37:23.160
His last day will be Friday, July 1st from Microsoft.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.760
And I think he's a friend of the open source community, he's a friend of the show and he

37:25.760 --> 37:30.120
tweeted a fantastic video that I played a little bit on our pre-show, which will be

37:30.120 --> 37:35.520
up on Jupiter.tube of the process he had to go through to convince Microsoft to make some

37:35.520 --> 37:36.520
of these transitions.

37:36.520 --> 37:40.760
And that's why he said here, 18 plus of which were awesome in a good way.

37:40.760 --> 37:43.560
There was a few years that weren't so great and he talks about those in the video that

37:43.560 --> 37:44.560
I played in the pre-show.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.200
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.480
So anyways, just wanted to say congratulations to Jeffrey.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.480
Yes, congratulations.

37:50.480 --> 37:51.480
That's fabulous.

37:51.480 --> 37:55.240
I mean, it's on to good and better and greater things.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.240
I am sure.

37:56.240 --> 38:00.560
I'm sure someone maybe or maybe, maybe he's just going to take it easy for a while.

38:00.560 --> 38:01.600
That's what I hope he does.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.600
He's definitely earned it.

38:02.600 --> 38:03.600
You know what?

38:03.600 --> 38:05.200
I just want to say we should all retire.

38:05.200 --> 38:10.720
Yeah, I had a real realization that every show I do comes with a serious cost to my

38:10.720 --> 38:11.720
health.

38:11.720 --> 38:14.040
So is it me coughing up a lung that's making you realize that?

38:14.040 --> 38:17.440
No, this show really, I think this show probably has the least cost to my health.

38:17.440 --> 38:21.960
It's probably, it's, we've done, we've been doing this for so long, you know, like it's

38:21.960 --> 38:22.960
easy.

38:22.960 --> 38:26.600
But all the other shows, like they take so much damn work, not that this show doesn't

38:26.600 --> 38:31.240
take work, but relatively speaking, you know, it doesn't, it's not the same kind of work.

38:31.240 --> 38:32.880
It's a different, it's a much more stressful work.

38:32.880 --> 38:33.880
Well, you know why?

38:33.880 --> 38:39.760
Cause this is a, your co-host on the show is a gentleman who every once in a while shows

38:39.760 --> 38:40.760
uploaded.

38:40.760 --> 38:41.760
It's happened.

38:41.760 --> 38:46.240
And then you got to walk them through it and get it, get them the fuck off the air.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.240
Yeah.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.240
That's not so bad though.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.800
I mean, really it could be worse.

38:49.800 --> 38:50.960
He could be talking about BSD.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.680
Oh, that's really all I was going for.

38:52.680 --> 38:53.680
Yeah.

38:53.680 --> 38:54.680
That gets that.

38:54.680 --> 38:57.200
That's where it gets rough.

38:57.200 --> 38:59.440
TailScale.com slash coder.

38:59.440 --> 39:03.760
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and of course you're supporting

39:03.760 --> 39:04.760
the show.

39:04.760 --> 39:10.460
If you haven't heard, TailScale is a zero config VPN and installs on any device in minutes.

39:10.460 --> 39:11.800
It takes care of firewall rules.

39:11.800 --> 39:19.000
It manages NAT, including the dreaded double carrier NAT, which I have to contend with.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.500
Devices connect directly to each other using WireGuard's noise protocol encryption, building

39:23.500 --> 39:28.160
a mesh network using the best VPN security in the business.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.840
I absolutely love this invention.

39:30.840 --> 39:34.960
I knew years ago when WireGuard was getting work done that we'd see products like this,

39:34.960 --> 39:39.060
but I just didn't picture something as simple and straightforward as TailScale.

39:39.060 --> 39:41.280
They have this really awesome process.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.960
You're going to get just about any device up and running in minutes.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.920
I've got it on my mobile devices.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.480
I have it on my Raspberry Pis.

39:47.480 --> 39:48.920
I've got it in my VMs.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.420
I've got it on my NixOS machine.

39:51.420 --> 39:54.920
Every NixOS machine I install, installs with TailScale.

39:54.920 --> 39:57.360
It's so simple to just add it in there too.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.960
And of course I love that it's backed by WireGuard.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.360
That's the genius of it.

40:01.360 --> 40:05.920
And if you want to use an enterprise with your single sign on and using two factor authentication,

40:05.920 --> 40:07.580
supports all of that.

40:07.580 --> 40:10.840
And I love that the TailScale VPN is always on.

40:10.840 --> 40:14.040
And it's intelligent about the way it routes traffic too, so you're not just accidentally

40:14.040 --> 40:16.520
sending everything over the TailScale interface.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.980
It's really smart about what it routes over there.

40:18.980 --> 40:22.040
And now all my machines have a static IP regardless of where I'm at.

40:22.040 --> 40:25.560
So if I need to get to a service or if I need SSH in or if I need to copy a file, this kind

40:25.560 --> 40:29.100
of stuff happens all the time, especially when I'm traveling, but it just happens between

40:29.100 --> 40:31.160
home and the office constantly too.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.520
TailScale solves it.

40:32.520 --> 40:36.520
TailScale solves it in a way that almost nothing solved it before.

40:36.520 --> 40:40.320
And it's so simple and straightforward to use and you can get it for free up to 20 devices

40:40.320 --> 40:41.920
and support the show.

40:41.920 --> 40:46.440
So get started right now by going to TailScale.com slash coder.

40:46.440 --> 40:50.240
Get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and support the show.

40:50.240 --> 40:55.320
TailScale.com slash coder.

40:55.320 --> 41:02.760
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.760
That's right.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.400
We got some boosts to get to here.

41:05.400 --> 41:08.560
The Golden Dragon boosted in seven days ago with a row of ducks.

41:08.560 --> 41:09.560
I'm a duck.

41:09.560 --> 41:12.560
I'm a UK duck loaded with talent.

41:12.560 --> 41:13.560
Money's tight right now.

41:13.560 --> 41:16.800
I hope I can eventually find a dev one on the secondary for a decent price.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.880
I recently got ahold of some Python books.

41:18.880 --> 41:19.880
Don't worry.

41:19.880 --> 41:22.480
I drink all the time and buy them every two days.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.800
Just DM me.

41:23.800 --> 41:24.800
You'll be fine.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.800
It may need a new keyboard, but it'll be fine.

41:27.800 --> 41:30.960
I recently got ahold of some Python books to learn with.

41:30.960 --> 41:31.960
Anything I should be aware of.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.840
Boy, if you were starting a Python journey.

41:33.840 --> 41:34.840
You know what my man?

41:34.840 --> 41:35.840
DM me.

41:35.840 --> 41:41.520
I'm going to send you some more stuff and a couple TMB swag and Chris, with your permission,

41:41.520 --> 41:43.560
I have some vintage coder swag.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.680
Ooh, do it dude.

41:44.680 --> 41:46.240
I'm talking green coder.

41:46.240 --> 41:47.720
Remember the old green logo?

41:47.720 --> 41:50.800
I found it in a box from when I got divorced.

41:50.800 --> 41:56.400
The bottom of a box, I have a whole pile of them of the old coasters and some of the stickers

41:56.400 --> 41:57.720
yet.

41:57.720 --> 42:00.800
The first ones.

42:00.800 --> 42:04.800
Although time has been cruel, so I would not trust these on like any tables that you care

42:04.800 --> 42:05.800
about.

42:05.800 --> 42:07.160
I don't know, man.

42:07.160 --> 42:08.160
I still use a couple of them.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.160
They still work.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.160
I have one on my desk.

42:10.160 --> 42:13.800
I thought it was the last one that I looked and I have like, I have like 50 of them.

42:13.800 --> 42:14.800
There you go.

42:14.800 --> 42:15.800
So yeah, man.

42:15.800 --> 42:16.800
DM me.

42:16.800 --> 42:17.800
I'll get you some stuff.

42:17.800 --> 42:18.800
There you go, Dragon.

42:18.800 --> 42:19.800
That's awesome.

42:19.800 --> 42:20.800
All right.

42:20.800 --> 42:26.680
Marcel boosted in seven days ago with a discounted row of ducks, 222 sats says, I love the sci-fi

42:26.680 --> 42:27.680
section.

42:27.680 --> 42:28.680
Talk about my love.

42:28.680 --> 42:29.680
We must.

42:29.680 --> 42:30.840
Would love to watch The Expanse too.

42:30.840 --> 42:31.840
If I can find it.

42:31.840 --> 42:32.840
I've heard so many great things.

42:32.840 --> 42:33.840
Thanks for the recommendation.

42:33.840 --> 42:35.840
It's on Amazon, Amazon prime, if you have that.

42:35.840 --> 42:36.840
The Expanse.

42:36.840 --> 42:37.840
I'm sorry.

42:37.840 --> 42:41.440
We got some emails in there like Mike's got to watch this and you know it, you saw it,

42:41.440 --> 42:42.440
you know it.

42:42.440 --> 42:44.800
I know it, but I saw something else.

42:44.800 --> 42:50.680
My beloved leathered out, armed with a bow and arrow, you have no idea what I'm talking

42:50.680 --> 42:51.680
about.

42:51.680 --> 42:53.680
I'm thinking like Xena, Hercules.

42:53.680 --> 42:59.500
No, this is, this is the new, the Star Trek, Strange New Worlds, they did a fantasy edition

42:59.500 --> 43:04.440
and she was like a ranger and she being a first officer.

43:04.440 --> 43:05.560
Number, what's your name?

43:05.560 --> 43:06.800
Rachel Romay.

43:06.800 --> 43:10.080
Is that, is that her name, Marissa Romay?

43:10.080 --> 43:14.040
I refuse to acknowledge that I don't remember her name cause I feel like I'll get canceled.

43:14.040 --> 43:16.720
But it's Oona, it's, it's Oona on Strange New Worlds.

43:16.720 --> 43:17.720
Yeah.

43:17.720 --> 43:18.720
You got a, you got a real Oona thing going.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.280
If you know, you always do.

43:20.280 --> 43:21.440
You like a powerful women.

43:21.440 --> 43:22.440
I can tell.

43:22.440 --> 43:23.440
I am suffering.

43:23.440 --> 43:24.440
My fiance is very powerful.

43:24.440 --> 43:25.940
She's very angry.

43:25.940 --> 43:32.420
I mean that in a general way and, but there's president Rosalind, which, listen, the Cylons

43:32.420 --> 43:38.480
were, were dicks, like fighting the Cylons, you know, it's, it's something, but Oona,

43:38.480 --> 43:39.480
we should move on.

43:39.480 --> 43:40.480
You need to go.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.040
She got the command presence.

43:42.040 --> 43:43.040
All right.

43:43.040 --> 43:47.880
Space Ninja boosted in with also a row of ducks, 2,222 sats.

43:47.880 --> 43:48.880
Oh, thank you.

43:48.880 --> 43:49.880
Thank you very much.

43:49.880 --> 43:52.000
And here's something for your trouble.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.160
Adam is dead.

43:53.160 --> 43:54.160
Long live Adam.

43:54.160 --> 43:56.280
I guess I'm switching back to Vim.

43:56.280 --> 43:57.280
That's hardcore dude.

43:57.280 --> 44:02.320
Wait, you're going from Electron editor to Vim.

44:02.320 --> 44:03.320
That's what I thought.

44:03.320 --> 44:04.320
I'm like, well, but.

44:04.320 --> 44:05.320
I love you.

44:05.320 --> 44:06.320
Go with it.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.040
But don't, don't stop at Vim.

44:08.040 --> 44:09.040
Let's talk about Emacs.

44:09.040 --> 44:15.300
I, I, Father, bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

44:15.300 --> 44:18.800
It's been probably a week since my last confession at this point.

44:18.800 --> 44:19.800
Yeah.

44:19.800 --> 44:20.800
Well, let's see.

44:20.800 --> 44:21.800
It's been about one week since we've done the show.

44:21.800 --> 44:22.800
So.

44:22.800 --> 44:23.800
Yeah.

44:23.800 --> 44:27.320
I used to be an Emacs user until I got my first job doing high OS dev.

44:27.320 --> 44:31.600
I opened up, uh, Oh my God, what's the Mac version of Emacs called?

44:31.600 --> 44:32.600
It has a name.

44:32.600 --> 44:35.840
Are you thinking of BB edit or are you thinking of no, no, it's actually Emacs.

44:35.840 --> 44:36.840
Oh, you know what?

44:36.840 --> 44:37.840
I'm just going to look this up.

44:37.840 --> 44:38.840
Cause this is Emacs.

44:38.840 --> 44:39.840
You've got Emacs on the man.

44:39.840 --> 44:40.840
It's not just Emacs.

44:40.840 --> 44:44.760
It's a, is it some BSD like non canoe version?

44:44.760 --> 44:45.760
Yeah.

44:45.760 --> 44:48.480
No, there's some Mac version.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.480
It's a gooey.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.480
Yeah.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.480
Yeah.

44:51.480 --> 44:52.480
Yeah.

44:52.480 --> 44:53.480
Of course.

44:53.480 --> 44:54.480
Yeah.

44:54.480 --> 44:55.480
Okay.

44:55.480 --> 44:56.480
Okay.

44:56.480 --> 44:57.480
Apparently that's old school.

44:57.480 --> 44:58.480
We're going back like 15 years, but I'm with you.

44:58.480 --> 44:59.480
I'm with you.

44:59.480 --> 45:00.480
Okay.

45:00.480 --> 45:01.480
Whatever.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.480
So it's a Darwin, Darwin, max, the Emacs.

45:02.480 --> 45:03.480
Okay.

45:03.480 --> 45:05.240
Well, we don't call things Darwin anymore.

45:05.240 --> 45:08.040
You know, that's not a thing that we don't talk about Darwin anymore.

45:08.040 --> 45:09.040
You know what?

45:09.040 --> 45:10.040
Say the name.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.720
That's all I'm just going to say.

45:11.720 --> 45:14.880
Space Ninja does say that he's excited to see what the Adam creator has planned next.

45:14.880 --> 45:16.720
Wasn't that going to be like a rust based?

45:16.720 --> 45:20.880
I've been using warp warp scrape, but I'm not going to like let someone have telemetry

45:20.880 --> 45:22.320
in my terminal.

45:22.320 --> 45:26.280
But that seems like a bad plan anyway.

45:26.280 --> 45:28.800
So Emacs, I open up Emacs per se on the job.

45:28.800 --> 45:32.000
I'm a, I'm a brand new iOS developer.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
The world is great.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.800
I'm in Chelsea, New York.

45:34.800 --> 45:38.880
I can't even afford a beer downstairs cause I didn't know I was getting ripped off.

45:38.880 --> 45:39.880
I open Emacs.

45:39.880 --> 45:40.880
My boss comes over to me.

45:40.880 --> 45:41.880
Who's the CTO?

45:41.880 --> 45:43.360
Which tells you how small the company was.

45:43.360 --> 45:44.360
Yeah.

45:44.360 --> 45:46.760
And he says, are you kidding me?

45:46.760 --> 45:47.760
I said, what?

45:47.760 --> 45:48.760
What did I do wrong?

45:48.760 --> 45:49.760
Day one.

45:49.760 --> 45:51.800
Oh my God.

45:51.800 --> 45:55.400
Get that off my machine right now.

45:55.400 --> 45:57.720
And from that day forward, I was a FEMM user.

45:57.720 --> 45:58.720
Wow.

45:58.720 --> 45:59.720
Yeah.

45:59.720 --> 46:03.120
I had a, yeah, I've had a, when I was a young lad in IT, I had a rough, somebody came up

46:03.120 --> 46:08.400
as I was spooling ethernet cable and basically had a freak out about how poor my spooling

46:08.400 --> 46:11.760
gave me a whole tear, tore me down over my spooling ethernet.

46:11.760 --> 46:14.400
There are no multi-line comments.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.000
I learned that one the hard way.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Oh.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Ooh.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Ooh.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
All right.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.480
So Eric, seven days ago with 15,000 sats, boost.

46:25.480 --> 46:29.680
Now he says, Mosh is for if the internet is crappy.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.560
It's a Tmux session for bad connections.

46:31.560 --> 46:35.760
And David actually wrote into the show this week too and said, I recommend Mosh on weak

46:35.760 --> 46:36.760
connections.

46:36.760 --> 46:42.600
I didn't mention it, but last week we were talking about bad connections and using Tmux.

46:42.600 --> 46:47.280
Mosh is the secret weapon for bad connectivity, cellular connectivity.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.440
It's great.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.440
It's great.

46:49.440 --> 46:53.940
One of the tricks, one of the tricks it does is it does a local echo back when you type

46:53.940 --> 46:58.440
to make it look like things are real super fast and it handles intermittent connectivity

46:58.440 --> 46:59.940
and all that kind of jazz.

46:59.940 --> 47:05.160
In my misguided youth, I once did a job for a company that I can't name, but let's just

47:05.160 --> 47:08.960
say they are down with both Mufasa and Lord of Vader.

47:08.960 --> 47:13.240
And yes, Mosh was part of the toolkit to see if they were getting responses.

47:13.240 --> 47:14.240
Yeah.

47:14.240 --> 47:17.160
And it rides on top of SSH, so you're still getting the security of SSH.

47:17.160 --> 47:20.880
See, and it's pretty much in every single distros repo.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.080
So it's really easy to get installed.

47:23.080 --> 47:26.240
It's also in homebrew if you're on the Macintosh.

47:26.240 --> 47:27.480
I really do recommend it.

47:27.480 --> 47:30.980
So both thank you to David and Eric for sending that in.

47:30.980 --> 47:39.200
And then we did get a thank you boost Freak sent in 8,472 sats to say thank you guys for

47:39.200 --> 47:40.200
the show.

47:40.200 --> 47:41.200
So thank you Freak.

47:41.200 --> 47:47.400
I think the worst part of this for me is I still don't understand what podcasting 2.0

47:47.400 --> 47:48.400
is.

47:48.400 --> 47:53.960
When I started talking about it, I was so focused on the boosts, but it's just an update

47:53.960 --> 47:59.480
to the RSS spec that allows for a standardized way to do things like alternative enclosures.

47:59.480 --> 48:03.200
You could do like Opus and MP3 transcripts.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.200
Whatever happened to AUG?

48:04.200 --> 48:05.200
Remember AUG?

48:05.200 --> 48:06.200
Yeah.

48:06.200 --> 48:10.280
AUG Vorbis was used quite a bit, but then the patents expired on MP3.

48:10.280 --> 48:14.360
And so everybody just kind of said, all right, well, now that the patent is just sort of

48:14.360 --> 48:21.120
cleared up, it just went all MP3 to the point where a lot of the platforms that are in podcasting

48:21.120 --> 48:26.400
now like Spotify and iTunes and Google and et cetera, et cetera, they don't even allow

48:26.400 --> 48:27.760
you to upload an AUG file.

48:27.760 --> 48:28.760
You can't even do it.

48:28.760 --> 48:29.760
Really?

48:29.760 --> 48:31.080
They actually block it by the file type?

48:31.080 --> 48:32.080
Yeah.

48:32.080 --> 48:36.980
The services don't even, they don't even recognize it as a valid file format.

48:36.980 --> 48:41.880
So podcasting 2.0 is like taking a lot of these things that different vendors had kind

48:41.880 --> 48:46.660
of modified the RSS spec on their own, and it's just making a spec out of it that application

48:46.660 --> 48:47.660
developers can follow.

48:47.660 --> 48:53.160
And so there's a handful of new podcast apps over at newpodcastapps.com that support these

48:53.160 --> 48:54.160
specs.

48:54.160 --> 48:59.920
A real time update, apparently beer, pretzel, sausage, and a tour are on Alex.

48:59.920 --> 49:01.540
So Whoa, dude.

49:01.540 --> 49:05.720
You know, but then we got to actually get together in person in real life.

49:05.720 --> 49:09.440
You and I will never meet, so you'll go to Berlin, I'll go to Munich.

49:09.440 --> 49:10.440
We'll divide and conquer.

49:10.440 --> 49:11.440
Conquer in Europe?

49:11.440 --> 49:14.240
See, I'm not sure that I would use.

49:14.240 --> 49:16.080
That was probably the wrong language.

49:16.080 --> 49:20.880
Although I do have a meeting with an uncle of mine who's very angry right now.

49:20.880 --> 49:21.880
Yeah.

49:21.880 --> 49:24.640
Is he very angry?

49:24.640 --> 49:30.560
I would say he is disappointed at the fall of the Soviet Union.

49:30.560 --> 49:34.080
Very disappointed comrade.

49:34.080 --> 49:39.960
I remember when we were great, I was young intelligence officer, I might have taken car

49:39.960 --> 49:44.400
battery to the balls of many Westerners.

49:44.400 --> 49:46.520
This is a we got a I'm sorry.

49:46.520 --> 49:47.520
I'm sorry.

49:47.520 --> 49:48.520
Yeah.

49:48.520 --> 49:49.520
I apologize for it.

49:49.520 --> 49:50.520
It's you know what?

49:50.520 --> 49:51.520
Drew loves you anyways.

49:51.520 --> 49:53.560
Are you know who else loves you is our members.

49:53.560 --> 49:55.160
The coder QA crew.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.160
They do.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.160
They do.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.160
And you know what?

49:58.160 --> 49:59.160
I think we owe them a show next week.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.160
We do owe them.

50:00.160 --> 50:01.160
You're right.

50:01.160 --> 50:02.400
And the other thing I'm working on for them, although it's still in the it's in the plumbing

50:02.400 --> 50:08.020
phase, but I am working on getting them the much requested live feed so they can get the

50:08.020 --> 50:12.480
full raw live feed, which will probably make some of them cancel their membership.

50:12.480 --> 50:14.840
But it'll be available as an option along with the ad free.

50:14.840 --> 50:18.120
They can they can hear me choke and understand the heart disease.

50:18.120 --> 50:20.620
They can hear me manage you a little bit more.

50:20.620 --> 50:21.620
They can hear the swearing.

50:21.620 --> 50:23.440
The pre and post shows really why people like it.

50:23.440 --> 50:25.160
I think I'm less crazy.

50:25.160 --> 50:26.920
I'm just gonna say the recorded version.

50:26.920 --> 50:27.920
I sound less nuts.

50:27.920 --> 50:28.920
Yeah.

50:28.920 --> 50:29.920
Yeah.

50:29.920 --> 50:30.920
That's what we pay drew for.

50:30.920 --> 50:33.000
But you know what?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.700
Like some people, they that's why they tune in live, right?

50:35.700 --> 50:39.600
It's like the folks that like the live stream, but they just can't make it on Monday at noon

50:39.600 --> 50:40.600
Pacific 3 p.m.

50:40.600 --> 50:41.600
Eastern.

50:41.600 --> 50:42.600
Like that's like 90 percent of people.

50:42.600 --> 50:45.960
So I feel like you're defining unfiltered listeners right now.

50:45.960 --> 50:48.120
Maybe they're out there still.

50:48.120 --> 50:49.120
Hello you.

50:49.120 --> 50:50.120
But thank you to our members.

50:50.120 --> 50:52.920
If you'd like to become one to get access to the ad free version, the Coderly report

50:52.920 --> 50:56.340
that we do once a quarter and the live feed once it is available.

50:56.340 --> 51:00.360
That's all at Coder QA dot co or you can sign up to support the entire network at Jupiter

51:00.360 --> 51:01.360
dot party.

51:01.360 --> 51:04.600
Then you get all the bonus features for all the shows, be a pro.

51:04.600 --> 51:07.680
And I am I am working on Chris to get those ropes back.

51:07.680 --> 51:08.680
Yeah, you are.

51:08.680 --> 51:09.680
I love it.

51:09.680 --> 51:10.680
Where should we send people?

51:10.680 --> 51:12.240
You got you got like a URL.

51:12.240 --> 51:14.740
You got like a website, you know, these things that you can put up.

51:14.740 --> 51:17.080
There's this whole hypertext transport protocol.

51:17.080 --> 51:18.080
And then there's.

51:18.080 --> 51:19.080
Yeah.

51:19.080 --> 51:22.040
Well, it's really it's crazy, man, because then you can put like text.

51:22.040 --> 51:25.320
I would like to send to you one or nine and one or one one one.

51:25.320 --> 51:26.320
Yeah.

51:26.320 --> 51:27.320
OK, sure.

51:27.320 --> 51:28.320
And then you'll have like a text file.

51:28.320 --> 51:30.320
And if you end it like dot HTML, just add to it.

51:30.320 --> 51:32.520
Add that to go on Twitter.

51:32.520 --> 51:33.520
That's fine.

51:33.520 --> 51:34.520
Oh, OK.

51:34.520 --> 51:35.520
Easy.

51:35.520 --> 51:38.880
But that's not like a URL, man, like, you know, the web's going it's going to be a web

51:38.880 --> 51:39.880
of URLs.

51:39.880 --> 51:40.880
You got to check it out.

51:40.880 --> 51:41.880
All right.

51:41.880 --> 51:42.880
Fine.

51:42.880 --> 51:43.880
HTTPS, I guess.

51:43.880 --> 51:44.880
Alice Dot Def.

51:44.880 --> 51:45.880
There you go.

51:45.880 --> 51:46.880
Yeah, I like that.

51:46.880 --> 51:48.480
I'll plug Jupiter Tube.

51:48.480 --> 51:51.880
We are streaming Coder Radio at Jupiter Dot Tube.

51:51.880 --> 51:53.600
The live version gets archived there.

51:53.600 --> 51:56.780
It is a total free software streaming platform.

51:56.780 --> 51:59.880
It's like YouTube in a box, but it's peer to peer.

51:59.880 --> 52:00.880
So that's neat.

52:00.880 --> 52:01.880
And I'll mention it.

52:01.880 --> 52:02.880
Jupiter Dot Tube.

52:02.880 --> 52:03.880
If you want to check it out.

52:03.880 --> 52:04.880
And you can also catch live stream shows over there.

52:04.880 --> 52:08.640
Also, the links to what we talk about, the things here in this show that come up, things

52:08.640 --> 52:10.700
are available over on our websites.

52:10.700 --> 52:16.700
That's available at HTTPS and you put a colon in there slash slash Coder Dot Show and then

52:16.700 --> 52:22.540
slash WAC 472 and then you'll get links to what we talked about today.

52:22.540 --> 52:24.120
It's real super easy like that.

52:24.120 --> 52:28.960
Our contact form is over there as well at Coder Dot Show slash contact and our RSS feed

52:28.960 --> 52:31.800
that's a Coder Dot Show slash subscribe.

52:31.800 --> 52:33.740
Actually it's just Coder Dot Show slash RSS.

52:33.740 --> 52:35.120
It's really simple.

52:35.120 --> 52:36.120
It's super great.

52:36.120 --> 52:39.960
I mean, we can't make this much easier for you guys if you get this up.

52:39.960 --> 52:40.960
Not on us anymore.

52:40.960 --> 52:45.520
And also, I'm 100 percent sure I have whatever my son has because I just yeah, you're dying

52:45.520 --> 52:46.520
over there.

52:46.520 --> 52:47.520
Yeah.

52:47.520 --> 52:48.520
I hope you're all right.

52:48.520 --> 52:49.520
We'll check in on you.

52:49.520 --> 52:50.520
The worst part is I'm drinking tea and water right now.

52:50.520 --> 52:53.600
I if I'm going to do a bad show, I'd like to be drunk.

52:53.600 --> 52:54.600
Yeah.

52:54.600 --> 52:55.600
Well, maybe next week.

52:55.600 --> 52:56.600
There's always next week, man.

52:56.600 --> 52:57.600
Maybe.

52:57.600 --> 53:00.240
All right, everyone, thanks so much for doing this week's episode.

53:00.240 --> 53:28.680
We'll see you right back here next week, hopefully, if Mike doesn't die.
