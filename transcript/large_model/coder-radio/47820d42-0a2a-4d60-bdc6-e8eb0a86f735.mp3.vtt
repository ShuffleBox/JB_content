00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
This is KOTORadio, episode 442 for November 26.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.920
Hello friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:18.920 --> 00:23.840
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.880
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru, with a cloud guru you get that cloud

00:26.880 --> 00:31.820
playground, Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

00:31.820 --> 00:35.120
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.600
My name is Chris, and joining me stuffed full of turkey is our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:39.600 --> 00:40.600
Hello Mike.

00:40.600 --> 00:41.600
Oh, trip to fan.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.600
Isn't it something?

00:42.600 --> 00:43.600
It really is great.

00:43.600 --> 00:50.560
I mean, my favorite thing is if I do get a great post-meal nap, but as we record right

00:50.560 --> 00:53.680
now, I actually, I have not had my Thanksgiving meal yet.

00:53.680 --> 00:58.680
We're recording on a Friday, after Thanksgiving, a little early for us, and what I have done

00:58.680 --> 01:03.360
so far, and I'm curious if you've ever done this, is I just completed last night the test

01:03.360 --> 01:04.360
turkey.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.360
Do you ever do these test turkeys?

01:05.360 --> 01:06.800
No, what the hell is a test turkey?

01:06.800 --> 01:10.040
I know you're not a big testing guy, you know, but think of...

01:10.040 --> 01:15.560
Listen, I'm on a good clean show, no rabbit punches, no shots below the belt.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.560
Come on.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.560
All right.

01:17.560 --> 01:18.560
I'm sorry.

01:18.560 --> 01:19.560
I'm sorry.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.560
Especially so at the top, right?

01:20.560 --> 01:27.320
So I deployed my family as QA members, and we test out the same size turkey, the brine,

01:27.320 --> 01:31.360
and the cooking method that we're going to use that year, because unlike a sane person,

01:31.360 --> 01:33.080
I kind of change it up every year.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.300
Last year, I smoked the turkeys.

01:35.300 --> 01:39.600
This year, I want to oven roast them, but I don't want dry breast meat.

01:39.600 --> 01:45.680
So I wanted to get the full workflow worked out and tested before production day when

01:45.680 --> 01:46.980
family's around.

01:46.980 --> 01:51.360
So last night, we cooked up the turkey and deployed it to the children, and I collected

01:51.360 --> 01:55.780
their feedback and got their input, and I am actually going to make a few adjustments

01:55.780 --> 01:58.720
before the actual production turkey is deployed.

01:58.720 --> 02:04.020
Not only is it like reduces my anxiety about turkey day, but I never end up having enough

02:04.020 --> 02:08.040
turkey meat as it is, because for some reason, like the chef, you know, I never get to eat

02:08.040 --> 02:11.400
enough, and then everybody takes some home, right?

02:11.400 --> 02:13.840
So this way, I get enough turkey to make sandwiches.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.320
I also like that you have a turkey deployment system here.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.400
Oh, it's all we got it.

02:17.400 --> 02:21.200
You got to even monitor the timing of it, too, because I got to make sure that I repeat

02:21.200 --> 02:22.200
the brine window.

02:22.200 --> 02:28.020
I don't want to like over brine it or under brine it on production day.

02:28.020 --> 02:29.460
That's a big deal, right?

02:29.460 --> 02:31.320
And I'm also going to match the resting time.

02:31.320 --> 02:35.900
So I've kind of come up with a post oven resting strategy where the turkey will rest.

02:35.900 --> 02:39.040
Then I will actually kind of bring up the dependencies of the meal, like, you know,

02:39.040 --> 02:43.200
your green bean casserole and warm up the stuffing, get all of the meal dependencies

02:43.200 --> 02:47.000
figured out and ready to go, and then deploy everything at once.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Oh, my God.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
That's my strategy.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.080
You got to take this stuff seriously, man.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.720
So it's like a turkey continuous integration system there.

02:55.720 --> 02:56.720
Yeah, it definitely is.

02:56.720 --> 02:57.720
Yeah.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.080
Well, once about 2 p.m. hits, yeah.

03:00.080 --> 03:05.640
This is actually the first year in a long time I did not deep fry the turkey.

03:05.640 --> 03:10.720
And it's also, on a perhaps related note, the first year I haven't gotten burned.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.920
So I think I like roasting it.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.720
I think this was much less painful.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.720
It was a lot easier than smoking, too.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.120
You're hardcore with the smoking.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.120
Yeah.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.800
This year, a montage went around of everybody's turkey fryers catching on fire.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.960
And I thought, oh, let's go easy this year.

03:24.960 --> 03:25.960
Let's go easy.

03:25.960 --> 03:26.960
It's very good.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.880
I didn't try to fry it because I found out that the turkey was still par frozen in the

03:29.880 --> 03:30.880
middle.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.560
And had I put that in a vat of oil, it would have exploded for sure.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.320
Those two things do not like each other.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.320
Water and oil.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.320
All right.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.320
Well, so we have a batch.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.960
We have a batch of productivity tips.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.160
So you're welcome, everybody.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.800
By the time you're done listening to this episode, you're probably going to work faster,

03:44.800 --> 03:46.680
make money faster, and probably owe it all to us.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.580
So you are welcome.

03:48.580 --> 03:51.160
Your deal for this show on Black Friday is you get a bunch of great tips.

03:51.160 --> 03:55.700
And Jose wrote in essentially saying, for the love of God, use a clipboard manager.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.080
You got to use a clipboard manager.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.600
There's a bunch of options out there for Windows.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.160
I use Ditto.

04:01.160 --> 04:06.480
And for Mac OS, I recently started using Maccy, M-A-C-C-Y.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.200
Ditto for Windows looks really nice because the Windows clipboard is obviously very basic.

04:10.200 --> 04:15.040
But you add this little gem on there, you're pretty much rocking a power clipboard.

04:15.040 --> 04:19.720
And this is something that I think us Plasma desktop users often take for granted.

04:19.720 --> 04:23.320
This comes built into the Plasma desktop, and it's a nice one, too.

04:23.320 --> 04:26.960
And I feel very limited when I'm on other desktop environments that don't have a clipboard

04:26.960 --> 04:27.960
manager.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.360
So it's just a real simple one right off the top.

04:30.360 --> 04:35.240
I also will admit that the clipboard manager, when I don't have one, is the thing that I

04:35.240 --> 04:37.620
tend to install after I've already needed it.

04:37.620 --> 04:41.960
When I've been in a situation where I'm like, ah, if I just had a clipboard manager, I would

04:41.960 --> 04:42.960
have that.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.480
And then I'm like, all right, I should go get one.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.320
And that's usually the point in which I install one on a Mac or if I'm, God forbid, on Windows.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.040
I have not gotten on the clipboard manager thing.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.820
Although I use, in Slack, you have that stupid account that's like your name.

04:54.820 --> 04:55.820
It's like you.

04:55.820 --> 04:56.820
Sure.

04:56.820 --> 04:57.880
I use that as a ghetto version.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.020
But I'm looking at this Maccy app.

05:00.020 --> 05:02.760
This seems like just a much better way to do this.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.480
Yeah, it's one of those things that as the more you use it, the more you realize how

05:06.480 --> 05:07.480
handy it is.

05:07.480 --> 05:11.000
Often you're like copying several things in order and you'd like to go back and get something

05:11.000 --> 05:13.280
or have a place to temporarily store something.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.280
Yeah, absolutely.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.560
Well, and you're writing code.

05:15.560 --> 05:16.560
It's all from Stack Overflow.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.560
So, right.

05:17.560 --> 05:18.560
Of course.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.560
Yeah.

05:19.560 --> 05:20.560
Yeah.

05:20.560 --> 05:25.080
You want to be able to go back a few Stack Overflows.

05:25.080 --> 05:31.360
Listener Michael says, I use an Elgato Stream Deck for development, not for streaming.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.840
So I recently got a Elgato Steam Deck and I also got it to work using the Steam Deck

05:34.840 --> 05:37.520
UI, which we'll have a link to that.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.760
He says it's great.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.240
I have buttons that launch programs.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.640
So I've dedicated buttons for programs and I've automated rather large test environment

05:43.640 --> 05:48.920
using a button and I fire one button off and half a dozen processes start up.

05:48.920 --> 05:52.120
It's everything I need to simulate the system I'm working on.

05:52.120 --> 05:57.000
Yeah, I could probably have made some sort of keyboard shortcut system in Gnome or something

05:57.000 --> 06:00.280
else, but I just prefer having dedicated buttons on my desk for these things.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.240
It saves me so much time and effort.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.000
Plus, if I ever do need to use OBS, it's great for that.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.440
The Elgato Stream Deck, I don't know if you've seen this, but it's this little box.

06:08.440 --> 06:12.240
It has like these little OLED screens on there and you assign each one of them a function

06:12.240 --> 06:14.240
on your machine.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.160
Now apparently it's working in Linux too.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.180
Thanks to some of the work of some friends of ours on the Mac and Windows, you could

06:19.180 --> 06:21.360
just use the Elgato software.

06:21.360 --> 06:26.360
I would be, I guess the term is remiss if I didn't mention how much Elgato has come

06:26.360 --> 06:27.960
up recently for different things.

06:27.960 --> 06:31.800
Elgato really seems to be getting a name out there for making pretty good products out

06:31.800 --> 06:32.800
there.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.600
So I would imagine the Stream Deck is probably one of those, not to be confused with the

06:35.600 --> 06:36.600
Steam Deck.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.360
Stream Deck, Steam Deck, two different things.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.200
One's a keyboard, one's a game console.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.720
Gab found a really useful bumper-like app for Linux.

06:45.720 --> 06:48.960
I've talked about it on Linux Unplugged before, it's called Junction.

06:48.960 --> 06:52.760
Bumper is the app that lets you choose which browser a link opens up in.

06:52.760 --> 06:56.800
Junction goes even further because it includes things like your default file manager, your

06:56.800 --> 06:59.840
default terminal, your web browser, all that kind of stuff.

06:59.840 --> 07:03.020
You can really take it to the next level as you'd expect with a Linux app.

07:03.020 --> 07:06.340
And so that is called Junction and it's on Flat Hub.

07:06.340 --> 07:08.080
Just go search for Junction.

07:08.080 --> 07:12.820
These are like little tools over the years that I've kind of just started to let myself

07:12.820 --> 07:13.820
use.

07:13.820 --> 07:18.180
I used to be a big, it's only the defaults and then deviate from there kind of guy.

07:18.180 --> 07:24.740
But in order to use GNOME or Mac OS or Windows, I've just sort of resigned myself to implementing

07:24.740 --> 07:26.740
a bunch of these kinds of tools.

07:26.740 --> 07:30.040
You can't use a Mac anymore, a new Mac with the notch.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.320
You can't use a new Mac without Bartender.

07:32.320 --> 07:36.360
If you do, I'm sorry, but you're just not going to see some of your icons.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.980
So there's little tools like this now or iStat menu.

07:39.980 --> 07:42.400
How the hell do you know what's going on on the Mac if you don't have iStat menu?

07:42.400 --> 07:43.400
You're going to launch activity?

07:43.400 --> 07:46.560
You don't because activity monitor is pretty much terrible.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.820
Yeah, it's awful.

07:48.820 --> 07:51.180
There's these kinds of things.

07:51.180 --> 07:55.560
Another one, like on the Mac, when you click on the calendar, you don't get a calendar.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.000
When you click on the clock, I mean in the menu bar, you don't get a calendar anymore.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.860
You get some stupid sidebar loaded with junk from the phone.

08:01.860 --> 08:02.860
It's nonsense.

08:02.860 --> 08:06.660
And so I've got a stupid little app in my menu bar that I can click and it gives me

08:06.660 --> 08:08.280
a stupid calendar.

08:08.280 --> 08:12.780
Stuff like this that's just built into Plasma or most of the stuff built into GNOME or Windows

08:12.780 --> 08:13.780
even.

08:13.780 --> 08:16.020
So I've started resigning myself to using some of these apps.

08:16.020 --> 08:24.480
So I'm using Junction and Bumper now and Bartender and extensions up the wazoo on my GNOME desktop.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.480
It's not a good life.

08:25.480 --> 08:26.480
It's not.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.040
It's bad over here.

08:28.040 --> 08:32.320
You're getting a nickeled and dimed for every little app.

08:32.320 --> 08:36.480
You got to load half a dozen extensions before your work environment's even useful anymore.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.920
They break with every major upgrade.

08:38.920 --> 08:39.980
It's not a good life.

08:39.980 --> 08:43.200
You know, I can't get around it, but maybe I could feel a little better because Danny

08:43.200 --> 08:50.040
wrote in and mentions that he's made a brown Ubuntu style theme for Soos Plasma desktop.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.040
Yeah.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.080
There you go.

08:52.080 --> 08:55.800
So if you want your personal color scheme to be as brown as hell on Plasma, we'll have

08:55.800 --> 08:58.740
a link in the show notes made by listener Danny.

08:58.740 --> 09:01.040
If you've ever wondered what brown can do for you.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.040
That's right.

09:02.040 --> 09:06.440
Vold wrote in with a couple of Python related productivity tips.

09:06.440 --> 09:10.860
He says, I've heard you guys mention Poetry for Python.

09:10.860 --> 09:11.920
Definitely worth checking out.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.560
It gives you a smooth development workflow like building the project, running commands

09:15.560 --> 09:19.760
in a managed virtual environment, publishing packages on an index server is easy.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.760
It's got lock file.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.760
He says there's a lot of value in it.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.760
He also says that the tool talks works particularly well.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.800
And then get this brace yourself.

09:27.800 --> 09:37.760
We had not one but two people write in and say they use Nix OS and Nix OS as the VM inside

09:37.760 --> 09:40.040
Mac OS as a host for development.

09:40.040 --> 09:45.760
So they're using the tools in Mac OS to like build stuff and edit stuff in the Nix OS virtual

09:45.760 --> 09:46.760
machine.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.040
Nix OS is a distribution built on top of the next package manager.

09:50.040 --> 09:54.480
And the big thing that it's known for is it uses a declarative configuration system.

09:54.480 --> 09:57.580
You essentially go in there and you declare everything and then build it.

09:57.580 --> 10:00.720
If you're looking for a reproducible environment, that kind of stuff, it's great.

10:00.720 --> 10:04.520
He says each project that he has, has its own development environment with its own Python

10:04.520 --> 10:05.520
version.

10:05.520 --> 10:09.220
And he ends up saving a lot of time because he doesn't have to worry about broken states

10:09.220 --> 10:12.760
between projects after doing a brew update or something like that.

10:12.760 --> 10:18.000
And he says, last but not least, Emacs org mode for note taking introduce Emacs lifestyle.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
There you go.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
There's a plug in there.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
You knew it was coming, right?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.400
You knew Emacs was going to show up.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.680
I'd have been disappointed if it didn't, you know, because, you know, you're going to get

10:25.680 --> 10:26.680
VS code.

10:26.680 --> 10:27.680
You know, you're going to get that.

10:27.680 --> 10:28.680
So you got to get the.

10:28.680 --> 10:29.680
You got to get the OG.

10:29.680 --> 10:30.680
Mm hmm.

10:30.680 --> 10:31.680
Mm hmm.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.680
Mm hmm.

10:32.680 --> 10:36.080
We also have a link in here to the advanced Visual Studio code for Python developers handbook.

10:36.080 --> 10:40.120
This is a massive resource and I cannot remember if we've talked about it on the show before,

10:40.120 --> 10:41.760
but it was sent in recently.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.280
I know you've seen this.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.280
It's a gold mine.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.680
I use a bunch of, well, I use a few of them.

10:46.680 --> 10:50.400
A lot of it's to taste, but these are basically productivity tips and how to kind of configure

10:50.400 --> 10:54.000
VS code to be the ultimate Python IDE.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.840
Take what you want and don't use what you don't, right?

10:55.840 --> 10:56.840
That's what's nice about it.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.840
All right.

10:57.840 --> 11:02.400
We got an email from Nick and Nick points out that, look, if you got RSI problems, you

11:02.400 --> 11:03.400
got productivity problems.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.980
You're not getting any work done.

11:04.980 --> 11:05.980
And that is definitely true.

11:05.980 --> 11:12.000
And he says, what I discovered, which really changed my RSI problem for me, I got a tip

11:12.000 --> 11:14.600
from a friend in the VFX industry.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.880
And it so far has eliminated my pain.

11:16.880 --> 11:22.540
He says, I've switched to using a Wacom drawing tablet instead of a mouse.

11:22.540 --> 11:27.000
So he's blasting around his machine using a tablet and a mouse, you know, the Wacoms

11:27.000 --> 11:28.880
as a result to use it properly.

11:28.880 --> 11:34.280
He sort of also had to hold himself differently, you know, assume better posture, he says,

11:34.280 --> 11:38.440
and sort of stopped slouching because when you slouch, you can't really use the stylus

11:38.440 --> 11:39.440
very well.

11:39.440 --> 11:43.480
And he says, I don't know if everybody will benefit from this like I did, but these tablets

11:43.480 --> 11:44.840
have gotten pretty cheap now.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.400
They have good Linux support.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.760
And if you have RSI issues, you should give it a go.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.200
It made a big difference for Nick.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.200
Something to try out there.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.200
Who would have thunk?

11:53.200 --> 11:54.720
Who would have thunk?

11:54.720 --> 11:57.640
I've definitely seen editors using these tablets before.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.760
I never thought about using them just to mouse around the UI.

12:00.760 --> 12:05.320
I also find for RSI, just switching up the type of input device.

12:05.320 --> 12:11.400
So I have a vertical Logitech mouse, which is great for RSI.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.520
And that works by you move your entire arm instead of just your wrist.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.080
So that's something to go check out.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.680
And then when I get tired of that, I switch to using a trackpad.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.760
And then when that wanes, I switch back to the mouse.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.460
And I also just kind of move around between a lot of different systems.

12:25.460 --> 12:29.800
And that helps, I think, too, just it's not the same ergonomics and sitting the same spot

12:29.800 --> 12:30.800
every single time.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.600
I think that helps too.

12:32.600 --> 12:36.640
As a result of my RSI issues over the years, I have gotten a lot more serious about my

12:36.640 --> 12:40.200
keyboards, and I've started buying nicer keyboards.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.540
And I stopped using like the butterfly keyboard.

12:42.540 --> 12:47.160
And I've been using like the System76 launch keyboard, or I'll get a keyboard that's specifically

12:47.160 --> 12:48.160
built for ergonomics.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.680
We talked a bit about this when the show first came back, because we really kind of went

12:51.680 --> 12:53.040
deep into keyboards for a bit.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.960
And I ended up with like a split ergonomic keyboard.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.020
I can't remember the name right now.

12:58.020 --> 13:00.280
But Microsoft also makes a pretty decent nice split one.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.180
And I have found those work pretty well for me.

13:02.180 --> 13:07.840
And if it's not a split keyboard, something that's mechanical, that has some actual travel,

13:07.840 --> 13:12.720
because I'm an old man, and I grew up in the 80s, where you actually typed on these large

13:12.720 --> 13:17.720
IBM keyboards, these things that were like skateboards, and you really typed on those

13:17.720 --> 13:18.720
things.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.160
And that's how I learned how to type.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.960
And so I bottom out really bad on things like the butterfly.

13:22.960 --> 13:28.200
And so something like the launch keyboard, or my keyboards upstairs, or my keyboards

13:28.200 --> 13:32.680
at home, they have a lot more travel, or they're ergonomically built so that they're a lot

13:32.680 --> 13:33.900
better for me.

13:33.900 --> 13:37.680
And I found that helps too, but I could definitely see taking it up to the next notch with a

13:37.680 --> 13:38.680
tablet.

13:38.680 --> 13:43.240
Have you made any tweaks to how you sit, or how you work, or any gear you use for RSI

13:43.240 --> 13:44.240
issues?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.240
Not in a long time.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.520
I mean, I use the launch keyboard.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.120
I'm pretty much the same here, mechanical keyboards.

13:50.120 --> 13:54.520
The biggest change I made was a couple of years ago when I went all in on standing desk.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.720
So other than when I'm doing the show, I'm usually standing.

13:56.720 --> 14:00.800
And the only reason I don't stand for the show is I tend to list a little bit while

14:00.800 --> 14:01.800
I'm talking.

14:01.800 --> 14:08.760
So I'm such a lazy, out of weight slob that I have to sit down after I've been standing

14:08.760 --> 14:11.800
for a while, because I start moving around, and then I run out of breath.

14:11.800 --> 14:16.120
Like I can't help but pace a little bit and stuff, and it's good for the energy level.

14:16.120 --> 14:21.080
But when I'm speaking into a mic, it's just enough that I'm breathing a little heavy.

14:21.080 --> 14:24.640
Because again, I've got to go for more walks, which is something I work on.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.600
But it seems like it's never enough.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.880
Never enough.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.120
System76.com.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.880
Do you hear those bells are ringing?

14:33.880 --> 14:38.960
It is our friends over at System76, and they are clearly in the holiday spirit with their

14:38.960 --> 14:45.760
special power up holiday sale up to three hundred and twenty dollars off select systems.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.240
This is what I wait for every single year.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.000
I never fear this year.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.680
They're including a sweet power up fanny pack, too, so you can, you know, you can really

14:54.680 --> 14:55.680
rock it.

14:55.680 --> 14:59.160
And they've got a nice little System76 power up logo on there.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.360
It's a unique piece of swag.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.360
Also kind of great.

15:02.360 --> 15:05.560
You know, that laptop that Mike just got, the Pangolin, guess what?

15:05.560 --> 15:06.560
It's on sale right now.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.000
You can get it for one hundred dollars off.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.040
So that should really put a little salt in Mike's wound right there.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.520
As for the Lema Pro, yeah, it's on sale.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.640
The Darter Pro, my favorite rig, the Oryx Pro and the Gazelle.

15:17.640 --> 15:18.640
I love the Gazelle.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.840
That's also on sale.

15:19.840 --> 15:24.200
And the one that's escaped me, but I've always wanted to try because I think it'd be so great

15:24.200 --> 15:28.480
in the studio set up or in the RV set up or for a home server, the Meerkat, that tiny

15:28.480 --> 15:32.400
little itty bitty Linux computer is on sale, too.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.080
Also great to see the launch keyboard is back.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.840
Ship dates are in December.

15:35.840 --> 15:36.840
What a gift that would be.

15:36.840 --> 15:41.080
Honestly, if somebody gave me a launch keyboard for the holidays, I would probably consider

15:41.080 --> 15:42.520
that to be near a marriage proposal.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.160
I'd rather have that than an engagement ring.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.400
I'm just saying, ladies, it's back in stock.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.480
It's truly my favorite keyboard.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.600
In fact, I have it right here in front of me right now.

15:50.600 --> 15:58.280
I'll type I love the System76 launch keyboard.

15:58.280 --> 15:59.280
Keyboard.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.280
Keyboard.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.280
Keyboard.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.280
There we go.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.280
See, I got to move that key right there.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.280
But that's the thing you can.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.280
You can move these keys around.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.280
It sounds great.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.080
These are actually the little slightly quieter ones.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.520
Of course, I have it right up against the microphone here.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.880
I say go for the quieter ones if you're in office space and if you're in your own place

16:13.880 --> 16:16.520
and you don't care, go for the louder ones because they have a fantastic feel.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.360
I got a chance to put my hands on both of them.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.400
The launch is back.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.400
It's available right now.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.720
Could be a great chance to get that.

16:22.720 --> 16:27.160
But head over to System76.com if you've been on the fence, if you've been thinking maybe

16:27.160 --> 16:30.560
now is the time to get a piece of hardware but you're looking for a deal, well, this

16:30.560 --> 16:32.040
is it.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.660
This is the sale of the year.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.160
You can get it from System76.com.

16:36.160 --> 16:41.680
They're building computers in Denver, Colorado, born to run Linux and they have their Power

16:41.680 --> 16:44.060
Up Holiday sale going on right now.

16:44.060 --> 16:49.120
Just go to System76.com and if you pick something up in the notes, tell them Coder Radio sent

16:49.120 --> 16:50.120
you.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.120
Let them know.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.120
You heard about it here on the show.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.120
The guy sent you.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.120
Do me a favor there.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.120
System76.com.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.780
The Power Up Holiday sale is on now.

16:56.780 --> 17:01.560
Go get a computer born to run Linux, a keyboard, or maybe some sweet swag.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.560
System76.com.

17:02.560 --> 17:09.560
Mr. Dominic went to Pallet Town and practiced some sequel alchemy.

17:09.560 --> 17:13.280
Boy, that sounds like the start to a really good kid's novel, but that's not actually

17:13.280 --> 17:14.280
what it is.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.280
No, no, no.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.880
So I did one of my beginner posts again.

17:16.880 --> 17:20.280
I always call them Pallet Town because I'm a big nerd and you know the old Pokemon games.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.280
Okay.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.880
So I've been writing these posts and talking about Python a lot and the thing that people

17:24.880 --> 17:29.960
have been kind of asking about is SQL alchemy, which is, if you don't know, it's the ORM

17:29.960 --> 17:31.560
that most Python uses, right?

17:31.560 --> 17:37.180
So if you're doing like Django or fast API, you're probably using SQL alchemy.

17:37.180 --> 17:42.280
So yeah, this is just a couple quick tips on dealing with common performance issues.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.480
I give you a little bit of setup.

17:43.480 --> 17:47.740
I don't go through the trouble of setting up the entire project because I just don't

17:47.740 --> 17:50.880
think it's necessary, but a couple of things, right?

17:50.880 --> 17:53.600
So we won't go into too much detail because if you're not a Python developer, you're not

17:53.600 --> 17:58.480
going to care, but Python has hybrid properties, which are basically other languages might

17:58.480 --> 18:00.680
call them computed properties.

18:00.680 --> 18:05.940
You know, it returns a value based on arbitrary Python function.

18:05.940 --> 18:09.680
The very, very dumb example of this you could do is like full name would be like self dot

18:09.680 --> 18:12.460
first name plus space self dot last name.

18:12.460 --> 18:16.480
It's actually a lot more helpful than that, of course, because you don't want to create

18:16.480 --> 18:20.820
unnecessary database columns and have to track everything here and there, especially if the

18:20.820 --> 18:24.220
value you want is dependent on other values on the table.

18:24.220 --> 18:25.220
Good stuff.

18:25.220 --> 18:26.960
You can read about all about that there.

18:26.960 --> 18:27.960
Deferred columns.

18:27.960 --> 18:28.960
Exactly what it sounds like.

18:28.960 --> 18:29.960
You load a model.

18:29.960 --> 18:32.440
You don't want to load the entire model, usually, especially if you have, let's say, a profile

18:32.440 --> 18:33.440
image or something.

18:33.440 --> 18:37.280
In my Pokemon example, I give the Pokemon's image.

18:37.280 --> 18:41.920
You do a deferred column and it won't immediately load the image.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.440
In my case, it doesn't have to be an image, right?

18:44.440 --> 18:48.320
There are some caveats to that, but in the most simple cases that you'll probably be

18:48.320 --> 18:54.400
getting, it's going to be one of the better ways to go for large data objects.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.560
The opposite of that is load only, where you specifically tell SQLAlchemy which columns

18:58.560 --> 19:02.840
you want to load off a table, ignoring the others.

19:02.840 --> 19:06.680
Pretty basic if you've ever dealt with an ORM before, but I was surprised to hear how

19:06.680 --> 19:07.680
many people found it.

19:07.680 --> 19:12.200
I think it's maybe the syntax, especially coming from something like Active Record,

19:12.200 --> 19:18.080
but how many folks were having trouble understanding kind of the fundamentals of SQLAlchemy.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.360
The next one I'm going to do is relationships in Python.

19:20.360 --> 19:24.520
Not like, hey, do you want to go out tonight relationships, but, you know, has one belongs

19:24.520 --> 19:26.160
to kind of thing.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.320
So yeah, if you want to keep reading along, that's fine.

19:28.320 --> 19:34.560
I'm doing these SQLAlchemy posts and probably going to dip a bit into fast API, but I'd

19:34.560 --> 19:38.160
say we probably have like one a month coming, maybe a little more frequently, depending

19:38.160 --> 19:39.680
on how busy I am.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.640
And we have a link to that in the show notes.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.080
You can go follow along with the series.

19:44.080 --> 19:48.160
I mean, you know, some of this is simple stuff, but some of it actually results in pretty

19:48.160 --> 19:53.240
decent performance gains because, you know, you're not doing a bunch of unnecessary database

19:53.240 --> 19:54.240
queries and things like that.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.720
I guess they're actually good little tips.

19:55.720 --> 19:59.440
Yeah, I would say it's stuff that's simple once you know it, but then if you actually

19:59.440 --> 20:03.800
don't know it, I mean, I'm sure people can write in horror stories about how when they

20:03.800 --> 20:07.000
were super junior, they didn't understand why their query took forever, right?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Isn't that the thing?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.440
It's like you just don't know what you don't know.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.680
And it's a cliche thing to say, but it is very true.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.160
It's ignorance, and it's the very thing you require.

20:16.160 --> 20:19.400
If you knew everything and how hard things were, you wouldn't get into it.

20:19.400 --> 20:24.620
You needed ignorance, but it's also it's also a challenge and you got to figure to like

20:24.620 --> 20:28.000
it's good for you, you know, like putting this stuff out there, get the name associated

20:28.000 --> 20:32.160
with working with Python, get some Google juice, hopefully, although that seems to be

20:32.160 --> 20:33.160
rare these days.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.680
Not that I'm bitter.

20:34.680 --> 20:37.120
Does that still work, man?

20:37.120 --> 20:42.640
It just burns me up because we got shows that have covered stuff that goes back years, right?

20:42.640 --> 20:46.800
But we never show up in the search results when you're looking for that stuff ever like

20:46.800 --> 20:52.120
Google has never properly figured out how to index and weigh podcasts in the whole scheme

20:52.120 --> 20:53.240
of things.

20:53.240 --> 20:54.960
And they went all in on figuring out YouTube.

20:54.960 --> 20:58.040
You know, if they've got anything relevant on YouTube, they'll give you an embed right

20:58.040 --> 20:59.880
there on the Google search.

20:59.880 --> 21:04.680
But say somebody wanted to know this information and they do a search for it.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.120
You're hoping they'll hit the blog post, right?

21:07.120 --> 21:11.600
But wouldn't it be great if Google was actually good enough to say, by the way, this same

21:11.600 --> 21:15.760
author was over here giving a verbal explanation of it.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.680
It just feels like we haven't evolved it at all.

21:17.680 --> 21:21.320
And I find it incredibly disappointing because, you know, there's a bunch of good stuff out

21:21.320 --> 21:22.680
there that you just can't surface, really.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.280
It's a lot of great free content on podcasts, for sure.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.920
One day we'll write a really powerful Python script that'll go through, transcribe it all

21:28.920 --> 21:31.560
and convert it into blog posts, and then we'll make it big.

21:31.560 --> 21:36.080
And then Spotify will put it behind the paywall.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.440
Leno.com slash coder.

21:37.440 --> 21:42.440
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, you go there to support the show.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.880
It's Leno.com slash coder.

21:44.880 --> 21:48.080
Leno's how we run and build everything for the last couple of years.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.020
Since we've gone independent, we've deployed it on the node.

21:51.020 --> 21:53.960
And like Jupiter broadcasting, Leno loves Linux.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.320
They use it every day in every environment.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.080
It's the core of their tooling.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.360
And that was the basis that they used to build the node 18 years ago.

22:01.360 --> 22:05.660
And now, well, now they're the largest independent cloud provider in the world.

22:05.660 --> 22:09.600
And over that 18 year period, they learned a few things.

22:09.600 --> 22:14.660
And when you, you know this, when you're in business, and you're focused on something

22:14.660 --> 22:18.460
for 18 years, you start to get better at it.

22:18.460 --> 22:24.480
And over that time, Leno learned that customer support, it's totally critical.

22:24.480 --> 22:28.620
They've invested in the absolute best customer support team there.

22:28.620 --> 22:34.580
It's a big part of why I feel like, even though I never had a major issue, if I ever did,

22:34.580 --> 22:36.720
I really do feel like Leno's got my back.

22:36.720 --> 22:39.940
That makes me feel like my business is going to stay online.

22:39.940 --> 22:43.680
I'm going to be able to continue to do business.

22:43.680 --> 22:48.200
Also Leno sort of reflects on us a little bit because of their high performance, because

22:48.200 --> 22:49.400
their speed is just fantastic.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.760
I mean, I'm talking 40 gigabit connections into the hypervisors.

22:52.760 --> 22:55.280
They are their own ISP.

22:55.280 --> 23:00.040
These factors all play into like when you access a service for Jupiter broadcasting,

23:00.040 --> 23:01.040
it's fast.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.040
It responds.

23:02.040 --> 23:05.820
And they have data centers all around the world, 11 of them.

23:05.820 --> 23:08.940
So on top of all of that, they've got some of the best performance out there.

23:08.940 --> 23:13.020
They've got great features like object storage, cloud firewall, backups that could be baked

23:13.020 --> 23:14.580
right in.

23:14.580 --> 23:17.280
The monitoring on their dashboard is really nice.

23:17.280 --> 23:21.140
You log in and you get a nice snapshot of exactly where your system's at right now and

23:21.140 --> 23:24.220
where it's been at recently, like performance wise and metrics wise.

23:24.220 --> 23:28.460
And then on top of that, you can plug into their API and pull some of that information

23:28.460 --> 23:32.120
right down and you could even use their Linode command line client if you wanted to.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.620
I mean, there's like a lot of ways you can get to that stuff.

23:34.620 --> 23:40.920
So as you grow, there become more options for how you manage your Linode infrastructure,

23:40.920 --> 23:47.720
like Kubernetes or Terraform, the API, pre-built images that you can actually design and store

23:47.720 --> 23:52.760
for yourself and then deploy them again, which is a really quick way to maybe do some R&D.

23:52.760 --> 23:53.760
There's a lot out there.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.380
There's a lot you can choose from, but it's not overwhelming.

23:56.380 --> 24:00.360
We've built a dashboard that makes it clean, understandable and easy to get started.

24:00.360 --> 24:05.540
So much so that literally everyone on our team has proficiency with the Linode dashboard.

24:05.540 --> 24:07.880
When do you see that ever happen in a group of people?

24:07.880 --> 24:08.880
It's pretty rare.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.520
You know, again, 18 years.

24:10.520 --> 24:11.960
They've learned how to build these things.

24:11.960 --> 24:13.360
They've learned how to do it right.

24:13.360 --> 24:17.080
So why don't you go build something, maybe go learn something, try something for yourself

24:17.080 --> 24:18.940
and support the show.

24:18.940 --> 24:23.800
Go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 in 60 day credit, kick the tires for yourself

24:23.800 --> 24:25.240
and support the show.

24:25.240 --> 24:29.660
It's linode.com slash coder.

24:29.660 --> 24:33.720
We were doing this here show and I was debating, was I going to get an M1?

24:33.720 --> 24:34.720
Was I going to wait?

24:34.720 --> 24:38.480
Did I want to even tempt into the Mac side of things?

24:38.480 --> 24:44.280
Because it's a very sticky ecosystem and it's not an ecosystem that necessarily plays great

24:44.280 --> 24:48.760
with what I have now, although I've managed to kind of walk that line over the years since

24:48.760 --> 24:49.760
I have an iPhone.

24:49.760 --> 24:55.640
It's, it's not a huge, huge deal, not a huge gap, but I was hesitant.

24:55.640 --> 25:00.520
So when the M1 was announced, it was to me, clearly the consumer level machines of the

25:00.520 --> 25:05.640
16 gigs of Ram limitation, eight CPU core, those kinds of things.

25:05.640 --> 25:06.640
Okay.

25:06.640 --> 25:09.040
That looks promising, but not for me yet.

25:09.040 --> 25:13.320
So I started saving up my coins thinking obviously there's going to be something more powerful

25:13.320 --> 25:14.320
around the corner.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.640
They'll rev the laptops.

25:16.640 --> 25:21.880
Probably a great time for me to get one because I've got a 2016 MacBook pro here, you know,

25:21.880 --> 25:24.760
with the full on like OG butterfly keyboard.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.140
My Z key just started going out on me.

25:27.140 --> 25:28.800
This seems like a good time to replace this.

25:28.800 --> 25:29.800
It's a nice leap.

25:29.800 --> 25:33.480
And I wanted to get my experience with an M1 machine.

25:33.480 --> 25:36.680
I put the order in a little bit after I hem and hawed about a little too long.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.200
So I was sort of on a long shipping delay.

25:39.200 --> 25:44.440
And in the meantime, in that window of time, as a business, we made the decision, well,

25:44.440 --> 25:50.480
we'll purchase a M1 Mac mini for testing purposes of Asahi Linux.

25:50.480 --> 25:56.440
So we can provide full coverage of that when they launch an installer, which is any day

25:56.440 --> 26:02.740
now to get Linux on the M1 Mac mini, they are using the M1 Mac mini for their development.

26:02.740 --> 26:07.400
So it makes sense that that's probably your best bet in terms of hardware to run Asahi

26:07.400 --> 26:10.120
Linux as an M1 mini, because that's what they're using.

26:10.120 --> 26:17.160
So we picked one up and I set it up and I realized, oh, damn, I didn't need to wait.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.820
This is plenty fast.

26:18.820 --> 26:20.860
This is plenty fast for me.

26:20.860 --> 26:23.920
The M1 mini was, it's a nice little piece of machinery.

26:23.920 --> 26:25.520
It really is truly nice.

26:25.520 --> 26:29.160
And additionally, it doesn't even show up in my power stats.

26:29.160 --> 26:34.200
It uses such a small amount of power, I can't actually tell when the M1 mini is powered

26:34.200 --> 26:37.360
on or powered off in my solar stats.

26:37.360 --> 26:41.200
I can tell when the monitor's on, I can tell when the monitor's off, but I cannot tell

26:41.200 --> 26:44.800
when the minis are off and the mini performance is fantastic.

26:44.800 --> 26:51.400
So when I got the mini and I realized it was this nice, I thought, holy, the M1 Macs is

26:51.400 --> 26:53.960
going to be mind blowing.

26:53.960 --> 26:59.000
And I watched the YouTube reviews and the YouTubers, their minds were blown.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.400
Unbelievable performance.

27:00.400 --> 27:05.520
So I got an M1 Macs, I ordered it with 10 cores, 8 performance, 2 efficiencies, 64 gigabytes

27:05.520 --> 27:06.520
of RAM.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.520
And he said, give it to me.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.760
I'm ready to have the ultimate in performance workstation.

27:10.760 --> 27:20.520
I took it out of the box and my first impression was an odd sense of sad nostalgia.

27:20.520 --> 27:26.280
Holding it in my hands took me back to the titanium power book.

27:26.280 --> 27:31.460
And that was like my first years in IT support.

27:31.460 --> 27:34.080
It was a very formative time of my life.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.920
That back then, it was an aspirational machine.

27:35.920 --> 27:41.240
I could never afford back then in my early twenties, a titanium power book pro.

27:41.240 --> 27:44.800
It was this machine that like the directors and the executives had and I'd be working

27:44.800 --> 27:45.800
on their machines.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.760
It was squared off just like this one was.

27:47.760 --> 27:53.080
And I couldn't believe the overwhelming like time travel sense of nostalgia that hit me

27:53.080 --> 27:54.920
when I picked this laptop up.

27:54.920 --> 27:57.720
It was completely unexpected.

27:57.720 --> 28:01.440
And immediately it gave me a connection to this laptop like I don't have with any other

28:01.440 --> 28:02.520
piece of equipment that I own.

28:02.520 --> 28:03.520
I couldn't believe it.

28:03.520 --> 28:07.480
And I opened it up and my next reaction was, oh, I missed the touch bar.

28:07.480 --> 28:08.480
Really?

28:08.480 --> 28:09.480
Yeah.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.480
I'm a horrible speller.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.840
And the autocomplete was a fricking lifesaver.

28:13.840 --> 28:16.120
And also the emoticon autocomplete was nice, too.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.840
I am like horrible at spelling.

28:18.840 --> 28:23.020
And so having anything that could give me an assist was appreciated.

28:23.020 --> 28:27.760
What I'd like to see is the full size F key row and then just put the touch bar above

28:27.760 --> 28:28.760
that.

28:28.760 --> 28:31.240
I know it's crazy, but that is a little crazy.

28:31.240 --> 28:37.280
You know, I started using this thing, Mike, and I I was expecting to just be blown away

28:37.280 --> 28:38.280
by the performance.

28:38.280 --> 28:42.360
I mean, everybody's just been raving about the performance of this thing.

28:42.360 --> 28:45.600
And that is not what I got.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.240
I mean, it's fast.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.680
It's probably the fastest computer I've ever owned.

28:49.680 --> 28:53.400
I mean, it probably does everything I've ever done with a computer the fastest I've ever

28:53.400 --> 28:54.400
done it.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.920
And that's impressive in a laptop.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.880
And it does all of this.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.520
I've never heard the fans yet.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.320
I've had it for three weeks.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.320
I've never heard the fans.

29:02.320 --> 29:08.400
I've had three VMS going with four monitors attached while I'm browsing the Web and watching

29:08.400 --> 29:09.520
a movie.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.500
And I still did not hear the fans.

29:11.500 --> 29:15.680
What happens is it just has unlimited headroom, like I have not been able to max it out.

29:15.680 --> 29:20.520
I do not yet have the sense of I've ever put this computer under load, even though I've

29:20.520 --> 29:24.460
put it under what would have been substantial load for an Intel machine.

29:24.460 --> 29:31.440
It is fast in that sense, but I have this sense that it's not like, oh, man, everything's

29:31.440 --> 29:32.440
different now.

29:32.440 --> 29:35.880
It's like, oh, everything's finally as fast as it should have been.

29:35.880 --> 29:39.340
That's my takeaway from it is, OK, well, this is about as fast as they should have been

29:39.340 --> 29:41.440
for years.

29:41.440 --> 29:45.360
And now they are that speed, which is great.

29:45.360 --> 29:49.160
But it doesn't feel like five or 10 years down the road like I was expecting.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.240
It feels like what today should be.

29:51.240 --> 29:54.340
And what we've experienced so far was just inadequacy.

29:54.340 --> 29:56.820
And now they've made up for that, and that's good.

29:56.820 --> 30:00.280
But I just dropped a lot of coin on this machine expecting this to be like a five to 10 year

30:00.280 --> 30:01.960
machine for me.

30:01.960 --> 30:06.040
And it will be a long term machine, no doubt about it, especially since I can't even break

30:06.040 --> 30:07.760
a sweat on it right now.

30:07.760 --> 30:13.360
But it wasn't that like fundamental, the land has just shifted for me kind of machine.

30:13.360 --> 30:17.840
There are a few things that make it really nice, like the way it handles multi monitors

30:17.840 --> 30:19.240
is nice.

30:19.240 --> 30:20.880
It's really nice.

30:20.880 --> 30:25.900
Four screens being powered by a laptop and it doesn't even get warm to the touch is impressive

30:25.900 --> 30:28.160
and doesn't make a sound.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.480
It's legitimately absolutely silent.

30:30.480 --> 30:34.320
And I am extremely picky about this kind of stuff because I record audio and I cannot

30:34.320 --> 30:35.320
hear the machine.

30:35.320 --> 30:39.000
Do you feel like you got your money's worth given your I wouldn't say disappointed, but

30:39.000 --> 30:41.320
somewhat not blown away by the speed?

30:41.320 --> 30:45.080
If I think of it as a desktop, maybe not.

30:45.080 --> 30:50.120
But if I think of it as a laptop that is kicking the ass of any desktop I've ever used, yes.

30:50.120 --> 30:51.120
You know what I mean?

30:51.120 --> 30:52.120
Sure.

30:52.120 --> 30:55.920
So if it's like the one computer, it makes sense because it's almost taking to two purchases

30:55.920 --> 30:56.920
with four screens.

30:56.920 --> 31:02.760
I can actually be running two different Linux VMs simultaneously and still have like a Mac

31:02.760 --> 31:05.640
app going and doing plenty of stuff.

31:05.640 --> 31:08.040
That feels like a workflow to work for me for a long time.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.880
Like that's that's pretty damn nice.

31:10.880 --> 31:15.840
And the thing that I just am blown away is like when I unplug those three external monitors,

31:15.840 --> 31:17.420
the screen like doesn't even flicker.

31:17.420 --> 31:21.820
It doesn't even like spaz out in the slightest and just those monitors and those windows

31:21.820 --> 31:26.880
just get moved to the main screen completely without having a spaz attack.

31:26.880 --> 31:27.880
That's nice.

31:27.880 --> 31:28.880
Yes, it's remarkable.

31:28.880 --> 31:33.120
And I can just be like, oh, I need another screen and I'll plug it in to one of the USB

31:33.120 --> 31:38.640
C ports and I've got another screen and it just turns on and the other screens don't

31:38.640 --> 31:42.600
freak out and it doesn't completely rearrange everything.

31:42.600 --> 31:43.600
That is really nice.

31:43.600 --> 31:47.640
And it's plugging and unplugging for monitors is something I do because I've got a USB C

31:47.640 --> 31:51.920
Thunderbolt 3 dock with, you know, a bunch of monitors hanging off of it.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.720
And I am impressed with Rosetta too.

31:53.720 --> 31:55.240
No surprise there.

31:55.240 --> 32:01.800
The only way I can tell I am running an Intel app is it takes a little bit extra to launch.

32:01.800 --> 32:06.240
You know, it takes a few bounces in the dock and then it launches where everything else

32:06.240 --> 32:07.960
launches instantly.

32:07.960 --> 32:12.840
So you can tell if it's native because there's zero load time and if it's Intel, there's

32:12.840 --> 32:15.120
a little bit of load time.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.680
I imagine that's your experience.

32:16.680 --> 32:20.440
Honestly, I think things have been pretty fast for me on Rosetta.

32:20.440 --> 32:24.440
But see, I basically live in VSCode and Terminal and Slack, right?

32:24.440 --> 32:29.840
So that's been the interesting thing for me is Electron apps perform like they're native.

32:29.840 --> 32:37.320
VSCode and Slack and Discord and Element, they have all felt like native code.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.800
Just super fast.

32:38.800 --> 32:39.800
Really good performance.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.920
If that's not an endorsement, I don't know what is.

32:41.920 --> 32:47.360
It's sort of ridiculous that you've got to buy a near $4,000 laptop to get good VSCode

32:47.360 --> 32:48.360
speed.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.040
Well, we should say that because you have the max, right?

32:50.040 --> 32:53.040
So you're not on the bottom of the ladder here.

32:53.040 --> 32:57.720
No, I went all the way because that was always my intention is to be responsible and save

32:57.720 --> 33:02.680
my moneys up and then pull it all in one big go and hope that lasts a few more years.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.680
I don't know.

33:03.680 --> 33:04.680
We'll see, right?

33:04.680 --> 33:08.060
Because I feel like I'm in a worse spot than you in one sense that there's not really anybody

33:08.060 --> 33:10.800
I can hand this machine down to if this doesn't work for me.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.120
I can't even swallow that cost.

33:12.120 --> 33:16.000
I'm going to just have to use this machine now and I am happy with it.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.120
I am happy with it.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.420
I'm just not blown away with it.

33:19.420 --> 33:24.120
I think a lot of this is it's nice to have ports, but I should have always had these

33:24.120 --> 33:25.120
ports.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.120
It's great to have high performance.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.600
I should have always had this performance.

33:27.600 --> 33:31.160
It's nice to have it be silent, but honestly, I feel like for the last few years, these

33:31.160 --> 33:33.960
machines should have this is what they should have been.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.880
And I think Apple could have gotten there or at least closer.

33:37.880 --> 33:45.080
I hate to say this, but I got to suspect Apple intentionally held back the MacBooks knowing

33:45.080 --> 33:46.520
this transition was coming.

33:46.520 --> 33:49.840
The reason why I say that is when you look at some of like the tear downs that I fix

33:49.840 --> 33:54.880
it and like the Linus Media Group did in there, you can see there's easy steps they could

33:54.880 --> 33:58.520
have done to make the cooling systems better on these systems.

33:58.520 --> 33:59.900
And Apple didn't.

33:59.900 --> 34:05.240
And then surprise, Apple used that exact cooling system when they launched the M1 version of

34:05.240 --> 34:06.360
the MacBooks.

34:06.360 --> 34:10.820
And it just, to me, seems like maybe these systems had been held back one more iteration

34:10.820 --> 34:15.120
so that way they could get the new keyboard in the ARM Mac, you know, they could get that

34:15.120 --> 34:17.800
improved function key row in there, you know, all of that.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.940
It just seems like maybe they sat on it for a little bit longer than they should have.

34:20.940 --> 34:22.840
It makes every other machine I own feel slow.

34:22.840 --> 34:26.600
It really and it's really bad here in the studio because these systems are like from

34:26.600 --> 34:31.080
2017, 2018 and 2016.

34:31.080 --> 34:35.600
So these systems down here really, really feel like dogs.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.620
It's not just the CPU.

34:37.620 --> 34:41.720
It's also the fact that they have this unified memory architecture and they have these ridiculously

34:41.720 --> 34:44.300
fast SSDs or MVMEs.

34:44.300 --> 34:47.880
As a work machine, it is a very solid performer.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.520
Mac OS, I think, is what holds it back.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.880
I think the reason why it doesn't feel faster to me is Mac OS.

34:53.880 --> 34:59.040
Yeah, Mac OS feels like it's in this weird, I don't know if it's a transitional state

34:59.040 --> 35:02.440
or it's something neglected, unoptimized.

35:02.440 --> 35:07.080
It doesn't feel like it matches or it's getting the same amount of attention as the hardware.

35:07.080 --> 35:10.640
The very first thought I had when I booted it up was, that booted just as fast as my

35:10.640 --> 35:13.360
last Mac and my last Mac from 2016.

35:13.360 --> 35:18.440
You know, that and then it shuts down at the same speed my other Macs do.

35:18.440 --> 35:19.820
OK, great.

35:19.820 --> 35:23.540
You know, my Linux box boots up faster than my brand new Mac does.

35:23.540 --> 35:26.800
Not that that's a metric of performance, but it's pervasive throughout the OS.

35:26.800 --> 35:30.160
I mean, Mac OS is pretty solid in terms of stability.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.840
I think it's holding this hardware back now.

35:32.840 --> 35:38.840
And I suspect that if I were able to put Linux on this and it was fully accelerated, I suspect

35:38.840 --> 35:43.080
I would realize more of the performance gains in the hardware.

35:43.080 --> 35:50.760
Because the way this manifests to me is functions like processing things, that is remarkable.

35:50.760 --> 35:55.640
It's like decompressing files, compressing files, building an application, any of that

35:55.640 --> 36:00.880
kind of stuff, encoding audio or media or video, but bonkers fast.

36:00.880 --> 36:06.280
But anything that involves the OS, just as slow as it was on your previous machine.

36:06.280 --> 36:09.920
And it's just like it's unoptimized code or I don't know what.

36:09.920 --> 36:14.080
It just does things a slow way, an inefficient way, I don't know.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.040
But it does feel like it holds it back a little bit.

36:16.040 --> 36:20.800
Now the nice part is, is that applications themselves are really fast, web pages even

36:20.800 --> 36:22.120
feel like they load faster.

36:22.120 --> 36:27.480
And something that was surprising to me is my internet feels faster just simply because

36:27.480 --> 36:30.320
my web browsers are faster, which is a funny thing.

36:30.320 --> 36:33.640
But it's been a little while since I've experienced that kind of change.

36:33.640 --> 36:36.160
And that you do get that kind of experience from this.

36:36.160 --> 36:41.200
While it's not like blow you away, it's like, oh, wow, huh, even the web feels faster.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.520
This is definitely a direction the rest of the industry has to go.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.440
They have to respond to these machines.

36:45.440 --> 36:46.440
It's going to be tough.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.600
Yeah, Intel and AMD are working on it.

36:48.600 --> 36:54.560
Samsung says they've got a ARM chip that's going to be just as good as the M1 soon.

36:54.560 --> 37:01.800
I know like Carl over at System76, he's kind of excited about RISC-V and there is some

37:01.800 --> 37:03.240
more developments in that area.

37:03.240 --> 37:08.880
But when I look at even the fastest RISC-V chips, they're like a gigahertz.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.720
And I don't know if that's not the full picture.

37:11.720 --> 37:17.280
The thing that kind of special sauce about these Apple chips is that they've grafted

37:17.280 --> 37:20.720
so much of the x86 instruction set on top of their chip.

37:20.720 --> 37:25.600
I'm running an Intel app and an ARM app right next to each other.

37:25.600 --> 37:26.600
It gets easier.

37:26.600 --> 37:32.240
Yeah, I just this is impossible, but it's easier to run an Intel application and an

37:32.240 --> 37:39.480
ARM application on the same system than it is to run a 64-bit app and a 32-bit app.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.480
That's what they've done here.

37:41.480 --> 37:46.120
They've made it simpler than just trying to have 32-bit and 64-bit apps on the same system.

37:46.120 --> 37:49.040
And they're entirely different CPU architectures.

37:49.040 --> 37:53.280
I'm hoping they go somewhere with macOS itself to, I don't know, modernize it.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.480
I mean, take a few pages out of Katie's book.

37:55.480 --> 37:56.480
I just don't think they can.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.320
No, I don't think they want to either.

37:58.320 --> 38:04.360
I think somehow I almost wonder if it's like an act of debate over in Cupertino, like what's

38:04.360 --> 38:07.440
is iPadOS going to become macOS or what's the...

38:07.440 --> 38:12.080
There's another kind of world out there where they want their systems to be kind of like

38:12.080 --> 38:17.320
NixOS declarative, or they want to be able to deploy their desktops, their workstations,

38:17.320 --> 38:23.840
and their laptops using things like Ansible or some sort of centralized management system.

38:23.840 --> 38:27.720
And macOS sucks so bad at all that kind of stuff, right?

38:27.720 --> 38:31.940
Like you're still in the era where you could mass deploy Windows and Linux workstations,

38:31.940 --> 38:35.620
but then when it comes time to work on the MacBook, you're either all in on the Apple

38:35.620 --> 38:40.240
management system or you're just bespoke setting up that MacBook.

38:40.240 --> 38:44.120
Maybe you've got a base image and then you're configuring all the apps on top of that.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.640
And it's the same for me.

38:45.640 --> 38:50.720
Like I can kind of centrally manage the configuration of a lot of the settings of my Linux desktops,

38:50.720 --> 38:53.920
but then the MacBook comes along and it's like, well, I'm just going to burn an afternoon

38:53.920 --> 38:55.040
setting this one up.

38:55.040 --> 38:56.520
I got to go download a bunch of apps.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.520
I got to go get a bunch of serial keys for these things.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.960
I got to do it all by hand every single time.

39:00.960 --> 39:01.960
It's tedious.

39:01.960 --> 39:06.320
It feels like for a professional, it's fine to have that to work that way.

39:06.320 --> 39:10.000
In fact, sometimes it's even fun to kind of experiment with different stuff and do new

39:10.000 --> 39:12.480
apps and try new things on each setup.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.780
Like that's what I'm doing with this MacBook in general.

39:14.780 --> 39:18.040
But if I wanted to deploy these things on the regular or if I wanted to be able to quickly

39:18.040 --> 39:22.520
recover from some sort of hardware failure or hardware swap, it just doesn't seem like

39:22.520 --> 39:24.860
Mac OS is really suited for that.

39:24.860 --> 39:30.520
Then you got like, Windows has a Linux subsystem, Chrome now lets you run Linux apps.

39:30.520 --> 39:37.720
It'd be really nice if Apple acknowledged that Linux exists and that people are deploying

39:37.720 --> 39:39.840
to Linux servers in production.

39:39.840 --> 39:43.400
Like just accept that you don't sell the XServ anymore.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.740
Acknowledge your own iCloud data center is full of Linux boxes.

39:46.740 --> 39:50.880
Maybe even recognize that your own engineers are on Macs and they're deploying on Linux

39:50.880 --> 39:54.560
and could use a Linux subsystem or something, right?

39:54.560 --> 39:58.240
Something that makes Docker less of a piece of **** on Mac OS.

39:58.240 --> 40:01.240
Well, I think that's why Terminal and Rosetta work so well, right?

40:01.240 --> 40:05.400
And if you remember when they first demoed the M1s, they even showed that use case off.

40:05.400 --> 40:11.200
You know, for me, this last week, my work setup, because I was testing things on a Raspberry

40:11.200 --> 40:19.520
Pi compute module, was my Macbook on the table next to me, a headless compute module.

40:19.520 --> 40:25.020
And it was actually a pretty great setup because I was testing out different containerized

40:25.020 --> 40:29.520
applications that I was using for benchmarking for a self-hosted segment.

40:29.520 --> 40:34.360
And I was looking up the information on the Macbook, getting the URLs and stuff like that

40:34.360 --> 40:40.720
and had VS code using SFTP to connect to the compute module so I could edit all my Docker

40:40.720 --> 40:42.880
compose files and VS code hit save.

40:42.880 --> 40:47.500
And then I set iterm to do drop down terminal like I do in Linux, which is awesome.

40:47.500 --> 40:52.040
So I have like a Quake style drop down terminal and I would, you know, execute the Docker

40:52.040 --> 40:57.000
up, Docker compose up and whatever and, you know, I start testing stuff and I realized

40:57.000 --> 41:01.360
this is a pretty slick workflow and yeah, it sucks that I had to set up a separate machine

41:01.360 --> 41:07.240
that was an actual Linux box that had actual software on it, but you know, it's a $35 compute

41:07.240 --> 41:08.240
module.

41:08.240 --> 41:12.080
It took me like, it took me like a half hour to get the thing set up and going and then

41:12.080 --> 41:14.040
I, I've been using it for two weeks.

41:14.040 --> 41:15.040
It's amazing.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.040
Yeah.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.780
It really worked really well.

41:17.780 --> 41:20.960
So I mean, it's a, it's a dumb way to do it, but you could re you could recreate that

41:20.960 --> 41:25.480
with like a, a VPS or something like our VM machine as well, I suppose.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.960
In all, I know we've mentioned this before on the show, but I have to give an honorable

41:28.960 --> 41:32.200
mention to Parallels 17.

41:32.200 --> 41:37.760
I thought for sure I'd go on the new Mac and I'd use UTM, which is a free open source virtualizer

41:37.760 --> 41:44.160
for M1 hardware and it seems like it needs further investigation, but let me say the

41:44.160 --> 41:48.120
folks over at Parallels really hit it out of the park with Parallels 17.

41:48.120 --> 41:55.080
This thing shows up as essentially pass through hardware to the Linux guest, VFIO GPU pass

41:55.080 --> 41:58.120
through to the Parallels VM.

41:58.120 --> 42:04.880
So Linux, Linux is like full on given it it's all like it thinks everything's full 3d accelerated.

42:04.880 --> 42:11.040
And then what Parallels is doing is using the metal API to render the VFIO input that

42:11.040 --> 42:13.160
it got from the Linux guest.

42:13.160 --> 42:17.240
So you're getting a 3d rendered metal interface on top of that.

42:17.240 --> 42:25.600
And it screams, I mean, I'm talking full screen 4k resolution, Linux desktop environment,

42:25.600 --> 42:27.160
full 3d acceleration.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.160
Things looking great.

42:28.160 --> 42:31.760
I've got wobbly windows going just to see how far I can push it.

42:31.760 --> 42:35.600
And it absolutely top performance.

42:35.600 --> 42:40.040
The only downside is you have to use ARM images because if you want native performance, you

42:40.040 --> 42:42.280
have the whole stack has to be ARM.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.840
And there are less Linux ARM packages out there, but it's pretty, it's pretty good.

42:45.840 --> 42:46.840
It's pretty good.

42:46.840 --> 42:50.960
So you got to be willing to live with an ARM Linux desktop, but if you use Parallels 17

42:50.960 --> 42:54.000
and perhaps other virtualizers do this as well, I have not fully tested it.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.780
Once I got a rocking setup, I was like, why change the thing?

42:56.780 --> 43:02.840
This is, I actually dropped like a good chunk of change for Parallels after I had what I

43:02.840 --> 43:08.720
have described before as the fastest virtualized Linux experience ever.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.800
And I've even used it with GPU pass-through before.

43:10.800 --> 43:14.480
It is just as good as GPU pass-through, absolutely.

43:14.480 --> 43:20.720
And that to me was a huge game changer because it meant I didn't have to like have a limited

43:20.720 --> 43:24.020
experience when I try out the Linux desktop and a VM, if I want to just try something

43:24.020 --> 43:28.640
for a couple of hours, I can have a really good full 3D accelerated experience.

43:28.640 --> 43:30.240
Now I've still got my ThinkPad.

43:30.240 --> 43:35.760
I'm still using that for hardware, laptop tests, but you know, to have a quick 3D accelerated

43:35.760 --> 43:36.760
VM, yes, please.

43:36.760 --> 43:37.760
Thank you very much.

43:37.760 --> 43:39.960
Don't mind if I do at all.

43:39.960 --> 43:43.840
And UTM looks great, but Parallels 17, it was for me.

43:43.840 --> 43:48.360
Yeah, that's actually the same VM I use, but I have not tried it on the M1 yet.

43:48.360 --> 43:50.600
So there you go.

43:50.600 --> 43:54.560
That's my reaction to finally getting the M1 Max.

43:54.560 --> 43:58.920
Guess my takeaway would be, if I have one, is just get the Pro chip.

43:58.920 --> 44:00.840
If you get one, get the M1 Pro.

44:00.840 --> 44:01.840
That makes sense.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.120
Like what's taking advantage of the Max right now.

44:04.120 --> 44:07.600
And you know, we're having an M1 love fest here, but just a friendly reminder, if you

44:07.600 --> 44:15.200
need to use Visual Studio proper for Windows or older.NET development, the ARM chips are

44:15.200 --> 44:18.800
a deal breaker for you, even in the magic of Parallels.

44:18.800 --> 44:25.400
What would be a real game changer for me would be if I saw Linux ships with 3D accelerated

44:25.400 --> 44:30.480
support on the M1 Max, then I would really be over the moon with this laptop.

44:30.480 --> 44:34.400
It seems to me because of that's a very normal work case for me.

44:34.400 --> 44:37.460
That's a major way that this is limited.

44:37.460 --> 44:42.800
It's saved by the fantastic VM performance that is truly the best I've ever experienced.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.720
And it doesn't even put a load on the laptop.

44:44.720 --> 44:45.720
That's the other nice thing.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.920
It's like penalty free virtualization.

44:47.920 --> 44:54.520
I can have a VM going on a second desktop all day, all night, and I'm not penalized

44:54.520 --> 44:55.520
for it.

44:55.520 --> 44:56.640
There's still plenty of overhead.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.480
So that's really good to see.

44:58.480 --> 45:04.360
I hope as time goes on and Asahi Linux ports that this laptop will get even better and

45:04.360 --> 45:09.600
it'll become even more valuable to me because right now I'm very much in love with the physical

45:09.600 --> 45:10.600
hardware.

45:10.600 --> 45:12.200
It has a very special place.

45:12.200 --> 45:15.320
When I hold it, it still feels really special to me.

45:15.320 --> 45:20.240
And the performance for doing processing is just, it's mind blowing, just held back by

45:20.240 --> 45:21.240
Mac OS.

45:21.240 --> 45:24.760
And I think Apple could address that, but perhaps I won't have to wait.

45:24.760 --> 45:26.740
Perhaps the Asahi Linux team will address it.

45:26.740 --> 45:30.180
I'd love to hear anyone out there's take if they've gotten one, if they have any tips

45:30.180 --> 45:34.840
or experience, coder.show slash contact.

45:34.840 --> 45:37.080
Now I thought maybe we were going to get a little hardware update from you, but it seems

45:37.080 --> 45:39.440
like the journey continues on your end for your new hardware.

45:39.440 --> 45:40.440
The journey continues.

45:40.440 --> 45:43.480
I didn't get enough time with the holiday and the kid being off of school to really,

45:43.480 --> 45:46.420
to really open up the Pangolin.

45:46.420 --> 45:50.000
Next week for sure, I'll probably have a review up and I'm actually, spoiler alert, going

45:50.000 --> 45:54.960
to be trying out an XPS 13 in Windows and Linux.

45:54.960 --> 45:55.960
That's a thing, huh?

45:55.960 --> 45:56.960
That's a thing.

45:56.960 --> 45:57.960
Wow.

45:57.960 --> 45:58.960
That's a thing.

45:58.960 --> 45:59.960
One of the current ones, one of the new ones?

45:59.960 --> 46:00.960
Yeah.

46:00.960 --> 46:01.960
The brand new new ones.

46:01.960 --> 46:02.960
Yeah.

46:02.960 --> 46:03.960
Tis the season.

46:03.960 --> 46:04.960
It's the end of the year.

46:04.960 --> 46:05.960
Yes.

46:05.960 --> 46:06.960
Very good.

46:06.960 --> 46:07.960
Good.

46:07.960 --> 46:10.040
I'll be, I'll actually be really interested to hear that because I've always really liked

46:10.040 --> 46:11.040
the XPS 13.

46:11.040 --> 46:15.680
I felt like that's a good little piece of hardware and also a really good value.

46:15.680 --> 46:16.680
Yeah.

46:16.680 --> 46:18.520
This is, this is one of the, I mean, I don't want to extend it cause we'll talk about it

46:18.520 --> 46:19.520
next week, but.

46:19.520 --> 46:20.520
Sure.

46:20.520 --> 46:26.960
A purchase entirely driven by the fact that I can't successfully VM windows on the M1,

46:26.960 --> 46:29.400
which is just becoming more and more important.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.400
So.

46:30.400 --> 46:31.400
Well, very good.

46:31.400 --> 46:32.400
I look forward to that.

46:32.400 --> 46:33.400
Also, thank you to our members out there.

46:33.400 --> 46:37.080
Our Coder QA team who keeps this show going, supports the show and gets a limited ad feed

46:37.080 --> 46:41.680
and the Coderly report every quarter at Coder QA dot co.

46:41.680 --> 46:42.680
All right.

46:42.680 --> 46:43.680
Coder QA dot co.

46:43.680 --> 46:47.360
We'd love to have you support the show and thank you everybody who does go find Mike

46:47.360 --> 46:48.360
on Twitter.

46:48.360 --> 46:50.460
He's at Dumanuco and his company's at the mad botter ink.

46:50.460 --> 46:52.700
Is there anywhere else you'd like to send people this week?

46:52.700 --> 46:53.920
Go to Alice dot dev.

46:53.920 --> 46:57.360
If you want to get rid of some legacy data and move it to something new.

46:57.360 --> 46:58.440
I like it.

46:58.440 --> 46:59.960
Alice dot dev for that.

46:59.960 --> 47:01.960
I'm at Chris LAS on the Twitters.

47:01.960 --> 47:05.400
Oh, the network's at Jupiter signal and the show's at Coder radio show.

47:05.400 --> 47:07.320
Kind of getting tired of the Twitters.

47:07.320 --> 47:08.320
You know what?

47:08.320 --> 47:09.320
Join our telegram.

47:09.320 --> 47:10.640
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash telegram.

47:10.640 --> 47:11.640
How?

47:11.640 --> 47:14.600
There's also a matrix colony dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com.

47:14.600 --> 47:15.600
If you know Matrix, that's the server.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.240
Love to have you over there.

47:17.240 --> 47:21.540
Links to some of the stuff we talked about today at Coder dot show slash four four two.

47:21.540 --> 47:22.740
We're normally live on Mondays.

47:22.740 --> 47:26.640
We did this one as a special on Friday, but we'll be back at our regularly scheduled time

47:26.640 --> 47:29.520
and our regularly scheduled live day next week.

47:29.520 --> 47:34.800
So join us at three p.m. Eastern noon Pacific at JBLive dot TV.

47:34.800 --> 47:37.680
Thanks so much for joining us on this edition of the Coder radio program, and we'll see

47:37.680 --> 48:07.560
you right back here next week.
