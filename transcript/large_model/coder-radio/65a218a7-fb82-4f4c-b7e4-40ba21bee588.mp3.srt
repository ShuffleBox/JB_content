00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Kota Radio, episode 382 for October 5th, 2020.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello friends and welcome to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My name is Chris and joining us every week, established down there in his fortress of development, it is our host, Mr. Michael Dominic. Hello, Mike.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What's up? It's Florida. Let's do it live, which I guess means let's get an alligator and some warm beer. I don't know.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah. And speculate about what makes the tides come in and out.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I think that's what you guys do. You guys do that down there.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I know plenty of people down here who will absolutely tell you about why the whole round earth thing. That's nonsense. That's how they get you.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let me ask you something.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, God.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Is it even possible to work anymore? Are you getting anything done?

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm getting stuff done. I mean, you know, I'm working a strange schedule, but I feel like there's a that felt like a pregnant question.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What's what's going on there?

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I just feel like, you know, I mean, everything's so nutty.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There's just so much going on between election stuff and family stuff and your buddy with the hairdo in the hospital and just like all of the just there's so much.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It feels like there is a massive cognitive load just to existing right now.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not off my game completely, but I'm feeling like I'm drugged down.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Like, I feel like I'm a desktop operating system that's running 15 too many background tasks.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You know what I mean?

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Your Windows seven.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah. I'm trying to have my wizard installer check for an update while my firmware gets checked.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And also, by the way, there's an antivirus scan that needs to run.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I mean, it just feels like there's so much going on beyond just work right now.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't know. Maybe I successfully in the past have managed to just get incredible tunnel vision and just completely block out all the stuff that's going on.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But it feels like more than ever, it's harder to do that.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There's more craziness happening all the time and it's harder and harder to focus.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah. I mean, I would say due to issues primarily of like childcare and the inability to like take an hour off and go watch a baseball game somewhere or go to a driving range because for some reason that has become weird and hard.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And I just like you have to get a tea time for the driving range now, which is nuts to me.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But that's a whole other old man.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Mike complaints about golf.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We don't we don't need to go there, although our buddy is an avid golfer and I maybe should just fly to Mar-a-Lago.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You didn't mean to actually, I mean, infer that we would betray our golfing relationship with our buddy with the hairdo.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Like, we can't talk about that on air.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Obviously, no, never. I mean, we were actually contractually obligated to only golf at certain resorts beginning with a tee.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I guess what I'm saying is, I don't know, damn it, Mike, it feels like there's a hell of a lot going on.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We haven't even gotten to the holidays yet, which always are productivity stealers.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And on top of that, it's taking me forever to just get certain things done.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I guess I'm feeling a little I'm feeling a little salty because in your parlance, I had a product launch last night.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And then I had to roll it back immediately because I realized I had so much going on that I had made one fundamental assumption that was wrong.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I mean, I had this thing all lined up. I even I had a mention for it in Linux Action News and everything.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And oh, that's the thing you pulled back.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah. Well, there was an announcement that we made Linux Action News that I had to cut.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, we record the episode. We even release it. I'm such an idiot. I'm so dumb.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm such a stupid man that I thought that I could I have everything done and lined up by the time the show went out.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So I stopped recording, say, let's just stop recording around 2 p.m.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Show's going to go out at 7 p.m. I know I can get this done. I'll have it all ready.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But the problem was, I made one fundamental assumption about how something technically works on this platform provider.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And we got everything done and lined up, all queued up to execute.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And I got to the point where I needed to flip the switch.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
At some point in my head, I made a shift without realizing it, too.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I need to supply the feeds to this thing so I can start doing that.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I at some point just in my head thought I solved the problem and assumed I knew what the answer was and forgot to check my math.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And by the time we got to it last night, it was 9 p.m.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I had been working on all day. I realized my screw up.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I had to go pull the episode of Linux Action News and recut.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Joe had already gone to bed, who's the normal editor.

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And I went and got the source file and recut it and republished it myself because he wasn't going to be up until, you know, the next morning.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And had to just scratch all the work, all the work, all of it.

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And I don't know, I just I feel like I got too much has been going on and I wasn't able to focus properly.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And I made a couple of assumptions because I'm going quick and I'm running gun and doing it live.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Tides come in, times tides come out. Can't explain that style.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And I messed up and I wasted an evening of my time, Wes's time, my wife's time.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Like, I just I don't know. I blew it, you know.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, I mean, that's and you obviously feel that the cognitive weight of, you know, 2020 being in a bit anyway.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I mean, I'm looking at I'm kind of looking at where I make my mistakes and realize, OK, I made an assumption here.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I didn't spend enough time researching this there.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I think why that happened, you know, it's no doubt it's relaunching the business, spinning all that up.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And that's just been a huge effort. But I think, too, it's just 2020 is such a shit show that it's become distracting.

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And it took my eye off the ball. Just feel bad. Feel bad for wasting people's time.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I feel dumb for making an assumption when I had identified that as an issue I needed to look into.

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But then at some point, just I don't know how I made that mistake. I just thought I had taken care of it.

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And oh, man, presumably it's a relatively fixable mistake.

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So, yeah, well, I mean, I just have to come up with another way to do what I wanted to do, which I'll get there.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But it's not ideal and create some additional problems that we have to solve.

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And yeah. Yeah. But it's all you know, it's all complicated.

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
One day I'll get it all fixed and I'll talk about it. And, you know, it would have actually fixed your problem.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Right. I don't want to leak what the thing is. If you were running on SUSE.

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, man. Yeah. So first of all, I suppose also apologies to Jonathan Meek this week, who burnt his chicken after listening to our show.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're really taking a lot of hits from the audience since we came back, man.

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I know. I know. You know, it's because I got spicy with the SUSE take and I thought this would be the safe space for it.

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, I love that he's out there barbecuing, listening to the show.

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And he got so wrapped up in our SUSE take that his chicken burned. The rest of his meal turned out all right.

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Jordan wrote in here. I feel like maybe he's with me. He says he's sick of that old SUSE smell.

86
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He says, I have an old used old unsupported version of open SUSE at my job.

87
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I have to use it every day. None of our clients use open SUSE, but we have to support it internally for reasons that are frankly unknown to me and possibly not knowable.

88
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Things are just easier on Ubuntu and fun. But Jordan stuck using SUSE every day. So he's with me on it.

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I tried to make good, Mike, when I said I also recognize there's other distributions that are very popular that I don't use.

90
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And I didn't do it. You know, like I tried to make an equivalence to Alpine because I know Alpine Linux has tons of uses as a as a base for a Docker container or other containers.

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And so it's got potentially millions of deployments. But I don't have a single system that's running Alpine right now, except for a next cloud container that didn't satisfy the SUSE hounds.

92
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think they're technically lizards, but keep moving. I get you. Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. Yeah, right. Sorry.

93
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So I don't know how to dig myself out of this hole. I feel like two things can be true.

94
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I feel like it can be a functional workhorse operating system that has good engineering and ideas behind it,

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:36,000
while also being an esoteric branch of Linux that has a lot of oddities that you don't find on other systems and also doesn't have the wide range of support that things like Red Hat or Ubuntu or Debian have.

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And it doesn't have the documentation that Arch has. So I feel like those things both can be true.

97
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I hope that position is amenable to everybody, because I don't discredit your use of it.

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I just think maybe if you had another choice or another chance or were building your infrastructure today, you just probably wouldn't use it.

99
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You think that'll solve it? You know, somehow I don't.

100
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You got me on a spicy day. What can I say? I was up late last night with a failed launch.

101
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Honestly, if you're throwing a fake news in there or like, oh, the failing SUSE distro. See, now I'm going to get you all that again.

102
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Right. Everybody knows. I tell you what, you know, off the air, I was kind of teasing that that teenage boy came to my house with the oversized MAGA hat campaigning.

103
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah. You know, he's actually very effective. Very on my mind, the big T right now.

104
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's true. Well, yeah. Yeah. And that's what I'm saying.

105
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That is my point is that it's things because because the political situation is so ludicrous in the US, it's more distracting than it normally is.

106
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I feel like it's on the mind more than it normally is. It's on the mind.

107
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah. When you've got ADD, it's really a trick. It's like somebody is like spamming your brain.

108
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But we'll get to the spamming here in a moment. We've been getting a lot of emails about the coder challenge, so I feel like there's something here.

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And I got an idea. I'm like, I want to pass by it. So this one came in from Sean and he wants to recommend foot Hark.

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's F-U-T-H-A-R-K language foot Hark.

111
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He wanted to hear a take on it, maybe do a challenge, have West try it out.

112
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And I think, you know, we probably will do that. The problem is, is we don't want to like overstay our welcome with West because he has a day job now.

113
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And it's a Monday that we recorded this show. Monday in the middle of the day in the West Coast.

114
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So like we want to do it, but we want to like, you know, give them time and prep them.

115
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So I thought maybe we'd flip the script on the coding challenges for a little bit while we will do them.

116
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What if in the meantime, every now and then, because we get we get basically some that come in on an ongoing basis.

117
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What if we tossed a couple out there for the audience to try it out and then send us in a contact submission with a report?

118
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It doesn't need to be a book. Just your thoughts on what made that language of the week stand out or the one we're trying that week at least.

119
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And what your thoughts are on it. But could even just be several bullet points with like a paragraph.

120
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The shorter, the better in some cases. And we could take some of these suggestions we get in of these really cool esoteric languages and you could try it out.

121
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And we could try it here with foot Hark or whatever it is, which is a small programming language designed to be compiled to efficient parallel code.

122
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's statically typed data parallel and has a purely functional array language.

123
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And it comes with a heavily optimized ahead of time compiler that presently generates GPU code via CUDA and open CL.

124
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The language itself is hardware agnostic, and so it can run on multi-core CPUs or single core CPUs or well, so on.

125
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So it could be kind of something pretty neat. It's not designed for graphics programming,

126
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
but instead uses compute power of the GPU to accelerate data parallel array computations.

127
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So if anybody out there would have a use for something like this and could give us their take on it, this could be an opportunity.

128
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We'll have a link in the show notes. That could be a thing. It could be a thing we do on the show. What do you think, Mike?

129
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I like it. It allows West to remain employed, which I can't speak for West, but I would be willing to bet is important to him.

130
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And it protects me from languages with names that sound like they're straight out of Lovecraft.

131
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I know. I can't even say it.

132
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Here's a question. Was this invented at the University of R'lyeh? Because, you know, it seems like it could have been.

133
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Or it could be also like some Star Wars alien character. Like it could be some Star Wars Lord, too. I could see it being a world in Star Wars or something.

134
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's actually what Jar Jar renamed himself after ruining everything.

135
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So we'll have that linked in the show notes where you can check it out and then drop us a contact form with your take.

136
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't know, maybe from there we take one that seems like it really got people's interest going and then we like escalate that up to an actual official challenge.

137
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And then, you know, there's lead up time and all that. And that could be a fun way.

138
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So we're going to like randomly pick languages and toss them out?

139
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, no, people got to send them in. Oh, OK.

140
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You know, like so far, all the challenge submissions have really been from the audience for the most part recently.

141
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I mean, initially you guys came up with some, right? But you see, we keep getting some from time to time.

142
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Like that's I see. Yeah. So throw them out there when we get them. See what people think.

143
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Squirrely Dave writes in and he's leaning towards Rust. Hey, guys, new listener.

144
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I found the show through everyone's favorite feed, the Jupiter Broadcasting all shows feed.

145
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I think that's something we should be talking about more as a network is the all shows feed because as we've gone independent, we've relaunched shows.

146
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Some stuff is in the works. And if you like what we're doing, the all show feeds is obvious.

147
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He says, I'm an infrastructure person for my day job, and the real extent of my coding knowledge is pretty limited,

148
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
essentially just PowerShell, Bash, Python and the like. Nothing wrong with that at all.

149
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And he goes on to say, I don't see myself shifting my career to software development,

150
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
but I would like to learn a low level programming language for my own personal knowledge.

151
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And because I'd like to be able to contribute back to the open source community and maybe one day develop a few things for myself.

152
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm leaning towards learning Rust, but I wonder if one of the C languages or something else would be a better choice.

153
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Thanks, Squirrely Dave. Leaning towards Rust. Do we dare steer him a different direction?

154
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Well, he did say C languages, so I am contractually obligated to say why not Objective C?

155
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I was almost going to set you up for it.

156
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I tick the box. No, Rust is a great choice. We have a lot of bacon these episodes, but I got to fry some bacon.

157
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This is bacon from the young MAGA lad who came to my house.

158
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, by the way, this is why you should listen to the live stream.

159
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
There was an entire story about a young man canvassing for MAGA who was very confused.

160
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yep. JBlive.tv on a Monday.

161
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I still don't believe that all these people tweeting about Rust, claiming to be doing Rust, aren't in fact doing much Rust.

162
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The reason I don't believe it is I can't find non-Apple, because Apple is using Rust now and Google, whatever,

163
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
non-places like that that are really hiring for Rust in large numbers.

164
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Also, there's just not a ton of outside of the core Rust projects and the core cargo packages.

165
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Now, I understand that I'm going to get 20 emails a la GitHub repos, because somebody is going to show me some that are,

166
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
but I'm just not seeing a lot of actual action.

167
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But that big asterisk, for some reason, I mean, Rust is great, I like Rust, but Rust is having this moment right now.

168
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
If you want to flex on Twitter and not be like that guy this week who said you have to use only keyboard shortcuts

169
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
or else you suck, he got attacked so fast, because why you would say that on Twitter is beyond me.

170
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But if you like one of the kind of subtle flex that you're awesome.

171
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah, I mean, tweet about Rust, learn Rust, do Rust.

172
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm still not sure how much of this is like actually happening in the real world.

173
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But yeah, I mean, and if you are like some shop doing Rust as like your thing, right.

174
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I would love to talk to you and to understand how did that happen?

175
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Because, you know, Rust isn't new, new, but it's not, you know, it's not Python old, right?

176
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So, yeah, I don't know. But yeah, it's a great new language to learn.

177
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's the new hotness. I would always, always recommend that you learn Rust because I'm afraid of crap people.

178
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I kind of do feel like where you're seeing a lot of traction is in open source and in the really kind of non flashy infrastructure layer of operating systems and tools that are being built recently.

179
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So any projects that started in the last couple of years that are building for cloud infrastructure, I think a lot of them are using Rust.

180
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Of course, my best example of this is Amazon and Microsoft, but I'm sure there are others.

181
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But I don't really see very much in, well, one, the mobile space.

182
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And I don't really see much in the sense of the consumer space that's very, that's very rusty.

183
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So I guess I kind of see where you're coming from because I think the other thing that job openings would kind of indicate to you, Mike, would be more of those dark matter developers that we just love to talk about.

184
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And those positions I don't think are Rust developers.

185
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I've been saying that for weeks is I think when you look at who people are hiring for and you want to get a day job with medical and a cubicle and they buy you a computer and you just you want to get a jobby job, probably pretty low chance you're going to be doing Rust.

186
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Which is super weird to me, though, right? Because unlike mission critical scenarios like medical, the safety guaranteed by Rust and I know it doesn't prevent human error and coding bad logic.

187
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But that's almost seems like the ideal vertical, right?

188
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah, it's just, you know, the problem there, of course, is that is such a slow ship to turn corporate development.

189
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I mean, it's because it's you got you got the structure, you've got the development process, you've got PMOs, you know, it's just so solidified.

190
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That's true. LWN had an article on August 31st about supporting Linux development, Linux kernel development in Rust.

191
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So they're looking at it there, too. If you're curious out there in the audience, if you look up Alex Gaynor and Linux kernel, you'll see a talk on YouTube from the Linux Security Summit from last year.

192
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Where they focused on some of the security things that they thought would be improved if they reworked certain aspects of the kernel in Rust.

193
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't really know, though, how far it goes. Really Linus Torvalds and other core kernel maintainers, they've expressed some interest, but it seems like no real traction has taken.

194
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There were some proposals and discussions in the most recent Linux Plumbers Conference, and it didn't really gain a lot of traction there either.

195
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
There was a session, but I don't know. So we'll see where it goes.

196
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But it seems like if you wanted to get low level and you wanted to get into the nitty gritty of systems and you expected that work to be taking place, you know, in a couple of years as you gained experience, it probably today would be smart to start in Rust.

197
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But if you wanted to go create a web application or a mobile application or something that's in the average enterprise day job space, I don't think it's Rust.

198
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'll put a link to the article about supporting Linux kernel development in Rust from LWN if people want to read more.

199
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What I'm taking from this, Mike, is and tell me if I'm characterizing you wrong, is you're more I guess you could use the term bearish on Rust and I'm a little more bullish on Rust.

200
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, no, I'm bullish on it. Are you? Yeah. So but your point about the enterprise, right, the corporate development, I think that is what I'm seeing, that I expected much more, you know, insurance company adoption, stuff like that.

201
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And I'm just not seeing it, you know, anecdotally. But I think you're right. Your whole thing about the ship being slow to turn, it may just be that those type because, you know what, they're just adopting like rails two years ago.

202
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So I was just going to say, like, it's the hot new thing for them still. It's very exciting for me. Yeah, that's fair.

203
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So sorry, right. Or disregard everything I said and still go ahead and do rust, unless, of course, you want to walk the path of enlightenment with some brackets. Little X code, of course.

204
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah. And ship an app on on the Apple ecosystem for at least another couple of years. You know, a mutual friend of ours who may be named wimpy.

205
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Let me know that the new step is still around and functioning. I was going to save this for later in the show, but it's true. Yeah. And I think there have you seen Darlene, which is a Mac OS translation layer for Linux.

206
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I have seen Darlene. Do you know what else I see? The I Mac Pro right in front of me.

207
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You think in Linux on the I Mac Pro using Darlene to run Mac apps? I'm thinking when this thing is immediately obsolete in three weeks or two weeks by a thousand dollar arm laptop and I start crying about it every week.

208
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You get an arm machine of Linux or Mac and you just emulate or virtualize both operating systems.

209
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The bet is that the arm processors are so fast that there will be no cost to that. Right. Yeah. Although I don't know if they're going to be particularly good at emulating X86 instructions, despite how fast they are.

210
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah, I wonder. I think this Darlene project is getting a lot of attention this week because it promises a lot.

211
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It essentially promises wine for Mac OS apps on Linux. However, and this is kind of a big, however, there's no GUI support right now.

212
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I would say it promises a lot. Right. Come with me tonight and I'll marry you in the morning kind of thing. Yes. Yeah, it's. And if you get that reference, well, then you're above the age of the MAGA canvasser.

213
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It also promises iOS apps running on Linux, which sounds again, these all feel like the type of things that Apple will just not let you do.

214
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Find ways to make hard. So I am not excited about Darlene. Yeah, it is neat that it exists. And if you had a couple of essential Mac OS command line applications that you needed to run on Linux, it may be there.

215
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You may you may take a look at it. Darlene HQ dot org or we'll have a link in the show notes for it.

216
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But I did see people talking about in the chat room this morning. It's getting some attention.

217
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's just it's a long road to haul. And Apple's move away from X86 probably isn't going to make this stuff any easier, especially as they can start to come to require components in their in their CPUs.

218
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So could we take a fast Apple silicon detour? Let's do it. Did you see those alleged benchmarks that came out?

219
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
No, I don't know if I did see them. Well, there's a lot of folks who might have Xeons or I nines that are going to be a little verklempt.

220
00:22:47,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And if you dropped, I don't know, the cost of a Subaru on a Mac Pro recently waves to John Syracuse, you are going to be sad within a year or two.

221
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It looks like, huh? Yeah. Yeah. That doesn't surprise me too much, just based on on the performance they can get.

222
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You know, like I was just telling this to to West last night when we were here in the studio working and we were using the Nvidia Shield and it was kind of getting leggy.

223
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And I said to him, he said, you know, I've got an Apple TV that's two or three generations behind.

224
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's like the one before they had one that had 4K. So maybe it's a little black box, but it's not very it's not very new.

225
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And it's still consistently faster than any Android device that I own.

226
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And I just you can't really as a consumer on the outside who's not building these things fully appreciate just the massive advantage their CPUs brought them.

227
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And it's it's obvious in a stupid Apple TV versus a almost brand new Nvidia Shield.

228
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And I thought when we were talking about that, I was like, you know, this is going to translate to performance in those laptops, too.

229
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
He's like, yeah, yeah, probably will. And I can see it and I can see that's why it's going to draw a lot of developers.

230
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I was kind of raising that flag because I think Linux Linux is looking really good.

231
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Lots of good laptops to choose from, the Ubuntu desktop and pop and all of that's in really good shape. But developers love performance.

232
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I love performance. I want it to be as fast as possible.

233
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And in 2025, when we can actually see each other again, battery life.

234
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah, right. For when you start traveling again. Yeah, very true.

235
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:31,000
But don't you think Nvidia will be all too happy to sell like Dell and System 76 and whoever makes Linux laptops, you know, just like a fancy knockoff of Apple Silicon?

236
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah, I think that's probably a fair statement. I could see that unless there's some like voodoo that Apple has going that they can't.

237
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But I don't know. All problems can be solved with money. Right. Nvidia is not poor. They can figure this out.

238
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah, they could. They could figure it out. They could. Nobody's executed yet. Qualicom, Samsung.

239
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
They've tried. They've been trying for years. Right. And we're making the wild assumption that like Apple Silicon is going to be awesome.

240
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Right. I don't believe this, but certainly it is theoretically possible that it's a bust.

241
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I find that unlikely, but I think it's a foregone conclusion that the performance will be good because if you'd look at the different devices in every single category, Apple is just crushing the performance for that device category.

242
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:27,000
So we just talked about like the iPads and the Apple TV, but look at the Apple Watch. That sucker, that super expensive watch that is outdated every single year is sitting in a 55 percent market share.

243
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
They have crushed every other wearable. It's now the most popular watch.

244
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:45,000
They are the most popular watchmaker in the world now. And the reason is, is because the Apple Silicon chips in the watch make the Android watches just look like dogs.

245
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
They're just so slow. And I've I've I've bought more of those watches than I'd like to admit. I'm a Pebble owner.

246
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But the truth is, the Apple Watch has dominated the market and it is absolutely in part in part due to software, but it is also in part due to hardware and just their massive lead in performance and battery life there.

247
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's going to stop you when you you mean smartwatch. They're not the number one watch. Like what would happen at Timex?

248
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Actually, you know what? I don't know. We should check that because I think actually it's number one watchmaker, period.

249
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Wow. He's in traditional. I know. I know. It's sickening, isn't it? Says the guy wearing an Apple Watch right now.

250
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Apple is the number one watchmaker. Traditional watchmakers are afraid. Apple has announced it is now the biggest watchmaker in the world, replacing Rolex at the top of that list.

251
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Wow. You wouldn't. No way. You wouldn't believe how old this is. They have been the number one watchmaker in the world since 2017.

252
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Wow. OK, Apple's takes your treasure and drinks your milkshake.

253
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Got it. I mean, they've just they've wiped the floor. And you know what? I worry that their silicon will give them that advantage in the laptop space, too.

254
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So last few weeks, there's been like a weird undercurrent with you and Apple Silicon where it sounds like you're kind of scared for the Linux vendors.

255
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Like, yeah. Is that really what it is? Yeah. Yeah, it is. And only because I just I've watched this game play out once before when Apple switched to X86.

256
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
There was just we talked about it. There was just a massive exodus to the Mac platform.

257
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It landed at the same time there was desktop environment changes. But I lost a lot of Linux brothers and sisters that day.

258
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And I think the market made a huge shift towards MacBooks as standard.

259
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And then that led to the revolution in office places where developers could go start working at a company and they could get a Mac instead of a Windows machine.

260
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It was almost Linux. We were like we were in striking distance.

261
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What year was this? It was really when Apple started releasing MacBooks.

262
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It took a little it took a couple of years after the X86 transition, but it really kind of started around the X86 announcement when Apple transitioned to Intel processors.

263
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And once they started getting the MacBooks out with the new design, the new MacBook name and all of that, it just it just shifted.

264
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And, you know, I saw it because I go to these events and at first I just sort of wrote it off.

265
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But it got to the point where we'd start counting how many machines were Linux because the rest were all just Mac.

266
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And I don't know. I just feel like that that Apple executed that transition extremely well.

267
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
They made the machines a compelling workhorse when they switched to X86.

268
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
This time around, they have all of those lessons and you see it reflects somewhat in their approach.

269
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
They're making a lot of efforts to make virtualization a top tier feature, I guess, of Mac OS of Linux.

270
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Right. To run Linux specifically. Yeah, yeah.

271
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I mean, I don't know. I'm I guess less doom and gloom about it.

272
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
One, I care a lot less than you. Right.

273
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Because I'm kind of like, you know, it's OK if people switch to stop operating systems and you can even go back and forth.

274
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Right. I guess what I feel like is going to happen is Apple's going to eat everybody's lunch for about a year or two.

275
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And then Nvidia, because now they own ARM, I just can't see a world where like Dell doesn't come back swinging.

276
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I just I guess I can't see it. Right. That business meeting is the most obvious thing that needs to happen.

277
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You know, sit down with the Dell people. OK, we need a developer workhorse.

278
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And it's not like anybody loves Intel. Right.

279
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Maybe they go AMD, but I'm pretty sure these Apple Silicon chips are also going to eat AMD's lunch in terms of mobile performance and battery life.

280
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:33,000
There is another scenario and scenario B is so much development is the net result is running on x86.

281
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's running on cloud servers, VPS is whatever EC2 that's x86 based.

282
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And some developers, maybe a lot, will look at that and go, well, I'd rather just keep my entire workflow on x86 where I'm developing the application via x86.

283
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And then when I deploy, it's on x86. And I could see that playing against Apple.

284
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And maybe it won't be a big issue, but I feel like they'll have mechanisms to solve that.

285
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
People can SSH into cloud boxes that are a super good price.

286
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Like there's a lot of ways around that issue.

287
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Well, and like Microsoft is helping them get Java over to compatibility for Apple Silicon for this reason, right?

288
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Because they sell a bunch of Azure. A lot of people run Java applications.

289
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So how long does it take them to port everything over, like all the Unix utilities you use a year?

290
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I bet a lot of it happens in the first few months because Apple is is contributing upstream to projects to help them port.

291
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
A lot of the underlying tools are getting code submissions from Apple engineers.

292
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I mean, I think your main line development platforms like your rails, your Python, your, you know, Java, obviously, I think that's all going to be day one.

293
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah, it's your more esoteric stuff like whatever that Lovecraftian language was from the feedback section is going to be more problematic.

294
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yes, exactly. Very much. That's exactly what I think. And that'll be the edge cases that take a year or two or just never even make the transition.

295
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Well, it'll be just like, you know, how Flash gracefully transition. Oh, no.

296
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Linode.com slash coder. Get a one hundred dollars, sixty day credit on a new account and spin up a server on Linode's dime.

297
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Linode is a fully independent cloud hosting provider with eleven markets around the world.

298
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:24,000
They've been running since two thousand and three, which if you're doing the math, that means they've been around three years before AWS and they're one hundred percent independent.

299
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
That's a nice reliability I can count on as a business owner myself.

300
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And Linode has been around since essentially user mode Linux was a thing.

301
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So that's a really long time because they saw that as an opportunity to build something like Linode.

302
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And that's how long they've been involved. But as the years have gone on, they've gotten more and more competitive.

303
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
They've been able to take advantages of hardware efficiencies and software efficiencies.

304
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And now you can get a little plan starting at five dollars a month.

305
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And with our one hundred dollars, sixty day credit. Well, you could play around with something a lot more powerful than the five dollar a month rig.

306
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
They've got dedicated CPU and GPU systems.

307
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
We're spinning up a system last night for this thing that we were trying to do.

308
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And we're sitting there doing the math and comparing to what we have run physically.

309
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And it's impressive the cost savings.

310
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
In fact, when you go to Linode dot com slash coder, they make it really easy to try out their total cost of ownership calculator.

311
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You can plug your workloads into that and get an idea of what the cost is going to be.

312
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So there's no surprises. It's really easy to understand.

313
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
They have a marketplace full of apps that you can run on your Linode's.

314
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,000
They have stack scripts that you can modify or just take advantage of to set up and redeploy something really quickly.

315
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Nice and easy to manage storage, too.

316
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And they give you all the commands you need to get up and working with some new feature you add.

317
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So I added a disk to one of my Linode's the other night.

318
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:56,000
After I add that disk, the next screen that comes up is the next four or five commands I'm likely going to want to run on my host operating system to either mount or format it.

319
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's those little things that they know because they're Linux users that they take care of.

320
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And with the support combined with the incredibly fast network connections and the really easy to use dashboard, managing your infrastructure, getting the server set up or getting the server updated.

321
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Those are not the things you struggle with.

322
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You can focus on the work on the job.

323
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You can get that done and Linode will take care of the infrastructure.

324
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And because they cost 30 to 50 percent less than the major cloud providers like AWS, they're also not going to break the bank.

325
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And you can get started with that one hundred dollar credit to see what I've been talking about.

326
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It's my cloud provider. It's Jupiter Broadcasting's cloud provider.

327
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And I think you're going to love it.

328
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Go to Linode.com slash Coder and receive a one hundred dollar 60 day credit towards your new account. And thanks to Linode for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

329
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
That's Linode.com slash Coder.

330
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Now, Mr. Dominic, what do you say we get into a little hoopla?

331
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And the one that the chat room has been asking about, the one that kind of has to come front and center is the Hacktoberfest drama.

332
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And I liked your take on it, actually.

333
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Your initial take, I thought, was actually the most on point.

334
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And that was people are really, really reacting strong this year.

335
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
In fact, you and I were going back and forth on and trying to figure out what is it about this year's Hacktoberfest that has people so worked up?

336
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Because when you look at the projects, unless I'm wrong, Mike, it's like the high end.

337
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
They were getting a dozen pull requests a day on the high end.

338
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And that's not great, but it's not like we're talking tens of thousands of spam requests here.

339
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I think a little background, right?

340
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So for folks who don't know what the hell we're talking about, Hacktoberfest is an event that it's GitHub and it's a Dio that does it.

341
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I think it's just Dio and GitHub.

342
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm not sure if anybody else participates, but I know it started about four, no, seven years ago.

343
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Yeah, because we were doing the show and it's worked basically fine as far as I know for however long it's been going except for this year.

344
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And the whole deal is they want to encourage people, particularly, you know, people who aren't so involved in the open source community to get involved, right?

345
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
To contribute.

346
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And the deal is you got to find you find an open source project that you're interested in on GitHub.

347
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You do something hopefully valuable.

348
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You make a pull request.

349
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And huzzah, you get a T-shirt.

350
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Yeah, as a reward, you get issued some digital ocean swag.

351
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And that was fine.

352
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So Chris, you can correct me if I'm wrong.

353
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
My understanding is there's some like YouTube dude, you know, some some young, young, young fella.

354
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Kids these days, right?

355
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Kids these days.

356
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Video.

357
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Doing some kind of what do you call it?

358
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Like a like a video cast.

359
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Oh, I'm going to throw up.

360
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
He was trying to demonstrate how to do a pull request on GitHub.

361
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And he was talking about Hacktoberfest.

362
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And in his demo, he did like a, you know, just like a I don't know, I think he like put an awesome project or something.

363
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Well, I guess the youngins are watching the YouTubes and watching this guy because apparently a lot of people just started spamming projects and putting like in the read me dot mark down awesome project grow or something like that.

364
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Yeah, really, really obvious, like just trying to do the basic requirements to get free thing.

365
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I don't know, as someone who has been yelled at in the Ubuntu forums in the past life, I'm sort of.

366
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah, you need to go first because mine is going to be too spicy.

367
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah. All right.

368
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I mean, I can I can appreciate some of the load this puts on projects.

369
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I mean, I was just griping about too much to do funny.

370
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So the way this came on my radar first is a open source developer that you and I are both familiar with.

371
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
He contacted me and said, I don't know what is going on, but I'm just getting all this junk on my project this morning.

372
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's so weird. It's really annoying.

373
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And he was grousing about it because every time somebody puts in a poll request, it sends out everybody who's monitoring and watching that project and it generates a whole bunch of traffic and then they go and check it.

374
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And it's just like waste. Like it quickly escalates how many people's time that it wastes.

375
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So the effects are cumulative. And that was part of the complaint, which I can totally get that.

376
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And I totally do appreciate how annoying it is to essentially get like a spam poll request.

377
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,000
The problem is and I love my buddies at D.O., but initially they made a mistake in their response.

378
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They kind of had a nonchalant like not really our problem.

379
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Nothing we can really do about it.

380
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
People can make poll requests that we can't stop them from making poll requests.

381
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And they kind of just shrugged it off.

382
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
They did quickly, but maybe not quickly enough, change.

383
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:41,000
But before they pivoted in their opinion and decided to make this thing an opt in exercise, it really started to roll on Twitter.

384
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It quickly started getting called shittoberfest, which is kind of funny.

385
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And people started taking screenshots of all of the obnoxious comments that people were making.

386
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:02,000
You know, some of them are really, like you said, great a project or amazing project, you know, like just really basic comments that they've added to the code or whatever.

387
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And I do understand how annoying that is.

388
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
DigitalOcean did come out and say, OK, OK, OK, we got you. We're going to make it opt in.

389
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You have to add the metadata to your repo. We'll only include the ones that have that metadata.

390
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's going to be OK. But by that time, the damage had been done.

391
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And you got to wonder if there's going to be a hacktoberfest next year.

392
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
There probably will be, but maybe they'll scale it down to like projects that they support.

393
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Who knows? So, OK, time to get spicy. All right.

394
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Couple of priors here. One, I do something like this twice a year, but I give away a failure.

395
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And I make the kids do like a lot more work. Right.

396
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Like you have to actually build something that works. And like there's always a theme.

397
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I always do it on Earth Day. And this year I did it for the election for the Fourth of July.

398
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It is a pain in the butt. Right. The grumpy open source people are right.

399
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You know what? I have to assume that most of the people sending these spam messages are like students or just young people.

400
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
YouTube's. Yeah, because YouTube's.

401
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And like, yeah, like it is. It's a young person thing to do, not to be mean about it.

402
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I was a young person. I understand. I get that kind of crap when I do my competitions, which is like fine.

403
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You just ignore it on the other side.

404
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You know, 11 months out of the year, the biggest complaint, I think both of you, you and I hear from folks, particularly in like the Fosse Linux communities.

405
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But even like the, you know, the apples, Apple devs, stuff like that is it's so hard to get these new developers, these young people to contribute and get involved with open source.

406
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's such a such a bear. How do we make it?

407
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You know, all this stuff about don't make gatekeeping comments, right? Gatekeeping is now the new thing that people yell at you on Twitter.

408
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It seems like you're gatekeeping. Right. And we have to be more welcoming, more inviting, more open.

409
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
OK, so 11 months out of the year, that's your thing.

410
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And then you get mildly annoyed and freak out.

411
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I kind of don't get it. Now, if you were to say, you know, it is not my project or my responsibility to make the broader community more open.

412
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I don't want to deal with that. Then, yeah, sure. Just ignore it, you know, and be mad.

413
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But what is the point of doing all this evangelism, trying to do all this mentoring and getting young people involved in open source if you can't even tolerate like minor annoyance?

414
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It would be like if you can't listen to crying or whining or brattiness, then maybe you shouldn't have kids.

415
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I guess it all depends on scale. Optimus Gray in the chat room saying there are thirty nine thousand three hundred and forty five issues open on GitHub with Hacktoberfest.

416
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah, it's a lot of people. Apparently kids really like T-shirts.

417
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Or how would you solve this problem, Chris? Because you know what? Hacktoberfest has worked.

418
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Right. We've had a year over year, many stories of young folks having like their first experience engaging with the open source communities.

419
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, what would you do? I got to tell you, requiring the metadata of the project to have Hacktoberfest in it.

420
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
If they do that next year, that's going to dramatically drop participation.

421
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Yeah. Well, that's why they haven't done opt in before. But now it seems like they're going to have to.

422
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:29,000
This is a tricky one because you can look at this as open source developers kind of snipping at somebody who's been a big supporter and a friend open source provided a lot of encouragements, monetary encouragement, you know, hosting.

423
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You could also look at it as and this is where I think this is this is where the story straight into.

424
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And I think what we've uncovered here is actually a much bigger problem that was just really brought to light because of the scale that DigitalOcean can bring to something like this.

425
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But, you know, I have friends in the Linux community who are always trying to come up with new ways to help developers, help them out.

426
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And a lot of times they don't appreciate how hard the developer's job is, how busy they are and how trying to help can sometimes actually just create a lot more work.

427
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And you see this a lot with Linux because people are so appreciative of the great free software they get.

428
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:31,000
You know, you get a desktop. It's got a desktop environment. It's got a great web browser. It's got a great office suite. And you realize individuals built these things and you just feel so immensely grateful for some people.

429
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And they want to help by finding bugs and filing bug reports and maybe encouraging lots of people.

430
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And now some of these people who just love Linux so much, an open source and free software, they now have a following on YouTube as time has gone on.

431
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And now they have potentially thousands or even tens of thousands of people who follow them.

432
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And so when they say, let's all go do something, it creates a DDoS.

433
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And they're just trying to help, you know, just trying to help bring up the quality of your of your project or help file bugs or, you know, whatever it is, it ends up creating a shit storm of work for the developer.

434
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And I had to think about this recently because I decided to do a bugathon on Linux Unplugged and I was like, I don't want to do it in a way where all of a sudden I create a thousand bug reports for a project and they just have no means of handling it.

435
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And they just sit there open all the time.

436
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So what I did is I looked at the project and I looked at what the developer's timetable was for Fedora 33.

437
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And I saw where there was a test window a week where they were asking the public to submit bugs and they as a team were all bug testing. They were all dogfooding as a team for this week.

438
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I took that idea and I said, well, that's what we aim for. We aim for the bug week. We contacted the developers.

439
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
We worked with a couple of people in the project and we said, this is when we're doing it.

440
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:56,000
We prepared them for it. And then a couple of them joined us during the live stream and we did it with them during a bugathon, that bugathon during a testing week.

441
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And I took so many precautions because I didn't want to essentially DDoS them.

442
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And I think this happens a lot by accident because some of these projects got one one person and we don't mean to hurt them.

443
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
We don't mean to give them a shitstorm. We're trying to help, but instead we're doing harm.

444
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And it's it's a really tricky balance.

445
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And I think Hacktoberfest just exposed it at a large scale because it happened to a ton of projects at once because once or twice, you know, every now and then on Telegram, I'll get a I'll get a message from a Linux dev that we all know.

446
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And they'll grouse at me about this problem. And and oh, yeah, OK, I didn't really.

447
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And then I, you know, OK, OK, I hear it and then it kind of moves on.

448
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's just that one developer. But this was like a lot of people all at once.

449
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Even projects like UbiPorts, you know, Ubuntu Touch and elementary OS, some of their projects, like even the projects that are like smaller in scope and scale, like components of those projects.

450
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
We're getting spam pull requests. There's maybe just going back to the premise, right?

451
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Assuming I do that DDoS like trying to be a good community member.

452
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Maybe the way they're doing this is just bad.

453
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Should you maybe partner with like Canonical because Ubuntu is the only distro that exists.

454
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And I don't know, work with them to have like do this on a specific project.

455
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
But then you're cutting down the potential participation, right?

456
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Because what if? Sure. What if someone only knows C sharp, right?

457
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Or whatever. And, you know, funny enough, it's probably more work.

458
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Right. Now you're coordinating with the specific projects instead of just saying, go make a PR request and let us know about it.

459
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Now you're interfacing with a group of developers trying to come to some sort of understanding.

460
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
All of a sudden, it's a lot more work.

461
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:46,000
My answer when you originally asked how would I solve it was going to be essentially hire a developer for a project for a month or something like some way a system.

462
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Hire a developer. Yeah, like hire a developer to work on a project that needs help.

463
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
You know, something. Yeah, but that doesn't help with the stated goal of getting new people involved in open source.

464
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:05,000
That just gives like whatever project you like, you know, whatever elementary open to more, more, you know, which I'm sure they'd appreciate.

465
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,000
What's the value of training, say, 30, 40,000?

466
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Let's just say 20,000. Some of them made multiple.

467
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Is there is there a real value in training 20,000 people how to do a pull request?

468
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
They wouldn't make get up accounts. Is there value in that?

469
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
This is where I think things actually went off the rails.

470
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The guy who did a YouTube video and felt that the problem was people didn't know how to make a pull request.

471
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I think he was fundamentally correct. And this I'm going to get in a lot of trouble for this one, because I guess this is a little bit, quote unquote, hashtag gatekeeping.

472
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,000
If you're going to impose upon these open source developers and they're going to get these, you know, kids trying to help them.

473
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Then you also take the set of people who literally doesn't know how to make a pull request.

474
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Right. And you show them how to make crappy pull requests. You create this problem.

475
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It's awful to say, but having some barrier that will weed out some, frankly, just spammy college kids who want a T-shirt, I think is an acceptable trade off.

476
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Ideally, we would try to get everybody who's interested in open source doing it, even if it's like open source, like an iOS thing or whatever.

477
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But you do have to be respectful of the folks who run these projects.

478
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And if if the choice you're giving me, if I'm, you know, king of the O, which I'm not.

479
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But if my choice is we never do this very successful campaign again or we're slightly less welcoming or slightly less accommodating and we leave the absolute least trained, least equipped to actually be.

480
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Because, by the way, the ones who also don't know how to create a pull request probably don't know how to, like, send you a meaningful contribution anyway.

481
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Well, it isn't the proof in the pull requests. They are very low quality, very low value.

482
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So, right. I think you could argue that we've just done the big experiment.

483
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And what we've determined is you can turn 20,000 people into GitHub pull requesters, but it doesn't mean you're going to get a pull request that's any good.

484
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
The value is low. You have created pull request script kiddies.

485
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Congratulations. Right. I guess it was the octo script kiddies. I don't know. Now, there are speaking of scripts, there are some tools that have been released to help people clean clean up from this. It'll go through and kind of just automatically clean up all this stuff for you.

486
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So, yeah. And don't get me wrong, like the devs who we both know who are upset about this are right to be upset.

487
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Right. I wasn't trying to sound like, oh, suck it up. It's Dio has put this burden on you, frankly. That's and let's call a spade a spade.

488
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
This is a great marketing campaign for Dio, too. That's why they do it. So, right, right.

489
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You know, it almost makes me wonder if maybe the way to do it is it smaller scale, more like at a podcast scale where it's where if we did something like this, it would be 20 or 30 people.

490
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Right. Right. And then the project would actually have an option to maybe have a conversation with a couple of them and convert somebody into a long term contributor at the scale.

491
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It's just impossible for developers to engage with these with these new participants.

492
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And I think you and I would want to have a conversation with whatever project we want to partner with.

493
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
We wouldn't just be like, I'm just going to make one up. Hey, elementary guys, we're sending 30 people your way.

494
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Enjoy. Like, we wouldn't do that because that's awful. Yeah. So never mind. Bad marks to Dio.

495
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And we'll see. I bet you by this time next year, it's pretty much mostly forgotten.

496
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And they just they make a big stink about having to, you know, put the hacktoberfest stuff in your repo.

497
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And it's I don't know. Yeah, I think people aren't going to do it. I'm telling you, I don't think it's going to be forgotten.

498
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Yeah, I don't think people would do it either. You're right. Devs are devs are moody, moody bees.

499
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Why would you do it? Right. Why would you? You're just going to get a bunch of crap.

500
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Exactly. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Yeah. It's not going to happen.

501
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
No. Oh, I think we just watched hacktoberfest die. I think that's what just happened.

502
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Possibly it was created during the show and it will end during the show.

503
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
We are the Alpha and Omega. Yeah. Yeah. We have watched several things come and go, I suppose.

504
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And, you know, that plays in really nicely to mentioning that our first quarterly report is out for the Coder QA team.

505
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:20,000
We did one last week and published it to the members feed. So if you become a Coder QA at Coder QA dot co, you get access to our quarterly reports.

506
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You support the show, obviously, and we really appreciate that. And you get a limited ad feed.

507
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
So that's nice to full produced production, all that good stuff edited. But you just get a limited ad feed.

508
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And that quarterly Coderly, which the first one is out.

509
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Thank you to everybody who does support the show at Coder QA dot co.

510
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I also want to take a moment and say if you can't afford to support the show or you're not interested in supporting the show, but you listen anyways.

511
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
We still appreciate that, especially if you listen to our sponsors and engage when they make sense and visit the URLs to let them know you heard them here.

512
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:01,000
That that all we really appreciate, too. And also another way to support the show that isn't monetary at all is just mentioning it to somebody else who you think might enjoy the show.

513
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Word of mouth is the number one way that podcasts are marketed.

514
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
If you think about it, a podcast is a big ask of somebody's time.

515
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And so you're going to need somebody you trust telling you, hey, you should go listen to this hour long show that you've never heard of before.

516
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
People don't just generally pick up an hour long show and start listening unless they're specifically looking for something.

517
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And obviously it happens because you're listening right now, but you're much more likely if somebody recommends it to you.

518
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So you could be that person. So thank you to our Coder QA team and thank you to everybody who helps promote the show.

519
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
We really appreciate all of it. Really grateful. The response still to us being back has been really strong and awesome.

520
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It's been really great. It's gratifying to see all of that. We appreciate everybody who's been sending in the emails.

521
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,000
We could use a whole nother batch. So go to Coder dot show slash contact to send us in an email or feedback.

522
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
You can hit me up on Twitter. I'm at Chris Last. The show is at Coder Radio Show.

523
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And Mr. Dominic, I think maybe you created an account this week. You're on Twitter as well now.

524
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
That's right. It's at Dumanuco.

525
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,000
What? And of course, our sponsor ACG, a cloud guru is on YouTube, Twitter or Facebook.

526
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Just slash a cloud guru at any of them, YouTube, Twitter or Facebook slash a cloud guru to find them.

527
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Well, Mr. Dominic, is there anything else we want to mention this week?

528
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:24,000
No. I mean, if you are a confused teenager that doesn't know he can't vote and you would like to show up at Chris's house or RV, I would encourage you to.

529
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I think I live with three of them right now. I tell you what, they've all got opinions.

530
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Strong opinions and no ability to act on them.

531
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Yeah, I know how they feel.

532
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Kind of like the PRs.

533
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,000
That's where it's going. Coder dot show slash 382 for the links to everything we talked about today.

534
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Of course, we've got that contact page slash subscribe for the feeds if you want to get the show weekly.

535
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Why wouldn't you? And last but not least, you could join us live on a Monday.

536
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
We do it at noon Pacific, three p.m. Eastern at JBLive.TV.

537
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:10,000
