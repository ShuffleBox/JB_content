00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Kodo Radio, episode 345 for February 18th, 2019.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello there, and welcome to Kodo Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and its related technologies.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:53,000
From a very cold and icy Pacific Northwest, my name is Chris, and join us, every week, like the soldier of podcasting that he truly is, it's our man in Florida, Mr. Dominic.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hello Mike!

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hello Chris!

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello Hanson, good to be connected with you, and we must not take another moment. No more time must be spent on anything other than the introduction of Wes Payne. Hello Wes.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hello gentlemen.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hello Wes, I gotta come up with like a really clever way to segue you into the show.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You gotta work on that. It's homework.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Right now it's Chris Practice's improv is really what happens with the intro.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well that'll benefit future hosts, I'm sure.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well guys, we have a pretty great episode. The three of us are gathered here today to talk about many, many things. Mostly how Mike spends his money though.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This guy right now, he's got not one, but two new Linux rigs sitting in his office. We're really later today going to be talking about his new Thalia workstation, which is a killer.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh my god.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You and I got a chance to go see them hands on, but Mike had a chance to see them.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, it's his. He's using it in his home.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, he's like the proto prototype too. So we'll talk about that in a little bit. But just as a little tea skis, Mr. Dominic, you got yourself a Darter Pro laptop as well.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, yeah, I'm currently reviewing that. Very just kick the tires that review literally like installed basic tool chain.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So, and I of course put the mandatory number of drinks on top of it.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Right. So how does it work as a drink holder?

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's pretty effective. I in fact, I did get a Valentine's package from Emma for myself, my wife and my son, including plastic wrap, a flask and shirt for Laura and a number of chocolates for my son.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So they are prepared.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's really nice. You know, they just they've embraced it because they realize that it's a good revenue.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So it's just going to keep happening. And it's a whole family affair.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah, literally, your Twitter feed was giving me anxiety all weekend long. It was it was it was rough in the Fisher household.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
When you're reviewing a laptop, it's important to put a bottle of scotch on it.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I can see that a higher bottle. Some cups. Yeah.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah. And it's not even like, you know, it's just cutting. So it's not like we were going too hard.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah. OK. But I suppose the higher proof it is, the better. Right. There's less water in it. So that's going to be safer for the laptop.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Great point. It'll actually clean it. That's a pro move right there. Science.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You got to love the Internet, though. And I don't mean any disparaging comments towards anybody who actually did this, because a couple of you did this.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But like the Internet's response to Mike posting a picture of a laptop with a drink on it is, hey, Mike, just so you know, I think that's a waterproof.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah. Oh, my God. Yeah. I've gotten a lot of emails mentioning the what I thought were dead.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You've also got a couple of audience members that are stalking you in Telegram trying to get you to let them buy you the unspillable mug.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There's a couple. It's a thing that's happening. Oh, I did forget. And Emma's package was also a sippy cup.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Not for your son, but for you. Nope. Yeah.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Now, listen, Mike, I've actually wasn't sure if you're going to make it today.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I wasn't sure I wasn't going to hold it against you if you no showed, because as far as I can tell, you haven't slept for about 24 hours.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And not only is that the first time this week, but I believe it is the second time this week.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What happened to all that talk we had about getting better sleep hygiene? What happened here?

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, I need to get back on the wagon there. I have not slept a good night's sleep in four days.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That is getting up that some serious stuff like hallucinations.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I get grumpy. I keep seeing Alan Jude with a USB stick installing PSD on all my machines.

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah, it keeps you up. It might actually be real. I don't know. I don't know.

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I mean, so are you are you pulling all nighters for work or is it unrelated to work?

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's work. It's just trying to wrap things up.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You know, the beginning of the year is always kind of awkward. You have projects, endings, projects starting.

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And yeah, just trying to dive one project that's supposed to ship.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And it looks like it is shipping, but that's requiring a little more effort than I bargained for.

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I mean, I know how much people love it when we talk about this stuff because it's only it's so happy.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's only us on the show that sleep. So it's not applicable to anybody. Certainly not.

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, obviously I'm back. So we're going to talk about stuff not related to coding, clearly,

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
because only on only when I'm on the show does any of us sleep, apparently. I'm deleting Reddit today.

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I just really quickly, you know, I got into tracking my sleep.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah. And so I had a 15 day stretch where I was getting really good sleep and it was pretty remarkable.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Did people comment? I'm thinking Hadea type people.

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would say I mean, I would say I had great, great energy.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It was it was good. I was I felt it definitely translated to a more productive sense of being,

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
which is it's like the key factor to me having an overall well sense of being like if I don't feel productive, I'm a mess.

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And but for the last week once I got sick and then I've been traveling to last night was the first night.

61
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I could tell you right now I got I got a little complication on my watch.

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I push one button and I can tell you I've got last night I got 15 minutes of deep sleep.

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh, no. I got four hours of quality sleep. OK. And that's my best in a week.

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But I know that now at least it's trending in the right direction.

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And I actually get you'll see this. I get a readiness meter. Can you see that?

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I get a readiness meter that tells me based on my historical sleep data how I'm going to feel overall today.

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And I'll tell you this is actually pretty spot on. I don't check it all the time.

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You kind of be like a little heads up like you might not be on best. Don't take it.

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah. Yeah. Take a little easy. If you've got the Apple Watch, get auto sleep and just wear it for 30 days and go to bed with it and just get your sleep figured out.

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It makes a huge difference in your productivity and how much you spill on laptops.

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So this is this is your intervention right now. Right. Oh, yeah. We get some sleep.

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah. Wes and your buddy Wes and Chris are we're having an intervention, Mike.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And we're saying tonight you have to go to bed on time. No working late tonight.

74
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So, you know, I think I might go to bed at eight. Me and the two year old are going to be lockstep.

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Good. Good. Well, I want I want to see a tweet in 24 hours or so saying you got great sleep.

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Otherwise, we're going to keep talking about the show. And nobody wants that. Nobody. Nobody wants that.

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You see what I did there? All right. Well, that was really just me stalling to get us to the point that I think Wes and I are most interested in.

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I mean, we got a lot to cover today, including switch statement changes. We got log in forms to shit on.

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There's some big things for IOT developers that are going to probably change the game for the next 10 years.

80
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And Mike got triggered this week. So we're going to talk about all of that.

81
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But first, we got to get to the bottom of Mike's Thalia workstation.

82
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Y'all know that System 76 announced their own in-house designed and built Thalia workstations that run Linux.

83
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
They have a unique wood panel design that's curved around the front of the case.

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Lots of I.O. the specs for the hardware, the case, the design of it. All of that is open source.

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
They have a daughter board that manages some of the I.O. also open source.

86
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And they started shipping. When did we go down there, Wes?

87
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The first start of December, I think. Yeah, you're right.

88
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So mid-December, they started shipping to customers that pre-ordered them.

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And Mike's pretty early in that batch. And just this last week or so, received a System 76 Thalia workstation and has posted his review.

90
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm kind of curious to know your initial thoughts, Mike, and your overall buy-don't-buy on the Thalia.

91
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, so the Thalia is magical for a number of reasons. The most important being that a client actually paid for it.

92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That helps. That is magical. That's a big win.

93
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I like it. Just top line, I definitely would recommend it.

94
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I did get a couple comments already because I love Reddit.

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I guess there are cheaper Linux workstations, and I did do some research, and it's like, that is true.

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Turns out. Turns out.

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You can always save a buck in the Linux ecosystem.

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Right. But if you're coming from the Mac world, this is half the price of an iMac Pro.

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If not, it's about, as configured, this is about $23, $24 after tax on shipping, I think.

100
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I am running the AMD version of the regular Thalia.

101
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I mean, we have the specs somewhere in the show notes or in the review.

102
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So if people want to look, just go to dominechem.com and look.

103
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is probably the fastest computer I've owned.

104
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It is pretty spec'd out. 8GB GPU, 32GB RAM, crazy Ryzen processor.

105
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I love it. So far, I've had only one minor issue, which was in shipping.

106
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The secondary hard disk drive dislodged because UPS apparently thought it was a soccer ball of some kind.

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So I did have to open it up, but that actually brings me to one of my positives.

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I was able to reinstall the drive, open the case, reinstall the drive without touching a screwdriver.

109
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Everything is basically hand, the whole case is hand screws.

110
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's so nice when you just want to get down to work.

111
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, if you just need to fix something.

112
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Working inside of the case is easy. I could see myself modding this out with additional hard disks.

113
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I have to say, and I know this is super nerdy, although you're listening to Koda Radio, so you're already done.

114
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I have not seen the inside of a case that was so easy to work in.

115
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Like they have the thumbscrew plates in there for additional thumbscrews when you add more devices later.

116
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The hard drive bays are precision cut.

117
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You know what's funny though, that you hit a shipping issue?

118
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Wes, wouldn't you agree?

119
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:07,000
One of the number one things that Carl would comment on, CarlCEOSystem76, was all of the crazy ass things that they were particularly engineering just to survive shipping.

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, oh yeah, they spent a lot of time being like, well we needed to design this not just for being in the case and that life, but how is it going to get to the customer?

121
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,000
In fact, so much so that I actually asked Carl, I'm like, so clearly shipping is the most extreme damaging experience in the life.

122
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Because the life of this PC, they were building, they are custom laser cutting individual components to hold the video card in position during shipping,

123
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
drive cage stuff, stuff to hold their dot, like all these crazy little components that they are custom manufacturing.

124
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That aren't there for any other part of the life of the machine.

125
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Just to survive shipping.

126
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So I asked Carl, I'm like, is this the most extreme situation the computer goes through?

127
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He was like, yeah, this is it.

128
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If the computer survives shipping, they generally survive everything.

129
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's like, it's the most damaging thing.

130
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And so much of their R&D goes into surviving shipping.

131
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah, did I see that the super thing, the massive ships in a giant big case?

132
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah, yeah, that was right.

133
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, it's crazy.

134
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah, and I have to say, they have a very nicely designed box with some artwork.

135
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I did not post a picture of it because it looked like Rocky Balboa had a few rounds with it by the time it got to my door.

136
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, the UPS kicked the crap out of it.

137
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So how's IO inputs and outputs? Do you have pretty good connectivity with this thing?

138
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Do you have plenty of storage?

139
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, you have plenty of storage.

140
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You have two USB 3.1 Gen 2s, which I thought was a nice touch.

141
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They're basically just double the IO throughput of regular USB 3.

142
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And you have a bunch of USB 3 ports.

143
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So if you're coming from a Mac, you might have to get out in one of those like Tom's hardware guides and realize what all these ports are.

144
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Might take you a few hours.

145
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The only, I would say, deficiency in the ports is actually what I'm experiencing right now.

146
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There is no front line out for an audio jack.

147
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And if you're doing any kind of podcast, I'm on the Thaleo right now, by the way.

148
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Is that what I'm hearing in the background?

149
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Is that what that is? I can't hear it. Yeah, I do hear it.

150
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, you can hear it. So, yeah, there is a pretty.

151
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I was wondering how the Rode mic would pick it up.

152
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's there is fan noise. Yeah.

153
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Now, I just got a little louder, too.

154
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It just like, well, my neighbor's also mowing his lawn.

155
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, that's what you have to disambiguate.

156
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What the audience hears is processed a little bit so they don't hear the full effect.

157
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
They'll probably hear a little bit of it, but they won't hear the full effect that we're hearing.

158
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah, it's not bad.

159
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't hear it when I'm watching TV.

160
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Now, I will say that I think this machine is.

161
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You know, I'm used to slapping Linux on a Dell or some Windows workstation and fighting with like particularly graphics drivers.

162
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Right. Sure.

163
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah, that noise you if you just heard something is my neighbor because I just heard a kick up through my headphones.

164
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The experience of taking a fully powered desktop, putting it on my desk or on my side table and being ready to go was great.

165
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Having the drivers all preconfigured.

166
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I honestly I honestly think if you're considering switching from Mac OS to desktop Linux because you wanted a Mac Pro.

167
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Right. This is I know I'm getting very particular here.

168
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And you happen to be a developer.

169
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Honestly, consider Thalia, you're used to spending money.

170
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's not that much more expensive than the equivalent, let's say Dell.

171
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And you don't deal with all the nonsense that you would deal with if you say bought something at Best Buy and had the slap Linux on it.

172
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Also, it's beautiful. I have gotten more comments on the case than anything else, which I think is interesting.

173
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, but it's I thought it was a nice design. I really do.

174
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah, but that was kind of one of their goals is a desktop you could have on the top of your desk.

175
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, it seems like kind of where you put it.

176
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah, that is how they put it. They wanted something you'd be proud to show off.

177
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And I think it is that. And the thing is, is what you're proposing has a built in sales advantage.

178
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Like Apple has this massive tricost.

179
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
If you want to get into the Apple ecosystem from a Mac side, you're looking at a thousand dollars or you buy used.

180
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But you will eventually want to buy a machine that can actually do your work. So you'll eventually spend money.

181
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But with Linux, you can throw it on anything just to see if the applications work for you.

182
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You can't do that with macOS.

183
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah, right. And you commonly do. You just find a machine, you're like, well, yeah, inspect it out, try it, see what happens.

184
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Or even if you have a decent machine now. So you've got maybe like this right here that we have in we have one of these in the studio right now.

185
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's a 2013 MacBook that we've used to throw Arch on before and things like that.

186
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's still a great computer. It really is funny. Like it's a 2013 computer.

187
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And if the design hadn't changed, I wouldn't be able to peg it. I wouldn't know.

188
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Like it does everything, including processing complex art, audio effects very quickly.

189
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And so you could just throw Linux in a VM on this or throw Linux on this and try out the workflow for a week and see if it works for you.

190
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You can't do that with the Mac. You can with Windows. It's not as flexible, but you can.

191
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah, it's a little more. You can you can push and squeeze it.

192
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And but unless you want to get into like KXT hacking and that's just that's just unpleasant.

193
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And it's not really it's not done as much anymore either.

194
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah. So I think there is a sort of you can put your I guess the way to put it is you can put your toes in the water before you make the leap.

195
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You can put your workflow toes in the water, see if it works for you and see if the water is amenable.

196
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So would you spend your own money on it, Mike?

197
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, if again, since I am a complete Linux hippie now, apparently I would I would this would be my Mac Pro replacement.

198
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hmm. Hell out of here. Now, I wasn't it wasn't it your co-host maybe over a year ago who told you you should go with a powerful desktop approach and build a powerful desktop that is a Linux based machine.

199
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And then your remote systems could be like, you know, like a thousand dollar Bangor MacBook or a Chromebook or anything that you needed for the remote work.

200
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But you could always remote into your centralized, powerful desktop system that you invest into.

201
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Senator, I have no recollection of that meeting.

202
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It sounds like something I say. It does sound like something you might say.

203
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You bastard. I'm going to be really curious how this works out in like the next month or two, especially with with the fans and what happens there, because I would it is really tempting to just solve that problem.

204
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Just be like, here's my here's a machine. I can do work on it. I know it'll just work. I can install whatever Linux distro and it'll have support.

205
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You and I were in a small office room with one of these failures. I did not sound like that. It didn't sound like that.

206
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
But it was an Intel based system. It was not the AMD system could be different cooling system.

207
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Who knows? It could be the different sizes have different sound. I mean, I guess in theory you could go hack on that daughter board and maybe mess with it.

208
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Well, I'll be I'll be curious to know what you think of the darter in time. I think it's a boy kind of a boy.

209
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Look at you. You're swimming a new gear over there. It's a lot of you're doing a lot of OS setups and installs right now, aren't you?

210
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I can install a rails tool chain in about 15 seconds.

211
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So are you going to are you just sticking with pop on everything? Like, I'm sorry, pop underscore OS exclamation mark.

212
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,000
They really need to change that. Yeah, I was running elementary, but right now everything's on pop because that's the way it's configured.

213
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Just for the sake of sanity and not wasting too much time, I am going to stick with pop.

214
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Huh. There you go. There you go, Wes. There you go. Do you think you could try? Do you think you could live on pop for a while?

215
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I would be willing to try.

216
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah. Are you still on plasma, right?

217
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I am still on plasma. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

218
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I mean, it was really nice when the latest one dropped and I just did an update and it keeps working.

219
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah. Yeah. Well, Wes and I and Elle, who if you haven't met yet, go check out Linux Unplugged.

220
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:30,000
She was on there recently. We'll all be hanging out at Scale 17X coming up on March 7th through the 10th, 2019 at the Pasadena Convention Center.

221
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And if you're going to be at scale, go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting Saturday evening.

222
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
We're going to go out to dinner, have ourselves a little get together and just hang out amongst friends.

223
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Scale is the annual, I was going to say. I don't know. I was going to say the biannual, but it's not.

224
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's an annual Southern California Linux Expo. It always happens around this time of year.

225
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's March 7th through the 10th this year. And the hotels are booking up quick.

226
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So if you're going to go, you need to get a hotel very soon.

227
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Elle will be giving a talk from our team on the introduction and basics of containers.

228
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Wes and I will be sneaking around, chatting and hanging out with people and fully taking advantage of the hallway track.

229
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh, yeah.

230
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
As we do. As we do. I don't think I'm bringing the RV this year, though.

231
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
No, just going freestyle.

232
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Going to do the hotel thing.

233
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We'll be fast and light and on our feet.

234
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Nimble, if you will. Nimble, if you will.

235
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
See everything we can.

236
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And don't ask Mike. He's not going. Don't ask him. Florida's on the other end.

237
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I mean, you just get stuck in the swamp, right? I believe that's how it works.

238
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
By the time he got to California, it would be over. That's the problem.

239
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's true. Or an alligator would follow me.

240
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And I can only imagine people from California trying to say, alligator, how have we offended you?

241
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Is that how it works over there?

242
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm a huge fan of California.

243
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Well, before anybody – well, I suppose if they're going to leave the show, they've already left now.

244
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But maybe we should do a little development talk.

245
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Oh, maybe.

246
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What do you say?

247
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What's the name of it? Coder Radio?

248
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No, I don't think – oh, Coder Radio.

249
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
At the end of January, the.NET Core development team has released a new version of.NET Core framework,

250
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
which I think might have got mentioned here on the show,.NET Core 3 Preview 2, as they say.

251
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It delivers a new version of – well, it does – but it delivers a new set of features to C-Sharp for developers.

252
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And we're going to be talking about switch expressions today.

253
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Switch expressions, because this is one of the new things that landed in.NET Core 3 Preview 2.

254
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Okay, so I threw this into some of the show notes.

255
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What?

256
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Because Mike suggests – it was something that Mike said on a previous episode,

257
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
which was just some of the feedback, the attitudes, not liking some of the changes in recent C-Sharp.

258
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Oh, yeah.

259
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And I saw a couple of comments on the internet, things like,

260
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
this might be better titled, Changing Things for the Sake of Changing Things and Appealing to the Programming Language Geeks.

261
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh, snap.

262
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And so I thought this was kind of an interesting change.

263
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Apparently, it offends people.

264
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Wow, that's a shocker.

265
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's totally unexpected.

266
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay, so to fully appreciate this, help me grok what a switch expression is and why.NET needed them.

267
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Boy, I don't know.

268
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I mean, Mike, would you say that it needed them?

269
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah, so I think Wes and I might have a little falling out here.

270
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm here to witness it.

271
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:32,000
A switch expression is basically stuff you could already do, but with an equal sign and a right-pointing caret thingy.

272
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Basically, let's make C-Sharp more functional so we can show off how smart we are.

273
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Sorry.

274
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Go ahead, Wes.

275
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, oh, that shot's fired.

276
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I mean, okay, it is a small thing.

277
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It probably just doesn't matter at all, and we could probably just skip the whole thing.

278
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But I don't know.

279
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I like expressions over statements.

280
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Statements are, they're just so, they feel like weird black assembly computer magic where you just say, like, adjust the machine.

281
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And an expression, it's a nice, clean, mathematical-style function.

282
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So it just seems easier to reason about, and I often try to set things up.

283
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Instead of having a case statement or something like that, with a switch expression, you get all the same pattern-matching benefits.

284
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And I think the way with the equal sign, with it on the right of the equal sign, it's just a little clearer to think about.

285
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's a good case.

286
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I will say that C sharp in particular, obviously this kind of stuff works better in really functional languages like F sharp or Haskell or Scallop.

287
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So there is a little bit awkward if you need to do a couple things on the, whichever, you've matched something in your switch and then you want to do something.

288
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
If you need to have multiple statements in there, probably the best solution right now is the kind of ugly lambda.

289
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So it's not perfect.

290
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I don't think you should go change everything to use this.

291
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I just like the functional influence.

292
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Well, it seems to be the way of the future.

293
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And I think that's been one of the criticisms is, oh, this is trendy.

294
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This is what the trendy thing to do in language design.

295
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, that's right.

296
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I think this is right on the edge probably of like, what's the real value versus just being invoked?

297
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Well, there's value to that too sometimes when you're trying to draw in new eyes or new developers.

298
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So that's not necessarily, I don't think it should be necessarily dismissed.

299
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I don't think it's worth a major change.

300
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I feel like oftentimes the functional approach can be a cleaner mental model and it might be more difficult for people who've been doing it for a long time and already have it into model.

301
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But for newcomers, it might be simpler.

302
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Exactly.

303
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And it might be if you're going for a growth thing versus just dragging along the old timers.

304
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah, it's just F sharp envy.

305
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:45,000
All kidding aside, though, this is interesting because we're seeing all the stodgy old languages, Java, C sharp are now adopting the I call them West features, but basically cool features of safety and functional programming.

306
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And I actually think it is to the benefit of, let's just say, more conservative developers who maybe aren't exactly going to go on the bleeding edge.

307
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
As I said that, the Rust book just fell off my desk.

308
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That's very fitting.

309
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Wow, that's telling.

310
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah, I have static in my headphones and the Rust book fell.

311
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So there's some sort of supernatural Rust God who's about to materialize in here.

312
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That's what happens when you stay up for 24 hours developing, you summon the Rust God.

314
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
They are watching all the time.

315
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Is that how the first Rust developer came to this planet?

316
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I believe, yeah.

317
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Someone just didn't sleep for a week.

318
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah, I believe that is actually the truth.

319
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So what's our takeaway from the story, Wes?

320
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I mean, besides the fact that it's coming and people better get used to it.

321
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah, it's just a new form you might start seeing out there.

322
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Probably you won't use it, but be aware some people might.

323
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh, I bet.

324
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So there was a great, great post that completely validated everything I believe in life this week.

325
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So I wanted to talk about it with you guys.

326
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And it is don't get clever with login forms.

327
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And this is becoming a plague of the Internet that is preventing good password hygiene.

328
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And I have a plea to all developers in the audience that might work at any of these companies that could make a difference here.

329
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You have been chosen by God to make a difference today.

330
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So please listen.

331
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Please create login forms with simple, linkable, predictable.

332
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And that play nicely with password managers.

333
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
That's it right there.

334
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Simple, like that.

335
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I've recently experienced several login forms that won't let me paste in the password field.

336
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Have you ever experienced this?

337
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Oh, yeah.

338
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And commonly it's the worst things.

339
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's like important stuff that has your credit card information.

340
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yes.

341
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And ones that I implicitly want to use.

342
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You want to use a really long, secure password.

343
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
A very long and secure password that they no longer.

344
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Oh, here's another one.

345
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
They will not let you paste in like the bank routing and account number field.

346
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Right, like what?

347
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Which, again, is something I would like.

348
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I don't want a fat finger and get wrong.

349
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
No.

350
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Because they charge you a fee for that.

351
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yes.

352
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Or here's another common one that we've all seen.

353
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I blame Mike for this design trend.

354
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It makes everything look nice and simple where it hides the password field.

355
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So you just get the login.

356
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You get the username.

357
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Then you have to hit next.

358
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Oh, yeah, right.

359
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And then you get the password, which some password managers are fine with.

360
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
But we don't need this.

361
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We don't need this.

362
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And I totally, completely blame Mike for that.

363
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yeah, I do.

364
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And there's a – what?

365
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I have a login form for you.

366
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah, I bet.

367
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You know what I'm saying?

368
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You have to – oh, I know what you're saying.

369
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You have to go for the nice-looking designs with their fancy websites, which you're a big, fancy website.

370
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You sure are.

371
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You know what I'm saying?

372
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I am.

373
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Well, I'm changing, though, Chris.

374
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
There's going to be no more fancy websites.

375
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's just going to be a terminal application where you have to solve a programming problem in Rust to log in.

376
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
There you go.

377
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
That's why you don't need a password.

378
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
No one can get in.

379
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That's fine.

380
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I just – no one can get in.

381
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I don't understand how this even happens.

382
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I guess they're trying to prevent maybe bot abuse.

383
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Could be.

384
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Yeah, could be.

385
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That's – the only thing I'm thinking of is, like, they're trying to prevent somebody from automating the entry of the information into the field.

386
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I mean, might some of it be just, like, not really thinking about it?

387
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
That just sort of like – oh, like with modals, for instance, right?

388
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You're like, oh, yeah, well, it just pops up and it kind of looks –

389
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah, now, a modal login, I think, is a design-driven choice.

390
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I think you got a great point there.

391
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
That needs to stop immediately.

392
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That has to stop.

393
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That has to stop.

394
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It does need to stop.

395
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It really has to stop.

396
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Just make slash login or whatever.

397
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's fine.

398
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I will go out of my way to try to find a non-modal version of the site and then I will bookmark it.

399
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yes, yes.

400
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah, I will do that.

401
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So – but what needs to – the other thing that needs to stop, it's just – it's fundamentally screwing with good password hygiene is the blocking of the password paste.

402
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And I think they do it because you think about it, that's not an accident.

403
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
No, you have to very consciously do it.

404
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Right.

405
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So there was probably multiple conversations in a large company, maybe dozens of discussions about blocking password entry, right?

406
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You got to figure it.

407
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It has to.

408
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You know how this gets built.

409
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah, exactly.

410
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
In any reasonable-sized organization, that's what happens.

411
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So there was – at multiple levels of the company, there were individuals that thought this was a good idea that bought off on the idea for better security.

412
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Got to put on the schedule, got developers to finish the feature.

413
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah.

414
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That's insane.

415
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Let me give you my – I have actually experienced this.

416
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah.

417
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Come clean, Mike.

418
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Come clean.

419
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay.

420
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So there are these people.

421
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
They're called designers.

422
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
They smell good generally.

423
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
They dress well.

424
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And they're really good at sweet talking, corporate executives as every race, religion, creed, sexual orientation, age, country of origin into doing things that are –

425
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm trying to find a nice way to say this – completely idiotic, but look pretty.

426
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That coupled with the second problem of every – Matt bought our customers listening.

427
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I, of course, don't mean you.

428
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Every enterprise I have ever met ever has this fallacy.

429
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I can only think of two companies that I know have legitimate security concerns that I've worked with at least.

430
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I cannot think of a startup in the last almost 12 – almost 14 years that I've been doing this crap that didn't think that they were the NSA.

431
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:32,000
They legitimately believe that someone wants to hack into their 20-year-old Gen Zers, want to hook up and have a good time app.

432
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
They legitimately believe that.

433
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But – so they do these – I have implemented more of these horrible completely breaks last past things than I care to mention.

434
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:51,000
At the same time, they will have things like digital ocean accounts with passwords such as Robert1944.

435
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That's very specific.

436
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It is very specific.

437
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So you might not be able to log in, but you can certainly get on DO and go into the terminal console for the database and dump the whole thing.

438
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And this is just how people operate.

439
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah.

440
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
This is my plea.

441
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I don't think I'm going to solve world hunger.

442
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm not going to cure cancer.

443
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You haven't been making much progress on that one.

444
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
No.

445
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm not giving up, but I'm thinking.

446
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But this, we can make a difference.

447
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
We can make a difference.

448
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It starts with every listener out there.

449
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
When you get to a website that doesn't let you paste in a password, you give them some feedback.

450
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It starts with every developer out there.

451
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
When somebody gives you a design decision that says to have a modal login, you say, I will not.

452
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I refuse.

453
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It starts with all of us.

454
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And then when you have no billings for that quarter, you write Linux Academy and ask them to send you some money.

455
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You cannot beat the designers.

456
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Hey, man, this is the battle of our time, and it requires sacrifice.

457
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You can't make...

458
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah, you know what?

459
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I just want to say, they brought us iOS 7.

460
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You got to crack a few eggs.

461
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
They're unbeatable.

462
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
They're monsters.

463
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
We're not starting a design show anytime soon, right?

464
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Okay.

465
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
No, not yet.

466
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Not now.

467
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:20,000
No, we ought to talk about this thing that Canonical's doing that I don't think any other major Linux player is doing.

468
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Like, look at what Red Hat has going on, and they don't seem to be making a huge play for IoT devices.

469
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
No, like Fedora's got some stuff, but not in the Fedora way, you know, it's off on its own.

470
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It's not like a Red Hat corporate push.

471
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah, it's not a big corporate push.

472
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But Canonical has announced that the latest version of Ubuntu Core for IoT will get 10 years of commercial support.

473
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
At 260 megabytes, Ubuntu Core is one of the smallest IoT platforms out there.

474
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
They did that essentially by stripping out a ton of components from the main Ubuntu OS,

475
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and then figuring you could use snaps to replace some of that functionality.

476
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It also improves security by pulling a bunch of stuff out because you have a smaller attack surface.

477
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And when you consider the popularity of Ubuntu, Canonical has a pretty good pitch for their IoT platform here.

478
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's got a wide range of applications, and Ubuntu Core enables a new class of app-centric things

479
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:18,000
because you've got all of the snaps that are already like things like Plex and FTP servers and mail servers that are snapped up

480
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
that you can put on an IoT device.

481
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I think that's pretty compelling.

482
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You combine that with the smaller size, 260 megabytes, the fact that it's based off a 1804 LTS, and it gets 10 years of support.

483
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Oh, boy, howdy.

484
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Now all of a sudden you've got something pretty compelling to build off of here.

485
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I think, I mean, that seems like the major thing this guy has, right, is that it's everything you already know.

486
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It's the same Ubuntu.

487
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I mean, a little bit changed, but if you're already using snaps, if you're already familiar with the Ubuntu base, it's the same platform.

488
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You don't have to start using Alpine or something even more exotic.

489
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Well, it isn't kind of the same argument that has been really successful for Ubuntu with that argument being

490
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
one of the great things about Ubuntu is you can run it on your desktop and build on your desktop or on your laptop for the same environment you're deploying in the cloud.

491
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah, you match production right there.

492
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Well, same thing here, yeah.

493
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Same thing with IoT devices.

494
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
That seems pretty super valuable.

495
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I mean, I'll admit, I end up deploying Ubuntu all kinds of places for the same reason.

496
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's just easy, and I know how to use it.

497
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Now, I know in our off-air chats, Mike has looked a lot at IoT devices here and there over the years, even on our on-air chats.

498
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
We've talked about it a bit.

499
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Have you really looked a lot about the lifecycle of the operating system of the devices that you end up shipping?

500
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Mike, is that something you factor in?

501
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Like, how long will it get security patches?

502
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Kind of.

503
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I mean, so this Ubuntu core thing is actually new to me, so this does look interesting.

504
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But yeah, it's generally any kind of LTS, and there are specialty versions of many Linux distros you can basically buy support plans for already.

505
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But if it's just something I'm kind of hacking on just to, you know, try something out or prototype something, I hardly pay attention at all.

506
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But having said that, Ubuntu core, you know, put a gun to my head, Greenfield project, I get to make all the decisions.

507
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
This probably is the way I'd go because it's easy, something I know.

508
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah, and you get the 10 years of support, which I feel like the reason why I'm kind of excited about it is not because I'm like an IoT nutjob or anything.

509
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's just, like, if we're going to go down this path, for God's sakes, please figure out the software update.

510
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah, right.

511
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It'd be nice if they could just update things a little bit more, but clearly that's not happening.

512
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
This is the best alternative.

513
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What gets me so frustrated is this was a problem we foresaw when we started seeing all of these consumer-grade routers.

514
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We all looked at that and went, well, we're not doing any kind of universal update.

515
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
No one's updating these.

516
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
This is a huge problem.

517
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
What are we doing?

518
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
That was a preview of what the IoT mess could be.

519
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And we have seen what that results in in terms of botnets dominating these devices, taking over people's DNS, exploiting zero days these things are riddled with, default passwords that are like the MAC address, like the list goes on and on.

520
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
That's routers.

521
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Like, we need to take those lessons seriously and build IoT devices that reflect those lessons.

522
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And one of the core lessons is you need an update mechanism and channel to these devices to keep them secure because they're connected to people's networks.

523
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And that's one of the things Azure Sphere offers that I think is very compelling, a complete update lifecycle.

524
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Well, this is Canonical offering the same thing from the Linux side of camp, but it's a much more B2B kind of relationship because Canonical is a manageable-sized company.

525
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So if you're a reasonably small to large-sized company, you could work directly with Canonical.

526
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
That's a huge benefit.

527
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
That is, right.

528
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Combine that with the fact that they've already, you know, with their phone exploration, like they've already pushed their OS to all kinds of similar spaces.

529
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Right.

530
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And you're likely already using it on the cloud.

531
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So it's just, I think it's a pretty clever play and I think they don't get enough attention for it because IoT OSs are just one of those things that people don't talk a lot about.

532
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It's hard to because with the long support cycle, like the last core release was ages ago.

533
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So this is the first time we've been talking about it for a long time.

534
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Yeah.

535
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I mean, I'm sorry, guys, I was distracted.

536
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I was watching my Ubuntu TV.

537
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
What are we talking about?

538
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I'm sorry.

539
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I got a call on my Ubuntu phone.

540
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I couldn't hear.

541
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
All right.

542
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Hang on.

543
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
My Tizen is ringing.

544
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'll be right back.

545
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You got your bell rang this week on Twitter.

546
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I saw you start tweeting about this.

547
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I knew you were percolating.

548
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And it starts with a simple tweet by Andrew Madsen.

549
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:39,000
He writes, it's weird how the iOS community has shifted so much from iOS development to Swift, quote unquote.

550
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Five years on and a huge part of what everyone's doing revolves around the language and not how to create great apps.

551
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Why is that?

552
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And then after, let's see, let's see.

553
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That was at that.

554
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm just doing a little time math here.

555
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Mm hmm.

556
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Analyzing.

557
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So Mike percolates on it for around 12 to 16 hours.

558
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And he says, you know what?

559
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Thinking more about this conversation.

560
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
This is now our our our host, Michael Dominic.

561
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So he's thinking more about this conversation, about how iOS dev and macOS dev scenes have changed online.

562
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It occurs to me that there is a platform where do you think I'm doing a good Mike?

563
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, yeah.

564
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Keep it up.

565
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It occurs to me there is a platform where the past ethos of just build cool things lives.

566
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And that's desktop Linux.

567
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You can see it in particular on elementary OS.

568
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Oh, man.

569
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And, you know, I got to completely agree.

570
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I said I think it's a fair point on the iOS side and the Mac side.

571
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Things are driven by the trends of the mega corporation that drives it.

572
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Probably rightfully so.

573
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And right now that is Swift.

574
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So you see the culture of the community sort of a line.

575
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's it's it.

576
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
There is a long stick to it sometimes with the Apple community, but you do eventually see them kind of fall in line with the Apple ethos.

577
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
This is interesting because it's a flip side.

578
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
We talk a lot about the benefits of having that sort of corporate backing, right?

579
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But open source is often the scratch your own itch community.

580
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Right. It's sort of like the last bastion of scratch your own itch.

581
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And I think that's pretty profound pondering you're doing there, Mr. Dominic.

582
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Yeah, I mean, there is one other thing I would probably add.

583
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Long time listeners and probably not less will know that I had a Chris, how can we say this, a passionate reaction to the announcement of Swift?

584
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
An allergic, you might say. Oh, my.

585
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You know, I actually went back and re-listened to that episode kind of recently.

586
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's not a great look to do that.

587
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I was like panicked you were going to bail at any moment.

588
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It was. Yeah.

589
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Like just throw a chair.

590
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I had a little flashback moment when I listened to that.

591
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So there is an alternate universe, theoretically.

592
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And I think this is other people, not me, saw Swift and realized what they could do was because it was brand new.

593
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Because Apple, as you guys are saying, does basically control the iOS ecosystem, the iOS development ecosystem in particular, and to a lesser extent, Mac.

594
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
There was an opportunity.

595
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It was basically resetting the board, right?

596
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
There would be some opportunity.

597
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And we see this, how many Swift podcasts exist now?

598
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
How many Swift blogs, right?

599
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Yeah.

600
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
To position yours.

601
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Right.

602
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
To basically climb the ladder, so to speak, in the community.

603
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Position yourself as a Swift expert.

604
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm using snare quotes here.

605
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
There was a little resistant by some very few people who didn't want to switch.

606
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I think people just tried to seize that opportunity.

607
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And then the reality is Apple has been really aggressive at pushing Swift.

608
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So if you really love the Mac platform, if you love iOS, well, you're crazy not to embrace Swift.

609
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,000
What's interesting is that something else happened at the same time, which is all the indies basically got killed.

610
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You know, even I believe somebody can fact check me and apologies if I'm wrong, but I believe a couple of months ago, even Panic Software, one of the biggest Apple ecosystem development companies,

611
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
that independent app makers had layoffs, right?

612
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Black Pixel has had layoffs.

613
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
In fact, they had to merge with somebody.

614
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:18,000
All of these, if you were in the Apple community in the early to mid 2000s, the mid aughts, these were kind of the big guys that you looked up to.

615
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Not that they're gone, right?

616
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
They're not like gone, gone.

617
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:35,000
But many of them have either refocused on consulting, writing enterprise apps for larger corporations or, you know, still have their products, but don't make that much money on them, right?

618
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Have shrunk.

619
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I mean, OmniGraph, the Omni group rather has been pretty open in the last, I would say, five years about discussing, you know, some of the changes that have happened to the market.

620
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
So take all those things together, right?

621
00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Take the fact that there's definitely an opportunity for, you know, look, when Swift came out and we, I remember when like the first Swift Focus podcast came out, that mother jumped the charts, like choose Linux.

622
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
There's your plug.

623
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
There's your plug, Jason.

624
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Why?

625
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Well, because one, Apple controls the iTunes charts and two, it was an opportunity for an ambitious person to basically try to, you know, jump up in the ranks.

626
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And also all the NDS are like broke now.

627
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I mean, I can't, I know Linux hippies that this is going to feel weird for you.

628
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
People used to sell their software for money.

629
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And like there were these small companies that used to make a lot of money just selling Mac OS apps and to a lesser extent iOS apps.

630
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And that is, I mean, I'm sure there are edge cases still, and obviously Panic! and Omni still exist, but that is just not in general the case anymore.

631
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Wow. See, that was always touted to me as one of the like professional aspects.

632
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Like sure, there might not be as much open source stuff, but if you've got the money and you have work to do, there are applications to do it.

633
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I mean, some of the big ones are still there.

634
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You know what, but there's also in those applications, and I'm wondering if you see this as much on the Android side, Wes, there is a big, hard shift to subscriptions.

635
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Every kind of productivity app I've gotten on the iPad Pro that is a large productivity app mostly is being monetized by a monthly, not by an in-app.

636
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Not all of them, but I'd say 95%.

637
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And now, Hadeah loves using the pencil on the iPad Pro to draw. Those are like sign up for $9 a month to get the drawing for new drawings and new colors and new tips and stuff like that.

638
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Like everything is being monetized with a monthly subscription.

639
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I guess we're just okay with it now, right?

640
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I mean, you might not actually be, but people seem to be paying.

641
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I feel like I understand why, because software development is an ongoing process of creating the software, maintaining the software, providing support, adding new features, adding.

642
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Even if you just keep up with the mobile platform pace of development, Android's true in this case too, perhaps not as rapid, but true.

643
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:11,000
You have to just maintain at a certain point to stay in the Play Store, to stay in the App Store, and that takes time and money.

644
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Then you combine people emailing you for support, people that want new features.

645
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I guess really the old model sort of assumed a certain amount of growth, right?

646
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
The only way it was sustainable is that you had new customers.

647
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
That's it. That's it.

648
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And you could bump major versions and get another $100.

649
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Right. You might do that. You might have like a limited license, whatever.

650
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Yeah. And like I touched on last week, not to beat this dead horse, but I think both Google and Apple are incentivized to have ongoing subscriptions.

651
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
If they can turn all of these apps into little subscriptions, will they get a cut of that?

652
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So the owners of these stores are incentivized to encourage this behavior.

653
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Just make predictable income for everyone.

654
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Which means keep prices low so that way we can get monthlies.

655
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Yeah, but for that to make sense, and I think this is where some of the Indies have ended up going, you need a lot of people buying your $5 a month or $20 a year or whatever it's going to be subscription.

656
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I mean, you need a lot of people.

657
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I don't know.

658
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I mean, if you get 500 people that are all paying $5 a month, that might matter more than 1,000 people that download it for free, but only 100 of them.

659
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I mean, I don't know.

660
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
You got to look at the – it depends on what your sales might be.

661
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
There's a lot of things there.

662
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:50,000
But like for – you look at Patreon, it's a similar system there. You can have a content creator that can make a few thousand dollars a month on Patreon but can then afford to distribute content to hundreds of thousands of people.

663
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So subscriptions do work in certain kinds of situations.

664
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:04,000
They can, but I think this is where sometimes talking to people who weren't like super Apple-focused back in the day, it's not like Patreon, right?

665
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It's not like you're writing – you're a one-man band writing an app and let's take your $5 a month.

666
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
That's $60 a year.

667
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
500 people, is that $30,000 if my math is correct?

668
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
The Indies that exist in the Mac ecosystem weren't – of course, they were into one-guys, right?

669
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
They were one-man, one-woman shops, of course.

670
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I'm not saying they weren't.

671
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
But the ones that people tend to think about were small businesses that employed five to ten people.

672
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
30 grand for an app is a dev site, right?

673
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
That's not even like – that's not even half of a dev salary except for like super junior people.

674
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah, you're right.

675
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
The subscriptions, it either has to be – okay, for that – yeah, right.

676
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
If you're talking about a company that's more than ten people, yeah, it's got to be a pretty big scale.

677
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Well, even five, right?

678
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Let's just say you're five software developers.

679
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Then I'm going to – okay, we're going to make lots of assumptions, right?

680
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
We're going to say US or Europe.

681
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Why would you work for – why would you – it's just not enough money.

682
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But it used to be, right?

683
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Remember, OmniGraffle used to be a couple hundred dollars for one license, right?

684
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Same thing for all of Panic stuff and prices have gone down over the years.

685
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
These were little companies making quarter million, half million dollars just doing their independent apps.

686
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
God's honest truth, other than some of the old ones who are still stuck around, I cannot name.

687
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
In fact, I would actually challenge you guys.

688
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Can you name a new app, and we'll just use the term loosely, any platform you care to mention where they're just selling it to consumers or to small businesses, right?

689
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Any new company since let's say 2014 that has started or launched something.

690
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Oh, boy.

691
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's like a standalone product.

692
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You got me with new company.

693
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
That is not also a consultancy, right?

694
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Because I don't count.

695
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
On the App Store, yes.

696
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You know, like things like Drafts and IA Writer.

697
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But not on the desktop.

698
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Not on any of my desktops, no.

699
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
There's been nothing.

700
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
No, man.

701
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Wow.

702
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I can name one.

703
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
What?

704
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
If they would just let ISH into the App Store, that guy, they'd be in great shape.

705
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Yeah.

706
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
That would be nice.

707
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
That would be nice.

708
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
That does make me ponder.

709
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

710
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Still hate you, Richard.

711
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Still hate you.

712
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
He accomplished his mission apparently.

713
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So can we talk about hardware for one more moment?

714
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
One more time?

715
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I know.

716
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm pretty depressed about the software.

717
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I know.

718
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Let's try.

719
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Hang on.

720
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Let me spill this water.

721
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I think we're in a really interesting time for hardware.

722
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So Mike's got these two System76 rigs that come out of the box, run on Linux.

723
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Pretty nice.

724
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Great options for developers.

725
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Plus, Dell's got their developer line.

726
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Yeah.

727
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Wes and I can attest the T480 runs Linux perfectly well.

728
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Sure does.

729
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Flawlessly, if you want to get a ThinkPad.

730
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And then today, there is a rumor out that there will be a 13-inch MacBook with 32 gigabytes

731
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
of RAM.

732
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
32?

733
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Boy, I mean, that's a number I had hoped for for a long time.

734
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I know we're not allowed to make predictions anymore.

735
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,000
But I, unlike Mike, I'm actually feeling pretty good about Apple's hardware prospects.

736
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
That's a big change.

737
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I mean, right?

738
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Like a year ago, that was not the case.

739
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Yeah.

740
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I was, I think, the most vocal critic on this show about it.

741
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
But I'm looking at where Intel's chips that are likely going to ship in 2019 are going

742
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
to land, what might make it in the MacBooks.

743
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And I feel like since the iMac Pro was a pretty big hit, the Mac Mini seemed like a pretty

744
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
solid release.

745
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Yeah.

746
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I feel like they're getting momentum.

747
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
They're getting their heads around this again, is what I suspect, right as Mike is a completely

748
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
jumping chip.

749
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
What are your thoughts on that?

750
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Just as we wrap up the hardware thing, because I'll tell you, I look at this and I think

751
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
to myself, Mike, I could be in the market for a 13-inch MacBook Pro.

752
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I thought no one needed more than 16 gigs of RAM.

753
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I'm kidding.

754
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Well, I'd use that to run a Linux VM.

755
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Exactly.

756
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I heard something very, very different.

757
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
So, it's weird.

758
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I heard there was going to be a 16-inch one.

759
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Oh, yeah.

760
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
No, it's both.

761
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yeah.

762
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
That is the problem.

763
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It's both.

764
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Who cares about it?

765
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Nobody.

766
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Who's going to buy that?

767
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Nobody.

768
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I mean, that is kind of a serious workstation, I guess.

769
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah.

770
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
That would be pretty cool.

771
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
But that sucker should go to 64 gigs.

772
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
But 32 gigs in a 13-inch, I am all on the 13-inch laptop.

773
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I will never buy it.

774
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
You run all the Linux VMs you need.

775
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I will never buy a larger laptop than 13 inches from now on.

776
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
For the rest of my life, I don't think I'll...

777
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I'd give 14, I think.

778
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
But you're right with that.

779
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I mean, you travel enough though.

780
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
That's hard.

781
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Yeah.

782
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It's crazy.

783
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Yeah.

784
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
That could make sense.

785
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I mean, my biggest concern, to get me to go back to a MacBook in any kind of serious capacity,

786
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I would need a keyboard that is not defeated by a grain of sand.

787
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah.

788
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I know I'm half joking, but I've taken so many of them in for that.

789
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
That's fair.

790
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
What's the early word on that Darter keyboard and trackpad?

791
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
It is...

792
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Okay.

793
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So, spoiler alert, and I don't think Sub776 is going to like this comment.

794
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Don't buy the Galaga.

795
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The Darter is so much better in both.

796
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The keyboards, that's a taste thing, but the trackpad is so much more accurate.

797
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Not that the Galaga is bad, but the Galaga is your basic like Windowsy, you know, non-Apple

798
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
trackpad.

799
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
The Darter is much closer.

800
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Now, they still aren't like a MacBook trackpad, because apparently Apple is the only people

801
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
who've learned the arcane magics required to make a good trackpad, but it's significantly

802
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
better, and it's about as good as you would get on say an XPS.

803
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Okay.

804
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
That's interesting.

805
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
There's a lot going on.

806
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It's just a lot.

807
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I don't know what to make of any of it, Mr. West.

808
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I know.

809
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I'm kind of...

810
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
It's nice that the T480 has been so solid, because I don't have to think about it, at

811
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
least for like a little bit.

812
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Yeah.

813
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I've been getting tweets asking, people asking to listen to the show, if we still recommend

814
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
the T480.

815
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I've gotten a couple, so I figured we'd address it on the show.

816
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Yeah.

817
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
It's something that I think I'd still recommend.

818
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Yeah.

819
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It's no beauty, but it is pretty solid just as a workstation.

820
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
What do you think?

821
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I've been thinking I might recommend it at high DPI.

822
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Yeah.

823
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I mean, it depends on what your workflow is and how much that matters to you.

824
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I think one advantage is if you don't go high DPI, it can be pretty simple.

825
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,120
You have like XFCE on here, and you just used it for some appliance type situation.

826
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,000
That would be a really good machine.

827
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah.

828
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,200
For me, I think the MacBook might be a more effective machine for me just because I am

829
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,100
very unhappy with Linux audio stack right now.

830
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,580
As you know, I'm very unhappy.

831
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,840
We don't need to go in on the show.

832
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,800
So I think for me, that might be the direction I go.

833
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,580
We'll see where it goes, but I think it's going to be a strong year, and the overall

834
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,760
trends probably won't change much, but I think they're going to have a strong year.

835
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,280
Well, if you're going Apple before we cut out here, what about Mac Pro?

836
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,680
Isn't that the hotness if you're waiting on a Mac that – I know you travel a lot, so

837
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,840
it's probably – do you foresee a Mac Pro in studio?

838
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,840
No.

839
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,840
What would it take for that to happen?

840
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,760
I mean, I can't even think of that.

841
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,760
They'd have to basically make a Thalio.

842
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,760
That's what they'd have to do.

843
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,760
Like if the Thalio was a –

844
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,760
Yeah, that'd be nice.

845
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,760
Yeah.

846
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,880
Because I really – I think that's great hardware.

847
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:28,360
I just simply – I've had an – I've had an ongoing relationship with Linux Audio

848
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:33,640
Stack for a long time now, and we just recently decided to see other people.

849
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:41,300
We're happy, and we're still sharing custody of the studio, but we decided for both Linux

850
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,360
Audio Stack and for myself, it's just better if we see other people.

851
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,040
Core Audio just does something for you.

852
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,040
Well, yeah.

853
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,760
That's not on – that's not on Pulse.

854
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,280
That's nothing – that's just between Core Audio and I.

855
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,280
It's not –

856
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,280
Sure.

857
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,280
Nothing on Pulse.

858
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,280
So, yeah.

859
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,280
That's where I'm at.

860
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,280
Oh, God.

861
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,280
Okay.

862
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,280
Mr. Dominic, where should people find you throughout the week?

863
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
At Tumultco on Twitter.

864
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,280
That's fair enough.

865
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,280
I can't believe that's it, but that is the show somehow.

866
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,280
It's nice being here with you guys.

867
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,280
It's a lot of fun.

868
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,280
Thank you for having me.

869
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,760
I don't know if I'll be back next week, but I do like being here.

870
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,260
We'd like to hear your feedback.

871
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,480
We need to get more questions and feedback into the show.

872
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,480
Our feedback section –

873
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,480
We do need some.

874
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,480
Yeah, come on.

875
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,480
Let us know.

876
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,880
The downloads are still there, so people are still listening, but they're not writing

877
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,880
in.

878
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,720
You, dear audience member, only you can change that.

879
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,400
We make dramatic changes to the show, and we hear just from a few people.

880
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,400
It's very confusing.

881
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,560
So let us know, because otherwise we're left here assuming probably the worst about

882
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,920
you, really, if you think about it.

883
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,920
Isn't that –

884
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,920
Therefore, us.

885
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,920
It's human nature.

886
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,920
It is human.

887
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,280
So the only way you can fix it is by going to coder.show and then hit the contact link.

888
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,280
See?

889
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,280
There's a solution there for you.

890
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,280
It's easy.

891
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,360
You can subscribe to the show there, coder.show slash subscribe, and you can grab links to

892
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,560
all the things we talked about at coder.show slash 355.

893
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,240
Mr. Payne, where can people find the excellently new revamped TechSnap program?

894
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,640
TechSnap dot systems.

895
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,080
Go there to find out why you should probably already be using QoS at home.

896
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,080
Yeah.

897
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,560
Yeah, and some cool tools in that episode as well.

898
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,840
I'm at Chris Ellis.

899
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,040
The network is at Jupyter Signal.

900
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,320
We do this show live on a Monday.

901
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:12,920
You can go to JupyterBroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that, jblive.tv to watch

902
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,920
that.

903
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,520
Thanks for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program, and we'll see

904
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:47,200
you right back here next week.
