00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Coder Radio, episode 460 for April 4th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, hello there! You look nice today and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
My name is Chris, and Mike's taking the week off, I think, to hunt iguanas.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I hear it's a big problem down there, in the house and outside of the house.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But I'm not sure. I don't ask for details.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So this episode, right on the 460, turned out to be a great one to reflect, to go back.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And I was looking through the backlog and I was thinking,

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I know there's a couple of episodes I wanted to replay for you guys.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And it turns out, one of them aired exactly this week, one year ago.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And in this episode, we chat about the new Supreme Court ruling in the Google versus Oracle copyright fight

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
that had finally landed, like there was some finality to that after talking about it for a decade.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And we had a moment with that.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But there's a couple of other things in there, like we speculate about future hardware advances

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and what might make us buy or switch to those hardware advances when they land.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And it turns out, I think we nailed it.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And then the other thing that's in here that's noteworthy is we have a discussion around Libidwaita,

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
which we'll talk about in the show more.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But it's actually just shipping this week and last week.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And for most people, they're not actually going to get their hands on GNOME 42

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
until they install a distribution with it, like Tumbleweed or Fedora or Ubuntu 2204.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And so it's wild because we're talking about what Libidwaita does.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And then the year in between that episode, 408, and this one, 460,

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
was a year of fierce debate within the Linux community.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So I think it's fascinating to reflect on that conversation.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Plus, you know what?

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Part of me misses talking about HomePods and robes.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So that was a lot of fun, too.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So I hope you enjoy.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I want to know if it's true or not.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Did you buy another HomePod?

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, because I couldn't goddamn find one.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What made you decide to buy a third HomePod?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Two, I get.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Three, well, might as well get four at that point and have another stereo pair.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You know what?

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The HomePod is just significantly better than the Sonos.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It is, isn't it?

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you have iOS devices.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah, that is true.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All right.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, I just thought I'd have to find out.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I had to because I'm trying to.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now, the trouble is I'm at the point where why don't they make the HomePod anymore

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and maybe lower the price to a more sane level?

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Because I would totally buy.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I mean, honestly, if I had a multi-level residence or like a place with a basement,

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I could be good for five or six HomePods.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All right.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now, listen.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Stay a while and listen.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, Decker, there you are.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I know.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's nice, isn't it?

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You got to work him in every now and then.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I have a robe update.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have a very exciting robe update.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about this because this was an area that I think

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
is interesting from a small business standpoint and managing your small business.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So I'll come back to that.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But quickly, the update is domestic and US orders should start arriving around May 19th, May 20th.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We didn't quite make the window and the materials got used and had to be reordered

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
because of some of the issues that held up the order, which are related to international troubles.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Now, international orders stand by.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll have more news for you next week.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We're still trying our best to work that out.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I may have bad news, but either way, we'll get in touch with you as we try to sort that.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Boy, a lot of lessons learned.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I have rethought a lot of things, and I'm also very excited that we actually have like a ship date

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
or an arrival date, perhaps, for the robes.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But I feel like as a business, I'm rethinking my entire strategy around swag.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And I think what, when I look back at this as sort of like a post-mortem,

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I think one of the primary problems I had was I was attempting to do something that was really,

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
really outside the norm for like my first thing.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And additionally, I couldn't work with a shop that like shipping internationally was like the thing they did

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
because of how unique this particular thing was.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So they were a domestic operation who generally would like just send like 100 or 200 units to me,

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and then I would ship them out to everybody around the world.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's generally the type of customer they have.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And instead, I was trying to get them to send it everywhere in the world, which they can do,

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but it's not their core competency.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And as a result of that, I didn't appreciate how much that would matter.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But I understand that it seems like for the kind of thing I want to do and to ship internationally at reasonable rates,

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
because some of these rates to like anybody who lived in Germany,

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
the original pricing we were working with was $150 of shipping per robe.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Holy crap.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The cheapest international shipping we had was $95.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So it was a range between $95 and almost $200 with the exception of Canada, which is like $85.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So now we're trying to sort that out.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And it was clear to me what would really work a lot better for an operation like JB who operates out of the States

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
but has a worldwide audience that represents a significant portion of its audience.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I have to build up some sort of operation where we're printing the shipping labels and slapping them on boxes

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and boxing them up here and then dropping them off at the post office and they're shipping them off.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I'm just not there yet.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So I try to get another company to do that part for me.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And the way they operate is the way the type of drop shipping they do is they need all the shipping information

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and get every robe's destination and then come back with a quote.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And then, of course, there's tons of back and forth and trying to find alternative fulfillment places

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and all that kind of stuff, which is where we're at right now for the international.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But the domestic orders, what we decided to do was break those off into their own original order set

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
from the original supplier and just get those out and going while we sort out the rest of it.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I mean, I learned a lot and I think I've internalized a new strategy for the company

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and how we're going to learn how to do this.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can't just start selling swag.

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't just turn on a switch and all of a sudden I'm like, you know, stocking swag and boxing swag and shipping swag.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
First of all, it sounds like hell.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And second of all, I have no idea what I'm doing.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And third of all, I have no inventory.

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I have to figure out how to get that skill set while not bankrupting the company

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
because this could go really simple where I pre-order a hundred robes for a second batch,

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
stock them here at the studio, and then never get them shipped out or never get it.

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There's so many ways I could screw this up.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So I have to build institutional knowledge while not screwing the pooch

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and keeping the train on the tracks while we try to build up this new aspect of the business.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But I feel like my lessons learned here are if I want to be serious about how to do this,

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm going to have to be kind of responsible for at least like maybe what I would do.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I guess I'll put it this way.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If I were going to do this again, I would take pre-orders and I would just order 200 robes.

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And then once 200 robes were sold, that's as many as we had.

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We could do a second batch if we wanted.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And then I would box them up and ship them out myself with like a label printer

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and like, you know, on a specific day, a couple of us are here at the studio,

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
boxing things up, loading the car and sending it out a couple of times a week.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And that's what I would do this time around.

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And then, you know, and then maybe open up another 200 orders or something.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But I'm just not there yet.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Or don't do it at all.

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Right.

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Robes were a stupid idea.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yep. Yep.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You shouldn't have done them.

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Nope. Nope.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I warned you.

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I felt like a good challenge would force me to dive deep into this and like I'd have to solve it in route.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And that might be true.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Unless we got Reese and Dylan and Abigail, right?

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Your daughter.

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you talking about you're talking about a ham slice in the channel?

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No. Yeah.

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We just enslaved the kids and make them box all the ropes up.

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, yeah. I'm totally going to enlist the kids.

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, yeah, for sure.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Like, I mean, I have a 14 year old brother.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He just turned 14.

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm totally cool with child labor.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I just make it fun somehow.

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'd figure out a way, you know, play some music, make a game out of it.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We need to learn.

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No, no, no, no, no.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Listen, my first job was a janitor when I was in high school.

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And for all my young men in the audience, you think girls are neat and clean.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Clean a ladies room.

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It will change your life.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Should have done something much simpler.

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Like a T-shirt.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That would have been easy.

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Could have done a lot of T-shirts.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
T-shirts suck.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
They do suck.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That was what it was.

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm so bored of typical swag.

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let me just fix your problem for you.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Do the Coder radio beer glass like a Stein kind of thing.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's an internet.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah, OK.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I was even being like lazier than that.

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But if we can pull off a Stein, that's even better.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's kind of like 400 saying, you know, I mean, I'm just saying they're hippies anyway.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What are they going to care?

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's true.

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What do they even know over there?

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Nothing.

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I have been actually legitimately looking for like a supplier of of mugs or cups that have

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
like a ring around the bottom that prevent tipping.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I mean, if you get an actual Stein with a hinge on it, that'd be pretty cool.

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And that would be cool.

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I feel like that's going to have the same problem as the ropes.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't know.

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah.

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And plus plus shipping something breakable like that probably isn't a good first.

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah.

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
OK.

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
All right.

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
All right.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Fine.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Fine.

189
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Fine.

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't want to dare.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I dare.

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I touch the luck monks of feudal Linux observance.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Right.

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
How about this Coder radio martini glass?

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's right on brand.

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's actually very on brand.

197
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm just going to say.

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah.

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That sounds great.

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I can tell you, I do mad butter martini glasses and that is not very hard.

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So.

203
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
All right.

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
All right.

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm filing that one away.

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Mm hmm.

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
OK.

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I can see I was trying to think of like some something to put inside the glass to like

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
a stir or something.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't know.

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But anyway, so thank you, everybody.

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,440
I'm going to get these ropes figured out and then I'm going to make some like lessons learned

213
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
plans that I'll share with everybody.

214
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,000
I want from a business standpoint to do in the future.

215
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,200
But that's the rope update for now.

216
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,800
It's just it's been way more than I expected, although I did.

217
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,000
I do totally acknowledge I brought it all on myself.

218
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,400
I do this to myself.

219
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,000
It is completely my fault.

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,280
I acknowledge that.

221
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,020
But I am excited to say Robe Bros in the US, you'll be receiving your be receiving your

222
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,280
robe soon.

223
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,160
Those of you internationally, you'll be hearing from us either with bad news or an alternative

224
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,840
source or perhaps perhaps we will be just absolutely forced to do a round two.

225
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
I don't know.

226
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
I don't know.

227
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
I mean, maybe maybe more robes will be demanded.

228
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
You know, we get a lot of emails in.

229
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,560
I feel like you're just making an excuse to do more robes.

230
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,520
I think this whole like with you just saying you're going to do more robes.

231
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,160
Personally, I kind of want to be done with the robe.

232
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,880
It's been a lot.

233
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,720
I don't believe you.

234
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,160
And here's what's going to happen.

235
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,280
In June, I'm going to start selling mad botter swag on here because you know what?

236
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
I deliver.

237
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Do you know why I deliver?

238
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,000
I only sell glass and t shirts.

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah, I know.

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
You know, a shot glass would be easier to would have been a lot easier shot glass would

241
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
have been a lot easier.

242
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,800
Look at Java Jax, the Coder Radio sippy cup.

243
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,160
I have been looking.

244
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,680
I've been looking something spill proof.

245
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
But you know what?

246
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,720
A lot of the things that they sell as like rebrandable swag.

247
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,800
I seem like they're targeted adults for some reason and not children.

248
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,760
I mean, I feel there was no need for hate speech, but maybe we should just move on to

249
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,920
the actual show.

250
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,480
I think what we need is an artist and sippy cup created by the audience that we could

251
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,160
mass produce or maybe only make a couple limited.

252
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,800
You know, the only person qualified to create a sippy cup in the world is me because I will

253
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,160
find every flaw.

254
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,520
There you go.

255
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,680
You could be a good product tester.

256
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,480
Oh, and then I think the other thing I'm going to do in the future, although I haven't worked

257
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,960
out the details on this yet either, is I think I'm going to figure out a way that members

258
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,600
of our shows can get discounts when they buy any of the merch that we do.

259
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,240
Why the hell don't we have new stickers?

260
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Yeah.

261
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
And stickers, too.

262
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,280
I think stickers are I think if I'm going to be able to ship robes, I could ship stickers

263
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
too.

264
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,480
Dude, I can ship stickers and I'm usually like depressed or hungover or like wiping

265
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
somebody's butt.

266
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
I mean, come on.

267
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,680
Well, stay tuned because stickers have been a topic of conversation recently.

268
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,880
Now let's get into the email.

269
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
We got a lot.

270
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,200
We had a spicy inbox this week.

271
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,040
Not all of them made it onto the air, but James S. writes in with an idea that I have

272
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,240
a feeling you're going to think is terrific.

273
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,640
He says, Hey, guys, I love the show.

274
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,040
The talk about the new Apple Silicon performance in the context of development, though, has

275
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,640
triggered me slightly.

276
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,680
I've long felt that developers should be working deliberately on low to mid range hardware

277
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,520
because otherwise it's just too easy to hide bad code behind a fast CPU.

278
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,120
The majority of end users don't run the latest and greatest.

279
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,820
They have older hardware.

280
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:33,240
What do you think of this idea that if a developer has tons of RAM and a fast CPU, they almost

281
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,040
always write code that feels fine on their system, but crawls on hardware that the typical

282
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,640
end user actually has?

283
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,700
James, I'm sure you're a lovely person and I think you're great.

284
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,960
Thank you for listening to the show.

285
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,920
Your idea is stupid.

286
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,340
What a developer should do is have a good computer with a gimped VMs for testing.

287
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,200
So the VMs should be intentionally weak to test.

288
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,440
For instance, on my Mac, my Mac Pro, I have good Windows VM for dev and a very crappy

289
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,000
Windows VM for testing.

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,960
And it's like a third of the RAM and a third of the GPU, you know, like, you know, it's

291
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,080
VMware, so the allocation, I'm sorry, it's parallels.

292
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,640
I actually keep saying VMware.

293
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,880
I don't use VMware.

294
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Okay.

295
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,000
I think I like VMware better on the Mac.

296
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,240
I agree with your point, James, that for testing, you should use a slightly weaker hardware

297
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,280
or significantly weaker hardware.

298
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:30,440
I honestly think a good workstation with different virtual machines for different use cases is

299
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,740
the best way.

300
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,240
So again, I, Chris, I agree with this point that like when I'm testing Windows software

301
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,720
or any other kind of software, like Linux, whatever, my VMs for testing have like the

302
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,320
minimal specs.

303
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,760
I don't want to have like five machines because that would be great, great.

304
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,720
I like your answer a little bit better than yours.

305
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,080
My answer was I think most developers keep a lot of their older hardware around.

306
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
Not me.

307
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
I pour marketing into it.

308
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
Well, yeah.

309
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Yeah, for sure.

310
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,280
But I think some developers have like probably a couple of iterations of machines around

311
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,400
so they can use that for this thing called Q&A where they could actually test it on the

312
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,280
older hardware directly.

313
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,440
I am not a fan of limiting any developer's productivity.

314
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,280
Like if you get in the flow and you are having one of those beautiful moments, I feel like

315
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,160
the machine should be as fricking fast as possible to let you rip.

316
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,880
Like I buy my guys the best machines we can afford.

317
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Amen.

318
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,640
It's the only area where I don't economize in the business.

319
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
I don't.

320
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
You know what?

321
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Like what?

322
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,960
What's the stupidly dumb, expensive machine that the asshole who works for me tricked

323
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,480
me into buying for him from System76, the Oryx?

324
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,240
Oh, that big laptop.

325
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
You got the big one.

326
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Yeah.

327
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Yeah.

328
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
He's got three monitors.

329
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
So I'm like, this is not what was intended.

330
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,640
I know, but I have two, I have a giant GPU.

331
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Like you don't need a GPU.

332
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,600
He's like, I know, but you bought it anyway, you stupid bastard.

333
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,840
Hey, man, you want smooth window manager animations.

334
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Let's be honest.

335
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
That stuff matters.

336
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,320
It still crashes if he runs an extension.

337
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
That's too soon.

338
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
It's too soon.

339
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,640
I actually have big news on that front later in the show.

340
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
You're pregnant.

341
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,440
No, in the genome shell related world that I want to get your take on.

342
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,880
But I think VMs are a good answer too.

343
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
But trolling aside, right?

344
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,360
The question is, if you're a company, right?

345
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,320
If you're like someone like me where you have, you employ devs, it makes sense to buy them

346
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,320
a higher spec machine than have them test in virtual machines that are intentionally

347
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
slow.

348
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,720
If you're like one guy, though, obviously keep your old machines back and just test

349
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
on those, right?

350
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,120
You don't need to buy a crazy iMac Pro that will be obsolete by your MacBook Air within

351
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,000
two years because Apple's evil.

352
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,360
What was I talking about?

353
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,960
Ron writes in, he says, hey, talking about Apple's gross dear code of radio, there are

354
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,080
two kinds of people who use Apple.

355
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,160
Number one, the technologically illiterate and number two, the insecure.

356
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,080
Group one is terrified of computers and group two is terrified of coffee shop laptop shaming.

357
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,880
Let's debunk some Apple fanboy myths.

358
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,480
Now, I don't know if Ron's trolling us because he spelled fanboy with an I, which I think,

359
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,280
I don't know if he's trying to be.

360
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,920
Yeah, he writes, the last time I spent 20 hours away from a power source was never.

361
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,320
So implying you don't need long battery life.

362
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,680
Well, I have definitely done that, but keep going.

363
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
Yeah, I know.

364
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,120
And it's like if you've ever gone to an event, do you speak at conferences ever?

365
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
Yeah.

366
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,480
A conference like the battery life, especially when you get to that stupid moment where you

367
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,520
realize you didn't charge, you left your laptop in your bag overnight.

368
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,960
You get there to do the talk.

369
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,040
You didn't plug it in.

370
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:44,420
And because Apple only lets you have a couple of USB-C ports, you're really in a tight spot.

371
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,900
But battery life matters a lot for me, too, because I spend a lot of weekends completely

372
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,840
off grid where I am only generating power that comes from the sun.

373
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,520
And sometimes in the Pacific Northwest, there's not a lot of sun.

374
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Right.

375
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
And I'm usually on a Coke bender.

376
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
So, yeah.

377
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Right.

378
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Of course.

379
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
And who's going to bother plugging in when you're on a bender?

380
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,880
He says, syncing digital content across devices has never been easier.

381
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,520
iCloud isn't needed.

382
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,780
He set up next cloud in 10 minutes.

383
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,080
No, no, no.

384
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,080
Ten minutes.

385
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,500
He had next cloud going in 10 minutes.

386
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,880
You were wrong when you said next cloud, but keep going.

387
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,520
I mean, this is this is a common thing that I think it's hard for our community to understand.

388
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,300
A lot of people have no interest in doing that, even if they have the technical capability

389
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,300
of doing it.

390
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,300
They don't care.

391
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
Yeah.

392
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,900
He says staying productive during renders is not about hoping things get faster on the

393
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,900
M1.

394
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
It's about organizing your workflow.

395
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,060
a custom PC used for content creation will scorch any Mac in existence.

396
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,300
Wrong stop custom PC. Yeah, wrong.

397
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,580
Right. Because most people are not buying custom and not customizing their PCs.

398
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,700
Yeah. So what's funny is so what I think guys like Ron kind of they don't look

399
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,580
at the actual market and go, oh, like there must be a reason

400
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,660
why a guy like Marques Brownlee buys the Mac Pro.

401
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,340
Right. Because, I mean, I'm sure he doesn't like burning money.

402
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,420
He'd rather probably buy that.

403
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,540
He'd rather spend that money on the next Tesla.

404
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,860
He's you know, why?

405
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,180
So why are they buying that Mac Pro?

406
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,060
And the reality is Final Cut.

407
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,380
It's Final Cut.

408
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,540
It's if you ask them, they will tell you it's because of Final Cut Pro 10.

409
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,900
Well, this is a developer show.

410
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,380
The reason I buy only System 76 and Macs for my guys is because I know out

411
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,580
of the box with either of those machines, they can get up and running.

412
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,940
Right. My biggest expense is payable.

413
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,820
And then additionally, like if one of those guys leaves and you want to move

414
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,100
that machine to somebody else, do you want to move them some weird custom built PC?

415
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,980
Or do you know I want to wipe it and put Pop OS, whatever, or Mac OS, whatever.

416
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,460
And then you scale that up for, like,

417
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,380
any company that has, like, an IT department with a bunch of employees.

418
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,900
It's just not scalable to do custom PCs.

419
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,460
The custom PCs are, I mean, bully for you.

420
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,380
No, that's great, seriously, for you.

421
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,140
But when you have, like, if I was just a solo shop, honestly,

422
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,860
I probably would have a custom PC.

423
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:07,460
There's still a group of individuals out there who think that what's selling Apple

424
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,260
and why Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world is because

425
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,060
of marketing and fanboys, and I don't really need to dwell on it.

426
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,060
I don't think it's I mean,

427
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,260
I think it's worth realizing that sometimes we can have real blinders

428
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,020
on to what seems to drive the market.

429
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,500
What seems to really drive the market seems to be battery life and performance.

430
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,540
And I would say visual appeal.

431
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,740
And then it's something that we don't

432
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,220
quite grok as a community is the entire package, right?

433
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,060
It's a product.

434
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:40,900
The cloud services and the fancy Apple sales, everything is part of an entire

435
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,500
product when you roll your own next cloud.

436
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,500
That's awesome.

437
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,380
And I have two.

438
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,620
I have two next cloud servers.

439
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,340
It's great.

440
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,420
The reality is, though, that's not a whole product.

441
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,020
You built a custom PC.

442
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,220
You loaded your own Linux on there and built it up just the way you like it.

443
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,780
And then you set up next cloud to do your sinking and you did it all on your own.

444
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,420
And that's fantastic.

445
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,780
I host a show with Alex called Self Hosted because I love that stuff.

446
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,940
But I have to be aware that the vast,

447
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,460
vast majority of the market, like the significant total vast majority

448
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,180
of the market, doesn't do that kind of stuff.

449
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,940
And so they need a solution that works well for them.

450
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,980
And the better and faster that solution is, the overall more people are there.

451
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,580
Technology experience is improved.

452
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,500
It's easy to dismiss this stuff, but I think it actually it deserves important

453
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,100
consideration and then then the next questions start to become like,

454
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,660
well, how do I make money on this reality?

455
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,820
Like, if I want to have a business and software development,

456
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,180
and this is the reality of the market, how do I make money on it?

457
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,900
I think that's a fair question to ask, too.

458
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,220
But maybe it's not.

459
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,980
Maybe your question is, and I'm not saying it is for everybody,

460
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,700
but I'm saying often in the context of the show, that's how we talk about it.

461
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,540
Maybe it's just how can I have fun with it?

462
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,020
And Ron, that might be the area you're in.

463
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,780
And you can be wired to a wall and you never have to go anywhere mobile,

464
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,980
and you can spend the time to set up next cloud and configure your Android

465
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,300
client to sync with your KDE desktop and, man, more power to you.

466
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,020
I wish I had more time to do that stuff because I love doing that stuff, too.

467
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,820
But you and I, my friend, we are a rare breed,

468
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,740
and we may be even fewer and fewer in some ways, at least compared to the overall

469
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,420
growth of the mobile and technology market.

470
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,220
Next one comes in from Alex.

471
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,900
Now, for him, the Linux desktop just isn't worth the hassle.

472
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,740
He says, first of all, love the show.

473
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,740
You guys are great.

474
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,300
He goes on to compliment us for a bit, but I'm going to skip over that.

475
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,900
But I really appreciate it. Thank you, Alex.

476
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,700
It's not you. It's me.

477
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
Yes, I got it.

478
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,740
He says you're great, and I just don't want to talk about it.

479
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,340
You know, like we focus on it too much.

480
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,940
Now, he says, some time ago you asked people to tell you about their work set up.

481
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,740
Remember when we came back, we did that for a little bit.

482
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,340
He says he proudly wrote in about his high-end Dell 7 series,

483
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,540
7000 series laptop running Ubuntu 1804 and i3.

484
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,340
The thing is, I really wanted this set up to work.

485
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,060
My employer insists on using some commercial VPN software as well as some

486
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,860
other office software that only runs on Windows, but I had it working for a bit.

487
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,500
I felt kind of like the hacker movie version of a developer spinning up new

488
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,140
borderless terminals and i3 and switching workspaces all while never really

489
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,540
leaving the keyboard. I felt productive.

490
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,740
But then one day when going to our support desk, trying to get some Linux

491
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,140
corner case fixed, the staff member most knowledgeable on Linux was out.

492
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,140
And I had a full day of work ahead of me.

493
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,740
So the solution they provided me was a used Mac.

494
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,540
What I got was a late 2020 Mac Pro fully decked out i7, 32 gigs of RAM,

495
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,940
1TB SSD.

496
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,940
And the amazing thing is, it doesn't really seem to get all that hot.

497
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,340
I don't really hear the fans to the point where they're audible,

498
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,540
even when running Docker or VMs.

499
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,540
I did disable Turbo Boost, but here's the kicker.

500
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,140
Docker for Mac works amazing on this Intel Mac.

501
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,740
And I just brew install all the GNU core utilities and just eat the annoyance

502
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,540
of some of the brew limitations and not really looking back.

503
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,740
The setup is working really well for me.

504
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,340
And he goes on to mention how he had some problems with gaming,

505
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,940
but he decided, you know, really for that, maybe I should just set up

506
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,740
a Windows 10 box.

507
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,540
In conclusion, I'm kind of embarrassed to say that I've ended up

508
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,340
leaving desktop Linux behind.

509
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,940
It, of course, is the only answer for server side work.

510
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,340
But my dumb terminal interface to it is, well, a shiny, expensive,

511
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,340
but effective gray slab from the guys in Cupertino.

512
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
Alex, that's hard for me to hear,

513
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,740
I have to say, as somebody who's been using desktop Linux for a very long time.

514
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,740
I know you have a religious objection to computers that actually work.

515
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,940
But yeah, this is this is why max.

516
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,940
This is why there will be no year of the links desktop, right?

517
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,940
You don't see a lot of people doing blog posts and YouTube videos about

518
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,340
switching away from Linux, right?

519
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:58,540
You see a lot of blog posts and hacker news stories about switching to Linux.

520
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,340
Let me tell you how many of them to the blog post about switching back.

521
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,340
I mean, I'm on an iMac Pro right now.

522
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,940
Sometimes you see it, but you don't see a lot.

523
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,140
But I've done several blog posts.

524
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,740
I'm on an iMac Pro, right?

525
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:14,540
Just I just hate I hate hearing this.

526
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,740
I really do. I hate I hate hearing this.

527
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,740
So I mean, I can tell you, I also have hated hearing a lot of things

528
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,140
over the last, let's say, six months and it doesn't get better.

529
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,340
So the M1 Pro is coming out in June.

530
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,340
Oh, too soon.

531
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,540
Yeah, if they had a if they had a 16 core, if they had a 16 core M1 with 32

532
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:41,740
gigs of RAM and two terabyte SSD and 27 inch plus screen, that'd be

533
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,740
pretty tempting.

534
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,140
The only other like shoe or whatever the term is I need to kind of drop

535
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:52,340
would be if I even got like a whiff that like the Linux M1 support was

536
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,940
getting dialed in and it was like, you know, within the next year,

537
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,340
it's going to be working for sure.

538
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,540
I think I'd probably pull the trigger, but it doesn't mean I just have

539
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,340
that be one of many machines that I have.

540
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,340
No, let's backpedal. Yes, of course.

541
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,740
No, no, it's just the reality is the reality is I need something mobile

542
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,940
and I still need lots of Linux and it's not going to do those things for

543
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,740
me because I'm not going to get a MacBook from them.

544
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,940
All right. All right. All right.

545
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,340
So it's just be one of many.

546
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,740
But I'm not. We'll see.

547
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,740
We'll see.

548
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,340
I think Apple is going to stick with the M1 for the remainder of the

549
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,340
year, and I'm not really interested in the M1 now.

550
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,140
Now I feel like I got to hold out for something better, too.

551
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,140
So that's what I'm hunkering down for.

552
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,740
The Fisher doth protest too much. Maybe it.

553
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
I am in a weird place with it.

554
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,340
I'll tell you that I can feel it.

555
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,740
It feels weird that I don't like it.

556
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,340
I'm uncomfortable with it.

557
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,140
And then the other thing that's hard is the lines between Gnome Shell

558
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,940
and Mac OS are even blurrier than ever because now Gnome Shell has

559
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,340
gone to horizontal workspace layouts and they have the same gesture

560
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,740
as Mac OS to get to it.

561
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,340
It's just one less finger.

562
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,740
It's a three finger gesture instead of a four finger and they move

563
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,940
the dock down to the bottom now and the whole thing's feeling a lot

564
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,340
like the two the two interfaces are colliding.

565
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,340
It's we've been here before, Sam.

566
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,740
Yeah, it's a weird overlap.

567
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,940
Scott writes in though.

568
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,740
He says, hey, I changed my mind for JavaScript on the server.

569
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,740
I once like Mike was just not having JavaScript on the server.

570
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,540
I thought I should always stay in the browser on the client side.

571
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,540
Just use it minimally.

572
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,740
But my mind changed once I learned about server side rendering and

573
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,740
it all clicked.

574
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,340
This allows the server to build the fundamentals of a web page and

575
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,740
then just send the browser.

576
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,540
Oh, this is not new at all.

577
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,540
Well, he says it's nice because in the browser gets this nice little

578
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,540
thing that can just display really super quick.

579
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,740
Any additional logic can be any minimal logic can be done on the

580
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,340
client, but the server does the bulk of the work.

581
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,140
He says it doesn't necessarily negate the idea of flask having an

582
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,540
API for jazz code and then load additional resources.

583
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,740
But he thinks it might be worth considering when you consider

584
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,340
server side rendering.

585
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,540
You're not having it, though.

586
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,540
It's not that I'm not having it is that this has existed for a very

587
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,540
long time.

588
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,140
It's not a new idea.

589
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,140
And this is how everything like ERB and flask and ginger.

590
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,940
I guess ginger would be the last version of ERB.

591
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,340
It's how it all works.

592
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,940
The server side builds the page and puts it down to the shithole

593
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
that is the web.

594
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:24,540
I mean, JavaScript is a language that should not exist.

595
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,740
I have written large things in JavaScript.

596
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,540
I have had to just delete them and I've lost tens of thousands of

597
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,140
dollars.

598
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,540
You need a better language.

599
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,140
Well, I can't argue with you.

600
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,740
I'm not going to be I'm not I'm not going to die on this hill for

601
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,740
this one.

602
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,740
It's I get what you're saying, man.

603
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:46,740
Like it's convenient for what you're doing, but it's it's not good.

604
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,740
Like it's just cheese.

605
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,340
You know, I'm not going to go into the history of server side rendering,

606
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,340
but not a new idea.

607
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,540
And it doesn't need to be JavaScript.

608
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,340
JavaScript is deeply compromised language.

609
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:07,940
We could say it's not a pure language that has a fundamental philosophy,

610
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,340
elegance, purity.

611
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:17,540
We could say, you know, say qua machismo, even I'm just off the top

612
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,140
of my head.

613
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,340
I'm thinking of a language.

614
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,140
You're my criteria and that might be objective.

615
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,140
See, obviously be a good language.

616
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,140
JavaScript is a bad language.

617
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,540
I think the fat cat proposes we ban JavaScript from the chat.

618
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,540
Promise you can't ban JavaScript just like you can't cure herpes.

619
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,540
It just won't go away.

620
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,540
He said and then Java Jack says JavaScript is what happens when there's

621
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,940
no competition in browser languages.

622
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,540
Spicy chat room tonight.

623
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,940
Koda Radio happy hour.

624
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,540
I am sorry.

625
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,740
I did start it tonight with my moaning before the show.

626
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,940
Yes, you know, that's why you got to show up live.

627
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,540
So that way you can catch the moaning at jblive.tv on a Monday.

628
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,940
Talescale.com slash coder.

629
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,940
I am so excited to welcome Talescale to the show.

630
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,540
You can go to talescale.com slash coder and get a free account for up to 20

631
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,940
devices and you support the show.

632
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,340
If you don't know, Talescale is a zero config VPN.

633
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
It installs on any device in minutes.

634
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,740
You can manage your firewall rules simply your DNS, your networking, all of

635
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,140
it very straightforward.

636
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,340
I have it on the iPad.

637
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,140
I have it on my phone.

638
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
I have it on the Android device.

639
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,540
I've got it on a Raspberry Pi running Linux.

640
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,740
I've got it on lots of VMS.

641
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:29,940
Now.

642
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,140
I've also been using this to connect my VMS together when I have some on

643
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,540
my laptop and on my desktop.

644
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,940
You can really just connect anything together into a mesh network using

645
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,340
WireGuard's noise protocol encryption.

646
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,140
So you're building a mesh network with the best VPN security out there

647
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,140
in the business and I leave it on all the time as an always on interface.

648
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,740
So now I essentially have a flat network between a series of my machines

649
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,340
and I've been able to set up bookmarks that point to their IP.

650
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,340
And if you throw a DNS server into that network, Talescale will work with

651
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,340
that and then you're starting to get name resolution over this private

652
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,940
flat WireGuard based mesh network.

653
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,540
I mean, it doesn't even matter if you're behind a firewall or carrier

654
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,940
grade NAT because I have to do that all the time.

655
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,340
This has changed how I access my information and it's also changing

656
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,540
how I do documentation.

657
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,540
Now that I know I can always get access to these Markdown files that I

658
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,940
have in my Raspberry Pi Linux box at home.

659
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,340
I know that that's a good source to get and store information from.

660
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,740
It's really great.

661
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,340
And because it runs on all these devices and it's so quick to set up,

662
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,540
you don't have to think about it much.

663
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,540
You can get going in a couple of minutes.

664
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,340
They support whatever single sign on vendor you'd like to use if you

665
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,340
want to go that route.

666
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,540
So maybe you have like a corporate Google account or a personal account

667
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,340
or whatever you however you do that.

668
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,340
What's great about that system is if you want to use two factor authentication

669
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,140
tailscales going to support that as well.

670
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,140
So when you install the client, which happens in seconds, you get a URL,

671
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,940
you associate it with your account and you're done.

672
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,940
The network's established.

673
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,340
It is so fast.

674
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:05,740
It is so simple to get a WireGuard grade mesh network set up in seconds.

675
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,340
So go try it for yourself.

676
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:12,540
See what I'm talking about and get 20 machines free on that network.

677
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,340
When you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

678
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,140
It's a great way to support the show and it's a great way to start with

679
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,540
something that I think will change how you work.

680
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,540
You're never going back after you get tailscale.

681
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,740
Tailscale.com slash coder.

682
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,340
All right.

683
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,940
Now it's time to talk about it.

684
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,940
The Supreme Court has ruled in Google's favor in the copyright dispute

685
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:40,540
with Oracle over the use of the I think it was like eleven thousand

686
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,540
lines of code or something.

687
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,940
Yeah, it takes back to 2010 when Oracle bought the Java.

688
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,340
What about sun but sun and then Java came along with it.

689
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,540
I looked back at our archives.

690
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,540
This is the story that's been covering for.

691
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740
Oh, yeah.

692
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,140
Remember Oracle claimed that they that Google owed them eight point

693
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,540
eight billion dollars and four hundred seventy five million and lost

694
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,940
potential licensing revenue and then in 2016 a jury found that Google's

695
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,340
use of that structure and sequence and organization of Java APIs was

696
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:17,940
fair use.

697
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,540
But then the Court of Appeals and the Federal Circuit overturned that

698
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,740
decision into Oracle's favor and it just went back and forth.

699
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,740
What felt like forever.

700
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,940
And to be fair, I was initially on Oracle side because Google literally

701
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,340
copy pasted some of the headers and everything.

702
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,740
But not that they couldn't use the API, but they should pay some damages

703
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,540
for literally copy pasta, right?

704
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:37,940
Come on.

705
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,540
Yeah, it was.

706
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,740
And the thing I think that we thought was pretty damning was the emails

707
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,740
from the executives that kind of just said we're going to do this and

708
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,540
we're either going to have to license it or fight them in court one day.

709
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,740
Well, if you remember and I did my research today, I actually did my job

710
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,740
today, Chris, you should pat me on the back.

711
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,540
Thank you just for you.

712
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,540
I rang the bell.

713
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,340
They could have used C sharp for free, but because they hated Microsoft,

714
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,140
they wouldn't do it.

715
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:00,740
Right?

716
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,140
Yeah.

717
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,140
There was the sense back then.

718
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:02,940
I mean, you're right.

719
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,140
Yeah, there was the sense back then, I mean, you remember back then when

720
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,540
they were first starting Android, like the sense was that the whole

721
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,740
world of these devices were going to run on Java.

722
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,140
Well, hang on.

723
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:18,340
If we're going back, there's only one gentleman that can help us.

724
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:18,940
Perfect.

725
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,340
I was thinking Deckard Cain, but you went a different direction.

726
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,740
Oh, oh, you mean you like you want to go?

727
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
You want to share that?

728
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,140
That's that's story time.

729
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,540
Stay a while and listen.

730
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,740
Back in the day, Microsoft was actually a scary company.

731
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,740
But now they're a little hippie company that runs Azure.

732
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,940
But they used to put companies out of business.

733
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,740
Yeah, kids, Microsoft was actually scary at one point.

734
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,140
Yeah.

735
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,340
And I guess there was also this feeling at Google that like Microsoft

736
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,740
was the big bad guy.

737
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,540
The world was going to run all these like I remember Blu-ray players

738
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,740
back then were running Java.

739
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,740
Like everything was going to be Java based.

740
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,940
Everything that Microsoft did was bad.

741
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:01,740
And I think that they figured we'll swoop up a huge amount of developers

742
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,340
who can already target our platform.

743
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,540
That'll get us in the race against Apple as fast as possible.

744
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,140
From India that are cheap, yes.

745
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,740
But yeah, you and I both thought, boy, Oracle could win this,

746
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,540
but it would be bad if they did.

747
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,340
And I actually thought there was a good shot that Oracle was going to win

748
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,340
and I couldn't really comprehend what the knock on effects of that would be.

749
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,140
But so it's on tape, right?

750
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,340
Like I was pretty pissed about this because I felt like just stealing Java.

751
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,140
But they didn't really see the problem was Google was kind of right,

752
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,140
but I didn't like what they were doing because this is going to sound

753
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:38,140
super old-manish, but Objective-C at the time requiring memory management

754
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,940
allowed me just to charge a lot of money that made me very happy.

755
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,740
It seemed like they knew there was some questionable activity to it.

756
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,740
Like they kind of had a sense that maybe they were in a gray area.

757
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,140
Well, in their emails, they knew.

758
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,140
What we have here is kind of like a half decision, though,

759
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,940
because the question is, are APIs copyrightable?

760
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,940
That's been skirted by the court here.

761
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:06,540
They focused on fair use and they didn't really establish the copyright precedent.

762
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,740
It's like the case establishes a precedent that if you're copying an API

763
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,940
and its primary purpose is matching interface so the developers can

764
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,140
reimplement it, you're in fair use territory, which it doesn't really

765
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,540
answer the primary question of the copyright violation.

766
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:26,740
So I have a service that copies the API for AWS S3.

767
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,940
Yeah, I have not talked about this on the show because...

768
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,140
Oh, you mean you really do?

769
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:31,940
I really do.

770
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,140
Oh, OK. That's theoretical.

771
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,140
I've seen Bezos' pecker, let's say.

772
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,740
Thank you, Reddit.

773
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,940
And I'm pretty sure he would slam that right up my bum.

774
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,740
No, you can.

775
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,740
I mean, you can.

776
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,340
You can. I run an object storage.

777
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,340
Right now. Right.

778
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,740
Like, I could have the exact same programmable interface

779
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,540
and my whole thing I do with this is go to people that are spending

780
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,140
a lot of money on S3 so we can set you up in our data center.

781
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:01,540
Literally, you change the API keys, you change the endpoint, the secret key,

782
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:07,740
all that nonsense, and bam, you're saving thousands of dollars a year.

783
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,940
Yeah, and it can also, like in some cases, yeah, you work with a smaller

784
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,540
business that can be more hands-on, that can be more attentive.

785
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,140
Right.

786
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:18,940
And we can offer you added custom benefits, like whatever crazy stuff you need.

787
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,540
So, like, I'm spiritually on the side of Oracle with this,

788
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,540
but I felt like Google was so brazen in how they did it.

789
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,140
I mean, we listened to the back catalog, folks.

790
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,740
I was pretty rough on Google.

791
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,540
And Chris was, I mean, Chris at Microsoft was great,

792
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,140
and we should all run Windows Vista at the time.

793
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,140
So I don't know.

794
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,340
I mean, like, and I did that, like every episode.

795
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:39,940
It was weird.

796
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,540
I just want to say YouTube, Google, I'm sorry, Windows Action Show.

797
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,540
Yeah.

798
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:51,540
Joking aside, I feel like I sort of this is anticlimactic in a way, right?

799
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,740
It doesn't matter.

800
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,740
Nothing happened.

801
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,340
Yeah, I mean, it well, it matters.

802
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,340
I think it matters in that if the had gone, if it had gone the other way,

803
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:08,140
then then it meant that implementing an identical API who would be there

804
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,940
could have said they could have set precedent that that is a copyrightable,

805
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,740
like court case that you could you could pursue.

806
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,140
You're talking about when I was 19, I tried to open Mercury Broadcasting.

807
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,340
Oh, you know what I mean?

808
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,940
Like if if if Oracle had won, it would have set a precedent that other companies

809
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,740
could have sued other individuals who've re implemented their APIs.

810
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,540
Well, hang on.

811
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,140
If Oracle had won, then Minio as a as an open source project would fail.

812
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:39,140
And as a company, Oracle database, which was a clone of IBM database,

813
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,940
right from the interface layer, would itself be invalid because let's

814
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,140
let's Deckard Cain style.

815
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,140
Go back here.

816
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:52,940
Oracle's original business was being a clone of IBM's proprietary databases,

817
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,340
but a little cheaper.

818
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,940
Yeah, I hadn't thought it.

819
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,340
You're right.

820
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,340
I hadn't thought about that in a while.

821
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,540
But I mean, this this is the quarter soon calling the prostitute before.

822
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,540
I mean, this is not right.

823
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:08,340
Yeah, it is kind of you know, but I guess companies change, I suppose.

824
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,740
But there is some irony in that.

825
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,540
It's very simple.

826
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,340
When you're small, you have to work outside the law because

827
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,140
you have nothing to lose when you're big.

828
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,340
Like, by the way, we don't talk about this on this show because unfiltered

829
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:25,540
exists, but Facebook suggesting Internet regulations is like the Nazis

830
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,940
suggesting housing regulations.

831
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,940
It's just not good.

832
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,140
You don't want it.

833
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,540
Yeah, they have lobbyists, so they can that's it.

834
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,140
That's a direct.

835
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,140
That's something they can shape.

836
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,340
When I think about my feelings over the last nearly a decade of this

837
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:44,540
thing, I think a piece of me wanted Google to have to pay some

838
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,540
penance for the stunt they pulled with Android.

839
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,540
I can't ever forgive them for Android.

840
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,540
It is a bastardization of Linux that is horrible.

841
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,140
And they made so many decisions in the name of adoption.

842
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,140
It just doesn't work.

843
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,540
Well, you go back to remember they were going with something that

844
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,540
was cursor driven until they saw the iPhone event and then they

845
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,740
switched to their Moonshot project, which was touch driven.

846
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,140
But Android, when it first shipped, you could still dig out the cursor.

847
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,140
It was very much still very touch focused.

848
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,340
How about Project Butter?

849
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:15,940
Right.

850
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,740
All the time.

851
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,540
All the times they had to address the performance.

852
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,840
They slapped together this system that was horribly unoptimized.

853
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,740
I mean, the early versions of Android were really bad because it

854
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,940
was not native code running on these.

855
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,340
Yeah.

856
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,940
So folks who are younger won't remember these ARM processors on

857
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,040
mobile were back in the day.

858
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,840
They were terrible.

859
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,540
Really bad.

860
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,040
Yeah.

861
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,540
Yeah.

862
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,340
The reason iPhone programming was hard and I got to make lots of

863
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,740
money doing it because you had no memory.

864
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,840
It was terrible.

865
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,440
Loading images in a list view or UI scroll view, if you will, was

866
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,040
actually like you people had different strategies and there were

867
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,540
I'm sure you can find them on Reddit.

868
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,440
There were blog posts debating what is the right way to load images

869
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,740
on iOS because you didn't have the memory to do it.

870
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,240
Come on, you know, this is true.

871
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:04,840
Oh, yeah.

872
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,040
And it was so much worse on Android because and then you'll recall

873
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,340
I don't need to recap history, but the incredible compromises they

874
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,140
made with carriers to to get great sweetheart deals with the carriers

875
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,740
to compete with the iPhone like allowing carriers to bastardize

876
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,040
up the firmware is with their crappy apps and tracking that they

877
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,340
crossed all these lines in the name of adoption that I felt like

878
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,240
created a product that didn't learn anything from the Windows PC

879
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,840
OEM era that makes shipping updates easy and fast and secure and

880
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,840
we ended up with an OS that's now in reality in the pockets of

881
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,440
millions of consumers with out-of-date Linux kernels out-of-date

882
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,840
Bluetooth stacks tons of vulnerabilities vendors who stopped

883
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,840
patching because they didn't have some driver licensing deal that

884
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,340
went beyond two years so they couldn't supply updates past that.

885
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,640
And so now it just gets no fixes and it just sits there open on

886
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,640
the Internet every single day and there are millions of them and

887
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:14,340
then you bring in all of the crap around this that this Oracle suit

888
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,440
which was another example of Google cutting corners to try to get

889
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,740
fast quick adoption to slam something into the market.

890
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,640
So then that way they could get all of these hardware manufacturers

891
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,840
to switch over to their crappy platform and have a horrible fight

892
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,640
race to the bottom LG by the way just announced this week.

893
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,740
They're out of the smartphone business entirely.

894
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,240
That's all Google Ed Google dumped an operating system on the market

895
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,840
that drove the value down that created a race to the bottom that

896
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,240
created manufacturers to make these horrible deals these tour

897
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,640
totally unsupported phones and now the market is a wash in them

898
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,840
and what makes me sick about it is it's all on the back of Linux

899
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,140
Linux is at the core of all of these and it's a bastardization of

900
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,640
what is a beautiful operating system that could deliver a secure

901
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,940
free user experience and instead has been perverted by Google for

902
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,240
this use all while getting their backs patted by the open source

903
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,840
community loving them every step of the way for their open source

904
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,040
stance and their open source support and their summer of code.

905
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,540
And so we never question the almighty Google even though they've

906
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,040
taken the beautiful platform that is Linux and they've weaponized

907
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,540
it as a tracking platform as and now not intentionally an exploit

908
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,240
paradise and it's all on the back of Linux and I hate it.

909
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,540
I turned it into slow the fact that they spent years trying to

910
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,340
perfect a goddamn scroll view.

911
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,240
I'm sorry, but no, I know it seems like a mean mean but that is

912
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,340
a stupid problem.

913
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,640
Yeah, it's just been a bad product and they're there.

914
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,640
You know what they're by the time they finally get a fairly decent

915
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,340
which is I mean, it's not it's pretty it's in a pretty good state

916
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,640
now, you know, I enjoy my pixel but it's still not as good as

917
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,640
iOS, you know, if somebody comes to me with it with a business

918
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,640
ID and they have an Android.

919
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,140
I just ignore you just decide right there.

920
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,340
Oh, they got an Android wear watch.

921
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,640
I won't let them in the door and I'm not even joking.

922
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,140
I've read VC posts.

923
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,740
People say if a founder comes to me as an Android.

924
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,640
Nope, I don't know how I feel about that.

925
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,240
It's about taste and you can look that up.

926
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,840
I feel like they've done a better job with Chrome OS that was

927
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,940
just brought up by the chat room.

928
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,740
I feel like that's been better managed by Google Chrome OS.

929
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,940
You know what the good mobile OS was?

930
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,240
Yeah web OS.

931
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,240
Well, yes web OS but no boys was never going to happen.

932
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
Windows Phone 8.

933
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,140
No, it had a registry dude.

934
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,240
It's out right there.

935
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,840
If it has a registry, it's not on my it's not going in my pocket.

936
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:40,840
This is not happening.

937
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,040
Yeah, but web OS was actually the good one and come on.

938
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:44,740
It was from HP.

939
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:50,140
It was never going to happen for some reason the Google YouTube

940
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,940
YouTube algorithm thingy decided to show me commercials of the

941
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,040
compact I pack from that era.

942
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,840
So the late 90s, I guess in my feet and for whatever reason it

943
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,940
was right and I watched it and man, I had one of those.

944
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,940
I actually really liked it.

945
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,440
If you were in that ecosystem and you had like the exchange

946
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,040
integration.

947
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,740
It was it was pretty cool.

948
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,240
Just want to say I was a Windows 95 power user.

949
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:14,840
Oh, yeah.

950
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,940
Did you actually you know, you got to get the plus pack then

951
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,440
so that way you get the themes and stuff.

952
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,840
Oh, no, I upgraded from 3.1 and then and then you had to get

953
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,340
the Windows 95 like OSR 2 or whatever.

954
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,540
It was where they added USB support.

955
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,440
I couldn't do it.

956
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,240
I was on Windows and I but then I got a gateway.

957
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,040
Oh, yeah.

958
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,140
Cow Box.

959
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:33,640
Yep.

960
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,740
Walk in the Casbah, but then I upgraded to Windows 98.

961
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,440
What's wrong?

962
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,240
Maybe it was great.

963
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:39,940
Didn't work.

964
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,040
It was slow.

965
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:41,840
Oh, yeah.

966
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,240
You definitely felt it back then.

967
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,740
Felt it, especially on low-end systems.

968
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,840
You you and my systems were low.

969
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,340
Yeah, you felt the pain.

970
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,640
Yeah, you really felt it.

971
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,240
Mm hmm.

972
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,140
Yeah, it was one of those things where like we were, you know,

973
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,840
reminds me of the email we got earlier in the show.

974
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,740
It's like you have no idea back then.

975
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,840
I mean, it sold new machines.

976
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,040
People would just buy it back then when a new Windows would

977
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:02,740
come out.

978
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,140
That's when people just buy entirely new PCs with Windows

979
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:05,940
preloaded on it.

980
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:09,340
Then I sort of skipped Vista because I wasn't crazy.

981
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,140
Then I went to seven.

982
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,740
Then I went to Mac and Linux and I'm not going to talk about

983
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,840
the machine I'm on now because people will send me hate mail.

984
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,340
Well, besides, you got to replace that thing.

985
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,140
Anyway, it's got those dirty x86 processors in it, right?

986
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,140
I've done some benchmarks on my MacBook Air.

987
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,340
It's not great.

988
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,040
Yeah.

989
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:25,940
Oh, yeah.

990
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:26,640
Oh, good.

991
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,340
Let's do a little anti-m1 for a moment.

992
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,140
So the iMac Pro crushed it, huh?

993
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,740
No, no, no.

994
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,440
Oh, no, that's not what happened.

995
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,340
Oh, damn it.

996
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,840
It's the iMac Pro has beautiful screen.

997
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,540
Uh-huh.

998
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,240
Yeah.

999
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,540
But did it beat it on the CPU test?

1000
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,940
Tell me it beat the M1.

1001
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,440
It's my special little computer and I love it.

1002
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,540
I love it very much.

1003
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:48,440
You're not answering the question, which I think means that it didn't.

1004
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,140
Oh, I didn't need to hear that.

1005
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,640
Unless the GPU becomes involved.

1006
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,640
Ah, yeah, sure.

1007
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,740
The air is faster.

1008
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,340
Pour one out for the x86.

1009
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,540
Honestly, if I was Intel CEO right now, I would not be making snarky

1010
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,640
commercials with Justin Long.

1011
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,440
I would be at the bar crying.

1012
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,340
That might be my character flaw.

1013
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:16,240
Maybe you can do both, you know, but he is the CEO of Intel.

1014
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,140
You can probably do both.

1015
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,540
But do you need Justin Long?

1016
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,840
I mean, no, no, it does.

1017
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,840
It's bad too, right?

1018
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,240
Because the funny thing is, is like you're so he's essentially getting

1019
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,340
on products that still are shipping with Intel processors in them.

1020
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,440
Like they still I mean the whole thing's like they're making funny.

1021
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,540
They're making fun of MacBooks, but they're still MacBooks selling

1022
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,540
with Intel processors.

1023
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,340
It was an awkward moment.

1024
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,540
Like I just want to say making an advertising campaign campaign dunking

1025
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:44,140
on one of your biggest customers seems super stupid to me.

1026
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,540
I don't know.

1027
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,540
Yeah, yeah.

1028
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:47,440
What do we know?

1029
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,740
Linode.com slash coder.

1030
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,740
Receive a $100 safety day credit towards your new account.

1031
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,740
Yeah, a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars and you support the show.

1032
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:59,840
Linode is awesome.

1033
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,140
It's powerful and you can simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode's

1034
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,440
great prices and modern Linux virtual machines and tools to develop,

1035
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,740
deploy and scale applications faster and easier than ever.

1036
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,140
And what I love about Linode is they are independent.

1037
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:17,740
They've been around since 2003 and they are in full control.

1038
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,240
They set their own ISP up.

1039
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,340
They run their data centers.

1040
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,940
They have 11 of them around the world.

1041
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,740
Super fast connections, super fast native SSDs and of course 40 gigabit

1042
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,840
connections coming into each one of those machines.

1043
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,540
Linode can really help your ideas come to life on the web too.

1044
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,740
If you want to set up a personal portfolio, maybe you want to put

1045
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,940
a resume online that looks nice or a status pager.

1046
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:40,040
Maybe you want to host the backend infrastructure for your community's

1047
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,240
chat platform or something even else that, heck, I don't really know

1048
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,740
because I'm not you, but I know Linode can do it.

1049
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:50,440
They have a full range of systems, dedicated CPUs, dedicated GPUs,

1050
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,140
$5 a month systems.

1051
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:56,540
They're great and they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the big shops like

1052
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,240
Azure or that AWS you may have heard of.

1053
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,340
And they have features similar like S3 compatible object storage,

1054
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,440
cloud firewalls, simple one-click application deployment and a lot more.

1055
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,440
So you should probably just go check it out for yourself and see why

1056
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,840
they are our cloud hosting provider of choice.

1057
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,840
Everything we've built and all of the things we have continued to build,

1058
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,040
it's just really gotten pretty awesome.

1059
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,240
I should do a machine count at some point.

1060
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,040
We run it all on Linode and you can too, linode.com slash coder.

1061
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,040
I found them a few years ago, started as just something I was doing

1062
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,940
on my own as a personal thing and now I use them for everything.

1063
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,440
And you can too and you can support the show while getting that $100 credit

1064
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,240
at linode.com slash coder.

1065
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,640
Are you going over to the WWDC website right now to make your plans

1066
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,440
because it's been announced.

1067
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,040
We now know it's going to be virtual again this year.

1068
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,040
They are leaning in hard on the Craig Federighi staring at his laptop

1069
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,040
in a weird way and they've announced it'll be June 7th to the 11th

1070
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,440
for the all online program open to everybody free at no cost.

1071
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,340
And even if you're not a Apple developer or even interested in any

1072
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,440
particular thing from Apple, it's kind of fascinating to watch this

1073
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,340
from a production standpoint because boy howdy if these aren't just

1074
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:19,040
the peak of virtual conference production like nobody does it like

1075
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:19,740
these guys do.

1076
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,940
They also this year are doing a Swift student challenge and they're

1077
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,240
going to have additional details on that.

1078
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:30,440
So teaching the young ones the Swift it's a big focus at WWDC got to

1079
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,540
get the young ones learned up.

1080
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,540
I guess if you hate children, that might be a thing you would do.

1081
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:40,540
No, but I mean, I obviously would love someone to look at me like

1082
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,440
Craig Federighi looks at the MacBook Air.

1083
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,040
I mean, who doesn't want that?

1084
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,840
And yes, I'm going to WWDC and no, I don't think there's going to be

1085
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,440
AR glasses because battery life.

1086
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,840
This is the shit about the Apple community.

1087
00:50:54,840 --> 00:51:02,740
That is so annoying the incessant yammering on about like VR goggles

1088
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:07,240
or AR or will Apple build a car like get over yourselves like who

1089
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,240
just wait and see what they ship like this is the like the community.

1090
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,040
There's so much Palace intrigue type stories and rumor mill and

1091
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,640
they have a giant processor transition they're doing.

1092
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,340
Yeah, they are not shipping.

1093
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:25,040
And first of all, the glasses have a particular problem of the boundaries

1094
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,540
of physics with battery life.

1095
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:31,540
Now, unless they have some amazing battery technology, which honestly,

1096
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:35,240
if they have it, they should license it to everybody because that

1097
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,240
would change humanity.

1098
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,640
Really?

1099
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,140
Yeah, let's share it share with the world, right?

1100
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:40,840
Seriously.

1101
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,240
No, I'm not being addicted to get such battery capacity in such a

1102
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:49,240
small package would be a significant leap in like actual battery

1103
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,240
physics, right?

1104
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,840
Actual like the science of storing energy that would be different.

1105
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:58,540
Like they would be dunking on Elon Musk like he was the, you know,

1106
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,140
junior University basketball team in their shack.

1107
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,640
But if we return to reality, they don't have that.

1108
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,040
There's not going to be air glasses.

1109
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,840
So it's so annoying.

1110
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,640
If you think if this isn't just the way they shouldn't just do this

1111
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,440
because I'll tell you what, man, you get a lot more information

1112
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,340
this way because you don't have to pay a thousand dollars to go.

1113
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,340
It makes a way more accessible to people that are considering getting

1114
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,040
in development.

1115
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,840
It makes a way more accessible to children specifically who could

1116
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,240
never get access to this stuff because they sometimes, you know,

1117
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,040
they're not old enough to have credit cards and whatnot.

1118
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:36,340
I think like there is a big net benefit to make this open to all

1119
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:42,540
and instead of this like this like exclusive only like 2,000 people

1120
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:46,240
to 4,000 people can make it there and it's a thousand dollar ticket

1121
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,440
and the price is only going to go up because there's less and less

1122
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,240
space available.

1123
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,340
I appreciate the value of those in-person events.

1124
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:56,440
You know me, I really understand the value, but this seems like

1125
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,240
a net improvement for everyone because even a casual like me can

1126
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,340
attend these and I can feel more informed and I like to have the

1127
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:05,540
technical details of things.

1128
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,740
I am conflicted as a dev.

1129
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:13,740
I feel like the online format is better, but as a sales guy or like

1130
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,040
a business owner, I guess which is really a glorified sales guy,

1131
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:17,340
right?

1132
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:21,640
There's something about the conference like pub scene, you know,

1133
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,340
the hall track, right?

1134
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:28,040
Having said that, WWDC, I mean, I don't want to be too negative.

1135
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,140
If there's a good API that I think I could build a cool app on,

1136
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:31,840
I'm going to do it.

1137
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:32,840
Absolutely.

1138
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,240
Right, look, and I'm going to watch this whole thing and I'm going

1139
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,540
to be on the hunt for something like that.

1140
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:41,240
But my entire problem, like I'm a, you know, you know, this Chris,

1141
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,540
I'm a huge iPad believer, but the problems are Apple's policies,

1142
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,540
not the technology.

1143
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,240
I mean, I don't want to say I'm not going to build something on

1144
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,040
iOS because obviously, you know me, I get excited and I do something

1145
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,740
and then I don't ship it because I'm crazy.

1146
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,540
Coderbytes is not coming because of trademark reasons, by the way.

1147
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,040
So it will be something else.

1148
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,940
Oh, man, we'll get another.

1149
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,840
I'm sure there'll be another name out there that'll work.

1150
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,240
It's going to be a coder balls.

1151
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,140
Inappropriate past.

1152
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,140
Mike was wise, you know, past Mike was much calmer.

1153
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:15,640
No, but I mean, are you excited for WWC?

1154
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,940
I mean, I kind of don't give a crap.

1155
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:17,840
No, I actually am.

1156
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:18,640
I am.

1157
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,640
This is home pods.

1158
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,440
It's the cumulative radiation from all those home pods.

1159
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,640
Okay, no, it's not the home pods, but I think they I think they're

1160
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,140
delivering.

1161
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,940
I think the iOS platform is looking better than ever.

1162
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,740
I find it fascinating.

1163
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:36,740
The last couple of WWDCs, we've seen them allow some major changes to

1164
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,140
iOS we hadn't seen in the past.

1165
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,040
I think the M1 platform is going to get iterated on.

1166
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,940
That'll be interesting.

1167
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,540
And then I think they'll probably send me into some sort of existential

1168
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:48,840
crisis and panic when I worry that Linux users will leave us all.

1169
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,440
But, you know, I've calmed down.

1170
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,040
I've calmed down.

1171
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,240
I think I think there is a good a good portion of Linux users out there

1172
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,240
who will never be swayed by the shinies of Apple, regardless of what they do.

1173
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,940
And I have good news for those of us on the platform.

1174
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:05,440
Mike, this has been sorely needed.

1175
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:11,440
A library that essentially plays a role in just defining the visual language

1176
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,640
of a GNOME application.

1177
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,540
You want to make a GNOME application.

1178
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:18,640
You can use Lib Adwaitia to now do that.

1179
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,140
Sort of like elementary OS's Granite.

1180
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,040
This is going to be something that's available to all GTK developers.

1181
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,740
It'll track specific releases with GNOME.

1182
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,240
So you can target like a GNOME 40 look or a GNOME 42 look.

1183
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,840
And they'll include guidelines as well as code and the idea will be a

1184
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,540
library that kind of grows over time that gives developers an ability to

1185
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:43,840
get some of the basics of a standard GNOME application without having

1186
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,840
to lay out every single button themselves and decide where it all goes.

1187
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,140
It's like the missing library that the desktop environment needed to

1188
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,140
get application developers started quicker.

1189
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,240
Yeah, here I come.

1190
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,140
I bring my nice little thing and I say, look, Daddy, they finally did it.

1191
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,240
They fixed a complaint of yours and you give me nothing.

1192
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,640
You smack it out of my hand and you just tell me to piss off.

1193
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,440
Well, let me ask you, how many users are going to pay for that software

1194
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,540
you built with that library?

1195
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,940
Oh, well, OK.

1196
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,240
I mean, there's, you know.

1197
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:13,740
Yeah.

1198
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:14,440
OK, all right.

1199
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,840
I admit I acknowledge the payment thing's a little tricky, but I grant you.

1200
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,640
Tricky? It's tricky.

1201
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,440
I would call it the battle.

1202
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,040
What battle?

1203
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,240
Hang on. The sixth day? No, hang on.

1204
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,840
But what was the complete route?

1205
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,040
Oh, the Alamo.

1206
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,640
Yeah, actually, the Alamo, they held up for a while.

1207
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,140
Hang on.

1208
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,540
Well, a lot of apps do and then they finally fall.

1209
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:37,440
That does happen.

1210
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,440
Oh, it's France and World War Two.

1211
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,440
Write down.

1212
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,640
Sorry, French people.

1213
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,240
I'm not sorry.

1214
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,140
My stepfather's French.

1215
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:43,540
So.

1216
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,640
Oh, Mike of the past.

1217
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,240
So that was a lot of fun.

1218
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,840
I listened to that whole episode with you and was making a few notes of a couple

1219
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,840
of things I want to follow up on.

1220
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:03,240
But if anything crossed your mind, go to coder.show contact and send it in.

1221
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,440
What should we follow up on?

1222
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,240
Let us know.

1223
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,240
Also, I want to thank our members.

1224
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,240
Coder QA dot co.

1225
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,840
If you want to become a member, a new Coderly is nigh.

1226
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,040
You support the show, you get a limited ad feed.

1227
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,440
It's just a great way to know that you're helping keep the show independent.

1228
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,240
I say, you know, if you got something you enjoy listening to, it's nice knowing

1229
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,240
that you're helping keep it that way.

1230
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,440
You can also support the entire network and get access to the features for all

1231
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,640
of the network shows at Jupiter Party.

1232
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:33,040
And also a big thank you to everybody who sends the show a boost.

1233
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,040
We didn't get a chance to read them this week or at least read them on air.

1234
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,440
But we do actually read them every single time you send them in.

1235
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,640
If you'd like to send us a boost and see how much fun it is, get a new podcast

1236
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,940
app at new podcast apps dot com and then send us a boost.

1237
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,940
If you don't have any stats yet, something like strike.

1238
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,640
It's a great way to do that.

1239
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:51,840
You can find Mike on Twitter.

1240
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,940
He's at Dumanuco and his company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

1241
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,140
You can follow me over there.

1242
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,640
Yeah, I'm over there.

1243
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,240
I mostly just reply.

1244
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,440
I don't really tweet much.

1245
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,240
Maybe that's a good thing.

1246
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,040
Maybe it's not.

1247
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,740
I don't seem to get rewarded by the Twitter algorithm for it, though.

1248
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,840
At Chris Elias, though, if you want to engage in that shenanigans, this year

1249
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:12,640
podcast at Coder Radio Show and the network is at Jupiter Signal and the

1250
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,840
links to what we talked about today.

1251
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,840
That's going to be over at Coder dot show slash four six zero.

1252
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,040
Don't forget, Talescale is on board now at the Coder Radio program.

1253
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,440
Go get yourself a super secure mesh network.

1254
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,840
That's a Talescale dot com slash Coder.

1255
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,040
And of course, a big thank you to Linode for their continued support.

1256
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,940
