00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
This is KOTORadio, episode 419 for June 23rd, 2021.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,680
Hey good looking, welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,480
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,480
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

5

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,920
My name is Chris, and battling technical issues so he can podcast, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
Hello Mike.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Hello.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,040
Man, what a week, right?

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,800
Like I'm losing my voice.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
You're fighting tech demons.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Oh yeah.

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,880
It's not even the half of it.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,560
It's just the last 15 minutes.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,720
This was like crazy.

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,000
The M1 failed me.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,400
So what started out as just a quick journey to install a program to capture audio from

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,680
an audio device turned into you like booting into recovery environments?

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
What happened?

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,920
Well, first of all, I guess we have to do a little inside baseball for Mac here.

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:24,320
After that, Piezo made by Rogameba, that was a tongue twister, requires a kernel extension

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,920
to directly record audio because many, many things in Mac OS require kernel extensions

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,020
that you might not think should.

30
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:40,360
So that used to be just a matter of going into security preferences and enabling it.

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,660
Now you have to reboot into a recovery mode, enable it there.

32
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,760
It took a total of four reboots to get this working and it blew away my desktop settings

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,720
of all my files organized and my background.

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
No.

35
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
Yep.

36
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,720
God knows what's going to happen after the show when I decide to try to use any of the

37
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,280
Linuxy, Unixy stuff in homebrew.

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,160
You think it just reset the PRAM or whatever the hell they call it?

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,600
It reset something.

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Wow.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,800
That sucks.

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, imagine a typical user who maybe doesn't even know what a kernel extension is, is trying

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,200
to install this software and gets a prompt, hey, you got to reboot and go into a recovery

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,760
environment.

45
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,320
And then when you booted back up, it was blocked initially.

46
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,320
It was blocked.

47
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
Yeah.

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,840
So, and it kept having to reboot to unblock it.

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
It's just too much protection.

50
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,640
They're turning it into an iPhone.

51
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
Ooh, that's a bold statement.

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
I think they are.

53
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,720
Well, you know, Phil Schiller did say on the stand in the Epic trial that they consider

54
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,360
the openness and I think security vulnerabilities on Mac OS to be unacceptable.

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,640
Sounds like they're right on their way of solving it and working out Rogue Amoeba, which

56
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,440
Rogue Amoeba is one of the best software creators on the desktop for any platform.

57
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,120
I mean, they just make incredible software in the audio realm.

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,280
I respect that a lot.

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,160
And if I were ever going to have a Mac, I would have the Rogue Amoeba apps on there.

60
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
They'd have to work.

61
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,080
I'd have to go through all of that, I guess.

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,560
What a pain in the neck.

63
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Wait a minute.

64
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,480
Now my desktop background is just, hold on, real time update.

65
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,000
It's just the color blue.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,360
Yet on the other workspace, it's the default, whatever, for whatever version of Mac, I think

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,160
I'm on Mojave or something.

68
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,780
Doesn't really generally manifest itself.

69
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,880
But my previous experience with Mac OS when I was doing Hackintosh is it felt like a bit

70
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,680
of a house of cards and you pull out one thing and a surprising amount of things just quit

71
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,680
working.

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Yeah.

73
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,440
And you're in a very specific, very defined environment and situation.

74
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,960
Something's super not right here.

75
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,280
Oh well, we can move on.

76
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,840
You're going to have fun after the show.

77
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,140
Yeah, this is wrong.

78
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,960
Unrelated to this, you also picked yourself up a new Thaleo.

79
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,760
I'm extremely jealous because I've been wanting one so bad, but I just can't get over the

80
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
GPU prices right now.

81
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
Yeah, the GPU prices are nuts.

82
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,240
I didn't go super hard on the GPU.

83
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
But yeah, I don't have it yet though.

84
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,320
I guess production's taking a bit longer than I thought it would.

85
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,360
So I will let you know once I have it.

86
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,880
You're a unique individual in that I can ask, on average, when you buy a Thaleo, Mike, how

87
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,720
often does it take to ship?

88
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,880
Because I've never bought one and you've bought several.

89
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,080
Well, that's true because I do those contests, it's always a Thaleo as a prize.

90
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,720
Usually a couple of business days.

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,320
Whoa, that's way faster than I expected.

92
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,640
Yeah, I think it depends on what configs.

93
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,920
I noticed that the lower end ones tend to ship faster.

94
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Oh, sure.

95
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,560
Maybe they have the parts in stock already and stuff.

96
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Well, maybe.

97
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,520
I also wonder if they don't like pre-configure a bunch of those because probably they're

98
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
high seller.

99
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,160
Yeah, and they're not a huge cost.

100
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,840
Because I did go up to the 12 gig NVIDIA GPU in this one.

101
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,080
I think when the GPU prices come back down, I'm going to be really tempted.

102
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
We'll see.

103
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,640
Yeah, well, I'll do my decibel readings on it.

104
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,520
So that's how I am about the background noise.

105
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,040
Yeah, I'll be really interested to know how that is, how that stacks up now.

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,720
Well, I'm going to be out at System76 in August.

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
I'm looking forward to that.

108
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,400
I'm heading out to Denver and also Salt Lake City.

109
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,920
We're going to do meetups at both locations, August 7th in Salt Lake City and August 20th

110
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
in Denver.

111
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,880
We'll have all the details at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

112
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,440
And if you're interested in going to a Denver meetup or a Salt Lake City meetup, please

113
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,600
do.

114
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,240
And our friends at Linode are on board with this trip, and not only are they making the

115
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,000
trip possible, but they're going to help us produce some exclusive content during the

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,240
road trip that will feature team interviews, the people we go and see.

117
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,420
I'm hoping to get a little bit of the inside story on the creation of the launch keyboard

118
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,240
while we're there, and we'll have an episode on that as well.

119
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,560
And I'll do a few coders live from the road.

120
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,560
So if you're a Coder Radio audience member in those areas, or if you can make it there,

121
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
come see us.

122
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,320
Again, August 7th, Salt Lake City, August 20th in Denver, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

123
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,840
I'm really looking forward to it.

124
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,560
It's been a long time.

125
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,800
And the last event I went to really stunk.

126
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,680
It was like almost two years ago, and I regretted going to it while I was there.

127
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,080
It gave me just this horrible, horrible feeling about the future of cybersecurity.

128
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,560
And then that was it.

129
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,200
Then it was lockdown time.

130
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,320
So yeah, it's going to be great to see people.

131
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,640
And I'm getting the RV ready right now, which is not in great shape because my slides broken

132
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
and all that.

133
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,940
But working on that at the moment to try to get it ready, and then we're going to load

134
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,680
up and we're going to do a meetup in Denver.

135
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,960
Of course, Mr. Dominic, you are welcome as well.

136
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Everybody's welcome.

137
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Everybody.

138
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I know not everybody can because everybody's got jobs and stuff they got to do, but we're

139
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,440
opening it up to everybody who might be able to make it out.

140
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
You know what?

141
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
You know, I love System76.

142
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,200
The problem is if I show up in Denver, do I have to bring an extra carry on for another

143
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,320
staleo, a few launch keyboards under my shirt?

144
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Yeah.

145
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Yeah, I know.

146
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,160
That's why I think some of us are going to drive so we can just load up our trunks, you

147
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
know.

148
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
I'm from Florida.

149
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,000
I just can't even imagine how far that is.

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,200
Yeah, I know, right?

151
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Hey, guess what I have right here?

152
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
I have a box.

153
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
What's in the box?

154
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Let's see.

155
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Stand by, sir.

156
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,960
I'm going to open it up right now here on the show.

157
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
It is.

158
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
It's a big box, too.

159
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
It's heavy.

160
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,120
It's a big box filled with the Coder Robes.

161
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,080
I got a whole batch of them right here.

162
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Yep.

163
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
Oh, yeah.

164
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
I got mine yesterday.

165
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Oh, did you?

166
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Yes.

167
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Yes, I did.

168
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
I took it.

169
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
I put a picture on Twitter.

170
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
I didn't see it.

171
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
I failed in my stocking.

172
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Oh, yeah.

173
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.

174
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,680
Turned out great.

175
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Turned out great.

176
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
Oh, look at that.

177
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
I got a whole batch of them here.

178
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
One's for Wes.

179
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Going to give him a Coder.

180
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,880
So when you saw people were sending in their Coder Rope pictures.

181
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Yeah.

182
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Yeah, that's great.

183
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
Yeah.

184
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
People should keep doing that.

185
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
They're not all done yet.

186
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,680
So if you haven't got your Coder yet, there is probably going to be another several week

187
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
delay.

188
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
I apologize.

189
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,360
But then the next batch and probably the final batch will ship.

190
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,640
And it really is just down to supplies.

191
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,280
We've had a lot of people ask us to do another run.

192
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,880
I will consider it when the whole global supply shortage is over.

193
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,360
You didn't have fun?

194
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Oh, my gosh.

195
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,600
And the threat on this is particular, too.

196
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,320
So it just took them forever.

197
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,840
And so maybe in the fall.

198
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
I don't know.

199
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,400
But boy, did it turn out, huh?

200
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
It's great.

201
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Woo-Wee.

202
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
It really is.

203
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
C-C-C-Coder.

204
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Yep.

205
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,640
One size fits all, Tali with pockets.

206
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Classic.

207
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
You can wear it.

208
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
It's an all day wear.

209
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
It's the Coder.

210
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
I'm really happy with that.

211
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,680
I'm very, very pleased.

212
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
It was nice.

213
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
It was nice to see that go out.

214
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
God damn it.

215
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,880
It blew away my Xcode tool chain, too.

216
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,680
No way, man.

217
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
How can this happen?

218
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,520
All the command line tools are gone.

219
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
It reset my terminal.

220
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
What did it revert?

221
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,600
Did it revert to some image?

222
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,160
I think it reverted all the utility stuff to base settings.

223
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,840
Yeah, I typed git and it's literally trying to install git.

224
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,760
It's telling me to run Xcode select.

225
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,080
It sounds like it reverted back to, because you know, the system partition stuff's read

226
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
only.

227
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,240
Sounds like it reverted back or something.

228
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,440
So it just wiped out everything but user land?

229
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,160
Yeah, sounds like it, doesn't it?

230
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Yeah, obviously.

231
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
That explains the settings being weird, too.

232
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Wow.

233
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,000
I deleted the directory under photos, under pictures with all my custom backgrounds.

234
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,200
What the hell?

235
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,520
And it's the same user account, right?

236
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,560
Yeah, I only have one user account on this machine.

237
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,280
You know what's not crazy and unreliable, though?

238
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
What's that?

239
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
The coder.

240
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Yeah, that's true.

241
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,680
And finally, it's just slow.

242
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
Just real slow.

243
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
It's just slow.

244
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,880
But a lot of people wrote in and said that the material is higher quality than they expected

245
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
and it was worth the wait.

246
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
And that's what I wanted to hear.

247
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,600
Rick wants your reaction, maybe my reaction, too, to this.

248
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,520
He writes in, he says, guys, Sir Tim Berners-Lee is launching an NFT for the original Objective-C

249
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,120
source code he used to create the World Wide Web.

250
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,400
I'd love to know your thoughts on this.

251
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,520
What do you think?

252
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,120
It's Objective-C. I love it.

253
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,880
Honestly, if you had the money, would you buy it?

254
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Absolutely.

255
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Yeah, I think so.

256
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Yeah.

257
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
I also hate this, by the way.

258
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
I do hate this.

259
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
I hate this deeply.

260
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
I hate it.

261
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
I hate it.

262
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
I hate it.

263
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
Yeah.

264
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,720
But that said, like if Linus Torvalds wanted to make an NFT out of his original Linux commit

265
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
or something.

266
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,880
How about an NFT of him throwing in video with a finger?

267
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Yeah.

268
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
I don't know.

269
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,580
I think these, I'd actually just rather have a printed version with him with his signature

270
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,840
on it than an NFT though.

271
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,200
Knowing you would have to be on like a nice canvas made only of the finest.

272
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Right.

273
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,360
That'd be great with a sapphire glass frame.

274
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,200
Jeez, man.

275
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,240
I just don't like where this is going.

276
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Where does it end?

277
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
I wonder.

278
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,000
And it's not like it's the only copy.

279
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,440
I hear people that try to make the art analogy, but I have a hard time with it.

280
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,140
And I'm not really Mr. Anti-Crypto coin and stuff.

281
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,840
I think Bitcoin gets a bad rap.

282
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,440
I think people that give Bitcoin a hard time for its environmental impact haven't done

283
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,120
any research and don't know what they're talking about.

284
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,360
And they couldn't tell you the environmental impact of everybody switching to electric

285
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,920
cars and charging Teslas in their homes.

286
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,760
And if that takes any more power than a Bitcoin, nobody knows.

287
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,360
And so I think Bitcoin gets a hard rap.

288
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,320
I'm not anti any of this kind of stuff.

289
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,520
I think it's worth exploring.

290
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,520
But something about this NFT stuff where you're selling something that you can make

291
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:31,320
endless copies of doesn't feel like legitimate and fair to the purchaser.

292
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,840
It's weird because you just described like the people who say they shouldn't have to

293
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
pay for software.

294
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
Right.

295
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,160
Well, you just made their argument.

296
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
It's true.

297
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,480
Well, a topic that Jimmy wanted to write in on is touching on our Linux dying as a desktop

298
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
OS conversation.

299
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,880
He says, my dearest sexy coder host, as someone who's run Linux since the late 90s, this has

300
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,940
been something on my mind for the last five years or so.

301
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,880
It seems to me, even as much as Linux has caught up to the other big OSes in terms of

302
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,480
functionality and applications, we're now back in the same place we were about 20 years

303
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
ago.

304
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,120
By this, I mean the mobile and their general ecosystems, even with really cool projects

305
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,600
like KDE Connect and where KDE and GNOME are taking their desktops, we're still over a

306
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,060
decade behind.

307
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,260
We're not even playing the same game, let alone the ballpark.

308
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,920
When you're in your 30s with kids, with things in your house like tablets, TVs and cars and

309
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,360
lady tubes all connected and syncing, not even to mention an ever-growing connected

310
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,020
outside world, well, Linux can sometimes feel like a bit of a hindrance, something that

311
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,800
needs to be tweaked constantly to get some of the basic features I've mentioned even

312
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,340
half working.

313
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,120
Not only is that annoying, but then when you're busy and you just want things to work, it's

314
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,280
going to be more of an issue.

315
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,880
We also have the problem that more and more of us, as time goes on, will start to use

316
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,320
our phones for payments, door access and even ID cards.

317
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
Linux is out on all of that.

318
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,720
Take that along with Windows now getting better for developers than ever, Apple doing their

319
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,280
thing and automation with servers in the cloud, serverless and containerization.

320
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,640
It's hard to see how Linux is going to stay relevant for most people going into the future.

321
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,760
Only a niche few who are working on the core technology behind the scenes and being paid

322
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,880
by large corporations, assuming fuchsia doesn't get too popular.

323
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,200
It makes me sad to think about this, but another way to look at it is look how far this little

324
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,380
free and open source community and project actually went.

325
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,680
From a small nerdy project, often mocked for being only for hobbyists, to powering the

326
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,160
entire internet and complete infrastructure of every large service billions of people

327
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
rely on day-to-day.

328
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,920
Hell, even Windows has it baked in now.

329
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,160
Who would have imagined that in 2008 while tweaking their compass settings on Ubuntu

330
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,520
Hardy Heron?

331
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,800
Linux beat all others and ultimately won.

332
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,480
So if the day comes in the next decade where I have to pour one out for my homie tux, I'll

333
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,120
do it with a smile, fond and proud memories.

334
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,840
I don't think you're ever going to be pouring one out for your homie tux though.

335
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
I agree.

336
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,760
I mean, you still have people that are listening to records.

337
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,720
Like, I'm just saying some stuff never dies, but this is going to have, it's going to still,

338
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,240
it will, I think probably for as long as you and I draw breath, there will be Linux servers.

339
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,200
And as long as there are large amounts of Linux servers, won't there always be devs

340
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,840
and sysadmins who want to use what they're running on the server on their desktop for

341
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,440
what they're maybe building for the server?

342
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,600
Yeah, I would go even further.

343
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,080
I think it's going to be as long as you and I draw breath and our grandkids draw breath.

344
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,260
Yeah, it's one of those entrenched forever kind of technologies.

345
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,280
And because of the licensing, they can just perpetually keep it going.

346
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,680
So it's going to be one of those things that just keeps on going.

347
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,280
Like, you know, they stretch out commercial operating systems, you ain't seen nothing

348
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
yet.

349
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,920
They just keep rolling, baby.

350
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,660
And talk about this often because it often is perceived as an elitist attitude.

351
00:14:52,660 --> 00:15:01,120
But I actually don't even agree with the premise that if only nerds like developers and sysadmins

352
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,160
and geeks use Linux, I don't buy the premise that's a bad thing.

353
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,840
I think the operating system is particularly good at catering to those particular niches.

354
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:17,120
And why not build a system that just super delivers to that user base while the commercial

355
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,240
platforms focus on the mythical new user constantly?

356
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,280
I think it's actually a very reasonable place for desktop Linux to land.

357
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,900
And that doesn't mean that it needs to have some cloud syncing service.

358
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,960
It just means that it needs to work with whatever solution I, as a geek, build for myself.

359
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,600
Yeah, I would even take it a step further that the mythical new user is probably going

360
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,080
to increasingly be a tablet or more likely phone user.

361
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
Yeah, or maybe Chromebook.

362
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,080
But yeah.

363
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
Yeah.

364
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,200
And I know it's been an education, but then, you know, I've never been on the Chromebook

365
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
train.

366
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Yep.

367
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Yep.

368
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
All right.

369
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Yeah.

370
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
All right.

371
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
So one more on this topic, then we'll move on.

372
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Tim writes in with a bulletproof Linux recipe.

373
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,040
I use an Intel NUC as my desktop and a Dell XPS as my laptop running for door.

374
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,920
They both have integrated Intel graphics and nothing weird in them.

375
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,880
And you know they're always going to work.

376
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,720
For gaming, I have an Xbox.

377
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,640
For my wife, who isn't really into computers, she uses an iPad.

378
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:18,520
I used to be really big into Windows and PC gaming, but honestly, Windows 10 wore me down.

379
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,800
Operating systems that make decisions for me on my behalf, that's just a little bit

380
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
too much for me.

381
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,360
And I'm never going to go back.

382
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,720
Say what you will, but staying on the rails and just not doing anything out of the ordinary

383
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,360
is all it really takes to use desktop Linux.

384
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,240
Upgrade only when you have time and maintain an Ansible playbook to make it easy.

385
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,800
I love that.

386
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Just all you got to do.

387
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Just learn Ansible.

388
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,840
I said, but that's how you do survive and you won't be tempted to use an operating system

389
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,440
that needs an internet connection to search for a list of locally installed applications.

390
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,920
I kind of agree with Tim to a degree, though.

391
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:59,000
If your workload allows and you kind of just use Linux on rails, like a System76 system

392
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,860
or like my ThinkPad X1 Carbon that came with Fedora or the Dell XPS developer line, they

393
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,520
are going to work every time you load Linux on that thing.

394
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,560
And they work really, really reliably.

395
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,400
But that is a large user base and it's a very viable customer base.

396
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,840
But it also doesn't work for folks that maybe need to do machine learning and they have

397
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,760
to push their video driver forward and their kernel driver forward or people that are doing

398
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
media production.

399
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,440
It also doesn't work for people that are doing development that targets upcoming Linux platforms

400
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,040
like maybe the next version of RHEL.

401
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,160
They can't really ride those rails.

402
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,880
So there are use cases where you need to use Linux, but you can't necessarily use it on

403
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,400
rails like Tim suggests.

404
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,000
But he makes a good point, I thought.

405
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,360
Are you suggesting the Mac-ification of Linux?

406
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
In a way it is, right?

407
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,480
I think the developer line, the XPS developer line feels the most like that, in my opinion.

408
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,560
Well, and then some of the stuff you mentioned, System76, that's kind of their whole pitch,

409
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
right?

410
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,800
They made a big push, at least last year.

411
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,320
Yeah, and I think with Pop in a way, they're kind of building that, but more oriented at

412
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,320
power users.

413
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,960
Because Pop doesn't feel like they're watering it down.

414
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,800
They're doing tiling window manager and keyboard combinations.

415
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Right.

416
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,280
With Pop, they assume you know what you're doing.

417
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:15,600
With the current Mac OS, they break your machine when you try to record audio.

418
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,120
Lino.com slash coder.

419
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,500
Go there to get $100 in credit on your new account, and of course you support the show.

420
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,240
It tells Linode, hey, thanks for making the Coder Radio program possible.

421
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,880
Linode is the largest independent cloud computing provider.

422
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,080
No matter what skill level you're at or what technology stack you prefer to use, they're

423
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,220
going to help your ideas come to life on the web.

424
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,040
And their boxes are screaming fast.

425
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,480
A lot of times when people are trying them out for the first time and they send me feedback,

426
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,900
that's number one.

427
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,720
It's faster than I expected.

428
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,740
Linode really knows what they're doing.

429
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,840
They've built out a network of 11 data centers.

430
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,880
They are their own ISP.

431
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,040
They've done super fast native SSDs for each hypervisor, 40 gigabit connections coming

432
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,540
into the machines, and then they wrap it all up with a beautiful, simple dashboard that

433
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,040
doesn't get in your way, but lets you get access to the power features where it makes

434
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
sense.

435
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,860
I mean, you can even do your own custom images on Linode.

436
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,020
So if you've got a stack that you want to build and then just deploy that image, they're

437
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,280
going to accommodate that.

438
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,200
They have S3 compatible object storage.

439
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,380
And I point this out because you can do really economical front end Linodes that are using

440
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,360
the S3 object storage as their back end file storage, and you don't have to sit there and

441
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,880
worry about allocating the right storage to that Linode.

442
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,600
It all just works.

443
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,300
And then, of course, anything that's S3 compatible, you can use there.

444
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,680
That includes even just mounting file systems.

445
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,080
Linode also features things like cloud firewalls so you can protect your machines at the network

446
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,960
level and prevent that traffic from banging on your door.

447
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,840
And then when you just want to get started quick, Linode has those one click application

448
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
deployments.

449
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,200
I did that recently just for a quick Docker stack as a way to just get an application

450
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
up and running and test it.

451
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,560
I'm really grateful for that kind of stuff because if you're working with that tooling,

452
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,840
you get a Linode deployed in like, I don't know, 25 seconds.

453
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,480
It's just really just so quick.

454
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,120
The way I do it with my Linode too is I already have my SSH keys uploaded.

455
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,240
So when I'm deploying a new Linode, I just check the boxes, yeah, attach my SSH keys

456
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,520
to that Linode.

457
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,240
And so they spin it up, and I just SSH into it, and I'm in.

458
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,480
It's so, so great.

459
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,220
And then the Docker stuff was already installed with this particular one click that I did.

460
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,240
So it was just a matter of putting together a Docker compose file and turning the application

461
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,520
on, and I was off and running.

462
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,800
So, so quick, so easy, and then it's really fast.

463
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,520
And I picked the Texas data center, so that would be right in the middle of everybody

464
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,920
that'd be working on the box.

465
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,000
So go get that $100 credit so you can really see what I'm talking about here.

466
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,440
Just a lot to take in.

467
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,400
And so I think $100 really lets you soak it all up, gives you an opportunity to learn,

468
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
see what they do for themselves.

469
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,800
So that's why you gotta go check it out by going to linode.com slash coder.

470
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:54,680
Get $100 in credit on your new Linode account and try them out, linode.com slash coder.

471
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,040
What a week.

472
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:05,800
New York Times ran a hit piece on Google's CEO saying that he has paralyzing indecision

473
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:13,040
that locks Google up, and they got a bunch of VPs to go off the record and on the record

474
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,960
to just crap all over him.

475
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,060
One Google executive who departed in February said, if I had to summarize it, I would say

476
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,380
the signal to noise ratio is what wore me down.

477
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,880
Since 2020, 36 Google vice presidents have left the company, and some of them are getting

478
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,180
vocal about why.

479
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:36,040
Attempting challenges, they are way too risk averse.

480
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,480
Several Google executives told the New York Times that the company is suffering from all

481
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,380
kinds of issues that are related to their size now, including this paralyzing bureaucracy

482
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:50,240
that seems to really kind of slow down at the top, and a bias, they say, towards inaction,

483
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,520
and a fixation by the leadership on the public perception of the company.

484
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,480
And they say Sundar Pichai has to go.

485
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,360
I don't really know that many regular people who aren't like super-duper tech nerds, really

486
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,120
ever one had the love affair with Google that I think particularly folks like the open source

487
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,440
community definitely did.

488
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,200
So like when I talk to regular people, you know, the normies, if there's a tech company

489
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,600
that they hate, it's almost always Facebook.

490
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,280
Yes, right.

491
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,400
And they're like happy to not spend as much money as they would on an iPhone on a mid-range

492
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Samsung.

493
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Yeah, yeah.

494
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
They're proud of their...

495
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:33,000
Right, I mean, when I talk to tech people, like it's like, you know, the other developers

496
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,160
I know, it's weird because like I kind of always had a little bit of ire towards Google,

497
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,320
but that was me banging my people should pay for software drum.

498
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Right.

499
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
They're dumping on the market.

500
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
Right.

501
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,880
But I don't think that's what this is about.

502
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
I don't know, right?

503
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,880
There was the whole Google tried to get a government, the military contract thing, and

504
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,840
then they have like a worker strike or something.

505
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,800
Yeah, they had a walk, they had a big walkout.

506
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,200
It doesn't read like the typical Google criticism.

507
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,520
What this reads to me as is a bunch of hotshot VPs who had the next brilliant product idea

508
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,920
to take on Company X pitched it, Google didn't act on it, and then Company X came to market.

509
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,940
Like the story that I saw bubble up in the Google ecosphere before this one is that Google

510
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,080
internally has been working on an AirTags competitor, and there's people internally

511
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,720
that are salty that they didn't get it out before Apple got AirTags out, and now they

512
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,520
feel like they're going to look like a MeToo brand when they release their tracker.

513
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,920
And I think that might have been maybe the impetus for somebody to reach out to the New

514
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:43,620
York Times, or completely alternatively, this entire thing is a brilliant PR piece by a

515
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:49,360
firm that is really earning their dollar right now, because my read on this is good.

516
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,320
I think this is great news.

517
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,520
The fact that Sundar Pichai takes a while to make a decision as a leader at Google,

518
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,680
thank God, thank God.

519
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,560
And the other part this story touches on is that people are salty they didn't buy Shopify.

520
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Good.

521
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,580
I'm glad Google didn't buy Shopify.

522
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,840
Like when you look at this from a market strategy standpoint right now, there's a lot of heat

523
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,040
coming down from different governments about antitrust.

524
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:20,840
So maybe having somebody at the helm of the world's most scary data collector that is

525
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,840
cautious and thinking about things and taking his time to make a decision, maybe that's

526
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,940
a good thing.

527
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,600
When I read this, I think that's exactly what I want Google's CEO doing is thinking long

528
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,480
and hard about the decisions and industry moves that they make.

529
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:42,020
I think this in a way is almost like a PR piece for Google to twist the way the regulators

530
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
are going to look at Google.

531
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,880
I'm not saying that's what it is, but it's so good for that that it almost could be.

532
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,840
I love it, so you think there's some VP covetching to the New York Times being like, damn this

533
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,360
Sundar guy, he's not being as rapacious a capitalist as I would.

534
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,720
Well, I mean, yeah, I think it's in a way I'm glad.

535
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,480
I agree that for Google maybe it would be better if he was being a little more ruthless.

536
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,600
They probably should have snapped up Shopify.

537
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,160
They could be a little more dynamic, they could be a little more aggressive, and they

538
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,480
would probably be doing even better.

539
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,160
But dude, Alphabet itself is worth like around $1.6 trillion right now, so maybe they're

540
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
not doing it wrong.

541
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,960
You know, Wes in the chat room makes a good point.

542
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,320
There is some rings of truth in there, that Google does seem to lack focus, that their

543
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,000
decisions are slow, and then when they do make a decision, it's generally reactionary

544
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,100
to the market.

545
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,100
Those are all true.

546
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,440
I mean, there's a connected story going on basically in all the press right now of all

547
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,560
the big tech companies are fighting like hell to prevent this regulation.

548
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,280
Yeah, when there's been like in the US, there's been like five different proposals on how

549
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,200
they could break these big tech companies up for antitrust.

550
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,840
The EU's got stuff in the works.

551
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
They're getting surrounded.

552
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,880
If you're any of these other tech CEOs, you've just got to hate Zuckerberg the most because

553
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,360
he really brought this down on them.

554
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Yeah, you're right.

555
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,760
Right, well, at the Facebook election, route Cambridge Analytica, the politicians would

556
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,280
not be, it seems weird to say, but not so long ago, the tech companies were like the

557
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,000
great, you know, the great hope, right?

558
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The darlings.

559
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Right.

560
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
America's best industry.

561
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Right.

562
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You know, this is the future.

563
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,480
We're going to have all these new and they remember biotech was going to be the next

564
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
thing.

565
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Mm hmm.

566
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,680
And, you know, autonomous automation was going to be like a good thing.

567
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,040
Now you say you do automation.

568
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,640
You're like, oh, so you're trying to put my uncle out of a job.

569
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
Right?

570
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,220
It's the worm has turned, and it's all because of Marky Mark.

571
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,320
That is an interesting insight.

572
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
I think you're right.

573
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,160
That really was the beginning of this whole thing.

574
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,360
And then when they when they hauled him in front of Congress, he's like, I welcome regulation.

575
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,040
Of course, the big companies love regulation because it puts barriers up to little guys.

576
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,480
I'm not so sure Apple does.

577
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,000
You know, did you see the story that Tim Cook called Nancy Pelosi?

578
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,800
Yeah, I saw that.

579
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
Yeah.

580
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,640
Also, it's not in the headline, but Google's senior vice president for global affairs,

581
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,680
Kent Walker, also has made many calls to lawmakers in recent days, too.

582
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,080
They're essentially trying to push back.

583
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,000
But I guess the reception's been cold.

584
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,140
Supposedly Pelosi told Cook that she needs specifics on what doesn't work for him.

585
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:20,560
And Cook says these changes would disrupt iPhones in the market and actually cause like

586
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,320
grief in people's life if you make these changes.

587
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,120
And it's so crazy, man, because basically from the start of the show, you and I have

588
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,320
been saying this is the way this is going to go.

589
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,880
This is the way it's going to go from day one.

590
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:41,640
And now here we are and I think they're going to get up and Apple is totally unprepared.

591
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,200
You know, they're not making the concessions they need to make.

592
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,240
If Apple would have given up on their 30 percent cut years ago, they'd be in a way better position.

593
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,120
But they antagonize developers to the point where they became outraged and they're trying

594
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:01,380
to claim that forcing them to open up third party installs on the iPhone would just completely

595
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,720
wreck the iPhone of all security, which is complete and total bullsh**.

596
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,680
Because of course, you'd still have to have a developer account.

597
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,460
You still have to have an entitlement that is signed by Apple.

598
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,240
They would retain the ability to revoke those apps and entitlements.

599
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,760
They could revoke your developer account, even if you didn't go through the app store,

600
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,600
just like they can do now on their platform.

601
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,440
They could do it to third party apps that get sideloaded.

602
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,640
They still could have to require signing.

603
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,920
The whole thing is such bullsh** from Apple.

604
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,800
It's like they don't think it's like they don't appreciate the train that is coming

605
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:38,280
their way, because what makes Apple work is the integration of everything.

606
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,980
Like if you took one message away from WWDC, it was that all of those features are coming

607
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,780
to all of the platforms at once, iOS, the Mac, the iPad.

608
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,640
They're all getting all of the features at once.

609
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,640
And they work together with things like universal control.

610
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,440
That's what makes Apple's ecosystem compelling, the fact that the AirPods work so well with

611
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,400
the damn phone.

612
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,000
And so if regulation comes in and breaks all this up, they're going to be so screwed because

613
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,240
their secret sauce is taken from them.

614
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,320
And so they are playing with a kind of fire that could destroy them.

615
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,880
And it's wild to watch a company go from nearly dead to now so far up that they're going to

616
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
be sliced up by the government.

617
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,880
I mean, are they going to be sliced up or are they going to just have to like take less

618
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
than 30 percent?

619
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
I don't know.

620
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
I'm not sure.

621
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,960
I mean, Apple has been building a legal team for a while.

622
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,560
I don't think anybody is getting broke.

623
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:37,960
The only one I think might face an actual breakup is for some reason the Instagram thing

624
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,360
seems to have pissed off the lawmakers significantly.

625
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,600
And I feel like Facebook could lose either Instagram or what is it, WeChat that they

626
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
own?

627
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Yeah, WeChat, right?

628
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Yeah.

629
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,120
That's what I could see only because like Apple is doing hardware integration and software

630
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,920
integration between their family of products.

631
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,880
Microsoft bundling Internet Explorer.

632
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,760
I mean, that might be how they're looking at this.

633
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
Okay.

634
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
But let's take me.

635
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Right.

636
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,800
Like one of the reasons I keep floating back to Mac is like as I buy Christmas, right?

637
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,960
The home pods are great or like the AirPods Max, right?

638
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,160
These are I'm using them right now for my audio output.

639
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Right.

640
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,600
I'm using the mic for the input.

641
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
These are really nice.

642
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,200
They automagically know which device I'm trying to use.

643
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,200
I don't have to do, you know, the Bluetooth dance that I used to always have to do.

644
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,800
Or I don't have to get cables that are going to get frayed and then only come out of one

645
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,000
ear like my other headphones.

646
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,960
I can, you know, quote, throw, what is it, AirPlay?

647
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,800
Stuff from my computer to my phone to the HomePod to the HomePod in another room and

648
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,240
seamlessly pick it up.

649
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,600
I don't think that's anti-try.

650
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,640
I don't think that's really being a trust.

651
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,680
Now, Apple saying that who can and cannot have software in the App Store isn't either,

652
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:02,800
to be honest, except when they say users may only get software via the App Store, right?

653
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,920
So I guess I argued myself actually into your position that the problem to me that Apple

654
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:16,680
has is if I want to, you know, if the mad botter wants to make the next great iPad app

655
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,760
and Apple for some reason doesn't like it, then I'm posed.

656
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,880
I can't go to, you know, Tim Sweeney at Epic and say I want to put it in your store, right?

657
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,440
This is where the whole store analogy kind of falls down because if, you know, if 7-Eleven

658
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,880
doesn't want to carry my slushy brand, well, quick check might or wall on might.

659
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
That's not the case on iOS.

660
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,840
I just can't imagine regulators stop at the App Store.

661
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,960
Like they open, once they crack that door open, where else are you going to go?

662
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,240
You could say maybe AirPods need to be broken out or something.

663
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
I mean, I don't know.

664
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
I don't know.

665
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
I don't know.

666
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,760
So the reason why I think is I think there is an appetite in the U.S. public.

667
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:01,800
So there was a survey done today and 53 percent of the citizens of the states that were surveyed,

668
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:08,680
53 percent somewhat support Congress's big tech antitrust bills, 44 percent rank tech

669
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,600
regulation as a low priority or the lowest.

670
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
I think 53 percent is a pretty significant number.

671
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,800
And the reason why I think it's significant is the poll was actually commissioned by a

672
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,320
tech industry funded group.

673
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,380
So if anything, it's going to like it's going to bring those numbers down because it's depressing

674
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,380
the numbers.

675
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,760
And if the numbers are 53 percent when they're depressed, I'm a little concerned about that.

676
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,180
However, the survey showed that when you were given specific examples of how they might

677
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,720
break up the big tech companies, respondents said they would then oppose them.

678
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,440
But initially the concept of breaking up big tech so that way it's fair for consumers and

679
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,120
small businesses, people like that idea.

680
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,160
And so it gives our Congress critters an opportunity to go up there and sound like they're doing

681
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:56,500
something for the people and play tough without actually having to do anything that really

682
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,800
is going to change the lives of the American people.

683
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,080
Like there's so many other things they should be focusing on right now.

684
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,240
Even with all the crap we talk about this, but this is what they're going to focus on.

685
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,860
Honestly, if they can get on the other end of this and what's really changed is we get

686
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,480
more access to installing apps on our devices, great.

687
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,920
I think where my primary concern comes from is watching what they did to Microsoft and

688
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,340
how they neutered them.

689
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:25,820
How Microsoft went and just kind of just became an old slow dog after the antitrust stuff

690
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,560
came in.

691
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,240
For better or for worse, I suppose.

692
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,960
I guess I just I can't get past the idea that they're just going to go for the easy win

693
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,680
and say Instagram can't be part of Facebook.

694
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,680
Yeah.

695
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,680
Oh, and by real time follow up, Reese in the chat room points out it's WhatsApp.

696
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,520
WeChat's the China chat app and it's WhatsApp.

697
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Yeah.

698
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
We'll see.

699
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
I suppose.

700
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,840
Boy, this stuff is really rolling on though.

701
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,920
It really is coming up.

702
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,920
It's coming up and I think they're not playing a smart game here.

703
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,880
I think the tech companies are about to get rolled by DC and that when you look at other

704
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,100
industries like the defense and oils and other big industries like pharma, they know how

705
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,360
to handle this so much better than these tech companies do.

706
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,600
They suck at this kind of stuff.

707
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,040
I mean, the fact that Tim Cook called Nancy Pelosi and that leaked out is an example of

708
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,240
something that just doesn't happen with the other big companies.

709
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,000
Well, and she obviously leaked it, right?

710
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Yep.

711
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Playing hardball.

712
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Playing hardball.

713
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,120
Good luck, Tim.

They've done an incredible job and I underscore that because that can really make a difference

727
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,840
when you're in a discussion, a meeting maybe with somebody that's upstairs.

728
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,920
You can show them this information and they can grok it.

729

735
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,760
while you're supporting the show datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

736
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,040
Well speaking of Microsoft, they're doing all right now.

737
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,860
They just hit the two trillion dollar milestone, unbelievable.

738
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,720
Their shares have gained 19% so far this year.

739
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,360
Only Apple and Saudi's Armco or Aramco have hit the two trillion in value, which is an

740
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,440
oil organization.

741
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,640
So Apple and an oil group have hit two trillion and now Microsoft, two trillion dollars.

742
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,560
So I guess maybe they did okay after all that antitrust stuff.

743
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
That's huge.

744
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,760
That's sweet, sweet Azure money.

745
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,520
Nadella is just, I mean, he's basically locked himself in the Hall of Fame of CEOs now.

746
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,040
If you're a CEO while your company creates, hits a milestone like this, like he's set.

747
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,840
Even if he does nothing else, remarkable for the rest of his tenure.

748
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
Yeah, he's done.

749
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,840
He's good.

750
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Yep.

751
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,280
And you know, congratulations to our friends at Microsoft.

752
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,800
I don't know how much this really matters to the employees there.

753
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Not even a little.

754
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,040
Boy, is it happening in the shadow of Bill Gates just eating a lot of shit these days.

755
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,320
Oh, poor Bill.

756
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
I know.

757
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,920
Today, Warren Buffett announced he's leaving the board of the Gates Foundation.

758
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,200
It's like there's a hit against Bill Gates, like a public PR hit.

759
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,800
Honestly, I really think there was.

760
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,800
He was like the last like loved tech guy.

761
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,600
I mean, it sounds like there was some hanky panky.

762
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Yeah.

763
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,100
And you don't think Warren Buffett did any hanky panky.

764
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,000
That's why I find all the Bill Gates stuff kind of like, yeah, I suppose they're all

765
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,160
kind of weirdos.

766
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
They're all kind of weirdos.

767
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,440
You don't get that rich and that much power if you don't have like a sense of entitlement

768
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,720
that you just like do weird stuff.

769
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,720
True.

770
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
All the things are mine.

771
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Yeah.

772
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,280
Well, so it's all in the shadow of Microsoft becoming hooch.

773
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,680
But Gates is sort of just an after story now, I suppose, about it.

774
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,880
I don't know.

775
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
I wonder what's going on there.

776
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
I wonder where that leads to.

777
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,600
You think the goal is to just discredit people in tech in general, like big tech leaders?

778
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,960
Because Bezos gets a lot of shit, too, although I'm not a big fan of either one of these guys.

779
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,480
I think that there's just a cultural moment right now where the tech guys are no longer

780
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,200
seen as the level born nerds who are going to build great things that are going to save

781
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
us all.

782
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Right.

783
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Right.

784
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Right.

785
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,960
Hey, you know what I didn't realize when we started the show today?

786
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,600
Tomorrow is the big Windows 11 reveal.

787
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,000
I think you mean Windows 10 X.

788
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,120
Now, I think you mean the artist formerly known as Windows 10 X.

789
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,120
Wait.

790
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,120
Wait.

791
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,680
Is this Metro again?

792
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,680
Kind of is.

793
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,000
Whoa, that's a deep cut.

794
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,560
I actually think it's Plasma, dude.

795
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,080
Have you looked at these screenshots?

796
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,280
I just put a link to The Verge in there.

797
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,960
It looks very KDE.

798
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,000
It does have the essence of KDE going on, yeah.

799
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,840
It's like Gnome and KDE had a baby, and it's Windows 11 UI, and a Chromebook.

800
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,080
I do not like the icons in the middle of the taskbar.

801
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
That sucks.

802
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,360
No, I don't like anything about this.

803
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
Yeah.

804
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,360
So there you go.

805
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:41,800
Significant updates, Nadella says, Windows 11 will be likely demoed tomorrow.

806
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,440
There's already a leaked version online, so we kind of already know a lot.

807
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,920
It sort of took a lot of the excitement out of the event.

808
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,760
All the rots are already gone over in detail.

809
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Yeah, what does he think?

810
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,120
Does he have a summary of what Paul thinks?

811
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
He thinks it's Windows 10 X.

812
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Yeah, okay.

813
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
Oh, yeah.

814
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Yeah, yeah.

815
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
Yeah.

816
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,880
Because it is, right?

817
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,520
Microsoft also recently announced their 30% cut on PC games is going down.

818
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:12,000
They're dropping it to a 12% cut for games.

819
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,540
That's 18% of throwing the finger at Apple.

820
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,600
They're expecting Windows 11 to be a free upgrade for any PC running Windows 10 right

821
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
now.

822
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,160
That's because it's 10 X.

823
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
I think so.

824
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,000
They say this is going to be the Windows release that focuses on Windows enthusiasts.

825
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,280
Are there Windows enthusiasts?

826
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Is that a thing?

827
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,960
He's unaware of such a creature.

828
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,360
I mean, not even Paul Therot, who makes his living writing about Windows.

829
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,560
I would not even describe him as a Windows enthusiast.

830
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,160
If you listen to his podcast, Windows Weekly, I would not categorize him as enthusiastic

831
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,680
or even happy at all.

832
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,680
Right.

833
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,720
I think it's what happens to guys who cover this for a while.

834
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
Look at us.

835
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
It's true.

836
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
Oh, man.

837
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:59,720
It's just impossible to stay positive after you watch this.

838
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,240
Just take like a decade or so on an OS and you will hate everything about it.

839
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
That's true.

840
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,160
Any tool you use extensively, you become aware of all of its problems, and then you kind

841
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,120
of fixate on that for a bit.

842
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,640
So meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, I just want to mention that one more time.

843
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,600
If you're out in the Denver or Salt Lake City area in August and want to come roast with

844
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,640
us, I imagine it's going to be real hot, right?

845
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,960
In Salt Lake City, it's going to be real hot on August 7th.

846
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,280
Yeah, I would think so.

847
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Why am I doing this to myself?

848
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
Why didn't I go up to Canada?

849
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Oh, the border's closed.

850
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
Yeah.

851
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
Because you miss events.

852
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,280
I do.

853
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
That's what it is.

854
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
I just decided to do my own thing.

855
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
I'll be honest.

856
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
I'm tempted.

857
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,800
If I can somehow get away, I might do it.

858
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,120
Oh, how fun would that be?

859
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,000
Do you miss the events at all?

860
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I mean, like-

861
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,160
I don't miss the bad, lame events.

862
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Yeah.

863
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:51,000
But I think once we get out of this weird state, which we, you know, 2022 in terms of

864
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,520
like no conferences and stuff, I'll probably still, like there was a couple that are good.

865
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,560
Like DevFest Florida, I always enjoyed.

866
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,640
I never went to Southeast Linux Fest and no offense to anybody who runs it, but I've heard

867
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
mixed things.

868
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,320
Maybe at a good year, maybe at a bad year, but Linux Fest Northwest, I regret not going

869
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
to.

870
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
Yeah.

871
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
I miss that the most.

872
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,320
That's the one I miss the most.

873
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,320
Yeah.

874
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
I really was.

875
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
I wouldn't go to WWC at this juncture.

876
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:20,560
Cause I don't do enough iOSy stuff to care and Google IO is just a train wreck.

877
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,880
Yeah.

878
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
And those may stay virtual.

879
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
Who knows?

880
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
We'll see.

881
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,760
We'll see if it actually stays virtual cause it's just better.

882
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,200
I wonder if by the next time we get together on our regular Monday recording, I wonder

883
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,200
if you'll have a Thaleo.

884
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,720
It might be too soon still depending on parts and stuff.

885
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Probably not if it hasn't shipped.

886
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
Right?

887
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
Yeah.

888
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
It's two business days from pick up.

889
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,240
So even if they would have to have it done tomorrow.

890
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Yeah.

891
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,240
It's a long shot.

892
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,120
Then I still wouldn't get it because it'd be Friday, Monday.

893
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Yeah.

894
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:58,000
So every day, my buddy Alex from self-hosted, my co-host from self-hosted will be in studio.

895
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,160
So I might invite him to sit down with us if you're open to that.

896
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
Sounds fun.

897
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,660
He's going to be staying for the week and we're going to be just hanging out and working

898
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,660
on projects.

899
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,660
Yeah.

900
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,920
I've been kind of getting the studio prepped for him cause.

901
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,920
Prepared.

902
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
Yeah.

903
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,080
You know, it's just sort of when I'm just working here, it's just a space for me really

904
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,940
and Wes, but we have a room that he can stay in and stuff.

905
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,180
So it was just getting that ready, getting new linens and stuff like that.

906
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:25,200
The weird like ancillary things you do to support the business that have nothing to

907
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,600
do with like creating content.

908
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,640
Yep.

909
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,640
Just totally like we're out there getting rooms ready and stuff, but it's so I'm totally

910
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,000
looking forward to it.

911
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So that'll be fun.

912
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,340
And I'm like, that'll, that's going to spice things up for next week.

913
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,340
So there you go.

914
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,280
And maybe we'll have comments on the, I was tempted to try at windows 11.

915
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,480
I may give it a download and try it out before next week's coder.

916
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,480
I might.

917
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,840
Oh, I'm going to try it out.

918
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,840
Are you?

919
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Yeah.

920
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,840
I'm going to try it out.

921
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,840
Yeah.

922
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,840
Okay.

923
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
All right.

924
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
Why not?

925
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
I'll give it a go too.

926
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,840
Well, anything you want to mention before we get out of here?

927
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,840
