00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 452 for February 7th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,240
Hey y'all, come on in now, this is Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,140
pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,920
My name is Chris, and joining me with his trucker hat, oh, hang on, it's our host, Chris

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
D'Onofrio.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Mr. Dominic.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,800
See, this is what happens, people miss the live stream, they don't even know what I'm

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,080
talking, I mean, they get probably part of the joke, but they don't get the full, you

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,400
know, the full illustrious Mike Dominic, you know, the full flavor Mike Dominic.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,800
Switch your Tim Hortons to decaf and calm the hell down, all right?

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
Tim Hortons.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,720
Hey man, you know I live in Starbucks land.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
You know that.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,720
You're so prudish.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
I live in the land of Starbucks.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,380
I don't drink Starbucks.

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,380
Coffee radio.

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,920
I've been holding this back for two months.

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
Ask me what brand of coffee is in my pantry right now.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,720
Hey Mike, what brand of coffee is in your pantry right now?

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,600
Great value, otherwise known as Walmart.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,920
Which is probably Folgers, let's be honest.

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,360
Right, it's fine.

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,600
I've gotten to the point of coffee addiction where I just need so much.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,640
I feel like meth heads go through a similar process.

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,920
This is why I just go for the pills.

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,400
I just get the caffeine pills, and then I drink something bubbly with it, so that way

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,960
I can slam the caffeine into my intestinal system as fast as possible, and that system

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
works.

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,240
There was a point in my wayward youth where I chewed espresso beans.

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,260
Surprisingly hard to get out of your teeth if you have caps.

32
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,360
This is what a man who has sleep apnea for 11 years and didn't get it taken care of tried

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
to do.

34
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,120
I discovered that Air Force pilots have this type of caffeinated gum that they get to chew.

35
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
Not good for you.

36
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,920
So of course, I tracked that down, and I ordered like a box of it, and just started going to

37
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,360
town on it, and then ended up getting a hole in one of my molars, so then I quit doing

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
that.

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,640
At what point did you start seeing Russian fighter jets around your house?

40
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Were you like, whoa?

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,120
Yeah, actually they were just geese, but I thought they were Russian fighter jets until

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
then.

43
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
Of course, they're not real.

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Right, yeah.

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,600
Oh man, I tell you what, the Steam Deck FOMO is getting real.

46
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,960
The reviews are out there.

47
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,240
The videos are dropping, and I want one now.

48
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,320
Did I ask you, are you getting a Steam Deck?

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,320
I think I pre-ordered two.

50
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,920
So there's something about like they're going to email you, and you've got to confirm your

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,560
order?

52
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,160
What kind of messed up system is this?

53
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,080
That is preemptively giving me anxiety, and I don't even think it's till like the end

54
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,940
of the month, and I'm already stressing about this email that might come in, and you have

55
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,520
like 72 hours, or 48 hours, or five minutes, you've got like five minutes to respond to

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
this email.

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
That's probably what it is, probably one minute.

58
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,120
You've got one minute to respond to this email, and if you don't respond to this email within

59
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,560
like 30 seconds, then you don't get your deck.

60
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,480
And also, I thought I already paid for it.

61
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
You did not.

62
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,540
I did not, right?

63
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,620
But I kind of mentally thought I had, and then I went and looked and realized I hadn't.

64
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,480
So that sucks, because I thought I already spent that money.

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,600
So now I'm like preparing myself for like, okay.

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,700
Since the deck was announced, my entire mindset about money has changed, and now I don't want

67
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,700
to spend any.

68
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,680
I don't like spending money on anything.

69
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,440
I've gone from let's buy to I don't want to spend money.

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,240
Now I feel bad about buying the deck.

71
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,720
I feel like the deck is a good purchase though.

72
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Yeah.

73
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Yeah.

74
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
I actually think it could be.

75
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,520
I was thinking about it like for people out there that don't have a Linux desktop machine

76
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,520
with a graphics card.

77
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,840
Maybe they're on a Mac or a Windows machine for day to day.

78
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,480
Now they can get this deck, and they can keep using their work setup that gets the job done

79
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,200
for them, and also experience how far Linux gaming has come.

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,960
For us geeks out there, that's also really great.

81
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,000
And I also realized the other thing that's going to be fantastic about it is it means

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,720
I can mess my systems up.

83
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,400
I can screw with different stuff, and I'll always have a working gaming machine now.

84
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Yeah.

85
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I think it's going to be good.

86
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,400
I have been deep into my Switch, but it would be nice to be able to play some AAA games.

87
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,160
Presumably the Steam Deck is more powerful than the Switch.

88
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,680
It's a powerful deck, if you will.

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Oh yeah.

90
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
For sure.

91
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Yeah.

92
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
I think it's going to be fine, right?

93
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,360
Put yourself in the mindset of you and me when we were flying and traveling and staying

94
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
in hotels.

95
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
That's so far.

96
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Right?

97
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
And this is a little PC that you could take with you in your bag.

98
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
Okay.

99
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,320
But is Steam going to complain about like DRM and authentication and stuff if you have

100
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
no connection?

101
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,960
I think that's going to work exactly how it works now with Steam games, because that's

102
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,560
all the same.

103
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,680
But you are going to get a plasma desktop, an Arch-based plasma desktop that they're

104
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,260
going to give you access to.

105
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:02,680
And if you plug in a second screen, you can do dual monitors using the screen of the Deck

106
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,980
and whatever monitor you brought.

107
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,480
I think that's pretty great.

108
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,800
One assumes, though, that you don't have to, right?

109
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,640
If you want to treat this as a console and just plug it into a monitor to play the games

110
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,280
with the controller.

111
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,960
Like if your hotel room monitor had or TV screen had a working in HDMI, you could totally

112
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
do that.

113
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,560
That just seems really cool.

114
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,320
I mean, how do the specs compare to like, I don't know, like a last gen, like an Xbox

115
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,800
Xbone or a PS4?

116
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,920
I don't know because I'm not familiar with the specs of those consoles, but it's a step

117
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:42,480
above what I think a lot of AMD gaming laptops are today with an integrated GPU.

118
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,480
So it doesn't have a dedicated external GPU necessarily, but it has the latest and greatest

119
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,600
AMD APUs, which is looking really great.

120
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,560
Plus Valve continues to do a lot of work on the back end to get the drivers in good shape.

121
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,880
So the performance, they've really managed to eke out every little bit of performance

122
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,900
for the Linux driver for the AMD GPU.

123
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,560
So you got a brand new iteration on that GPU, plus a really good driver stack for it in

124
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
the back.

125
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,480
So this is where I bought one because I like to light money on fire.

126
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,360
Like the Witcher 3 is a game I want to play and I have it on the Switch, but I'm told

127
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,200
that the Swift is just kind of a nerfed version of it.

128
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Oh, sure.

129
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Yeah.

130
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,840
Will this be able to play the Witcher 3 and all of its...

131
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
I believe so.

132
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Yeah.

133
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Hmm.

134
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Okay.

135
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Yeah.

136
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,240
And because it's also the other thing that has in its favor, decent GPU, really.

137
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,560
And it's a 720p screen.

138
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,240
Now the reviews are saying it's a great screen, but it's not a crazy high res.

139
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,240
So you can really kind of push the graphics because it's not trying to do like a 1080p

140
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,440
or 4K resolution.

141
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,520
We will see.

142
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,360
Who knows how it'll actually go, but I'm keeping an eye out for that email.

143
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,860
And speaking of email, we are still getting a lot of emails about the blue versus green

144
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,640
bubble situation, unbelievably.

145
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,920
And I don't know if you caught this, Mike, but last week Google announced it was rolling

146
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,880
out an update for Google messages that supports the iMessage reactions.

147
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,440
So it now displays them appropriately in Google messages.

148
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,920
I still don't get it, but sure.

149
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Okay.

150
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,180
This is outrageous.

151
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,520
This is fucking outrageous.

152
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,720
So this entire discussion, the premise has been Apple is the bully.

153
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,640
Apple is the bad guy.

154
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:41,140
Apple is making green bubble folks feel like they are less when a huge part of the problem

155
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:47,000
could have been solved by Google all along on their own platform with their own update.

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,480
Are you kidding me?

157
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,920
Well, I mean, you know how Google feels about maintaining platforms.

158
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,680
I just, I can't believe that this was a thing that Google could have done all along and

159
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,820
they just now got to it.

160
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:06,720
That is so extremely user hostile and yet that's not how this gets covered at all.

161
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
And nobody's talking about that.

162
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,160
Everyone's celebrating now that Google messages now supports iPhone reactions and they actually

163
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,920
mapped RCS reactions now.

164
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:21,840
And yes, I acknowledge this is not the entire problem, but this is a big part of the problem

165
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,000
and it indicates that Google had the ability to solve it all fricking along.

166
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,440
And I can't even, especially when they were on Twitter shaming Apple and calling them

167
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:39,800
bullies for this situation, the official Android account called Apple bullies for this.

168
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,720
But does this really solve the whole problem, right?

169
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,120
Cause you still have like the group messaging kerfuffle.

170
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,200
Yeah, it's not perfect, but now in group messages, when people do the reaction, they'll display

171
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,480
properly on the Android side.

172
00:08:51,480 --> 00:09:01,920
It doesn't solve all of them, but it's outrageous that again, Google just, I cannot properly

173
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,400
convey how bad Google has screwed this up from all of their different messaging applications,

174
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,320
from the way they screwed the pooch with the carriers initially, all of it.

175
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,880
And it's all been user hostile.

176
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,740
It's been all extremely user hostile from the very beginning.

177
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,660
And yet somehow they don't end up getting any of the criticism in this situation.

178
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,580
And I know I come across here and now here's Chris again, I'm like the guy that defends

179
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,920
Facebook and defends Apple.

180
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,340
So I sound like I'm like, you know, pro Apple, but I'm really just trying to advocate for

181
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:37,260
common sense and having a little bit of balance looking at these things.

182
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,180
Absolutely Apple could do more.

183
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,560
Absolutely it'd be like minimum for Apple to support RCS.

184
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,580
And then I think even just maybe like slightly above minimum would be for them to release

185
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,000
iMessage for Android.

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,760
Like that seems like that would be a fairly reasonable thing to do.

187
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,800
I grant you there's things that could be done on both sides, but this has to be looked at

188
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,000
from what Google could be doing to help their own users.

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,380
And then we never, ever, ever hold Google accountable for that kind of stuff.

190
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,200
With apologies to the listeners who wrote in, I definitely like feel bad if people are

191
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,540
upset about the whole green bubble thing and they're being pushed around if they're younger,

192
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,540
especially.

193
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,500
But I don't know, Apple made a messaging system, right?

194
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,200
They don't have to open it to other people if they don't want to.

195
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,800
And they clearly don't want to.

196
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,040
Google decided to not update their messaging app because they're Google and that's how

197
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
they roll.

198
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,480
I mean, it's great that they fixed the emoji problem, I guess.

199
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,200
I don't see the remedy, like you said, it'd be reasonable for Apple to put iMessage on

200
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Android.

201
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,320
I think that would be crazy.

202
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Why would they do that?

203
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,520
Lock-in is a valid business model.

204
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,880
I'm not saying it's a nice model, but it's certainly legal.

205
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,980
I agree they don't have motivation, but I could see the argument that they've probably

206
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,520
gotten most of the value out of that iMessage lock-in effect, that network effect.

207
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,700
If you just look at the dominance and market penetration of the iPhone, which again, isn't

208
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,920
the market leader, but they've done a good job creating a network effect.

209
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,480
But don't you think maybe the bulk benefit of that has kind of faded now?

210
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,200
And while it's still a benefit, it's not the strong ecosystem lock-in that it was, say,

211
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,280
a few years ago, I would presume.

212
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,200
You've pretty much reached everybody at this point who's going to go iPhone except for

213
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,520
the slow trickle of switchers.

214
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,620
Yeah, but the benefit is the moat, right?

215
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,680
And in fact, one of the emails released in the Epic trial, the case they're talking about,

216
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,080
they were talking about in those emails was parents who have kids that are getting them

217
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,600
their first smartphone, getting them to buy the more expensive iPhone rather than take

218
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
the carrier-free Android.

219
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,800
And I know like with the SEs, there might be a free iPhone depending on the promotion,

220
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,360
but usually there's not.

221
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,240
iMessage is a big way to handle that, a big form of lock-in.

222
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
That's a fair point.

223
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,840
Yeah, it is a good moat.

224
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
It's a moat, right.

225
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
It's a defensive action.

226
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,680
That, along with AirPods and Apple Watch and the App Store, they're all part of that moat.

227
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,120
Yeah, and I guess I feel like they have enough moats that they could afford to open that

228
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,720
up a little bit because then if you're looking at it from a services standpoint, if iMessage

229
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,360
ever starts to play into services, you could see why they'd want to open it up a little

230
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,640
bit like they've done with Apple TV.

231
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,620
But until that point, you're right.

232
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,340
There's no business motivation and Apple won't do things for their users unless it's also

233
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,340
good for Apple.

234
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:33,520
If it benefits users and it benefits Apple, they'll do it, but it has to benefit them

235
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
too.

236
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
I don't know.

237
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Maybe that's how you keep things sustainable.

238
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,880
So it's a thing now.

239
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,960
Android's rolling out iMessage reactions.

240
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,600
Steve writes in, and I think Steve's looking for a Python niche.

241
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,080
So I thought, okay, let's see if we can't help them out here, provide a little Coder

242
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
Radio wisdom.

243
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
We love answering your questions.

244
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,120
You go to coder.show slash contact to send them in.

245
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,600
We got a bunch of emails because I put the word out there that we wanted them.

246
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
So thank you, everybody.

247
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
We'll do a batch today.

248
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,400
We'll do a batch next week.

249
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,880
Steve says he's been in the Navy for 18 years and he's quickly approaching retirement.

250
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,600
So he's been teaching himself Python through Udemy courses that he snagged on sale.

251
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,680
He wants to get a decent headstart and so he's building a GitHub portfolio.

252
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,120
But here's his main concern and his question.

253
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,480
He wants to know what areas of technology within Python should he work on?

254
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,800
Should he learn in order to land that first junior developer job?

255
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,840
What kind of stuff are you looking for when you're hiring a junior Devon?

256
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,100
I think he's looking for your insights there.

257
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,860
He's worried about intangible soft skills.

258
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,680
He's just basically worried about getting a bunch of book skills and then getting on

259
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,680
the job and like, it turns out he doesn't know anything.

260
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,100
He has to learn a whole bunch of stuff because it's a major life change.

261
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,160
He's 41 years old.

262
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,720
He's got a family to support and he just kind of wants to make sure he lands on his feet.

263
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,040
So I think he's seeking your advice, your insights for what you might be looking for

264
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,520
in a junior Dev, specifically focusing on Python.

265
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Yeah, cool.

266
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
So awesome.

267
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
First of all, 18 years in the Navy.

268
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
That's awesome and nice work.

269
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,240
I mean, you've got a lot of it already, right?

270
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,480
Because, you know, if you have a GitHub and you're doing a Udemy course, that's great.

271
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,880
I would say right now the big things and I wish maybe I should say big, but the common

272
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,880
things that people are looking for, you know, some sort of API or web development framework

273
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,400
like Django is big or fast API.

274
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:30,880
I'm partial to that one, but Flask is certainly more popular as is Django, but really just

275
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,880
basic knowing how the frameworks work.

276
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,080
If you are thinking of doing a full stack web thing, Jinja or rather Jinja 2, which

277
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,440
is the kind of templating front end engine, it's going to be important.

278
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,360
The challenge with this question is that Python does so many things now, right?

279
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,880
You could do like Python IoT, you could do Python TensorFlow for machine learning.

280
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,920
I mean, hell, a bunch of, a lot of people just run their DevOps scripts in Python.

281
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,000
So I'm assuming you mean kind of the more common case, which is like web development,

282
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,760
server side application development.

283
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:06,440
I would definitely look at, you know, understand how async code works, pick up one of the web

284
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,320
frameworks, whether it's Django, Flask or fast API, it doesn't really matter.

285
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,040
I'd encourage you to actually take a look at fast API.

286
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,640
It's a little newer, a little smaller.

287
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,120
But I, in a lot of ways, and I'm going to get some crap for this, I think it is Flask,

288
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,400
but significantly better, kind of makes up for some of the mistakes, well, not mistakes,

289
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,800
but some of the legacy baggage that Flask has.

290
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Inappropriate?

291
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Yeah.

292
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,160
But a big one is going to be the Jinja 2 stuff, like I mentioned, because it doesn't matter

293
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,240
if you're a backend developer, at some point, somebody is going to want an admin page that

294
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,960
doesn't look like garbage.

295
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
And know your tools, right?

296
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,240
If you, you know, know how to use the debugger and VS code, that's super helpful.

297
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,280
I'm a little excited about Fleet coming out from Jeparins, but it is not out yet.

298
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:56,800
And those goddamn Russian bastards won't send me a beta invite.

299
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,280
So I can't really recommend that.

300
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,140
Perhaps it's because you call them bastards, comrade.

301
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,520
Maybe it is because I file bug, bug about font scaling on Ubuntu, but he did not like

302
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
this bug.

303
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
We don't have bug.

304
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
We have feature.

305
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,240
And they said, it is not our fault.

306
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,820
It is Ubuntu's fault.

307
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,400
And they were right to their credit, and they were correct.

308
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,080
And I understand that they're not actually from Russia, but I'm American, and if it was

309
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,360
the Soviet Union, it still is, ooh, ooh, ooh, too soon.

310
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,160
I don't, yeah, man, you're, you're on the right track.

311
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,120
I would just say, don't worry, don't get like crazy about, you know, I have to know this

312
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
framework.

313
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
Yeah.

314
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,760
You're going to go somewhere and buy, you know, ironically, they could be a Jeparins

315
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
shop, right?

316
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,200
They could hand you pie charm and that might just be where you, what it is and that's fine.

317
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,640
Steve points out, you know, he's got like the, how to work in an office skill.

318
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,480
He's got that kind of like ability.

319
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,000
So what you're really just looking for, Steve, is a way to demonstrate your capability to

320
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,040
learn that stuff.

321
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
That's what I'd be looking for.

322
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,840
If I were interviewing you and you were 41 years old and you had a resume that demonstrated

323
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,560
you were a competent worker, I would assume that you had all of those kinds of soft skills

324
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,640
and then it would really be a matter of, okay, could he get up to speed on what our stack

325
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,840
is?

326
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,800
Because even if you go, you go one direction and they go a different direction, or even

327
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,920
if you happen to just pick the exact same stack that they're using, there's still going

328
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,480
to be a lot of unique aspects to it.

329
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,080
There's always something you'll have to learn at every job.

330
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,160
A lot you're going to have to figure out, legacies, decisions, technical debt, that

331
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
kind of stuff.

332
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,280
So what I'd be looking for is to see if I felt like you had the ability to pick that

333
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
stuff up.

334
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,300
So that's what I think you're going to be looking for to demonstrate and I think you

335
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,240
are on the right course.

336
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,960
Colin wrote in, and Colin kind of is thinking along the same lines.

337
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,040
He says, I have some college experience, so I think he's a little bit on a younger end

338
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,240
of the spectrum, with computer science, but I never finished my degree and my primary

339
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,220
coding experience comes from passing both my Python certified entry level programming

340
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,760
course and the Python certified associate programmer.

341
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,400
So here's my question, you guys.

342
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,600
How helpful do you find these certifications when it comes towards working in everyday

343
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
businesses like on a day job, day to day job?

344
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,720
My main concern is that even though I have these certs, I'm going to start my job and

345
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,920
find myself unprepared to do the work that they're asking of me.

346
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,620
This is my first job professionally writing code.

347
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,640
My primary goal is to make a good enough impression with the team and in the hopes that they'll

348
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,480
retain me after a temporary position and I can go full time.

349
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,680
So he's concerned, okay, I've got these certs, they're decent Python entry level programmer

350
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,680
and Python certified associate programmer, but he's wondering, does this really mean

351
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
he's ready for the day to day job?

352
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,440
Does having this cert, learning that stuff, is he actually ready?

353
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,840
Yeah, so I am not personally familiar with these specific certifications.

354
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,040
I would say if the exam was challenging, then it probably does test something and that's

355
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,600
good.

356
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,200
The fact that you're asking if you're ready probably means that you are.

357
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,360
I know it's an old cliche, but the Dunning-Kruger effect, right?

358
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,040
If you're smart enough to know or you're knowledgeable enough to know there's things you're not maybe

359
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,200
super strong in or super comfortable in, then you probably know more than you think you

360
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
do.

361
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,960
And just the fact that you presumably on your own sat down for those exams means I'm sure

362
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,000
you would pick up whatever you need to learn.

363
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,520
And I would almost kind of what we talked about with Steve.

364
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,280
If you don't know how to write like a PyTest test, now's the time, right?

365
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:31,080
If you don't know how to make server to server REST calls using HTTPX, I would recommend

366
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,080
HTTPX.

367
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,520
You got to learn the async stuff, right?

368
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,920
That's kind of where things are going.

369
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,280
It seems like you are in the right direction and I would not be shocked, barring reasons

370
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,920
that your employer, if they just make you permanent.

371
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Good for you.

372
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,640
I think he's thinking along the right lines.

373
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,120
That's a good indication right there.

374
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,880
Really quickly, Trader Brew and Adrian Stein wrote in via telegram asking for an update

375
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,520
on the launch keyboard that I have since it's been a few months.

376
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,200
I don't know if you have any thoughts, any updates on your launch keyboard over there.

377
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
It's been pretty good over here.

378
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,480
I mean, it's great.

379
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,960
I switched to the blue keycaps.

380
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Oh, you did.

381
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Okay.

382
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,600
We had a meet up here in the studio a couple of weeks ago and the people that came in the

383
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,920
studio, everybody knew this was the launch keyboard.

384
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,520
Like they all recognized it and most people said it looks better in person than it does

385
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
on the website.

386
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
So, there's that.

387
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
I don't know.

388
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,480
I guess people had a bad impression of the photo on the website, but they think it looks

389
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
better in person.

390
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,600
I am very, very happy with it.

391
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,240
And if I could afford it, I'd probably have one at every computer and if they ever make

392
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,520
a cheaper version, I'll probably pick another one of those up.

393
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,040
I really like it a lot.

394
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,560
It makes kind of the perfect addition to the studio.

395
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,720
It's still great to type on.

396
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,320
I do like also split ergonomic keyboards.

397
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,800
So if they ever made it like a launch split, I'd probably pick that up too.

398
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Really?

399
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Yeah.

400
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Yeah.

401
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
I find that helps with the RSI if I can reposition it.

402
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,720
And the other thing I like to do with the split keyboards is I like to split them far

403
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,080
enough that I can put like a laptop in between the keyboard or a plate.

404
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
Nice.

405
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,080
Yeah, it's great.

406
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,320
Get a lot of keyboard action going there.

407
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,260
So I still give it a buy, which I paid for this with my own hard earned money and I still

408
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,960
give it a buy recommendation.

409
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,760
The launch keyboard has been solid.

410
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,480
It feels like a tank and continues to perform.

411
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,960
Linode.com slash coder.

412
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,240
Go there to get $100 on your account right now.

413
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,280
Go there and get $100 in 60 day credit and support the show.

414
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,800
Linode is fast and reliable cloud hosting.

415
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,560
You got to try it for your next project.

416
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,840
Maybe something you want to research, maybe something you want to deploy into production.

417
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
It's what we use.

418
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,840
You know, Linode has been essential actually and I love to see them doing upgrade after

419
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
upgrade.

420
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,040
Really, I thought, you know, one a year maybe is what we're going to see.

421
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,240
No, no, they just never stop.

422
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,520
They just literally are always rolling through the infrastructure, making improvements.

423
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,240
My favorite right now is the PCIe MVME storage.

424
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,740
It's a game changer for certain kinds of application.

425
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,720
Even like our matrix server could make a huge difference.

426
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,020
So if that's something that might be appealing to you, having really high IOPS for maybe

427
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,900
particular application might be worth going and checking out Linode.

428
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,280
Go talk to their support, which is great, 24-7, 365 support, phone, ticket, email, whatever

429
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
you prefer.

430
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
They're going to work with you.

431
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,320
They'll even help you figure out if that MVME storage is right for you.

432
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,200
You know, Linode is 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers that have these crazy

433
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,280
platforms that they just want to lock you into.

434
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,040
And when I want to try out an idea, I suppose in the past I may have gone through the hassle

435
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,440
of doing a VM on my local machine, but that just feels silly now.

436
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,440
I can spin up a Linode machine in seconds, especially if I'm taking advantage of the

437
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,000
command line client.

438
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,260
That's really the way to go.

439
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,920
On my system, I have the Uake drop down terminal, I don't know if you remember Quake, but there's

440
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
that drop down terminal.

441
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,120
I have that on my plasma desktop.

442
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,560
I hit the tilde key, that thing slides down, and I can fire off Linode API commands like

443
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,960
nobody's business because I always have it in one of the tabs.

444
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,680
I usually have several tabs and it's always there, in part because that's how we'll also

445
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,800
toss files to each other, is we'll use Linode's object storage.

446
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,920
Throw it up there, market public, send each other a link, it's really useful for that

447
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
kind of stuff.

448
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,560
I'll always take a snapshot on Linode before I do a major upgrade.

449
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,280
A couple of days ago, it was time to upgrade the OS on our matrix server.

450
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,600
And I started to go through the process and I realized, no, not a great idea, I should

451
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
do a backup.

452
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,200
So what I've done there is I'll put the Linode command line client on the Linode machine

453
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,800
that I'm going to take care of, like that week it was the matrix server.

454
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,680
And I'll just run it locally on that machine before I do an upgrade, and you can just have

455
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,000
the command line client initiate snapshot process.

456
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,440
It's so cool, I'll be like, oh, right, nope, cancel the update, run the Linode command

457
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,640
line to initiate a snapshot, wait a few seconds, then run the upgrade, and the snapshots are

458
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
super fast.

459
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,260
They got 11 data centers around the world, so there's going to be something close to

460
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,260
you or your clients.

461
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,400
You know, they've been doing this for almost 19 years now.

462
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,480
So they figured it out and they just keep getting better and better.

463
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,380
They didn't have to take a bunch of VC funding, so they don't have like these crazy, crazy

464
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,240
like higher goals and all this kinds of stuff, they just stay focused on building the best

465
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,580
product and the market rewards them.

466
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,960
Go see it for yourself, support the show, and get $100.

467
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,440
It's linode.com slash coder.

468
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,920
Go there to get $100 for 60 days on a new account, and support the show, linode.com

469
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,200
slash coder.

470
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,840
We got some crazy stuff going down in Swift town.

471
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,240
They're integrating Objective C, oh wait, no.

472
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
They already did that.

473
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,200
Yeah, I was just going to try to trigger you somehow.

474
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,480
But no, actually, so we're looking like a serious, serious commitment to interoperability

475
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,660
with C++.

476
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:44,680
Like the foundation is adding like a whole wing to the group to make sure that they maintain

477
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
compatibility.

478
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
What are your thoughts on this?

479
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,200
This is a super pragmatic.

480
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,280
I think it's the right thing to do.

481
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,440
They're making an entire work group focused on this.

482
00:24:52,440 --> 00:25:01,600
You know, they want to import C++ APIs directly, which yeah, handle C++ standard lib types

483
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
negatively.

484
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,320
Swift is, oh my God, I'm going to throw up.

485
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,680
Swift is a nice language.

486
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
I have been writing some-

487
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
I'm sorry, what was that?

488
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
It's fine.

489
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
It's fine.

490
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,520
Could you imagine if I could time travel, play this clip?

491
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
It's fine.

492
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,560
You know, but you don't need to rewrite stuff.

493
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,440
And sometimes, you know, see, I saying that, I just like blew my mind out now.

494
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,160
I don't believe you.

495
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,160
That's younger you.

496
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,080
That's younger you not believing present you.

497
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,420
You know what?

498
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,920
It's like one of those really bad episodes of Star Trek where like old spot comes back

499
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,760
and it's like, you all suck.

500
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Let me save the day.

501
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
Yeah.

502
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,240
Let me save you young Captain Kirk from JJ Abrams.

503
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,760
You could static library your way to glory before, but this is just a very practical

504
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:52,860
thing to do because despite what Linus will tell you, C++ is not a bad language.

505
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,640
It is just suffering from being used for everything.

506
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,400
And there's a lot of code written in it.

507
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,760
And you might want to use that code, huh?

508
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,100
If you want to join the new wing of the Swift working group, you need to be prepared to

509
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,640
dedicate 50 minutes per week that you can use to discuss interoperability issues.

510
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,520
And you have to actively participate in the work related to Swift and C++ interoperability.

511
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,960
You got to either make code, write docs, review PRs, or at least provide design input if you

512
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,740
want to have a seat in the wing.

513
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,000
Or if you want to perhaps be less commercially successful, but more morally righteous, the

514
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,600
new step is still around.

515
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,400
What do you think this kind of means long-term for Swift?

516
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:42,200
Like not this, but this style of decision, this pragmatic style of decision.

517
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,920
So now let's take the time machine back, right?

518
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,320
Apple and the Swift team, I will give them credit.

519
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,420
How can I put this without starting a flame war?

520
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:58,720
Apple said Swift would be a true open source project, and it basically is, which I'm very

521
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
impressed with.

522
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Yeah.

523
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Okay.

524
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,440
However, they certainly have failed in being significant in server development.

525
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,960
Long time wishers will know I used to financially support the Vapor project, which is still

526
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,640
around and still good, but commercially not super viable, at least not with the type of

527
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
customers I deal with.

528
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,480
And that was a server side, right?

529
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,160
Server side, like a Sinatra or a Flask for Swift.

530
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:30,120
IBM had a deal with Apple to make server side Swift a thing, and that was an interesting

531
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,080
choice by both parties.

532
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,320
That did not work out.

533
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,280
So when you say, what does this mean for the future of Swift?

534
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,760
Well, I think it's a very nice language to work in.

535
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:49,960
If you are doing iOS or Mac development, and I don't understand why you would use it otherwise,

536
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,000
other than, you know, I use Objective-C sometimes for things that I probably don't need to.

537
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,120
Of course, if you like the language and it just makes you happy, sure.

538
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,240
But from a practical perspective, no, right?

539
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,240
Like I certainly don't think I could sell an end customer on a Swift web service or

540
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,560
a Swift, you know, piece of server side software, unless they're A, either the type of customer

541
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,960
who doesn't care, right?

542
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,980
Or B, I'm not even sure I would want to do that, now that I think about it, because it's

543
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,520
just not that huge of an ecosystem compared to, say, your Python, Ruby,.NET, Java, so

544
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,680
on and so forth.

545
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,940
It does seem, though, like it's a decision that a project that's operating like an autonomous

546
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,880
open source project would make, and that's fascinating.

547
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,600
Well, you know, for those people out there that are working that ecosystem, this is probably

548
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
great for them.

549
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,960
I will say, just like one more thing, right?

550
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,280
If you read the Swift forums, the developers are very sincere, right?

551
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
They love Swift.

552
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,240
They care a lot about Swift, and they want to be writing Swift.

553
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,100
So we are beyond the point where Swift is going to, like, die.

554
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:58,460
You know, we joke around about my love of Objective-C. I think Swift is going to have,

555
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,920
you know, in 10, 15 years, there is going to be a guy named Mike, not me, but a different

556
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,960
Mike, right, who's like, oh, they're canceling, they're changing my Swift into whatever the

557
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
new thing is.

558
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,160
And he's going to be a pain in the ass about it.

559
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
It's funny.

560
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,120
We got an email that I lost, because I'm an idiot, about PHP this week.

561
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,120
And the guy was asking me, do I really hate PHP?

562
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,520
I apologize that I don't remember your name, because I somehow, I don't know what I did

563
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,720
to the email.

564
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,980
Most of that's trolling, right?

565
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:30,400
But PHP at the time, let's say the early aughts, was basically a dumpster fire because of the

566
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,880
type of people writing it.

567
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,800
It was always, and I was working in startup land, so it was, you know, hackity hack, hack,

568
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
hack.

569
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
You know, but it's matured, right?

570
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
It still exists.

571
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Laravel's gotten really good.

572
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,600
Facebook, the evil, evil Facebook, has done a lot to make PHP better via the hip hop DM

573
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,500
and other things.

574
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,440
That's kind of what Swift is like.

575
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,600
There are passionate PHP open source developers.

576
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,080
There is a big company supporting PHP.

577
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,880
I mean, PHP is a little bigger than Swift, right?

578
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
A lot bigger.

579
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,680
I'm going to tell you right now, anybody who still thinks Apple's going to change their

580
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,320
mind on Swift is smoking crack.

581
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,320
The fight's over.

582
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,800
But it doesn't mean that Swift is just an Apple language.

583
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:15,480
If you enjoy writing it, you can certainly write command line applications for Unix.

584
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,920
I think they actually have Windows support, although I don't know why you would do that.

585
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,440
You could write server side applications.

586
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,920
It's just, again, it would be like me trying to sell someone on like an Objective C web

587
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
service.

588
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
You could do it.

589
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,760
I don't know who's buying that that knows they're buying it.

590
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
Yeah, right.

591
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
So more power to them.

592
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
I say good.

593
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,960
I'm glad they're actually thinking this way.

594
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,400
Well, speaking of Facebook, also known as Metta, not while I'm alive, boy, they had

595
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
a rough week.

596
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,680
Oh, my gosh.

597
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,000
Did you did you see their stock last week?

598
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,580
Did I see they dropped like their crypto is what it was.

599
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,120
That's oh, my God.

600
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,720
Let me explain to you what happened.

601
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
I saw it.

602
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
I took off my shirt.

603
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
I whipped out the Vaseline.

604
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Never mind.

605
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,380
Where were we going with this?

606
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,040
You always have as nearby.

607
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,320
Here's my theory on Facebook is they announced in their earnings report that Apple's iOS

608
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,240
privacy change with, you know, the first party tracking stuff.

609
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,520
It's going to cost Facebook ten billion dollars in 2022.

610
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,400
On top of that, a ten billion dollars.

611
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,800
So that tells you right there.

612
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,160
That's how much your information is worth.

613
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,440
If you're an iOS user to Facebook, all of y'all ten billion dollars.

614
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,240
So it's a big market.

615
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,840
And then at the same time, they also announced that they blew ten billion dollars trying

616
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,200
to build the metaverse so far seems awfully fast.

617
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,480
That's rough, man.

618
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,720
That's well, that also includes like new Oculus headset development and stuff like that.

619
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,720
So I guess.

620
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
OK, hardware is expensive.

621
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
Yeah.

622
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,720
Yeah.

623
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,840
But still, Wall Street sees you blew ten billion on on this and you're going to lose ten billion

624
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,920
on that.

625
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:57,080
And your and your new user signups are down.

626
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,680
Stock price crashes.

627
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,040
And I think it's just as simple as that is this is why I think they're so desperate on

628
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:09,520
this whole meta angle is they know that their Facebook ad revenue is going to go down.

629
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,040
They're at war with every major legacy media company that's ever existed over it.

630
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,640
And you know, one major political party in the United States.

631
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,080
But hey, whatever they took it on the nose so bad over the elections.

632
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,320
Go Google how much money actually was spent on on ads on Facebook for the election.

633
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,320
It's fascinating.

634
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,600
It's a bit of a straw man.

635
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,120
But you know, so this just that's rough.

636
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,800
So you and I had like a disagreement here.

637
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Yeah.

638
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,460
I mean, I'm not saying they're committing accounting fraud because they're not right.

639
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,020
But remember my space barely?

640
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,200
Is this not just the way of things?

641
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,240
Because like, I'm a dad, you're a dad.

642
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,000
We're both pretty boring now.

643
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,280
Maybe I'm speaking out of turn, but I'm pretty boring.

644
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Yeah.

645
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,560
You know, my primarily use Facebook because one, if you have a business and you don't

646
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,360
have a Facebook, weird local business organizations think you're not real, which is a whole nother

647
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
problem.

648
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
Yep.

649
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,840
But basically, to share pictures of my son with my aunties back in New Jersey, ironically,

650
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,660
the green bubble problem did hit me several times, but a picture wouldn't load correctly

651
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,160
to the to like the two ants that have Android.

652
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,200
Oh, it comes home.

653
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,480
I once offered to buy one of them an iPhone just so I could avoid that problem.

654
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,320
So maybe I should back down on the green bubble thing.

655
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,160
I don't know, like, you know what?

656
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,560
I'm aware of teenagers when lives in my house.

657
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,400
They don't use Facebook.

658
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,320
They use what's the Chinese one?

659
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,320
Oh, yeah.

660
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,240
The tick tock, tick tock, right.

661
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,960
And Snapchat, which I honestly thought was out of business.

662
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
It is tick tock.

663
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
It's tick tock, right?

664
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,040
That's the that's the one where they're always dancing and crap, right?

665
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Yeah.

666
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,360
And Zuckerberg, I think I guess it had an all hands meeting and they he instructed the

667
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,520
team a whole whole wide company like your all of company focus should be on quick video

668
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,520
because tech talks eating us alive and that seems like a super sound decision for him

669
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
to make.

670
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
Right.

671
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Like, I don't know.

672
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,800
I feel like this is kind of the cycle we've seen of these platforms.

673
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,160
I mean, LiveJournal was a thing back in the day.

674
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,720
Tumblr was until Yahoo bought it because Yahoo is cursed by the pharaohs to never be successful

675
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
at anything.

676
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,120
So you have to sell yourself to Verizon.

677
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,180
You know what it is, because they made the deal with those early BSD guys.

678
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,180
The devil.

679
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,180
Yes.

680
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,180
Right.

681
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,180
I wish we could.

682
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:31,160
OK, our younger listeners, let's say if you're below 25, 30, are you using Facebook to share

683
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,000
content or consume content with your peer group?

684
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,400
I'm not talking about aunties.

685
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
I'm not right.

686
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
I'm talking about.

687
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,480
Hey, bro, let's go chug some.

688
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,100
I don't know how kids talk today.

689
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,320
They have to have a Facebook account if they want to log into their Oculus.

690
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Oh, really?

691
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Do you really?

692
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
Yeah.

693
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
Yeah.

694
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,280
If you want to get hooked to a fake, you got to have a Facebook account to use the Oculus.

695
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,360
That's one way to juice numbers, I guess.

696
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
I know.

697
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,800
And their numbers are still down, even though the Oculus had like its best year ever.

698
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,320
I feel like that makes it worse.

699
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,880
It does, dude.

700
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,880
It's rough, man.

701
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
All right.

702
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
So I don't know.

703
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
I'm being long winded.

704
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,200
But I feel like this is just the natural cycle and Facebook's not cool for the kids anymore.

705
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
You're right.

706
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,440
The only thing that's different here is that people pretend to like that Facebook wasn't

707
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,200
going to be part of the cycle.

708
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,780
Like, I guess they just figured it's going to be king forever and not that it's dying,

709
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,440
but I'm sure it is natural for something else like TikTok to come along.

710
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,320
I just want to say one more thing, right?

711
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,280
On Facebook, the content that gets serviced to me the most is liberal auntie and Trumpy

712
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,160
auntie going at it because that's like all Facebook is.

713
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,600
My relatives my age or older just yelling at each other.

714
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,480
One's got her MSNBC clip ready.

715
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,920
One's got her Fox News.

716
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,480
You know, for me, it's actually been so it's been so liberating when I go see family and

717
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,800
they tell me about something and I can always just say, you know, I don't use Facebook.

718
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
So I didn't see that.

719
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
I'm sorry.

720
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Oh, it's so great.

721
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
It's like a superpower.

722
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,560
I'm so jealous right now.

723
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,360

Datadog.com slash Coder Radio and happy monitoring.

742
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,600
Speaking of Apple, bane of Facebook's existence, they have put the details out there for this

743
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,000
dating app situation in the Netherlands.

744
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,960
So it looks like after you pay 3% to your payment processor, if you're lucky, it's low

745
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
at 3%.

746
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:34,640
You're lucky for 3% and you pay 27% to Apple, which you still have to pay, you're right

747
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,680
back at 30% buddy.

748
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,680
Yeah.

749
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,920
Only to punish you, Apple forces you to create a separate app that's only available in the

750
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Netherlands.

751
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,680
It cannot also do any in app purchases.

752
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,080
It must display a scary sheet.

753
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
It's bad.

754
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:58,720
That says that this isn't using Apple's secure system and it also restricts how you can link

755
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,340
out to your website, even though that's always been a problem and you have to submit monthly

756
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,200
reports to Apple on every external transaction.

757
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,980
And that is my favorite.

758
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,960
And they have the right to audit you.

759
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,680
So Apple is the IRS now too.

760
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
Well, it's the EU.

761
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,680
By the way, you know who actually wrote the Apple policy for this?

762
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,620
Oh no, I don't.

763
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,040
They contracted out to Victoria Nuland.

764
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
You got her.

765
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
I get her every time.

766
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
That's amazing.

767
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,680
Do you have it like on a sticky note, like on your screen or something, or are you just

768
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
remembering?

769
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Wow.

770
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,920
Any time my kid does something stupid, I just put on my headphones, my AirPod Max, because

771
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,480
I pay my Apple tax and I listen to a glorious clip that somebody sent me.

772
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,960
Somebody will not be named.

773
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,880
Man, that's amazing.

774
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,480
The commission that's like doing this is called the ACM.

775
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,360
They said they're going to continue to find Apple five million euros per week up to a

776
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,880
maximum of 50 million.

777
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,400
That's less than they spend on vodka for lunch, but keep going.

778
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Yeah.

779
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,520
I mean, if it's only going to go up to 50, why would Apple even bother?

780
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
Just pay the 50.

781
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,480
I mean, I feel like it's not even a fine if it's just kind of a tax at this point.

782
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,000
Apple's so rich they don't care.

783
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Okay.

784
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Did you did the page?

785
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,520
Yeah, the little tear sheet that make you put up.

786
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,840
I know this is an audio show.

787
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:22,640
If you're driving when you get home or to work, wherever you're going, you have to read

788
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,680
the page and the tear sheet that make you put up.

789
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,360
It's horrible.

790
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,440
This app does not support the app store's private and secure payment system, implying

791
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,720
that your app is not private or secure.

792
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,880
I mean, it's like they just threw the finger up and we're like, here you go.

793
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
I don't know.

794
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
I love this.

795
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:48,200
The thing I like about this is because I'm a Twitter troll and I really enjoy I don't

796
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,640
know if you've been paying attention, but all the Apple fanboys heads are exploding

797
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,880
because they just realized that while Apple is super happy to put up like the disadvantaged

798
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,080
people who made an iPhone app and got out of poverty, they're really just a company

799
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,080
trying to make lots of money.

800
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,080
I'm for that.

801
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
I think that's okay.

802
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Yeah.

803
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,620
I just don't like the hypocrisy of being like, oh, look at all the different peoples and

804
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,960
oh my God, this kid made an app.

805
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,480
The whole video section of WWDC where they play that heartwarming intro video.

806
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,560
Let's get rid of that and show me your goddamn, I don't think it's called the K1 if they're

807
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,400
a C-corp, but whatever.

808
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,800
I want to see a PNL, right?

809
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
That's what I want.

810
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800
Yeah.

811
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,960
But like kids running in the field during golden hour makes me feel great about Apple.

812
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Come on.

813
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
If you're stupid.

814
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
I don't know.

815
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,440
This is so great.

816
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,080
When you go through the documentation and we'll have a link to the support page at Apple's

817
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:51,040
website where you can read about this, when you go through it all, it just reeks with

818
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,160
disdain for having to even do this.

819
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:00,560
Apple just clearly is dragging their feet and they are making it as painful as possible.

820
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,840
They are being vindictive.

821
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,880
They are a nearly $2 trillion company that is being petulant.

822
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,880
I love it.

823
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,880
Over this.

824
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,800
I'm here for it.

825
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
This is the right response.

826
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,320
In fact, this is, I mean, people say that Apple went downhill from Steve Jobs.

827
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,120
This is restrained from what he would have done.

828
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,120
That's true.

829
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,120
Yeah.

830
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,480
Is that the Netherlands?

831
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Is that like a state?

832
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,560
I just feel like I don't care.

833
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,520
You know, I have to say in the last couple of months I have noticed Microsoft and Apple

834
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,760
are getting very aggressive again.

835
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,300
Like it came out that Microsoft been like the puppet master behind Epic secretly backing

836
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,800
people to sue Apple.

837
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
Yeah.

838
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,040
And Microsoft playing hard licensing games in other countries like that don't speak English

839
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,180
natively so it doesn't get reported on a lot, but they're over there playing hardball right

840
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,840
now in a way they haven't done in years.

841
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:57,820
There's a lot going on these days that these, these sleeping giants really feel like they're

842
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,520
waking up and starting to throw their weight around.

843
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,880
There's almost a weird generational story here, right?

844
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,080
Where Apple just kneecap the Facebook, right?

845
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
And it's back.

846
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,080
You know what?

847
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,320
Uncle Tim and uncle Satya have been calm for a little while.

848
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,000
Now they're not playing anymore.

849
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,160
Google continues to cancel services like it's going out of style.

850
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,280
I mean, I feel like Microsoft, we're, we're going back to the nineties, right?

851
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,080
Microsoft and Apple are just going to be the big dogs.

852
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,800
Speaking of Google, you knew it was coming.

853
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,240
It still hurts for me to say it though.

854
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,300
It looks like Google is starting to wrap up Stadia, at least the consumer facing part

855
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,320
of it.

856
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,280
This has been reported everywhere, but a new report claims that Google is trying to salvage

857
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:49,400
what's left of Stadia by not focusing on consumer video games, but instead looking to make deals

858
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,920
with companies like Peloton to create quote, playable experiences and quote, online demos.

859
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,920
Sure.

860
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,920
That's not going to work.

861
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:03,320
And according to the report, it's like a small crew of people that don't have a lot of power

862
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:08,480
inside Google that are scrambling every day to keep it available to consumers, to keep

863
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,760
it going.

864
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,340
They say, quote, there are folks who still believe in the dream of playing stuff like

865
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,180
cyberpunk 2077 on your phone.

866
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:21,240
But one person who spoke to Business Insider estimated that only 20% of the focus now is

867
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,260
on the gaming side of Stadia.

868
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,360
But do you know who really does believe you should be able to play cyberpunk on your phone?

869
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360
Who?

870
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,360
Microsoft.

871
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,360
That's true.

872
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,360
Go to Microsoft.

873
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,360
What are you guys doing?

874
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,360
Yeah.

875
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,120
I mean, as a Linux user, the thing I liked about Stadia is that it's all Linux on the

876
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
back end.

877
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,600
So for the game developers to use Stadia, their game needed to work on Linux.

878
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,600
So was Azure.

879
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,600
I don't know though.

880
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,040
The Xbox ones, I don't know what they're using.

881
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,040
I don't know.

882
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,360
I mean, bitch, it's a hodgepodge.

883
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,360
I bet you it's Windows.

884
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,360
Yeah, I bet.

885
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,560
I mean, I could even see they have some Xbox boards or something, right?

886
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,560
Something sitting on a rack.

887
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,560
Yeah, why not?

888
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,560
Why not just rack them up?

889
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
True.

890
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,560
Yeah.

891
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,560
I mean, you're right.

892
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,880
Google is, just as Microsoft is getting its game together, as we've just seen with the

893
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,880
acquisition of Blizzard Activision, Microsoft is really getting their streaming game.

894
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,240
They have so many titles.

895
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,240
They are so the Disney Plus now of video game streaming, but they haven't executed yet.

896
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,840
They haven't brought it all together.

897
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,480
And there's no guarantee Microsoft will.

898
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,440
They have good momentum, but they screw this kind of stuff up all the time.

899
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
I don't know, man.

900
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,300
I just was playing Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, which is a slave's flattery to the classic

901
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,680
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 from the arcade.

902
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
In their stream setup?

903
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,240
Yeah, in Chrome on my Mac.

904
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,240
Oh, okay.

905
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,720
You know, I got stuck on a very, very dumb recursion bug that I definitely didn't write

906
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,720
myself.

907
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,680
Yeah, it was me.

908
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,400
And I just popped open Chrome.

909
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,440
I can do it in Safari, but it seems to work better in Chrome for reasons.

910
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:55,400
Plugged in an Xbox 360 controller that I still have because, yay, wired is easier than Bluetooth.

911
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,600
And yeah, I played a couple rounds.

912
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,560
It was, I mean, I mean, I don't know why we're doing game reviews now, but we are.

913
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,880
I feel like the old version was better, but it has nothing to do with the streaming service,

914
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,880
right?

915
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,920
It's a fighting game, which requires pretty good latency.

916
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:17,480
Granted, I do have Fios, so that might make this a bit easier for a lot of folks listening.

917
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,280
So like you, I pre-ordered the Steam Deck, and I'm wondering why I'm spending another

918
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,200
like $500, $600.

919
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,480
The thing about the streaming service is they, I feel like they still have a lot of skepticism,

920
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,480
but I've been really happy.

921
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,480
I've tried Stadia.

922
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,720
I've tried GeForce streaming now.

923
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,800
And I did try the Microsoft one, but when I signed up for the beta, they didn't yet

924
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,140
have web browser streaming yet.

925
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,600
So I didn't get to try that.

926
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,160
It's funny.

927
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,800
So the one weakness is Microsoft accounts are just as dumb as Google accounts.

928
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,640
And I have to have like an instance of Chrome that is only my, that Microsoft account, because

929
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,600
my personal is my gaming one.

930
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
But I don't know, man.

931
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:03,280
I think, I feel like this is in fact the future if the FCC can ever get, you know, fiber optics

932
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,280
everywhere.

933
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,640
Well, you can actually do it over Starlink.

934
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,640
I've done this game streaming over Starlink.

935
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,960
How much does that cost?

936
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,720
Starlink is 99 bucks a month.

937
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,720
That's not horrible.

938
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,720
No.

939
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,720
And I'm getting like 200 megabits.

940
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,720
It's not bad.

941
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,720
Ooh, really?

942
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,720
Yeah.

943
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,520
The trick is if you have any obstructions, then your latency and your connection goes

944
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,760
down and then it's not so great.

945
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,960
What if you live in basically a prehistoric landscape?

946
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,560
Do you have a clear shot to the sky?

947
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,360
When the pterodactyls aren't flying?

948
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,360
Yes.

949
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:38,440
In fact, they just announced Starlink Pro, which is fricking 550 bucks a month, but you

950
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,720
get 500 megabits down and even lower latency because it's a dish with even more points

951
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,720
of contact.

952
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,720
It's a dish?

953
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
Starlink, yeah.

954
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,920
It connects up to their low orbit satellites.

955
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,680
So we have a R&D budget, right?

956
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,680
Right.

957
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,680
Of course.

958
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,680
Of course.

959
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,680
I need two different connections.

960
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,800
I mean, so far we've just been spending it on these crypto developers who are supposedly

961
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,280
billing us a cryptocurrency, but I don't know, it's been two years and they haven't released

962
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
anything yet.

963
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,440
By the way, where is my Jar Jar NFT people?

964
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,440
I know.

965
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,440
I know.

966
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,520
I know you guys, but nothing and smoke and mirrors.

967
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,920
So you were a Stadia user.

968
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,120
Are you going to jump ship to xCloud or whatever it's called?

969
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,120
I think so.

970
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,880
After seeing this, I, you know, and I, you always knew it was sad, too.

971
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,240
And this is a real problem, I think, for Google.

972
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,440
When they launched it, I knew they were going to kill it.

973
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,440
Google Wave.

974
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
Yep.

975
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,440
You knew they're going to wave it.

976
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,120
And I only bought one game and I bought that game when I got a gift card.

977
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,120
Oh, that's right.

978
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,240
Oh, God, you had to buy the games.

979
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,000
Oh, it sucks.

980
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,520
And who's going to who's going to go buy $60 games a pop when, you know, Google is just

981
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,640
going to kill this thing.

982
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,260
So I'd never really invested in it, even though I think it is the best of the experiences

983
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,260
so far.

984
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:53,680
I think you should download edge because apparently it's better and give give the xCloud a shot.

985
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,680
I've been meaning to.

986
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,680
So I will.

987
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah, I was just sad to see it go because I loved the idea that game developers were,

988
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,080
you know, it was one more pressure point to get game developers to get their games working

989
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,080
on Linux.

990
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:10,640
Ultimately, what I love about these streaming services is I can just stop caring about the

991
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,560
GPU in my hardware, in my laptop or in my desktop.

992
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:18,120
I mean, I still like having it in a desktop, but in a laptop, you don't have to make that

993
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:24,600
decision of do I want to compromise battery life and and heat, but have a GPU?

994
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,360
Or do I want to have good battery life and low heat, but never be able to game like that's

995
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,560
just or like, do I want to get a Mac?

996
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:38,080
But there's no games for the M1 platform except for the arcade, like now that just totally

997
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,840
abstracts that whole decision, your platform, your architecture, it's all abstracted away

998
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,540
and you just stream the game from Microsoft's servers and they will be upgrading GPUs for

999
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,160
years and you don't have to worry about it.

1000
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,180
Microsoft is not getting a lot of fanfare for this, but I actually just tried it this

1001
00:48:54,180 --> 00:49:01,600
week streaming a Windows desktop via Azure is significantly better than the alternatives.

1002
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,860
Yeah, because they're probably using RDP, right, which is pretty robust.

1003
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:08,760
I have no idea what they're using and they have little presets.

1004
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,520
I had a visual studio set up, I had to install my own weird libraries, but I was rocking

1005
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,280
in the free world and you can pay more or less depending on what you need.

1006
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,780
But yeah, interesting if you're if you're living that M1 life and you need Windows for

1007
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,720
stuff as I do, that's something.

1008
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:31,720
The other streaming thing is we do a lot of negativity on indie development on the show

1009
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,720
instead of love.

1010
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,260
Indie devs are like, I feel like I'm that last Japanese soldier who didn't realize the

1011
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,340
war was lost, kind of crying.

1012
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,640
It's me and the rogue Amoeba dude and you to a point.

1013
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,640
Indie game development.

1014
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:50,200
I mean, eventually it's going to be bad because we're consolidating everything, but look at

1015
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,400
what's happened to independent film production, particularly documentary production because

1016
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,240
of Netflix and Disney Plus and other services who are smaller, right?

1017
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,240
Right.

1018
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,240
What has happened?

1019
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,760
There is so much more opportunity to produce more films for smaller budgets, but with smaller

1020
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:12,520
scopes and for unknown actors, for unknown directors, unknown playwrights, or I'm sorry,

1021
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,520
screen playwrights.

1022
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,520
Right, right.

1023
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,240
So you could say the same for YouTube and podcasting as well, but I see what you're

1024
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:22,680
saying like Netflix flip, flips the bill or fits what's what Netflix flips the bill fits

1025
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,680
the bill.

1026
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,680
What's that?

1027
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,680
I think it's fits, fits the bill, but I write the checks.

1028
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,680
Yeah.

1029
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,680
I would argue one podcasting.

1030
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,040
I don't even want to touch the Spotify thing cause I don't know what the hell they're doing,

1031
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,600
but I feel like the YouTube is, is like the bad version of this though.

1032
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,600
Right?

1033
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,360
Like I don't know anybody who does YouTube creation that doesn't feel like they're in

1034
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,880
a horrible abusive relationship with YouTube.

1035
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,880
Yeah.

1036
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,160
And if you are someone who likes it, tell me.

1037
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,720
No, they're not out there.

1038
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,720
They're not.

1039
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,720
I don't think they exist.

1040
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,720
No, it's a machine.

1041
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,720
Right.

1042
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,960
And I sponsor people who do YouTube stuff.

1043
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,680
So I, and just based on like how willing, how easy it is to buy sponsorships, by the

1044
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,520
way, if you own a small business, forget about Facebook, find some independent creators that

1045
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:07,600
talk to people that you want to talk to you like Jupiter broadcasting, buy some ads, seriously.

1046
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,160
It's the way to go.

1047
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,000
I've never been more bullish on indie game development.

1048
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,280
Now I'm, I'm actually writing a game myself.

1049
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,840
I call it Newlands quest.

1050
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,400
Oh my gosh.

1051
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,400
Really?

1052
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,400
This looks exciting.

1053
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,040
I got the perfect intro song for you too.

1054
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
I bet you do.

1055
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,040
There you go.

1056
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,040
You just play that in there, you know?

1057
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,040
Yeah.

1058
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:43,800
And you know, I've got a great voiceover from Nigel Farage, weirdly not available in the

1059
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,800
EU.

1060
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:50,400
But kidding aside, seriously, if you are thinking of making an indie game, and I know that iPad

1061
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,460
money is, is, is, is the, is tempting as hell.

1062
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,460
Think about it.

1063
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:59,560
Just think about what if you thought about Linux as a native platform that your game

1064
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:04,720
ran on, not to be installed as an RPM or a Deb, Debian package, right?

1065
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:11,300
To run in a cloud environment, I Azure or whatever the Amazon Luna, is it, they call

1066
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,300
it Luna?

1067
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,300
Yes.

1068
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,300
I think you're right.

1069
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:22,040
Because that's, you know what, you hit, you target one platform really well and you're

1070
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,040
everywhere.

1071
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,600
I mean, I've, I've even done the experiment.

1072
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:29,360
I think there's problems with it, but I've taken my iPad, Bluetooth it in a controller

1073
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,880
and played X cloud on that.

1074
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,680
I did that with the G force now streaming.

1075
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,680
It does work pretty good.

1076
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,680
Well, all right.

1077
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,560
Should we stop talking about gaming now?

1078
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,560
Yes.

1079
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,560
With apologies to Brussels.

1080
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,000
Also, I want to mention that Coderly is out for our members.

1081
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,960
So if you are a member at coderqa.co or at Jupiter.party, the Coderly report is out.

1082
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,960
It's just in your feeds.

1083
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,360
It's also available in the members download area if you want to log in and just grab it

1084
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,580
that way.

1085
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,520
But if you become a member and subscribe to one of our member feeds, you get it.

1086
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,240
Plus, you also get every episode of Coder Radio ad free and you're supporting the show.

1087
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,600
So thank you to our members out there, Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send

1088
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,600
the people this week?

1089
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,600
Yeah, sure.

1090
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:13,000
My name is Dominic M.com and if you are a Python developer in Florida, you should call

1091
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
me.

1092
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Nice.

1093
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Nice.

1094
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,600
The secret, the superpower, superpower right there.

1095
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,440
You just got to figure out how to track them down.

1096
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,280
But we always, of course, have links in the show notes.

1097
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,620
I'm on the Twitter too at Chris LAS.

1098
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:30,160
We also have the telegram group for the network at Jupiter broadcasting.com telegram.

1099
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,040
And in fact, there is even a Coder Radio feedback matrix chat.

1100
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,040
God, there is.

1101
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,040
Yeah.

1102
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,720
It's super big, but I'm starting to watch it so that way if somebody leaves something

1103
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,240
in there, I can, you know, loop it into the show for us.

1104
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,200
Got my eyes on it.

1105
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,200
That's over there, too.

1106
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,560
We'd love to have you join us live.

1107
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:51,440
We do the show Monday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern, and then it's usually out for download

1108
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,480

1109
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,760

1110
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,760

00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:12,960
We'll see you right back here next week.
