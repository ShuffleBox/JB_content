My name is Chris and joining us every single week, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.600
Hello, Mike.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.800
Hey, I'm happy to be on the Blaze.

00:49.800 --> 00:50.800
Thank you so much, Chris.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.800
Yeah.

00:51.800 --> 00:52.800
Yeah.

00:52.800 --> 01:00.480
This is our new exclusive right-wing streaming service where we unintentionally upset people.

01:00.480 --> 01:05.240
Can we call it the no spin zone or is Papa Bear or Riley going to sue the shit out of

01:05.240 --> 01:06.240
us?

01:06.240 --> 01:07.240
Yeah, sure.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.240
You know, he's still going.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.240
Is he really?

01:09.240 --> 01:15.000
You know, that old coot is still, he's got like, he talked some YouTuber into helping

01:15.000 --> 01:20.360
him out with some setup and the production quality, like the lighting and the cameras

01:20.360 --> 01:21.360
are not...

01:21.360 --> 01:22.360
It's got to be bad.

01:22.360 --> 01:23.360
They're not good.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.560
Well, it's weird because like Glenn Beck faced the same problem, but he's like, yo,

01:26.560 --> 01:27.560
I got my whole network.

01:27.560 --> 01:28.560
Now I'm good.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.760
I feel like Bill Wright is just like a little too old, I hate to say it, but...

01:31.760 --> 01:38.720
It is wild how many different streaming platforms and services and et cetera are out there today.

01:38.720 --> 01:44.920
Like, I was thinking about this last night as we were watching a Star Trek Lower Decks

01:44.920 --> 01:45.920
with the kids.

01:45.920 --> 01:46.920
Nice.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.480
And you know, that's a CBS all access show.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.240
Yeah, it is.

01:50.240 --> 01:55.360
And we're sitting there watching it and we can just pull this up whenever we want it.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.320
There's no commercials.

01:57.320 --> 02:00.960
There's no like waiting around until Thursday night when it airs.

02:00.960 --> 02:05.520
And then we, you know, or like when I was a kid, if I wanted to see a cartoon, I'd have

02:05.520 --> 02:06.760
to watch it Saturday morning.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.200
That was when I was going to watch cartoons.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.560
Like they don't have to do any of that now.

02:10.560 --> 02:15.140
I literally had this conversation with my son and he looked at me in a state of, I can

02:15.140 --> 02:20.720
only describe it as confounded horror, that there was a time when one could not just simply

02:20.720 --> 02:24.440
watch whatever, you know, insert your kid's favorite cartoon here, right?

02:24.440 --> 02:25.440
Right.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.440
At On Demand.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.440
He's like, but Dad, Netflix.

02:27.440 --> 02:31.480
I'm like, okay, there was no Netflix.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.680
Brace yourself for this.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.960
There was no YouTube either.

02:34.960 --> 02:35.960
You know, like...

02:35.960 --> 02:36.960
He is not allowed on YouTube.

02:36.960 --> 02:37.960
But yes.

02:37.960 --> 02:38.960
Good call.

02:38.960 --> 02:39.960
But you know, it's a funny reaction.

02:39.960 --> 02:44.240
Like when I stay in a hotel room with the kids and the TV comes on and we're watching

02:44.240 --> 02:47.720
something and then it breaks for commercial and the kids are just like, what the hell

02:47.720 --> 02:48.720
is this?

02:48.720 --> 02:52.800
I've also had to have the conversation explaining the concept of a commercial.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.800
Yeah.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.800
Yeah.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.800
Pretty funny.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.800
But I enjoy it.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.800
We love our sponsors.

02:57.800 --> 02:58.800
That's true.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.160
And I just started watching the Ted Lasso because everybody's been going on about the

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
Ted Lasso.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.160
Oh, how is it?

03:04.160 --> 03:05.160
I haven't seen it yet.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.160
It's good.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.160
Is it really?

03:07.160 --> 03:08.160
So frustratingly good.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.160
Yes.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.680
I really don't want to pay for Apple TV Plus.

03:10.680 --> 03:11.680
I know.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.680
Because you know, it's getting out of hand.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.680
And I don't need another damn show.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.680
Yeah.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.520
But like, I have to pay for Picard because the world hates me, which is I think, is that

03:18.520 --> 03:19.520
the CBS one too?

03:19.520 --> 03:20.520
Yeah.

03:20.520 --> 03:21.520
Yeah.

03:21.520 --> 03:27.160
I pay for Peacock because I must have been drunk and just paid for Peacock.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.440
I wanted all of the law and order apparently.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.160
I honestly don't know why I have Peacock when I have Hulu.

03:32.160 --> 03:35.720
And I pay for like the super Cadillac Hulu because I like soccer.

03:35.720 --> 03:40.240
And apparently if you're in the US, you need to pay more money to like soccer.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.240
Oh, geez.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.720
Then you'd really like the Ted Lasso show.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.760
He's a soccer coach, right?

03:44.760 --> 03:45.760
Isn't that the whole?

03:45.760 --> 03:46.760
That's why I resisted it.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.760
Because it was sports.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.760
Yeah.

03:48.760 --> 03:49.760
Yeah.

03:49.760 --> 03:50.760
Yep.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.120
Well, if you ever notice, I'm a little wild on Twitter on Saturdays talking about how

03:52.120 --> 03:56.760
much Manchester United sucks because it's all about Chelsea.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.040
I'll leave it there.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.040
Sports ball.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.040
Man, sports, huh?

04:01.040 --> 04:02.360
It gets me so riled up.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.360
I know.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.800
Chris is like, let me tell you something.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.640
Linux Mint is going to win the NHL Stanley Cup.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.840
Man, I'd love to see that.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.440
Then they're going to pitch a perfect game while dunking on Shaq.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.440
Boom.

04:14.440 --> 04:19.280
I'm just waiting for a NASCAR, a NASCAR car to come racing by with a Linux logo on there,

04:19.280 --> 04:20.560
like a distro logo.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.560
You know what?

04:21.560 --> 04:23.760
I'm going to throw it down here.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.760
System 76.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.400
It's time to get into the NASCAR game.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.400
Oh, yeah.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.400
Yeah.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.400
They seem like big NASCAR folks.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.400
Oh, yeah.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.200
Oh, they definitely do.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.200
You want to know something adorable?

04:33.200 --> 04:36.220
That's the last thing I'll say about my kids.

04:36.220 --> 04:40.420
But you know, we took the kids with us on the Denver road trip to see everybody.

04:40.420 --> 04:41.840
And we brought them to the meetup.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.600
That was great.

04:43.600 --> 04:48.760
And we had a listener, Mike, show up and really great guy, like, you know, the kind of listener,

04:48.760 --> 04:51.580
like it's just it's so cool to meet people like listener Mike.

04:51.580 --> 04:54.800
And he turned out to be a Cessna pilot.

04:54.800 --> 05:00.120
And he also offered to take a bunch of us up for a couple of hours on a scenic tour

05:00.120 --> 05:01.780
of Denver in his Cessna.

05:01.780 --> 05:05.100
And I got to bring Dylan with me.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.260
And you know, it was a great experience.

05:07.260 --> 05:11.340
But I'm not kidding you if the bigger impression for Dylan might not have been when Carl from

05:11.340 --> 05:15.000
system 76 took Dylan around in his Tesla.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.860
Dylan's mind was blown by the Tesla and he got to turn on the fart whoopee cushion settings

05:19.860 --> 05:22.520
and he got to see it in the rainbow road mode.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.460
And I mean, Carl was such a sport.

05:25.460 --> 05:31.280
He took he took both Dylan and Abby out for a spin in his Model 3.

05:31.280 --> 05:35.520
And I think that was probably the highlight of Dylan's road trip.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.340
That was awesome and also I did not know there was a rainbow road mode.

05:38.340 --> 05:40.660
Yeah, just like, yeah, from like Mario Kart.

05:40.660 --> 05:41.660
No, that's awesome.

05:41.660 --> 05:42.660
Yeah.

05:42.660 --> 05:49.100
So last week we set a small part of the Internet on fire unintentionally.

05:49.100 --> 05:53.780
And you know, this is a tricky one for us because I know I blew it in one way and a

05:53.780 --> 06:00.080
big way is I get really caught up in the practical aspect of the situation.

06:00.080 --> 06:05.340
Like we were talking about fair pay and we were talking about that slack channel that

06:05.340 --> 06:06.980
Apple shut down.

06:06.980 --> 06:10.380
And I just sort of had this natural reaction of like, yeah, of course Apple did that.

06:10.380 --> 06:11.380
Right.

06:11.380 --> 06:15.780
And of course, Apple doesn't want you using a company slack channel to talk about pay.

06:15.780 --> 06:19.840
I don't think I did a good job of articulating it from the worker standpoint.

06:19.840 --> 06:24.420
So I know I can totally understand why people who are dealing with this issue right now

06:24.420 --> 06:27.980
at their workplace would get super upset.

06:27.980 --> 06:33.820
But I kind of feel like some people when they got so upset, missed an opportunity to hear

06:33.820 --> 06:40.020
this from a business owner's standpoint, which is a valuable perspective, I think, for people

06:40.020 --> 06:45.560
who are negotiating better pay to understand it, like when we talked about it last week,

06:45.560 --> 06:48.580
I think we were very much thinking about it in the way an Apple executive would think

06:48.580 --> 06:49.620
about it.

06:49.620 --> 06:53.500
It's a business owner mentality versus a worker mentality.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.220
And I think that is actually the core of the conflict.

06:55.220 --> 06:57.660
Yeah, it's a hassle and you kind of don't want to deal with it.

06:57.660 --> 06:58.660
Right.

06:58.660 --> 06:59.660
Yeah.

06:59.660 --> 07:00.660
Right.

07:00.660 --> 07:01.660
For the business owner.

07:01.660 --> 07:02.660
Right.

07:02.660 --> 07:03.660
Yeah.

07:03.660 --> 07:09.060
So let me just on this subject, some were constructive, others were less.

07:09.060 --> 07:10.060
And this is what I'm saying.

07:10.060 --> 07:11.660
Like, I think maybe an opportunity was missed here.

07:11.660 --> 07:16.980
Like Chris B wrote that he fired a podcast to hear a usually interesting code of radio.

07:16.980 --> 07:21.620
But what he heard instead was some bizarre far right extreme political triad sounding

07:21.620 --> 07:25.820
like a radio broadcast from the dying days of the Weimar Republic.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.220
Employees are actually fully purchased property of their own employer.

07:29.220 --> 07:33.220
Anyone who doesn't want to work to the death of the industry is a traitor to the fatherland.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.300
Seriously, off the rails, guys.

07:35.300 --> 07:38.900
OK, so one, no one mentioned slavery.

07:38.900 --> 07:45.780
Like I just like if some Chris, I'm sure you're sincere, but I obviously don't think slavery

07:45.780 --> 07:46.780
is good.

07:46.780 --> 07:47.780
Right.

07:47.780 --> 07:50.020
No, I would not be surprised to hear that.

07:50.020 --> 07:52.420
Nor am I a fan of fascist German governments.

07:52.420 --> 07:57.900
So my point was like and actually there was another email that you didn't highlight in

07:57.900 --> 08:00.900
the doc here that actually sort of changed my mind.

08:00.900 --> 08:01.900
Right.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.580
And I think I kind of pissed off the folks more.

08:04.580 --> 08:06.580
It's funny because like what I preach is not what I practice, right?

08:06.580 --> 08:10.060
People who work, you know, at TMB can talk about their salary.

08:10.060 --> 08:14.180
It's kind of lame because we all have basically the same salary, but just do it by your experience.

08:14.180 --> 08:19.180
So I do that because I don't want to be accused of like prejudice or whatever.

08:19.180 --> 08:25.780
I realized like for years I've been talking about how folks I won't name names, but large

08:25.780 --> 08:32.100
consulting companies that you have definitely heard of abuse the H1B system to the detriment

08:32.100 --> 08:35.020
of the H1B recipients, right?

08:35.020 --> 08:37.060
To lower wages on all people.

08:37.060 --> 08:41.740
This is something we covered a lot back in the day on the show when it was happening.

08:41.740 --> 08:45.020
Years ago when Disney, yeah.

08:45.020 --> 08:48.300
And I realized that and someone sent me a nice message pointing out that there is an

08:48.300 --> 08:53.420
internal kind of logical inconsistency in my arguments.

08:53.420 --> 08:57.280
Basically like you and I have what, like, I mean, whatever less, I think we both have

08:57.280 --> 08:59.580
less than like 10 employees, right?

08:59.580 --> 09:00.580
Yeah.

09:00.580 --> 09:04.900
So it's not like we're robber barons with like 400 people digging, you know, laying

09:04.900 --> 09:06.420
railroad track.

09:06.420 --> 09:11.060
We're closer to the worker side of life, particularly me, right?

09:11.060 --> 09:13.260
Because I sell development services effectively.

09:13.260 --> 09:14.260
Yeah, for sure.

09:14.260 --> 09:19.180
I do think it's bad when people like when Apple and Adobe and Microsoft or I can't,

09:19.180 --> 09:22.740
I don't know if it was Microsoft, but it would definitely Apple and Adobe have a secret agreement

09:22.740 --> 09:25.140
to collude to lower wages, right?

09:25.140 --> 09:29.720
I think it's bad when companies, I won't say the name, but you can Google it.

09:29.720 --> 09:36.980
There was a story about this, hire H1B visas explicitly to make them work unpaid overtime.

09:36.980 --> 09:40.320
And then basically knowing that if they don't do what they want, they'll fire them.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.980
And that is effectively deporting them.

09:41.980 --> 09:42.980
I think that's bad.

09:42.980 --> 09:45.600
I think it's bad for the folks getting the visas.

09:45.600 --> 09:49.600
It's bad for small companies like mine that have to compete for these consulting jobs,

09:49.600 --> 09:52.060
but need to pay like reasonable wages.

09:52.060 --> 09:58.300
It's bad for Americans, British, Indians, anybody trying to get these jobs.

09:58.300 --> 10:04.660
If these large firms know that they, I mean, excuse the crude language, but they effectively

10:04.660 --> 10:10.140
have these folks by the balls because if they lose their job, they get deported.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.140
That was my point.

10:11.140 --> 10:16.300
Not that we, like we should not allow immigration, that it's abusive.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.620
Let's be honest too about what does getting deported mean?

10:18.620 --> 10:20.100
It means losing out.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.100
It destroys their life.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.740
They ruin your entire life.

10:22.740 --> 10:23.740
Everything you've built up.

10:23.740 --> 10:25.780
Imagine you have, you know, your kids are in school here.

10:25.780 --> 10:26.780
That's horrible.

10:26.780 --> 10:27.780
Yeah.

10:27.780 --> 10:31.640
My point is if we're going to have the H1B system, and I've been saying this for years,

10:31.640 --> 10:34.820
you can go back to 2014, 2015.

10:34.820 --> 10:41.620
The recipients of the H1B visas must have, and not just in writing, but like actual in

10:41.620 --> 10:46.460
practice, the same protections as domestic workers.

10:46.460 --> 10:47.860
And it just isn't the case, right?

10:47.860 --> 10:49.100
I mean, you could Google it.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.820
There's horror stories.

10:51.820 --> 10:53.460
I mean, we'll name one name, right?

10:53.460 --> 10:57.140
Because we covered it years ago when Disney just laid off all their IT people saying that

10:57.140 --> 10:58.140
they were redundant.

10:58.140 --> 11:03.060
And then a month later outsourced everything to H1Bs and to one of these large consulting

11:03.060 --> 11:07.300
companies that isn't notorious for treating their folks like crap.

11:07.300 --> 11:11.660
Another example is the verge has the H1B folks and the contracting folks, not all of them

11:11.660 --> 11:19.000
are H1Bs, but that that company for the, they hire another consulting firm to do their moderation.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.100
These people themselves are being mistreated.

11:22.100 --> 11:27.480
My point is if you're going to have employees, you should treat them well, right?

11:27.480 --> 11:28.480
That's basically it.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.480
Yeah.

11:29.480 --> 11:35.020
And I think that is an ongoing conversation that if you haven't heard the back catalog,

11:35.020 --> 11:38.940
you know, they didn't have all of the context for your position in the last episode.

11:38.940 --> 11:40.620
And again, I should have been more eloquent, right?

11:40.620 --> 11:44.100
Well, I mean, neither of us were at our best because it was at a different show time.

11:44.100 --> 11:47.180
I was in a hell state called Tucson.

11:47.180 --> 11:49.900
Dude, you're going to get ripped apart by Tucson folks now.

11:49.900 --> 11:50.900
I don't know what you're doing.

11:50.900 --> 11:51.900
I hope.

11:51.900 --> 11:52.900
Bring it.

11:52.900 --> 11:53.900
They can bring it.

11:53.900 --> 11:54.900
They live in a failed hell state.

11:54.900 --> 11:55.900
And I'll say it right now.

11:55.900 --> 11:56.900
All right.

11:56.900 --> 11:59.700
Can someone suggest Tucson is a failed hellscape, please?

11:59.700 --> 12:01.740
The rest of Arizona seemed great though.

12:01.740 --> 12:04.060
Anyways, Drew, our editor, put it really well.

12:04.060 --> 12:07.860
He said, you guys are wrong about this in the most Florida way possible.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.700
Fair pay is a huge issue in the country right now.

12:10.700 --> 12:14.440
It's less of an issue in Europe because they have actual laws to protect workers.

12:14.440 --> 12:19.100
In contrast to this, the dystopian nightmare we call workers rights in air quotes, he says

12:19.100 --> 12:23.060
with a wink and a nod, heavily implies that the right is that you can work, not that you

12:23.060 --> 12:25.680
have rights while being a laborer.

12:25.680 --> 12:30.380
He writes case in point, Colorado passed a law recently requiring companies to post a

12:30.380 --> 12:33.620
real legitimate pay scale on job postings.

12:33.620 --> 12:37.580
Some companies decided they would rather not have employees in Colorado rather than let

12:37.580 --> 12:40.460
people know what others are paid.

12:40.460 --> 12:45.380
Some tried to skirt around it by posting something like a dollar to one million.

12:45.380 --> 12:47.580
And then, of course, they got smacked down with fines.

12:47.580 --> 12:48.580
That's amazing.

12:48.580 --> 12:51.580
I have a story about that I'll share in a second.

12:51.580 --> 12:55.580
He finishes though with the employees at Apple should have known better than to have a chat

12:55.580 --> 12:57.340
room within a company property.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.380
Apple had every right to shut that down.

12:59.380 --> 13:03.640
But when they start telling the employees that they can't have those conversations inside

13:03.640 --> 13:08.140
or even outside the company, they're becoming thought police.

13:08.140 --> 13:11.660
You don't pay these people while they're off the clock and off property.

13:11.660 --> 13:15.420
Get the out of here trying to tell them what they can and can't talk about on their own

13:15.420 --> 13:16.420
time.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.420
Sincerely, your editor.

13:17.420 --> 13:18.420
P.S.

13:18.420 --> 13:19.420
Don't fire me.

13:19.420 --> 13:20.420
No, you nailed it.

13:20.420 --> 13:21.420
No.

13:21.420 --> 13:22.420
Yeah.

13:22.420 --> 13:26.380
I mean, so the pay scale thing is so I worked at a bank forever ago, lifetime ago, and every

13:26.380 --> 13:33.580
position in the company in the H.R. book had a pay scale that was posted like, you know,

13:33.580 --> 13:39.860
I.T. was probably thirty five to sixty thousand or so or maybe forty thousand to sixty thousand.

13:39.860 --> 13:43.980
And you knew that if you had the I.T. position one, you would get something in that range

13:43.980 --> 13:47.860
and you knew everyone else in that position was making that pay.

13:47.860 --> 13:53.140
And that was true for many, many years until it wasn't when they wanted to promote me to

13:53.140 --> 13:59.420
sort of incentivize me, but it was above what was public in the pay scale.

13:59.420 --> 14:02.660
So the the one time they just paid me more and didn't say anything about it.

14:02.660 --> 14:06.420
But then when it came time the next year to do something else again, they just created

14:06.420 --> 14:09.860
a whole new position and decided that had a new pay scale and they just created it spontaneously

14:09.860 --> 14:13.580
and said, well, now you're a server technician level three.

14:13.580 --> 14:16.820
OK, where did one and two go?

14:16.820 --> 14:19.140
And they just sort of invented new pay scales.

14:19.140 --> 14:24.300
But I thought when the system was working properly, it was kind of nice to know that

14:24.300 --> 14:29.480
if I wanted to jump over to, say, working in the branch side of the bank, these were

14:29.480 --> 14:32.100
the salary ranges I could expect.

14:32.100 --> 14:35.700
And if I shot for top tier, I could expect to make as much as this.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.160
And that worked.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.880
But that's something that company chose to implement.

14:39.880 --> 14:45.300
And I wish we could utilize technology in a way to create something like Glassdoor,

14:45.300 --> 14:50.660
but better and decentralized that also helps us discuss pay in a way that would actually

14:50.660 --> 14:55.120
be appealing to Americans who are culturally awkward about this.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.780
And it's a real hard spot for me.

14:56.780 --> 14:59.580
This whole thing, and I think it affected the way I talked about it last week.

14:59.580 --> 15:01.340
Honestly, at this point, it's a joke.

15:01.340 --> 15:06.700
But let's say somehow I ended up making three hundred thousand dollars a year doing this

15:06.700 --> 15:12.220
job, which I can't imagine how that would ever happen.

15:12.220 --> 15:16.700
But let's just say like that would be my high end of what I could ever expect for success

15:16.700 --> 15:17.700
is three hundred thousand.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.860
It's not, you know, it's not in the grand scheme of things.

15:19.860 --> 15:22.220
It's not a ton of money for media.

15:22.220 --> 15:26.300
But I'd be I'd be over the moon to make that much money a year.

15:26.300 --> 15:32.980
And if that ever went public, it would significantly damage my brand.

15:32.980 --> 15:36.860
Back in the day when I worked in I.T. and I was making a good chunk of change because

15:36.860 --> 15:41.720
I was charging one hundred and twenty an hour for my clients, and I also had podcast revenue

15:41.720 --> 15:43.860
coming in from sponsors.

15:43.860 --> 15:48.420
It became scandalous in the community when I bought an Oryx, like Chris, Chris just spent

15:48.420 --> 15:50.620
three thousand dollars on a laptop.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.100
He must be making so much money.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.340
Well, I'm not going to listen anymore.

15:54.340 --> 16:00.020
You know, like there is a big part of the Linux community that responds extremely negatively

16:00.020 --> 16:01.740
to financial success.

16:01.740 --> 16:02.740
And it's not all of them.

16:02.740 --> 16:06.300
And I don't even think it's the majority, but in a weird way for me, if I were ever

16:06.300 --> 16:09.580
public with how much money I make, because ultimately it's probably going to be more

16:09.580 --> 16:15.540
than somebody in the audience, even if it's not very much, they it creates this brand

16:15.540 --> 16:16.840
problem for me.

16:16.840 --> 16:17.840
And it's the craziest thing.

16:17.840 --> 16:22.220
And I think I don't think this is true, like in other communities, you know, you have YouTubers

16:22.220 --> 16:24.660
who kind of flaunt giving away money.

16:24.660 --> 16:30.060
You got you got like ATP, the accidental tech podcast where they literally brag about the

16:30.060 --> 16:34.580
thousands of dollars they spend on monitors and stands and they each make over five grand

16:34.580 --> 16:36.020
a month per episode, apparently.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.020
Right.

16:37.020 --> 16:38.820
Like they've mentioned it on the air.

16:38.820 --> 16:41.820
Probably more since that membership of theirs, because they have a ton of members.

16:41.820 --> 16:45.460
Like it's it's like, you know, our members are like essential to keeping the show on

16:45.460 --> 16:46.460
there.

16:46.460 --> 16:47.940
Their members are helping them buy Apple Watches.

16:47.940 --> 16:51.620
It's a whole other scale of money they're making and Tesla's right.

16:51.620 --> 16:53.820
And actually, all kinds of crazy stuff.

16:53.820 --> 16:57.580
I mean, if you listen to the show, it's clear that money isn't a problem.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.100
And they also have other alternative revenue.

16:59.100 --> 17:03.660
I mean, they're making good money and it's not considered a bad thing.

17:03.660 --> 17:08.260
And I think it's because the Apple community, you know, it's sort of a high, high spend

17:08.260 --> 17:09.620
bar to even get in.

17:09.620 --> 17:10.620
And so it's just normal.

17:10.620 --> 17:16.460
But in in the audience that I serve, there is a portion that would be very it would be

17:16.460 --> 17:21.460
very upset to hear he makes 300,000, which, by the way, I got to be clear, I make nowhere

17:21.460 --> 17:22.540
near that.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.620
Not even close.

17:23.620 --> 17:29.980
But it would even though for me, it would be like the success of my career of this particular

17:29.980 --> 17:33.740
trajectory to make that much, you'd be like, it'd be like a life goal for me to achieve

17:33.740 --> 17:34.740
that.

17:34.740 --> 17:38.320
And I, you know, I would imagine life would be great.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.820
For a good portion of the audience, they would be angered.

17:40.820 --> 17:42.480
And I think they'd probably tune out.

17:42.480 --> 17:49.140
And so when I think about wage transparency and talking about how much I make, it's a

17:49.140 --> 17:53.700
scary topic for me, because it has so many negative, negative ramifications for me.

17:53.700 --> 17:57.880
So I that also influences how I think about this.

17:57.880 --> 18:02.620
Because not only do I own a business, and not only have I done a lot of hiring, where

18:02.620 --> 18:06.740
depending on when I hire somebody, and what's going on in the market, and what the needs

18:06.740 --> 18:11.660
of the business are, if they come in at the right time with the right ask, they're going

18:11.660 --> 18:15.300
to make more than somebody that came in a couple of years ago when the market dynamics

18:15.300 --> 18:16.960
weren't the same.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.980
And it's an unfortunate reality, and I've seen it play out in multiple companies.

18:20.980 --> 18:23.860
But it's like, there's a lot of things that influence how much a business is willing to

18:23.860 --> 18:25.860
pay for somebody at what time.

18:25.860 --> 18:29.420
And every now and then, like, you're the right person with the right skill set, with the

18:29.420 --> 18:32.280
right ask, and the business says yes.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.980
And it doesn't necessarily mean they're a better coder than somebody else already on

18:34.980 --> 18:39.860
staff or a better tech or a better podcast or whatever it is.

18:39.860 --> 18:44.200
But it means that they bought at the right time, essentially, you know.

18:44.200 --> 18:50.340
And that also can, when employees find out about that disparity, it can create a lot

18:50.340 --> 18:52.660
of issues inside the team.

18:52.660 --> 18:55.320
I don't necessarily know what the answer is there.

18:55.320 --> 19:01.060
And I do feel like workers should have access to as many tools as possible to negotiate

19:01.060 --> 19:03.780
with these large, especially these monstrously large companies.

19:03.780 --> 19:09.700
Because the employers and the businesses have all the tools in the world, from all kinds

19:09.700 --> 19:16.200
of tactics to literal tools to personnel to lawyers, they have all the tools in the world.

19:16.200 --> 19:20.500
So I do think workers need access to more information and more resources, but I just

19:20.500 --> 19:21.500
don't know what the answer is.

19:21.500 --> 19:26.940
And I think it's a more complicated problem than we really give credit for.

19:26.940 --> 19:31.620
Yeah, I think it gets messy too, the smaller, like it's very easy to say that like Apple

19:31.620 --> 19:35.380
should not quote, interfere with organizing or whatever.

19:35.380 --> 19:39.780
But you know, if you have a company of like five people, and everybody's making roughly

19:39.780 --> 19:43.500
the same amount of money, and the company, like all small companies, is always on the

19:43.500 --> 19:45.820
edge of life and death.

19:45.820 --> 19:52.460
There's just not like enough fat there to have this massive drain of like constantly

19:52.460 --> 19:54.180
fighting with the employer.

19:54.180 --> 19:55.180
I don't know.

19:55.180 --> 19:58.180
I mean, one, I don't know about other places.

19:58.180 --> 20:01.580
I know in Florida, if you're small enough, a lot of these things don't really apply.

20:01.580 --> 20:07.300
But I feel like there's just a fundamental difference between the huge tech companies

20:07.300 --> 20:09.580
and like, JB and TMB, right?

20:09.580 --> 20:14.900
It just seems oh, yeah, like you and I are not making 300 times more than our employees,

20:14.900 --> 20:15.900
right?

20:15.900 --> 20:16.900
It just.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.140
And you know, think about it in terms of employee disparity.

20:19.140 --> 20:22.460
I thought about this when we were getting those emails, and we you know, we didn't talk

20:22.460 --> 20:26.360
about with Apple is imagine being an employee there, right?

20:26.360 --> 20:30.900
Maybe you're like responsible for some subsystem and iOS or some component of the desktop or

20:30.900 --> 20:32.340
whatever.

20:32.340 --> 20:37.620
You now work for a company that's willing to pay like 30 million dollars to do Ted Lasso

20:37.620 --> 20:42.300
and pay those to pay the staff of the Apple TV arm.

20:42.300 --> 20:45.500
Millions of dollars in payroll, millions, right?

20:45.500 --> 20:49.780
Like the difference now between what a developer makes and what Jennifer Aniston makes, who

20:49.780 --> 20:53.380
are both now employees for Apple, is gross.

20:53.380 --> 20:55.180
And that is a whole new level of disparity.

20:55.180 --> 20:59.940
And I don't I know it's different markets and all that, but like at the end of the day,

20:59.940 --> 21:03.100
if you're an employee at Apple, that's a reality for you now.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.500
And that doesn't sit well with me.

21:04.500 --> 21:08.780
Like I'm thinking about it, like in my exact case, the difference between me and my current

21:08.780 --> 21:14.420
lowest paid like employee, like full time employee is, I think, like four or five dollars

21:14.420 --> 21:15.460
an hour.

21:15.460 --> 21:17.780
It's a lot narrower in our in our area.

21:17.780 --> 21:19.500
Yeah, I don't know.

21:19.500 --> 21:23.260
I think it's kind of crazy.

21:23.260 --> 21:27.980
lino.com slash coder go there to get one hundred dollars and 60 day credit on a new account

21:27.980 --> 21:29.780
and you go there to support the show.

21:29.780 --> 21:34.660
Of course, Linode started in 2003 is one of the very first companies in cloud computing.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.900
I got hip to them about two years ago.

21:36.900 --> 21:41.700
And what I realized is for 18 years, they have been focused on being the best in this

21:41.700 --> 21:42.700
area.

21:42.700 --> 21:45.380
They haven't been led astray and done a million different little strange things.

21:45.380 --> 21:49.580
Instead, they have focused on making cloud computing accessible, simple and affordable

21:49.580 --> 21:50.580
to all.

21:50.580 --> 21:55.180
And if you are starting a project, Linode is a fantastic way to go.

21:55.180 --> 21:58.580
And they have systems in place that help take care of your box, like with snapshots and

21:58.580 --> 22:00.540
backups if you ever need them.

22:00.540 --> 22:02.140
And they make it really easy to get started.

22:02.140 --> 22:05.660
I frequently deploy a Debian box with Docker preinstalled.

22:05.660 --> 22:09.700
But for example, you could just one click deploy next cloud or maybe Jitsi if you want

22:09.700 --> 22:10.700
to replace Zoom.

22:10.700 --> 22:14.420
They have a lot of just hit a button, deploy the app and get started type stuff.

22:14.420 --> 22:19.540
But they also make it really simple for you to go the DIY route if that's what you prefer.

22:19.540 --> 22:21.700
That's why that one hundred dollar credit is so great.

22:21.700 --> 22:27.020
Plus, you get access to their S3 compatible object storage, cloud firewalls, VLAN support,

22:27.020 --> 22:33.060
a powerful DNS manager and really great 24-7 customer support.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.580
Linode is always making an investment in their infrastructure.

22:35.580 --> 22:38.580
Their high end CPU boxes have AMD epic processors.

22:38.580 --> 22:40.740
They have super fast SSDs.

22:40.740 --> 22:42.780
They are their own ISP.

22:42.780 --> 22:44.540
So their network connection is fantastic.

22:44.540 --> 22:47.020
And they have 11 data centers around the world.

22:47.020 --> 22:49.860
I mean, it really just doesn't get any better than that.

22:49.860 --> 22:54.340
While I was on our Jupiter Colony reunion road trip, it was Linode that kept the lights

22:54.340 --> 22:55.340
on here.

22:55.340 --> 22:59.980
My on-premises server went down and I ended up having to shift all of my workload to the

22:59.980 --> 23:02.500
Linode instances that I had set up before the trip.

23:02.500 --> 23:05.860
And that kind of stuff is so great too because you can use Linode as part of like a multi

23:05.860 --> 23:06.860
cloud strategy.

23:06.860 --> 23:08.340
Maybe you have multiple cloud providers.

23:08.340 --> 23:10.580
You want to spread out some risk.

23:10.580 --> 23:15.020
Maybe you have on-premises and you want to augment that with a cloud option like I did.

23:15.020 --> 23:18.780
Linode is super flexible in that way and you can run your entire infrastructure up there

23:18.780 --> 23:22.580
because their pricing is 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the major duopoly cloud providers

23:22.580 --> 23:23.580
out there.

23:23.580 --> 23:28.460
So go get started and get a hundred dollar 60 day credit by going to linode.com slash

23:28.460 --> 23:29.460
coder.

23:29.460 --> 23:34.340
You get that one hundred dollars and you support the CoderRadio program and make it possible

23:34.340 --> 23:35.820
for us to keep going.

23:35.820 --> 23:40.700
That's linode.com slash coder.

23:40.700 --> 23:44.900
Apple today, as we record, so probably two days as you're listening to this, has released

23:44.900 --> 23:51.940
iOS 15 and iPad OS 15 along with the watch stuff and I assume the Apple TV stuff.

23:51.940 --> 23:57.260
I wanted to note it since it's happening today on the show and there is actually one real

23:57.260 --> 23:59.940
significant feature in here that I think is decent.

23:59.940 --> 24:03.500
But you have any off the top of your head thoughts about the iOS 15 release?

24:03.500 --> 24:04.500
None.

24:04.500 --> 24:08.900
I'm actually curious what the feature you think is important is.

24:08.900 --> 24:09.900
Well you know what I'll say this.

24:09.900 --> 24:13.220
I've been using the beta the entire summer on the iPad.

24:13.220 --> 24:14.220
Really?

24:14.220 --> 24:15.220
Mm-hmm.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.220
Way better on the iPad.

24:16.220 --> 24:19.920
They just did one thing and it was really simple is they just made the multitasking discoverable.

24:19.920 --> 24:23.780
They put little tabs in stuff and gave you clues of how to use it.

24:23.780 --> 24:27.240
It's relatively the same but it's so so much better now.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.900
There's a feature in there that I haven't played a lot with because I've really been

24:29.900 --> 24:32.140
waiting for it to land on the phone.

24:32.140 --> 24:37.740
And I think it's a great example of A, the kind of area where Apple was really really

24:37.740 --> 24:42.740
behind for essentially all of iOS and then just sort of leapfrogs with a feature set

24:42.740 --> 24:45.700
that it looks really really competitive.

24:45.700 --> 24:51.180
And then the other thing about it, so B, is it sort of really checks that sync across

24:51.180 --> 24:57.300
all your boxes and I cloudify this for everything in the ecosystem the way only Apple really

24:57.300 --> 24:58.300
does these days.

24:58.300 --> 25:01.420
So I'm talking about here is the focus feature.

25:01.420 --> 25:07.060
So at a high level the idea behind the focus feature is it's like do not disturb but way

25:07.060 --> 25:09.300
more turned up to 11.

25:09.300 --> 25:12.740
So when you want to focus on a particular task like say maybe you're recording a podcast

25:12.740 --> 25:17.180
or you're flying a damn drone or you're trying to sleep or read a book or play a game on

25:17.180 --> 25:18.620
your device.

25:18.620 --> 25:24.060
You can enable that particular focus to silence notifications from specific apps or people.

25:24.060 --> 25:30.360
You can also at the same time trigger automations and shortcuts and rearrange your home screen

25:30.360 --> 25:31.820
for that particular focus.

25:31.820 --> 25:36.100
So it's do not disturb on steroids where it touches all this other stuff.

25:36.100 --> 25:40.220
And then you can sync those different focuses so like I'll have one for podcasting, I'll

25:40.220 --> 25:41.780
have one for driving.

25:41.780 --> 25:45.960
You can sync these different focuses across all your devices.

25:45.960 --> 25:50.500
Everything that's either on the latest version of the latest Apple OS.

25:50.500 --> 25:56.580
But for me the biggest thing is as you're using it you can start to add people or notifications

25:56.580 --> 25:58.820
to the focus mode or remove them.

25:58.820 --> 26:06.180
It gives you a surprising amount of customizations where I could say allow notifications from

26:06.180 --> 26:12.420
Mike and Wes but nobody else and it will actually recognize you assuming that the developers

26:12.420 --> 26:14.260
are using the new APIs.

26:14.260 --> 26:20.020
It'll recognize you across chat services so iMessage, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp.

26:20.020 --> 26:24.260
If it's using the new API it'll know it's you regardless of the chat application they're

26:24.260 --> 26:25.260
using.

26:25.260 --> 26:28.660
So I can just put you in there as a contact and that means any app you want to use you

26:28.660 --> 26:32.940
can break through and I can specifically allow or deny apps.

26:32.940 --> 26:36.980
So I can say in the case of like when I'm flying the drone this has actually been, this

26:36.980 --> 26:42.780
has been a really frustrating problem is because the universe hates me just like when I'm podcasting

26:42.780 --> 26:47.060
when I put my drone up in the air that's when I start getting all the push notifications

26:47.060 --> 26:51.820
you know motion notifications, Slack notifications, everything.

26:51.820 --> 26:57.380
And the horrible thing about iOS is you can be in do not disturb mode but if you allow

26:57.380 --> 27:02.060
banner notifications and you have your screen on you will get those notifications and if

27:02.060 --> 27:07.420
you have an iPhone mini and you're flying a drone those banner notifications cover up

27:07.420 --> 27:10.340
a significant part of the screen you're using to fly the thing.

27:10.340 --> 27:14.620
So I can literally be in mid-flight and not able to see where I'm flying because of these

27:14.620 --> 27:18.980
damn notifications or I can be recording a podcast and they break through.

27:18.980 --> 27:23.900
So with these focus modes I choose the task that I'm doing and I will have only certain

27:23.900 --> 27:28.180
allowed applications through and I will have custom home screens so I don't even have to

27:28.180 --> 27:32.380
see the badges of the other apps.

27:32.380 --> 27:36.060
And then they're going to do some things we'll see how it works like some contextual suggestions

27:36.060 --> 27:40.860
based on you know things that it's observed which they seem to get right about 30% of

27:40.860 --> 27:46.660
the time but the 30% they get right is pretty clever and in terms of iMessage which is what

27:46.660 --> 27:53.100
my family uses for better or for worse it'll let them know I'm in a focus mode and not

27:53.100 --> 27:58.700
seeing their notifications and then there's also some way for them to say this is urgent

27:58.700 --> 28:03.700
break through the focus mode and let him know I need him to see this notification sort of

28:03.700 --> 28:10.140
like slack can do and I think that is going to be a feature that genuinely changes how

28:10.140 --> 28:17.140
I use my devices and how I'm interrupted which is a rough interruptions are rough for me

28:17.140 --> 28:20.260
and it also is one of those stupid it's a small stupid little thing but it makes me

28:20.260 --> 28:29.940
go huh you know if I had a M1X Mac with Monterey it would get silenced when I silence my phone

28:29.940 --> 28:36.120
or my watch like they all the iPad the Mac the theoretical Mac that doesn't exist they

28:36.120 --> 28:42.180
all would get it and that is extremely appealing to me it's a small stupid thing but yet huge

28:42.180 --> 28:45.380
for me personally.

28:45.380 --> 28:48.580
Really I didn't sell you I thought that was a pretty good explanation.

28:48.580 --> 28:53.860
No because I because I can already hear the complaints like you monster well I can already

28:53.860 --> 28:58.380
hear like the family tech support I'm gonna have to do when someone mistakenly puts some

28:58.380 --> 29:02.580
app on a block thinking you know like oh come on you know this Chris you get all kinds of

29:02.580 --> 29:07.020
crazy calls from relatives right like yeah you're the tech guy in the family like I've

29:07.020 --> 29:13.060
seen all right my love you and also I understand you love collective bargaining and I'm very

29:13.060 --> 29:18.540
sorry but like the woman can destroy an Apple TV in ways that I didn't know were possible

29:18.540 --> 29:21.500
really an Apple that does seem like the impossible.

29:21.500 --> 29:27.140
So like giving more settings to my relatives it's just there's a reason I make them pile

29:27.140 --> 29:30.820
life it was to avoid this.

29:30.820 --> 29:34.820
Yeah like you know what I want them to do nothing.

29:34.820 --> 29:41.560
I don't even again sorry ma but like she discovered how to turn her phone off.

29:41.560 --> 29:45.500
She's a very smart person but she thought off was silent.

29:45.500 --> 29:50.420
This is years ago when like smartphones were new and that was just a problem right now

29:50.420 --> 29:53.300
granted we're talking the iPhone.

29:53.300 --> 29:56.780
Oh God what was the first one of horizon was it the four or the three G.S.

29:56.780 --> 30:03.500
It must have been the I want to say four but I don't know I felt like it took forever for

30:03.500 --> 30:04.500
Verizon to get it.

30:04.500 --> 30:08.940
Yeah well there was a setting you could like change what the button did from like off to

30:08.940 --> 30:12.460
silent or something sleep silent.

30:12.460 --> 30:16.900
Yeah OK it was sleep to silent you could change it and she changed it and she just kept turning

30:16.900 --> 30:21.340
her phone on silent and then being mad that her phone wouldn't ring and like my opinion

30:21.340 --> 30:22.900
is that setting should not exist.

30:22.900 --> 30:23.900
Right.

30:23.900 --> 30:24.900
I'm just like no.

30:24.900 --> 30:28.860
So I don't love that what you just described it took you at least two and a half minutes

30:28.860 --> 30:32.660
to describe on a technical podcast.

30:32.660 --> 30:33.660
Yeah OK.

30:33.660 --> 30:34.660
All right.

30:34.660 --> 30:35.660
OK.

30:35.660 --> 30:36.660
You're right.

30:36.660 --> 30:37.660
It does seem a little complicated.

30:37.660 --> 30:38.660
Yeah it does.

30:38.660 --> 30:41.580
But it's like it is the new do not disturb and I think they've just taken do not disturb

30:41.580 --> 30:43.380
and they've made it a focus now.

30:43.380 --> 30:48.340
I think it's way better than it was the notification system seems uniquely improved in fact it's

30:48.340 --> 30:52.060
got other things in there too now like silently collecting notifications and just tucking

30:52.060 --> 30:56.580
them away in a tray until you want them instead of like blasting them in your face a lot of

30:56.580 --> 30:59.780
things like that that I think are a nice step up but you're right it is complicated.

30:59.780 --> 31:01.740
You know they're not doing a lot this year.

31:01.740 --> 31:06.060
I think Apple is paying the covid tax this year because let's be honest the iPhone event

31:06.060 --> 31:07.060
was kind of a snoozer.

31:07.060 --> 31:08.060
It was a dud.

31:08.060 --> 31:11.940
Yeah but they're not doing a lot but they're doing more than their nearest peer competitors

31:11.940 --> 31:12.940
for sure.

31:12.940 --> 31:18.040
Unless you care about folding phones and I just want to say at the rate I destroy hardware

31:18.040 --> 31:20.700
can you imagine a folding phone.

31:20.700 --> 31:23.260
Would I even get it out of the box if I could do it right.

31:23.260 --> 31:24.260
I wouldn't.

31:24.260 --> 31:27.260
I kind of liked the clamshell phones but I don't think I want something that thick in

31:27.260 --> 31:28.260
my pocket.

31:28.260 --> 31:30.180
I'm talking the tools you know the same way.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.180
What do they call the Samsung.

31:31.180 --> 31:34.340
Yeah the fact the things that unfold into a tablet basically.

31:34.340 --> 31:37.820
Yeah I can't remember the name but someone will will have it in the comments.

31:37.820 --> 31:41.460
What are your thoughts though on on on the 13.

31:41.460 --> 31:42.460
Did you order one.

31:42.460 --> 31:43.460
Did I ask you last week.

31:43.460 --> 31:46.100
No but you and I are iPad mini brothers apparently.

31:46.100 --> 31:47.100
No I don't have one.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.100
I thought you ordered one.

31:48.100 --> 31:50.420
No I got a 13 Max Pro.

31:50.420 --> 31:51.420
Really.

31:51.420 --> 31:52.420
Yeah I do like the mini.

31:52.420 --> 31:54.540
I think that's a good iPad but no I don't have one.

31:54.540 --> 31:58.660
I had the I what you're thinking of is I had the iPhone mini with the iPhone mini.

31:58.660 --> 31:59.660
That's what it was.

31:59.660 --> 32:00.660
OK.

32:00.660 --> 32:01.660
Yeah and it's been a disaster for me.

32:01.660 --> 32:02.660
It's just been a dumpster.

32:02.660 --> 32:03.660
So I like to read.

32:03.660 --> 32:07.140
In fact we're going to have a review of it if I ever finish it like you know Manning

32:07.140 --> 32:08.820
presses like technical books.

32:08.820 --> 32:09.820
Oh yeah.

32:09.820 --> 32:13.060
And I find that on the regular Kindle they're kind of garbage because you know you don't

32:13.060 --> 32:15.500
get the syntax outlining or whatever.

32:15.500 --> 32:21.100
I cannot express how painful dropping an iPad pro on my face is with the keyboard attached.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.100
Oh yeah.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.980
When you're sitting there reading in bed and yeah you start falling asleep and you just

32:24.980 --> 32:27.880
like knock your own ass out.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.540
So the mini and also my son has discovered cut the rope.

32:31.540 --> 32:32.540
He's a little late.

32:32.540 --> 32:36.080
Stop being mean to the five year old and fruit ninja.

32:36.080 --> 32:39.060
So he is enjoying the best of 2014 mobile games.

32:39.060 --> 32:41.780
Hey you know what you have to do next is get him on Angry Birds.

32:41.780 --> 32:43.460
I mean you know what the classics are the classics.

32:43.460 --> 32:46.820
How much money those those rovio guys made on Angry Birds.

32:46.820 --> 32:48.760
Seriously it's not anymore dude.

32:48.760 --> 32:52.140
You know it's it they got a version in the arcade now and it's all just like you know

32:52.140 --> 32:53.140
all built in.

32:53.140 --> 32:54.500
No no in-app purchases or anything.

32:54.500 --> 32:57.460
Yeah that's that's it's a while.

32:57.460 --> 32:59.540
They're all going for that subscription revenue now.

32:59.540 --> 33:04.780
Hey get down to 15 percent Apple tax after a year.

33:04.780 --> 33:06.540
Yeah so we'll see.

33:06.540 --> 33:07.540
Yeah I got that.

33:07.540 --> 33:08.540
I've got the big one.

33:08.540 --> 33:09.540
It's problem problem.

33:09.540 --> 33:14.220
I'm also I also think live text is a decent feature where you can select the text in photos

33:14.220 --> 33:19.900
in like a screenshot or in Safari or I've actually already used that a couple of times

33:19.900 --> 33:20.900
on the iPad.

33:20.900 --> 33:21.900
So we'll see.

33:21.900 --> 33:26.860
Anyways I just wanted to note that it's here and we're aware of it and I think focus was

33:26.860 --> 33:30.980
probably the only thing that's really going to change my productivity with these devices

33:30.980 --> 33:35.300
and I think it is a nice little note of of system wide setting sinking that Apple could

33:35.300 --> 33:36.300
do.

33:36.300 --> 33:39.260
They could do a lot more of that if you think about it there's a lot more things they could

33:39.260 --> 33:44.740
sink across all these devices and if they got it right and didn't screw it up.

33:44.740 --> 33:46.280
That's pretty compelling feature set for me.

33:46.280 --> 33:51.300
I just want to remind all I was developers of the cloud API you know and sinking and

33:51.300 --> 34:00.940
if they got it right OK Datadog.com slash Coder radio go there and see why Datadog is

It's a great tool and you got to check it out Datadog.com slash Coder radio.

35:22.540 --> 35:26.780
Let me tell you about an experimental operating system that Microsoft has developed.

35:26.780 --> 35:32.060
It's called Singularity and it's designed to eliminate some of the shortcomings of existing

35:32.060 --> 35:37.060
operating systems such as the general security vulnerabilities failures and crashes due to

35:37.060 --> 35:42.980
drivers extensions add ons and of course crashes due to unexpected interaction between apps

35:42.980 --> 35:45.100
and an overall lack of performance and robustness.

35:45.100 --> 35:48.620
So they are aiming big here.

35:48.620 --> 35:53.620
Their strategy is to utilize a safe programming language no more of C's shenanigans as Microsoft

35:53.620 --> 35:59.480
says they will use verification tools impose constraints that will make verification easier

35:59.480 --> 36:04.700
and they have a new architecture and design that they think is tops.

36:04.700 --> 36:07.340
Do I have your attention are you impressed?

36:07.340 --> 36:08.340
No of course not.

36:08.340 --> 36:11.340
Yes I should know better.

36:11.340 --> 36:16.260
It's a very fascinating theoretical study that they did.

36:16.260 --> 36:19.020
There's just one little catch.

36:19.020 --> 36:24.820
The last release was in November of 2008 just an old it was an experiment about 18 years

36:24.820 --> 36:31.360
ago they thought would make for a better platform for the long run kind of like Google's fuchsia

36:31.360 --> 36:34.780
today that's the first thing I thought of when I saw this is this makes me think of

36:34.780 --> 36:37.780
what Google is doing right now with fuchsia.

36:37.780 --> 36:42.380
Okay I mean first of all what does it say for programming language are they just saying

36:42.380 --> 36:45.620
they're doing rust because you know that's great for the hashtags on Twitter.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.020
Well there was no rust 18 years ago was there.

36:48.020 --> 36:49.980
So it's C sharp.

36:49.980 --> 36:51.860
It's Longhorn 2.0.

36:51.860 --> 36:56.260
Yeah maybe they actually do have it up on GitHub now so one could go sniff around.

36:56.260 --> 36:59.860
I wonder if this kind of thing like these rich companies you know they do this kind

36:59.860 --> 37:04.100
of stuff these skunkworks projects whole new operating system and then the business

37:04.100 --> 37:08.380
sort of just says that knock it off we got a good thing going over here we're not going

37:08.380 --> 37:12.440
to reinvest in all this because like what ultimately is going to happen to fuchsia is

37:12.440 --> 37:18.420
either Google will slowly replace Android and roll it out to first all its IOT devices

37:18.420 --> 37:23.540
and then its mobile devices and then put it on Chromebooks eventually or in a few years

37:23.540 --> 37:27.000
they're just going to they're just going to give up it's just going to kind of wind down

37:27.000 --> 37:30.820
a little bit because the Linux kernel or whatever that is that they need changed will adopt

37:30.820 --> 37:36.940
what they're doing and the business will say ah good enough I mean it just seems to happen

37:36.940 --> 37:38.180
over and over.

37:38.180 --> 37:39.180
It is C sharp.

37:39.180 --> 37:45.980
Oh you know of course it is oh yes well I wouldn't expect anything else from you know

37:45.980 --> 37:51.020
this is like this is their dream and I have a similar dream or I have a dream I think

37:51.020 --> 37:56.520
it's not similar but I have a dream that like I keep going back to that keeps like not working

37:56.520 --> 38:01.580
and I respect them for not giving up is that a dot VBS file get out oh it's got to be right

38:01.580 --> 38:09.380
I mean come on get out a VB all right you know this repo we're going to we need to put

38:09.380 --> 38:13.100
this in the chat room this repo is worth a look there's some stuff happening here okay

38:13.100 --> 38:16.660
yeah and I'll put in the show notes too there's also a PDF paper they wrote which I'll put

38:16.660 --> 38:22.380
that in the show notes as well it's pretty great singularity how about that and you know

38:22.380 --> 38:25.940
it's the new Microsoft so of course they put it up on GitHub wait what's iron hang on did

38:25.940 --> 38:33.980
the PowerShell there it is all right wait wait no way really oh yeah there's a lot but

38:33.980 --> 38:40.780
it's mostly C sharp sure of course using common system collections and link you man this is

38:40.780 --> 38:44.260
wild because this is what they were saying back in 2008 this is long software runs on

38:44.260 --> 38:49.220
a platform that has evolved over the past 40 years and is increasingly showing its age

38:49.220 --> 38:53.860
the platform is a vast collection of code operating systems programming languages compilers

38:53.860 --> 38:59.700
libraries runtimes middleware etc and they're calling that as super old and this is 18 years

38:59.700 --> 39:03.660
ago I just want to say I'm looking at some of this code granted this is my cursory but

39:03.660 --> 39:09.780
like this is actually pretty good like if you want to learn C sharp and like hardcore

39:09.780 --> 39:16.260
C sharp not like you know you're just doing Xamarin or whatever I would check this out

39:16.260 --> 39:21.260
there's some like they're doing a lot of like bitwise opera they're doing some good stuff

39:21.260 --> 39:26.620
here like yeah yeah yeah well their whole idea was if we were going to start today and

39:26.620 --> 39:32.500
learn and use everything we've learned how could we use that to create the basis for

39:32.500 --> 39:38.580
quote more dependable system and application software singularity exploits advances in

39:38.580 --> 39:42.180
programming languages and tools that create an environment which software is more likely

39:42.180 --> 39:47.540
to be built correctly program behavior is easier to verify and runtime failures can

39:47.540 --> 39:52.620
be contained this is fascinating I would actually suggest that like especially our newer developers

39:52.620 --> 39:57.780
or folks wanting to get into it who write us all the time if you are at all interested

39:57.780 --> 40:02.380
in the dotnet world or even you know now even just like programming patterns this repo is

40:02.380 --> 40:08.460
actually this is this is beefy I was gonna make fun of it but and then in the show notes

40:08.460 --> 40:15.600
I'll have a link to a story from a developer who decided to start taking phone support

40:15.600 --> 40:20.700
after never doing it he only opened up in Japanese because he's primarily Japanese and

40:20.700 --> 40:24.300
he had a Japanese phone number I would hope he speaks Japanese if he's only doing Japanese

40:24.300 --> 40:27.900
phone support but of course you know it's kind of an interesting experiment because

40:27.900 --> 40:32.300
he says most of them were polite he says probably mostly because Japanese culture I was yeah

40:32.300 --> 40:36.600
I was just yeah but he did get a few upset calls and this was the key insight that I

40:36.600 --> 40:40.820
thought it almost it almost made me go like maybe I should like have a phone line for

40:40.820 --> 40:45.580
like a week the people could call he says you can detect critical parts of your product

40:45.580 --> 40:50.420
there are times when there's large problems that's obvious but there's small little things

40:50.420 --> 40:54.780
that the phone calls would expose to him that he realized everybody must be hitting and

40:54.780 --> 40:58.860
that he should probably fix and he says of course there's also an opportunity to improve

40:58.860 --> 41:02.740
listening skills and get a better understanding of what clients explain they want and what

41:02.740 --> 41:07.500
they actually want but the insight that he essentially was getting bug reports even though

41:07.500 --> 41:12.320
they didn't realize that's what they were gave him critical feedback of a data point

41:12.320 --> 41:16.060
he was missing when the application was in the field without phone support and I thought

41:16.060 --> 41:19.100
isn't that interesting you know and he didn't make a big deal about it I think he just put

41:19.100 --> 41:22.980
it like in the about page or something like that but sure enough he'd get calls the other

41:22.980 --> 41:28.780
thing he said is that if he went a while in between updates in the past people would just

41:28.780 --> 41:33.380
kind of assume the project was dead yes but now people would call him and say hey are

41:33.380 --> 41:38.060
you still maintaining this and he could say yes and then he'd have a sale I don't love

41:38.060 --> 41:44.020
the fact that most business communications have moved to like slack or email or like

41:44.020 --> 41:51.220
you know Trello in my case because we're TMB uses Trello enterprise it's horrible sorry

41:51.220 --> 41:56.660
you guys I can just say like if there is a problem which software always has bugs there's

41:56.660 --> 42:01.740
always a problem people are much much much nicer on the phone than they are on oh yeah

42:01.740 --> 42:06.100
sure in fact it it's easier to get a detailed bug report when you're actually on the phone

42:06.100 --> 42:09.940
with someone or better yet in person with them not only are they nicer usually but they're

42:09.940 --> 42:13.300
more generous they'll be they'd be willing to check test more things and do more steps

42:13.300 --> 42:19.100
for you over the phone right to walk you through it yeah I mean I I've definitely found that

42:19.100 --> 42:25.340
like I mean I mean I've been on both sides of this equation right but like DMS or emails

42:25.340 --> 42:32.740
you get at like 2 a.m. or probably like you need to take them with some charity because

42:32.740 --> 42:37.340
they're not going to be good you know customers get frustrated I guess my thing is if I had

42:37.340 --> 42:42.540
a consumer facing app like I used to a code journal if I opened like just like I guess

42:42.540 --> 42:46.260
the phone line can't be my phone line it has to be like some kind of view view over IP

42:46.260 --> 42:52.340
solution because don't you think you just get too much like random questions this seemed

42:52.340 --> 42:56.440
like his situations best case scenario where he put it in the about version for the Japanese

42:56.440 --> 43:01.000
version of the application so it's very specific I'd be willing to release code journal in

43:01.000 --> 43:07.580
Japan only and have phone support I know they sound great over I mean I can't translate

43:07.580 --> 43:13.100
the text into Japanese because I don't know if you have Google Assistant answer and I'm

43:13.100 --> 43:19.660
pretty sure I can't compile it anymore but whatever right yeah there is that problem

43:19.660 --> 43:23.620
I've always liked the idea of hearing from the audience that's why I went on that road

43:23.620 --> 43:30.180
trip for me I know implicitly with with without any doubt that going out there and meeting

43:30.180 --> 43:35.740
the audience gives me a much better understanding of who these people actually are than what

43:35.740 --> 43:41.460
I get through social media and chat rooms and I say that all the time so not a big surprise

43:41.460 --> 43:46.580
there but it's like I have to drill the point home because if people aren't frequently experiencing

43:46.580 --> 43:53.620
that difference it's I think our our brains sort of normalize it out and we sort of forget

43:53.620 --> 43:59.940
how low bandwidth these relationships truly are and we we don't really have a brain that's

43:59.940 --> 44:04.300
adapted for a low bandwidth style of communication so we put a lot into that communication that

44:04.300 --> 44:08.180
isn't there because that's how our brains are built that when you're talking to somebody

44:08.180 --> 44:12.420
you see their facial expressions and you see how they're holding themselves and you also

44:12.420 --> 44:17.000
just sort of humanize them more like those emails we got a lot of times if you respond

44:17.000 --> 44:20.900
to them and say you know hey so and so and such and such and I'm sorry or this like they

44:20.900 --> 44:25.000
realize oh yeah right no man I'm sorry I forgot I forgot actually you're a person right you're

44:25.000 --> 44:30.420
not in facts and a Nazi robot for instance right and I probably I've probably heard that

44:30.420 --> 44:35.740
a thousand times in emails when I respond but I but I will tell you a little bit like

44:35.740 --> 44:40.420
remember way back in the day gather around children in 2012 when I used to respond to

44:40.420 --> 44:45.420
YouTube comments now I don't yeah because there are people who are just trolls right

44:45.420 --> 44:49.340
who are just gonna like yes you know and I feel back I've been on both sides of this

44:49.340 --> 44:55.460
especially like I'd like to say when I was younger but not that much younger it's very

44:55.460 --> 44:59.860
easy when you're like staring at a slack channel you're staring at a telegram or whatever to

44:59.860 --> 45:05.460
forget that whatever thing the person did that annoyed you they are a person who probably

45:05.460 --> 45:10.060
has their own stuff going on right how do you know right like you can use me maybe they're

45:10.060 --> 45:13.900
going through like an awful divorce right and it's just like whatever they're a little

45:13.900 --> 45:18.380
messed up maybe yeah hell maybe they got an offender bender right or some health issue

45:18.380 --> 45:22.500
or some health issue yeah and we both had pretty severe health issues over the course

45:22.500 --> 45:28.320
of the show yeah I don't know it's something I try to do I would recommend especially as

45:28.320 --> 45:32.420
more of these communications become these asynchronous messaging services right is it

45:32.420 --> 45:38.220
clear the direction we're going better or worse you got to remember that like the person

45:38.220 --> 45:42.100
might just have like especially in the age of COVID right everybody's kids are home like

45:42.100 --> 45:47.620
people are tired you know people are just run down you got to give a little bit of charity

45:47.620 --> 45:54.180
and I'm trying to do it I'm not perfect as at it as Chris knows but you got to you got

45:54.180 --> 46:01.820
to try yeah well said unless unless they are the maintainers of the GNOME project then

46:01.820 --> 46:06.020
just wild out at them I'm joking I love you guys sorry they have been getting it this

46:06.020 --> 46:12.080
week tough week was huh yeah yeah boy I tell you but you know what I'm more appreciative

46:12.080 --> 46:17.160
than ever for our members there our coder QA team out there is amazing and we are grateful

46:17.160 --> 46:22.620
for your support you can join us and get access to all the previous coderlies and the future

46:22.620 --> 46:27.220
coderlies and of course you get a limited ad feed which will have some upgrades soon

46:27.220 --> 46:33.380
you're going to get the also warm and fuzzies of supporting the show over at coder QA dot

46:33.380 --> 46:39.900
co coder QA dot co mr. Dominic is there anywhere you'd like to send folks this week follow

46:39.900 --> 46:44.160
me at Twitter at to Manuco I am two weeks away from shipping and I haven't slept much

46:44.160 --> 46:49.860
remember what I said take charity you never know what somebody's going through they could

46:49.860 --> 46:53.620
be about to ship you're gonna have to have a lot of charity with me in the next couple

46:53.620 --> 47:00.460
weeks yeah yeah the hell I was going through I realized I shouldn't have done shows that

47:00.460 --> 47:04.780
last week like the last two weeks you could argue but that last week where I was like

47:04.780 --> 47:11.040
trapped in Tucson and it was a hundred and something degrees every day in the RV and

47:11.040 --> 47:15.980
I mean like I just shouldn't have done the shows but I I didn't plan to get stranded

47:15.980 --> 47:20.060
somewhere so I didn't have any backup plans you know the other thing about the behind

47:20.060 --> 47:23.580
the scenes about last week's episode to which people don't know is if you listen to a drew

47:23.580 --> 47:29.380
does such a great job but we had all kinds of like crazy strange drifting latency and

47:29.380 --> 47:35.820
yeah it like oh god it was so brutal and so awful I shouldn't have done the shows but

47:35.820 --> 47:42.240
I think my kid Mike's son was whiling out in the other room right like I think we should

47:42.240 --> 47:46.980
have just said sorry but yeah yeah you know what you know what like you know what big

47:46.980 --> 47:52.140
podcast networks do like you know that Roman Mars guy he just he features another show

47:52.140 --> 47:57.860
and says I would love to feature stoked this week yeah this week we're featuring something

47:57.860 --> 48:02.200
from our catalog and you know then they just roll it and that's that's how they get away

48:02.200 --> 48:07.740
with it I just want to say stoked email him hey you know what stoked was great it was

48:07.740 --> 48:12.100
fun I like stoked I don't know why stoked went away well I do know why but well cuz

48:12.100 --> 48:14.700
Star Trek online got a little weird for those of you don't know which would be everybody

48:14.700 --> 48:19.680
I used to do a podcast way back in the day it was a video podcast with some decent production

48:19.680 --> 48:25.920
values I'll add it was awesome yeah and cuz I'm such a big Star Trek guy and we we got

48:25.920 --> 48:30.060
early access to this Star Trek online game which is still going to this day but we got

48:30.060 --> 48:34.700
I call that Fisher privilege we were very early we got very early access so they were

48:34.700 --> 48:38.860
here in the event in Seattle and the guy that ended up later on running the project for

48:38.860 --> 48:43.420
a while but the guy that was working there let us film for a bit before he shut us down

48:43.420 --> 48:48.280
like he was supposed to and so we had solid few minutes worth of gameplay footage on YouTube

48:48.280 --> 48:52.780
and from there we just sort of took off because we became like this rumor house for the game

48:52.780 --> 48:56.700
before it launched and we started a podcast and there's a lot of fun for a long time until

48:56.700 --> 49:03.860
until it wasn't the game got bought also my co-host got acquired by the company that we

49:03.860 --> 49:08.500
were covering because you really knew his stuff so then you know we had to shut it down

49:08.500 --> 49:13.140
and focus on other things and that probably was for the best you know isn't it gone down

49:13.140 --> 49:20.640
though the game yeah no it's still going I don't know how many get out yeah yeah really

49:20.640 --> 49:25.180
yeah it's still going it's free to play now too of course Star Trek online all right well

49:25.180 --> 49:28.860
