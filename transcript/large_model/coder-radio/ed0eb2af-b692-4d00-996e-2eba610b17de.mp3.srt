00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,800
This is Coder Radio, episode 402 for February 22nd, 2021.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,100
Hello friends and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,080
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,560
Now running for nearly 402 years, my name is Chris and joining us every single week

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,160
perched in the perfect podcast position, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,160
Hello Mike.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,160
Hello, sir.

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,160
When the Jar Jar does it, it's legal.

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,560
Oh, I get a shiver down my spine.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
It's legal?

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,560
That wasn't my best Jar Jar voice.

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
I'm going to take that again.

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
Missa back bitch.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,560
Oh, well.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,560
Right off the top.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Here we go.

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:01:02,960
One of those episodes right off the top, send your angry emails to WestPain at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,680
I thought we were starting those to Alan still.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,880
You know, Alan doesn't take the bait.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,060
Alan's like, yeah, whatever, Mike, just yeah, that's true.

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,360
You know, as you know, he still wants to make everybody happy.

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
I know.

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
Wes is always helping.

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
We love Wes.

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
Wes is great.

26
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
He's helping right now.

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
He's helping right now.

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,280
As we, as we fixed your, cause you had, okay.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,600
Surprise topic, Chris.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Okay.

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Why are you moving my cheese again and changing our recording technology?

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,800
Listen, you know, I'm going to be real gentle with you, darling.

33
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,360
You know, I appreciate that you're sensitive to this kind of stuff.

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,920
I hate this kind of stuff.

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
You know, I know.

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,920
You know how I get.

37
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
I know.

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
That's why I understand.

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
That's why we're testing it real good.

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
I promise.

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Wes was right.

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
But you know how Wes gets.

43
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,720
He finds real good stuff sometimes.

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,840
Get out of here.

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,120
Why can't we just run like Skype?

46
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,720
Isn't that what we started with, with Skype?

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
I think so.

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,760
I think it was Skype.

49
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
That was awful.

50
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
That was bad.

51
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
I know.

52
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
I know.

53
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,720
You know, every now and then there's new tools that come along.

54
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,840
Tools that are not trapped in a web browser.

55
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,720
Tools that are dedicated apps on the desktop that solve problems.

56
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Wait a minute.

57
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Wait a minute.

58
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Desktop apps?

59
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Yeah.

60
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Can we run on Linux?

61
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Yes.

62
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Of course.

63
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Mac?

64
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
Yep.

65
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
Windows?

66
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Yep.

67
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
Even iOS and Android.

68
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
Mm-hmm.

69
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
What about FreeBSD?

70
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
FreeBSD.

71
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
FreeBSD.

72
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
Of course.

73
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
I thought you were running Windows 10.

74
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,200
How is that journey going still?

75
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,000
Are you still in the Windows 10 land?

76
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,160
I've been doing a lot of.NET development and yeah.

77
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Yeah?

78
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,200
You just want to jump right into this?

79
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
You want to do this?

80
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,800
I think if I ask you for a few weeks straight, eventually we're going to get to the point

81
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,360
where Windows is really starting to grade on you.

82
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,160
And I don't know if it's this week or if it's next.

83
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,320
I'll put it this way.

84
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,360
Visual Studio is a dream come true.

85
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Yeah.

86
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,280
And if the entire operating system were like Visual Studio.

87
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
Yeah.

88
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
Right.

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
It would be great.

90
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Alas, it's not.

91
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,720
See, what I want is Mac OS without the creepy, you know, I'm going to tell you what you can

92
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,360
and can't run on your computer stuff with Visual Studio.

93
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,800
And please don't send me Visual Studio for Mac.

94
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,880
That's just rebranded mono developer Xamarin Studio.

95
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,880
No.

96
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
We've been there.

97
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
We've done that.

98
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
But like Windows 10, it's...

99
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Okay.

100
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
You do this to yourself.

101
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
All right.

102
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,040
32 gigs of RAM does not go nearly as far on Windows 10 as it does on POP or Mac OS.

103
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
I completely agree.

104
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,320
And I'm not even like saying the Apple Silicon magic.

105
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
No, I'm not trolling.

106
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Right.

107
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,260
It just doesn't get you the same distance.

108
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,620
Like when people have Windows boxes with 32 gigs of RAM, I understand why.

109
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,640
So I bought this Lenovo ThinkPad, a Yoga X360, I bought it on a President's Day sale.

110
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,080
And it's a lovely piece of hardware.

111
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
I love it.

112
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
It's great.

113
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,680
I finally get the ThinkPad love.

114
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
You all were right.

115
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,080
But I did not know that I needed more memory.

116
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,680
And I really need more memory.

117
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Yeah.

118
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,760
It's slow.

119
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,440
Like my typing seems laggy in Visual Studio.

120
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,700
Yikes.

121
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,040
It says I'm only consuming like 60% of the RAM, but somehow things just sort of like

122
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
the start menu.

123
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,520
I hit the Windows key and it's delayed.

124
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,760
I don't get it.

125
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,120
Like Mac OS is fine and does not have these problems.

126
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,680
Well, isn't this kind of the problem with the Windows OEM model is that there's no one

127
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,120
that says this is the minimum bar that these applications.

128
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,280
I'm just going to play devil's advocate because I don't think I actually believe this.

129
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,780
But let's get in the headspace of Apple for a minute.

130
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,300
They have a pro user work group that validates these different machines can run different

131
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,560
workloads and they won't ship a MacBook Pro that can't do a certain kind of workload.

132
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,420
I'm not trying to defend Apple here.

133
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,520
This just seems to be my observation from the outside.

134
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,560
I think you could probably say the same kind of thing for system 76.

135
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
They're going to sell a laptop at a certain category of user and they won't sell a laptop

136
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,680
that can't meet the certain requirements that they have with and they're looking at it from

137
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,020
an application level, an OS level and a hardware level.

138
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:05,480
But Lenovo, not so much because somebody else who buys that yoga that has 16 gigs of RAM

139
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,160
and say they're only running Edge and Outlook, it's going to be completely sufficient.

140
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,740
So Lenovo doesn't really have like this kind of baseline that they're going to guarantee

141
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,780
is going to work well.

142
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:22,320
They're just kind of targeting a real rough demographic, I feel like I don't know.

143
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
This is not a cheap machine.

144
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
True.

145
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,080
I mean, granted, it's last year's model and granted I got it on sale, but it's I don't

146
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
know.

147
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
I mean, I have my lemur.

148
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Is it a lemur?

149
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Is it a darter?

150
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,120
I always messed it up.

151
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,040
You mean lemur.

152
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,320
Lemur from Carle de Shell at System76.

153
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Rochelle.

154
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Rochelle from Paris.

155
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
Sorry, Carle.

156
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
So sorry.

157
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:54,000
And it's like, granted, the battery life, not great, but it's fast and I don't feel

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,640
like PyCharm is lagging behind.

159
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:03,040
The Mac is literally the platonic ideal of perfection because of Apple Silicon.

160
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,800
I have nowhere to go from that statement.

161
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
It's bold.

162
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,040
It seems like 16 gigs of RAM should be enough to me.

163
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,680
Well, my diagnosis is then that the paper cuts are beginning to set in already.

164
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,720
Well, it's just annoying.

165
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,680
But like Visual Studio is a masterpiece.

166
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,440
Now devil's advocate, maybe the things I like about Visual Studio are just so heavy and

167
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,400
so memory intensive that that's actually what's causing me issues.

168
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,840
Anybody who's trying to run a workload like that is going to have performance issues.

169
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,440
Like if you were trying to do Premiere right now, you'd be having you'd be having the same

170
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
problems, my friend.

171
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,000
Not with my Xeons, baby.

172
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,760
So having said that, I solve all problems being the Democrat that I am, which is ironic

173
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,000
because we don't talk about that anymore.

174
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,320
I bought a very or a somewhat expensive Lenovo monitor.

175
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Oh, really?

176
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,480
It has a built in camera and mic, huh?

177
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,560
Because I am going to hook up the Thaleo again as my daily driver.

178
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Good call.

179
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,320
I saw pictures on your Twitter of the Thaleo opener.

180
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,360
Are you swapping out components again?

181
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,200
Los Siento, Carl Los Siento.

182
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,440
I may be modifying the fan to make it quiet.

183
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,840
You have one of the early models, and I think that's an area that I have.

184
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,400
I have one of the first models that has the it's a little loud.

185
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,720
I mean, we did the decibel test with a year and a half and I was like, Mike, you can't

186
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
use that to podcast.

187
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,080
You're like, Mike, go get your Mac and shut up and just pretend like you're running Linux

188
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,560
because we need the clicks.

189
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
It's no good.

190
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
It's no good.

191
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,480
Like right now, I'm an iMac Pro and you know what you're not hearing?

192
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,200
The iMac Pro because it I'm not even sure it has fans.

193
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,280
I mean, I know it does, but yeah, I think they've come on twice.

194
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,800
Having said that, you should totally buy a Thaleo.

195
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,880
The new ones do not do what mine does because they I guess they fixed it.

196
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,720
I am elated to hear that you're coming over to the workstation master race.

197
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,280
I think it is the superior performance choice.

198
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,760
I would watch the term master race these days.

199
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,040
I'm just just saying, yeah, but I'm labeling you, not me.

200
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
So fine.

201
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,160
Oh, so I'm the Nazi.

202
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Great.

203
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,180
I am blonde hair and blue eyes.

204
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
Let's just keep going.

205
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,760
I need that as a soundboard clip.

206
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Just pointing that out.

207
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,120
Anyways, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

208
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,440
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

209
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

210
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
All right, fair enough.

211
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,220
I actually I was on Newegg and for a for a lull I was looking at the price of video cards.

212
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:35,400
I don't know if you've gone down this rabbit hole, but it's comical, it's comical like a modern video card.

213
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,180
If it's in stock, a great deal would be seven hundred dollars right now.

214
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,800
It's ridiculous.

215
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,040
It's so bad that Nvidia is coming up with this cockamamie scheme where they're going

216
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,200
to have mining only cards and then they're going to artificially limit the gaming cards

217
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,160
so that when they do mining workloads, they're cut in half via the driver.

218
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Wait, this is real.

219
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Yeah.

220
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,880
This is such a like using the software driver to limit the hardware.

221
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,640
It really pushes my buttons.

222
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,680
AMD is having trouble making theirs.

223
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,720
There's a global chip shortage that's impacting everybody.

224
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,400
So I was looking at it and I thought this is just not the time to try to upgrade my

225
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
workstation.

226
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,560
But, you know, that'll be my next thing by the end of the year is I'm going to try to

227
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,820
refresh my desktop workstation into something that's pretty powerful and I'm going to start

228
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,440
with a high refresh rate monitor and work my way out from there.

229
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,920
I decided I guess I don't get it.

230
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,880
Why are they discouraging people from buying their cards?

231
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,440
They are having a hard time making enough to meet demand.

232
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,620
Gamers aren't getting access to these cards.

233
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,620
That has a knock on stagnation effect for the rest of the gaming industry.

234
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:45,160
But also, it means that neither customer is satisfied, neither the miner who wants to

235
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,140
mine some cryptocurrency, nor the gamer is satisfied.

236
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,080
And you have a bunch of miners who when they can are buying up a whole bunch of these cards.

237
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,120
Yeah, but their money's good, too, right?

238
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
I know.

239
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,320
And here's the worst part, Mike, is these mining only cards can't be used for gaming

240
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,440
later on.

241
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,760
So when the miners move on, they just go in the landfill.

242
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,800
They're not going to go on like eBay.

243
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,000
This seems like the dumbest way to solve this problem possible.

244
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,280
I think Nvidia realized that they're going to have a problem, that you'd have the use

245
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,440
market come along and dump a whole bunch of cards in a year or two undercutting their

246
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,740
market price.

247
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,840
And so they decided to make this move, which is just it's cold.

248
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,760
You know, it's a cold move.

249
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,920
And you know that that driver limitation is going to get bypassed in under a month.

250
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,920
As I say, you know, there's like 15 guys in Eastern Europe ready to get around that at

251
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
any point.

252
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
You know it.

253
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
And you know, they're sitting there in their coders.

254
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Oh, Jesus.

255
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Go ahead, Chris.

256
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
I'm muting.

257
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,400
I'm muting because I know I'm not supposed to swear on the show anymore.

258
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Just do it.

259
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,280
Well, you know, time is running out for the coder.

260
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
That's right.

261
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,320
The Coder Radio robe.

262
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,120
It's almost it's almost gone, folks.

263
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,760
At the end of the month, eleven fifty nine p.m., we're done.

264
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
It's true.

265
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,100
It's you know what you could say.

266
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:08,400
This is the final countdown for the coder.

267
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:17,920
OK, the fact that you made this happen just drives me crazy and the fact that every single

268
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,840
day on Twitter, someone has to tell me, hey, Mike, hope you're having a good day.

269
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Look what I just bought.

270
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,760
I mean, at least you're getting a robe out of the deal.

271
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,360
I even bought one myself because I I sincerely didn't believe that this would be successful.

272
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,960
The only way is through, Mike.

273
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,400
It's the only way out.

274
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
I get it.

275
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
This is the battle of the bulge.

276
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,360
I just have to shoot and shoot and shoot and like fight.

277
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,460
Right.

278
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,960
And you know, we'll see.

279
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,800
We'll see what happens because I can't guarantee that the robe is gone forever, but I think

280
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
this is the only one.

281
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
I don't know.

282
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,080
You know, so this is a special moment in Coder Radio history right now.

283
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,520
If everybody who has tweeted at me has actually bought a robe, we should never stop selling

284
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
rooms.

285
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
I know.

286
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
I know.

287
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
You know, I know.

288
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Unless they're lying.

289
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,480
But I don't think we've even I don't think we've crossed the 150 mark yet.

290
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
I don't think so.

291
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,800
That's you know, but it's all it would really take to make this viable, assuming we don't

292
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,440
die in the international shipping.

293
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,080
If the international shipping ends up being half the cost of the robe, I'm going to have

294
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
a problem.

295
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,320
But we'll find out.

296
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,360
The Coder dot shop and then the next thing I'm going to tackle after this is figuring

297
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,520
out how to do multiple sizes and colors for some other swag item.

298
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,840
Can I recommend just this is just me trying to help the audience for the same people in

299
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,320
the audience, which I know there's only five of you left.

300
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,240
There is a poster, a Coder Radio 400 poster.

301
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Mine came today, actually.

302
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,640
Oh, do you know if we did a video show, do you know what my backdrop is?

303
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
The last one.

304
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,920
It's the 300 poster framed, the old one with the green Emacs logo.

305
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,600
Yeah, this one looks really sharp with the new logo.

306
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Really happy with it.

307
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
I'm going to get it framed and I'm going to put it up on the wall in the studio.

308
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,920
I'll have to do the same just out of pure jealousy.

309
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,800
But you know what I will always do now?

310
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Hmm.

311
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,200
So, you know, I'm starting an OnlyFans, right?

312
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I've been waiting.

313
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,720
Hey, the fact that you laugh, you know what I'm saying?

314
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
I'm waiting.

315
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,520
You know, I've been thinking this is the way to go.

316
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,040
I'm thinking, you know, we have the Coderly report, right?

317
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Yeah, yeah.

318
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,360
This is the only fans where I dress in the Coder robe and I code in whatever language

319
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,680
the audience picks, which I can already see the PHP coming because many people have tweeted

320
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,880
it at me because I tweeted this idea out.

321
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:35,400
So just so I'm clear, what would be the product would be, would be you, a grown man in a robe,

322
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,240
complaining that people keep choosing PHP over and over again and then having people

323
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
pay for that.

324
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,680
Well, it doesn't have to be PHP.

325
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,280
I mean, if there are particular status in the audience, they could be vBasic.

326
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,960
I mean, vB6.

327
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
I mean, I don't know.

328
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Okay.

329
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,440
I actually think now I think I'd pay for that myself, actually.

330
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Now I see what you're saying.

331
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,840
I know for a fact Wes would get in there because he did this to me for free.

332
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Right.

333
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,840
About a year ago.

334
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Yeah.

335
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,280
I think this is something we should do.

336
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,640
So please comment on the show if you would like to torture me.

337
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,560
This could be a new platform for developers to raise money for their project.

338
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,360
Yeah, it's going to be me and a bunch of dancing girls, let's say.

339
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Right.

340
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,320
And you know what I love about it is everyone's wearing a robe.

341
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,880
Yes, I will wear the damn robe, okay?

342
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,840
So go get it now, thecoder.shop.

343
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,680
I will never forgive the audience for the robe.

344
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,040
I'm just letting them know.

345
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,160
This really is, they're the ones that encouraged me, you know, with the emails.

346
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
How did this?

347
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
You know what?

348
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Let's just move on.

349
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
Okay.

350
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
All right.

351
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
All right.

352
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,160
The robe is a thing for me.

353
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,600
The robe is very triggered by the robe.

354
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Let's just keep going.

355
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,680
It'll be a thing, but we'll heal and we'll move forward.

356
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,960
I'm willing, of course, to make money off the robe.

357
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:51,120
All right, well, it is a special time to mention that a Cloud Guru has a 20% off business plans

358
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,920
promotion going right now.

359
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,280
If you use the promo code SPRINGINTOCLOUD21, you'll save for your whole team.

360
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,840
You know the cloud's growing.

361
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,680
In fact, 82% of companies have ramped up their investment in cloud computing as a response

362
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,960
to the pandemic.

363
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,920
So a Cloud Guru has a spring sale right now.

364
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,560
It's the perfect time to plant the seeds for your digital transformation.

365
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,360
Fast-track into the cloud with the most effective and comprehensive cloud training platform

366
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
out there.

367
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
That's a cloudguru.com.

368
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,160
You go over there and use the promo code SPRINGINTOCLOUD21.

369
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,640
96% of customers saw improved results within six months when they surveyed 400 users.

370
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,960
SPRINGINTOCLOUD21 at a cloudguru.com.

371
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
We have some email.

372
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Should we do email?

373
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
Maybe we should do email.

374
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
That might be best.

375
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Can you send me a robe email?

376
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
I don't know, actually.

377
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,720
No, the first one's actually about keyboards.

378
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
That's classic.

379
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
That should make you feel better.

380
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
All right, fine.

381
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
Notjohn writes in.

382
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,480
He says, can we get an update on the Keychron mechanical keyboard that Chris ordered?

383
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,760
They're on my short list of options, but I hear they're a bit tall and usually require

384
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,700
a wrist rest.

385
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,920
So I have the Keychron right here.

386
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,400
I've talked about it a little bit on the show.

387
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,280
It's been a few weeks, though, so it's not a bad time to update.

388
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:13,040
It's the Keychron K3, and it's just this tiny little 65% keyboard, and it's USB-C or Bluetooth,

389
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,840
and it has really low profile keys.

390
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,920
And they even sell a little baggie that I have linked in the show notes.

391
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,600
This is a perfect portable keyboard to go in your bag.

392
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,760
This would have a no impact on my bag, weight or really size.

393
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,320
It's lower profile than a normal keyboard, so you have to be comfortable with that.

394
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,600
The lighting options are really cool, and it has a switch to move between Mac mode or

395
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,360
Windows and Linux mode.

396
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,880
And I'll link to an iMore review, which I pretty much agree right up and down with their

397
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,000
entire review over there.

398
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,840
I think it was Christine Chan that wrote this.

399
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,760
Essentially because of their low profile keys, it's a little bit harder to swap out some

400
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,420
of the keys on this than a typical mechanical keyboard.

401
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,700
So that's a bit of a downside, but it's lightweight.

402
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,340
It's compact as heck, and it does have hot swappable keys if you need to.

403
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:05,480
It has Bluetooth connectivity or USB-C, and it has a lot of nice backlighting options.

404
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:12,200
It's gray for the keys with kind of a soft glow white that comes through the keycaps.

405
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
I like that part a lot.

406
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,800
And then the other thing I'm a big fan of is some of the other keys like Tab and Capslock

407
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,720
and Shift and Enter.

408
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,820
They're a darker gray.

409
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,820
They stand out more.

410
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,000
It's a different color.

411
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,480
And then the Escape key is red.

412
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,400
It comes with a different key, but I like it red, and I have it lit up.

413
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,040
So it looks like the Escape keys, like the abort key on a spaceship or something.

414
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
It types real good.

415
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,480
I mean, this is me kind of banging on it.

416
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,540
And I think it's a great keyboard, but because it is so low profile, it's not quite as satisfying

417
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,720
to type on as I would ultimately like.

418
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,800
If I was buying this to work with an iPad or another sort of ultra portable machine,

419
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,480
I'd be very happy with this.

420
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,600
And because I'm using it here in the studio in a kind of a tight space, it works tremendously

421
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
well.

422
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,480
So if I was going to get a Keychron for myself at home today, I actually would be a little

423
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,920
bit boring and I'd probably go with the K6, which is about a similar size, doesn't look

424
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,960
quite as modern, but has a more traditional depth and size of a keyboard.

425
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
It's not quite as thin.

426
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,960
That's the Keychron K6 wireless mechanical keyboard.

427
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,800
That'd be probably the route I'd go instead of this one.

428
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,560
I don't know if I'd buy this one again, but that's just for my use case.

429
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,040
If I was throwing this in a bag, absolutely this would be the one I'd get again.

430
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
And I really like it.

431
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,100
It's been a nice improvement from what's in here.

432
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,080
So I will link to both of those, the K6 and the K3 in the show notes.

433
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,680
The K3 is sold out right now.

434
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,540
Keychron man, they have travel pouches, they have wood wrist rest.

435
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,400
I don't feel like this needs a wrist rest.

436
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,180
In fact, if anything, I'd say this is lower down to the desk than most keyboards are.

437
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,520
So I like it a lot.

438
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
You're super fancy.

439
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,040
I still like my WASD code keyboard.

440
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
Yeah.

441
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,200
Yeah, we actually have had people write in too with good comments about that.

442
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,240
Yeah, I like the little one, but it's not as little as your mini, but we're ultra slim

443
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
rather.

444
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
And it lights up really cool.

445
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,560
I really like the way it lights up.

446
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:11,320
Anti-hacker Mike wrote in and he has been in a situation and I'd love to hear what you

447
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
think about this.

448
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,720
He says, hey guys, love the show as usual.

449
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,280
I can't, oh here, this is great.

450
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,400
He says, I cannot wait to be listening to it comfortably in the coder.

451
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,560
There it is.

452
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Good job.

453
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Mike, what are you doing?

454
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
He worked it in.

455
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
He worked it in.

456
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,280
We've talked about security a few times here on the show, but he wanted to get our views

457
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,080
on a controversial practice that he has seen on the rise.

458
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,800
He says he's referring to the idea of bug bounties, but not bug bounties like you know

459
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,360
it, where a company basically invites people to hack them and then pays the hacker for

460
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,960
what they find, which is common, you know, Apple and Google and Microsoft and lots of

461
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,200
companies, there's bug bounty that do that.

462
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,520
It seems, anti-hacker Mike writes, that it's becoming an entire career for people where

463
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,360
they essentially bang on stuff and then they come emailing.

464
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,400
He says this all seems well and good until it happened to my web service.

465
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,240
Yeah, a hacker was able to find a small hole in our security and then was able to exploit

466
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
it.

467
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,320
He emailed us with screenshots asking to be paid for finding this bug.

468
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,360
While it sounded like a question, it didn't really feel like a choice.

469
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,640
It felt more like blackmail.

470
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,880
Extortion is the word you're looking for, but yeah.

471
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,280
Yeah, he goes on to say we did end up agreeing to hire him to test the whole site and then

472
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,800
report his findings.

473
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
He did, and then we fixed those issues.

474
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,160
But then, a couple of months later, he came back saying he'd found more things and that

475
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,680
we'd have to pay him again to see them.

476
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,200
I can't help but see this as anything other than a hustle.

477
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,720
We haven't agreed to anything yet, so I'm not sure what will happen next, but what are

478
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,240
your views on this type of practice?

479
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,600
On one hand, it is a service, but on the other hand, it feels forced and not morally right.

480
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
What are your thoughts?

481
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,480
Gather round, children, and let Uncle Mike tell you about New Jersey for a few minutes.

482
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,880
Oh my gosh, that's amazing.

483
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,880
I understand.

484
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,120
I think last week we had a nice conversation about Texas.

485
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
Yep.

486
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,160
Well, it's time to talk about Jersey.

487
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,200
Tell us a little bit, Mike.

488
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,920
I want to make sure we have our glossary of terms.

489
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
Okay.

490
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Extortion.

491
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Uh-huh.

492
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,720
Give me money or I will do something bad to you.

493
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,360
Blackmail.

494
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,560
Give me money or I will share information damaging to you.

495
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,080
Protection racket.

496
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,200
Give me money or I will hurt you.

497
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Right.

498
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,920
Usually it's phrased as, hey, that's a nice website you got there.

499
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,240
Be a shame if all the user data got leaked.

500
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Right.

501
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,280
Now, I am a pretty mild-mannered guy, which, I mean, Chris has hundreds of hours of evidence

502
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,180
to the contrary, but, you know, we just got to let that go.

503
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,640
The first thing you learn when you're in preschool in New Jersey is if somebody shoves you on

504
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,600
the playground, even if they're right, you punch them in the face, no matter what.

505
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,160
You never admit fault.

506
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,240
Chris knows this from dealing with me.

507
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,400
You're sorry only transactionally, right?

508
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,280
You're never really sorry.

509
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,400
Because your mistake in this case, what's the listener's name again?

510
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Anti-hacker Mike.

511
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
All right.

512
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
I'm calling you Vinny.

513
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,120
Vinny, your mistake is you paid this jerk, and jerk is the modified.

514
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,320
You know, we need to do a New Jersey feed of the show where I can say what I really

515
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
think.

516
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Right.

517
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,800
This guy's never going to leave you alone until you get even.

518
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,480
Now, I'm not telling you to break any laws because we don't do that on Jupiter broadcasting.

519
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,040
We do that on Telegram in encrypted chats.

520
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,500
I'm telling you, you got taken for a sucker.

521
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
He came to you.

522
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,120
You paid him, which was not smart.

523
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,080
Now he's coming back for more money.

524
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,080
This is this is mafia tactics right here.

525
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,560
This is the same bullshit people try to pull all the time.

526
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,360
Do you know how many?

527
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,560
Okay, let's go back to classic coder.

528
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,240
I got sued for code journal when it hit the top of the app store.

529
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,560
Like I think it was literally like eight times.

530
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,680
One of the lawsuits, my favorite one, was because I had syntax highlighting.

531
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,840
Remember when that came after podcasts for like playlists?

532
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
Yeah.

533
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
What was it?

534
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,880
I also got hit with the in app purchase one.

535
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
What the hell?

536
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
What was the name of that company?

537
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Wow.

538
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
That was forever ago.

539
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
I remember that.

540
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,880
What the hell was it?

541
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
I don't remember now.

542
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
But whatever.

543
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,480
These are like gangster tactics.

544
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,280
And the mistake you made, Mike, I won't call you Vinny because that was kind of mean, is

545
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
you gave in.

546
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,400
Yes, you may have legitimate issues.

547
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,520
But this person, the way you have at least described him or her, is not behaving like

548
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,160
a security professional.

549
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,080
They're behaving like honestly, like a damn gangster.

550
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,760
Like they're extorting you.

551
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Yeah.

552
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,280
And the minute you lay down to extortion, you're done.

553
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
And I've made the mistake.

554
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:57,280
I have settled lawsuits for bullshit patent stuff that I didn't need to settle.

555
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,280
And you know what?

556
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:04,100
If I could go back in time 10 years, I would tell younger Mike, you know, eff them.

557
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Don't pay a thing.

558
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Fight, fight, fight.

559
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,640
Because let me tell you, all these jerks are paper tigers.

560
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,000
And what are they going to do?

561
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
They're going to write a mean tweet.

562
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,760
They're going to write a mean blog post about you.

563
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Who cares?

564
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,700
People can say whatever they want about you.

565
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,960
This is straight extortion.

566
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,440
Don't give in to it.

567
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,320
And if the guy doesn't leave you alone, honestly, call the FBI and tell him you're doing it.

568
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,800
Because this is a crime.

569
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,080
I know some people in the infosec world will say I'm being too harsh, but this is bullshit.

570
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,600
Yeah, I think you could get him for breaking and entering at this point.

571
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,000
You could get him for for felon abuse.

572
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
What is it?

573
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The 1980?

574
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Mm hmm.

575
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
What the hell?

576
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You know the law better than I do.

577
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The telecom?

578
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
No, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

579
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Right.

580
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,240
That he did not have consent.

581
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,620
So there are real security professionals have get consent to do penetration testing.

582
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,620
That's exactly right.

583
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,620
This is bull.

584
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,060
You're being extorted.

585
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
Even if he's right.

586
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
You don't lay down to this.

587
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,060
Yeah.

588
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
You could.

589
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,060
You definitely should be talking to a lawyer.

590
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,600
There's no there's no doubt about it.

591
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,680
Yeah, I would be talking to a lawyer and the district's attorney at this point.

592
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,320
I this is nonsense.

593
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,760
You don't have to put up with this.

594
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,440
And then at the same time, you could engage with a legitimate firm to start, you know,

595
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,880
helping protect and investigate so that if he does leak something, but a legitimate firm

596
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,680
would not do this without your consent.

597
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
Right.

598
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Absolutely.

599
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,680
You're being attacked.

600
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,780
I have been the sales engineer in those calls and we get stuff signed.

601
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,200
You get stuff signed off before you begin any of this for legal reasons.

602
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,440
And I have been on that end of the transaction.

603
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,080
And by the way, I've been the customer for this stuff.

604
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,960
One of the things that is in the contract from the security firm nondisclosure.

605
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,580
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

606
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:45,120
So the security engineer who finds a flaw in your system, you know, trademark New Jersey

607
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,160
has to keep their damn mouth shut.

608
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,680
They can never say anything.

609
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,640
Once you sign on the dotted line, you you know, you agree to the terms and in there

610
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,880
is going to be a nondisclosure.

611
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,980
It's absolutely part of the standard practice.

612
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,240
And that's why I say you could engage with a firm now and have them start proactively

613
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
working on this.

614
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,580
So that way, what this guy knows is an outdated set of information while you pursue legal

615
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,580
options here.

616
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:11,840
I mean, it's a hell of a situation because, first of all, it angers me because it delegitimizes

617
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,800
an area of I.T. that I think is critically important and something I used to act I used

618
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,600
to I used to do work in.

619
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,880
And, you know, I took it really seriously.

620
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,240
And so that makes me angry.

621
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,040
But additionally, on top of that, like you could see how people could just stay home,

622
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:34,520
do nothing and just poke at WordPress websites and then extort small businesses for money

623
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
all day long.

624
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,720
I am going to say one thing, but like the MadBotter.com is a old WordPress website that

625
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,720
has nothing of value on it.

626
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
So.

627
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Well, absolutely.

628
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,240
But, you know, you go into like some mom and pop hair salon or some shop that has.

629
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,360
Well, and they've got their customer info in WordPress.

630
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
That's a mistake.

631
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,920
And I think you could scare people enough.

632
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,520
People don't understand that a compromised website on their GoDaddy colo doesn't mean

633
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,200
that their credit card point of sales app at their local LAN has been compromised.

634
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,980
They don't get the difference there.

635
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,480
If you come in and say, I've owned your website and I've defaced it.

636
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,000
Now I have access to your customer records.

637
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They would believe you.

638
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,180
Well, that's why the I mean, I know I'm on pretty aggressive ground here, but I I consider

639
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,480
this stuff extortion, especially when it's small businesses.

640
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,440
I've never gotten the pentest thing because I mean, this is maybe too inside baseball

641
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,600
for me, but we're required to do audits and I have to hire them anyway.

642
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,960
It puts you this way, but the professionals, when they find something, don't threaten you

643
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
with it.

644
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Right.

645
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,240
And they actually fix it for you most of the time.

646
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Yeah.

647
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
That's how you know this guy's not legit.

648
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,720
This guy's not legit.

649
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,320
You're being taken for a ride.

650
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,420
This is like, I don't know.

651
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,400
I mean, go watch the movie The Untouchables.

652
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,200
This is the guy who goes to the bar during prohibition that's selling soda.

653
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,680
And then when the guy won't buy his illegal beer from Canada, puts a bomb under it and

654
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,440
kills the little girl.

655
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,920
That's a that's a deep Sean Connery reference.

656
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Sean Connery.

657
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Oh, let's can we pour one out for the only true James Bond?

658
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,960
But yeah, seriously, Mike, do not lay down to this.

659
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
Yeah.

660
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,880
And that is the most New Jersey way I can put this right.

661
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,080
And I don't care what he says.

662
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
Let him say.

663
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,820
Let him say what he's going to say.

664
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,820
This is you.

665
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,880
You are the victim of extortion and it's time to not be a victim.

666
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,000
You got to fight back.

667
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,440
It's no different than if you give in to ransomware, just enables them as well.

668
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,680
It's a exactly, exactly.

669
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
It's a bad racket.

670
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
You got me all fired up.

671
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
All right.

672
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,040
Well, Timer Mike writes in different Mike, my brothers.

673
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,880
Yeah, they're all coming together today.

674
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,200
He when he was listening to the last episode, I mentioned that I was still having an ongoing

675
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:44,440
battle with RSI and he realized that he has adopted techniques in general to sort of mitigate

676
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
and manage this.

677
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,880
He also picked up on you mentioning that you use a Pomodoro timer app when you're on Gnome

678
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Shell.

679
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,840
He said, I'm not really sure when I came across the technique, but it's become a regular part

680
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,440
of my development process for the last 10 years.

681
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,000
I imagine Mike can have a detailed definition of the process for Pomodoro, but for me, this

682
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,800
is how I use it.

683
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:08,280
I try to distill my tasks into simple sentences that can be definitively marked as done when

684
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,700
they are in fact done.

685
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:16,140
So like an example would be account record update when Cognito user is updated and sentence

686
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,000
tasks should just be completable in 30 minutes to an hour and no more than two hours long.

687
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,960
I try to keep to this, but I often lean towards the two to three hour side of things and work

688
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,480
time comprises of 25 minute focus, distraction free efforts, followed by five minutes of

689
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,740
something entirely different.

690
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,300
This is where I've been able to improve my RSI health significantly, giving my hands

691
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,560
and body a five minute break from behind the computer seems to make all of the difference

692
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,120
in the world.

693
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,120
When I'm under time pressure, I'll sometimes abandon my break and keep cranking.

694
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,260
When I do this for long, I inevitably find that my hands and forearms become sore.

695
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:58,080
Over the last year, I started creating a to do today sheet where I list out my distilled

696
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,560
tasks along with the day's date.

697
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,600
I use the leftover space as a doodle pad for ideas and notes.

698
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,480
And at the end of the day or often at the start of the next, I make a journal entry

699
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,880
on the back of the sheet, summarizing my thoughts on the work that was done and what needs attention

700
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
next.

701
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,840
I now have a year's worth of these sheets and I fill that with a three ring binder.

702
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,240
I doubt I will ever go through and read every one of those sheets.

703
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,880
But when you work with intangible goods like software, it's nice to see a stack of something

704
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,040
accomplished in the real world.

705
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,180
I've tried various software timers over the years and they've all had something that

706
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,420
made them difficult to stick with.

707
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,200
When I start blaming those timers for not allowing the technique to work, I decided

708
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,860
just to toss them and go old school kitchen timer from Amazon.

709
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:50,720
It's not great, but it doesn't crash nor does it stop ticking when my OS crashes and I need

710
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
to reboot.

711
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,520
I think there might be a J.B. Swag opportunity for the quote, coder countdown put me down

712
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,520
for three.

713
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
God damn, no.

714
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
I congrats on 400 shows.

715
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,720
What do you think of that, a coder countdown, it's, you know, I think that's something

716
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
right there.

717
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,640
He ought to call himself Merch Mike because I think he's onto something.

718
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,960
This is interesting.

719
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,320
I have been experimenting with a daily brain dump at the end of every workday of what I

720
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,240
think my to do's are for the next day.

721
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,860
And I've actually found what works best is just a text document on my computer that I

722
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,920
just leave running that I just leave up on my screen.

723
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,280
So the next day I come in, it's right there.

724
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280
Get out of town.

725
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,280
We do the same thing.

726
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,880
I have just like a little text document that I pop open on my desktop and that's it.

727
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,280
I have from time to time done the physical, write it down on a piece of paper, and I do

728
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
like that.

729
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,800
And then I would cross off something when I got it done.

730
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,200
I like that crossing off thing.

731
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,900
There is something to when you work on an intangible good to have a tangible good that

732
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,480
represents some accomplished work does feel good because there are every now and then

733
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,040
there's days that I have.

734
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,160
There are always off air days where I feel like I lost an entire day to slack and telegram

735
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,080
and email and I feel gross at the end of the day.

736
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,760
Like what have I done with my day?

737
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,640
Like every day all my time is so precious.

738
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,240
I have so little time to get the stuff done and then I spend an entire day replying to

739
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,320
people and I have nothing to show for it at all.

740
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,000
And so that's where having it, I can look back at a to do list and go, oh no, that's

741
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
right.

742
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,440
I did fix that issue we were having in the studio and I did get so and so contacted about

743
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,040
this and I can look at the list of things I actually accomplished.

744
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,960
And then while I'm thinking about it, okay, but I still need to get all this done.

745
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,480
That's when I do the brain dump for the next day doc.

746
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,440
I could definitely see extending this though and taking some of these breaks that Mike's

747
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,960
talking about here, doing like a focus 25 minute session and then taking a break.

748
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,360
I do need to play around with that a little bit I think.

749
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,920
Pomodoro will change your life.

750
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
Yeah.

751
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,440
I've been doing it for years now.

752
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,560
Little bit of an error here, Mike.

753
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,920
I no longer use the Gnome Pomodoro app because Gnome extensions are fundamentally broken

754
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,000
because Gnome extensions are poorly engineered.

755
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,280
Hey guys, sorry about that.

756
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,360
I keep doing that and I'm sure Eric's pissed off.

757
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,080
I do it on my iPhone because I actually once sold a Pomodoro app and I still have an old

758
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,880
copy of it that I have made run and do not currently sell and it works much better than

759
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
Gnome extensions.

760
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,480
Chris, did I miss anything I wanted to insult today?

761
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
I don't think so.

762
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,040
I mean, you could, I mean we could throw shade at Chrome or Android.

763
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,520
We haven't done that in a while.

764
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
No, you know what?

765
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,400
We don't throw shit at Android because Google, no, I feel like Fuchsia is going to do it

766
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
for us.

767
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,760
I feel like Chrome OS overtaking Mac OS, like just like dunked mercilessly on Android.

768
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
Oh right.

769
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,480
I mean, somehow Google is its own worst enemy in like the weirdest way.

770
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Yeah.

771
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,600
That Chrome OS becoming the second largest OS is kind of remarkable audience.

772
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,360
This is how it happens when my kid's not here and we no longer have structure to the show.

773
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,880
I have a bone to pick with you.

774
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Oh, all right.

775
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
With the audience or with me?

776
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
You personally.

777
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
Oh, okay.

778
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
All right, good.

779
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Okay.

780
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,080
All of the audience, the rogue thing, guys, if he makes a timer, we might take another

781
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,120
couple of month hiatus here because I don't know if I can take it.

782
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,120
You guys got to stop.

783
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,880
Martini glasses, sure.

784
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,280
Coffee cups, yes.

785
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,080
I've noticed certain Linux commentators.

786
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:27,400
I'm not going to name names, Chris, Chris, Chris, counting Chrome OS as desktop Linux.

787
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Is that what I heard?

788
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
What I thought I heard?

789
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Hmm.

790
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
I may have in some context.

791
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,800
I kind of waffle on that.

792
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,040
You're a little pussy footed on that.

793
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
I could say.

794
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,120
I mean, what do you what do you consider?

795
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,160
It's Gentoo under the hood.

796
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Is it Gentoo?

797
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
I mean, I know you can run devs.

798
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,160
I mean, yeah.

799
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,880
And you can run some Linux desktop apps as well now.

800
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
Gooey ones.

801
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
I know.

802
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,760
But it feels like when people used to claim Android installs as Linux installs.

803
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
Oh, yeah.

804
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Yeah, maybe.

805
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
Yeah.

806
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
Like it.

807
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,400
Here's the problem.

808
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Here's the thing, Mike.

809
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,040
It's like what what slice of Linux are we talking about?

810
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,160
Are we talking about like desktop Linux?

811
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,400
Because then, yeah, I don't think it's actually fair to count Chrome OS at all, actually.

812
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,440
Oh, we're talking desktop Linux, right?

813
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
Servers Linux wins, right?

814
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
IOT Linux wins.

815
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,760
I sell everything on servers and IOT is Linux.

816
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Fine.

817
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
I'm with you.

818
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,200
I change my wallpaper background every 30 minutes and that feels like a problem.

819
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,240
Oh, man.

820
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:31,720
You know, it's I feel like Chrome OS is it's closer to a Linux machine than Mac OS is to

821
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
a Unix workstation.

822
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
What?

823
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
You got a vape pen there?

824
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,580
I think you're nuts.

825
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,580
Are you joking?

826
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,180
No, no, because you can get a Linux command line.

827
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,360
You can run Linux, gooey applications.

828
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,720
That itself is based on Linux and it runs a Linux kernel.

829
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Hang on.

830
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,040
You said Unix, not Linux.

831
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
Right.

832
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,440
Yeah, because like Mac OS, while it has it has a BSD user land, it has its own wackadoodle

833
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,440
kernel.

834
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,000
It doesn't have the entire BSD user land.

835
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,660
It has its own init manager, whereas everything on the Chrome OS side, it's Linux kernel.

836
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,120
It's an open source init manager.

837
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,920
It's got the Linux user land and it runs Linux desktop applications.

838
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,400
And they're even converting the sucker to a Wayland based display system.

839
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
So it's like.

840
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,640
Yes, because Wayland was always a good idea.

841
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,440
My point is, it's a lot of the Linux stack there where the Mac is their own proprietary

842
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,200
UI, a good portion of the BSD user land and their own kernel.

843
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:32,000
Hey, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, let's take a breath, OK?

844
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,280
First of all, the Mac kernel is amazing.

845
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,920
Darwin is amazing.

846
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,760
You're fundamentally wrong in every possible way here.

847
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
All right.

848
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,680
Yes, the Mac user land is a little schizophrenic.

849
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,520
It sometimes thinks it's an iPad and doesn't know what it's doing.

850
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:56,320
Like for instance, I was texting a person and it decided that it forgot who she was

851
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,400
at some point in iMessage and sent me the same notification 10 times on my phone because

852
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,840
I sent it from my iMac.

853
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,840
Sure.

854
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:10,080
Still, I would say Mac is more BSD than Chrome is Linux or Chrome OS is Linux, I should say.

855
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
I don't know, man.

856
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
I don't know.

857
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
Have you seen BSD?

858
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Yeah.

859
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

860
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
Yeah, it's great.

861
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,040
I mean, we know people who run BSD and they pretty much won Windows 7, is my understanding.

862
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,040
You would be correct.

863
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
You would be correct.

864
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
I would be correct.

865
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,600
I know I'm correct.

866
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,360
So I don't know.

867
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,600
I mean, I think we should all run Pop OS and Carl, I don't know why I'm in love with Carl

868
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
today.

869
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
I don't know.

870
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,200
All I want to do is change my background every 30 minutes and not have my OS crash.

871
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,960
He's got your back, you know, because-

872
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
He really doesn't.

873
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
This one issue-

874
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,280
His team's making their stuff in Rust and TypeScript, so you should be happy hunky dory

875
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
there.

876
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,440
I was with you on Rust and I'm judging them harshly on TypeScript.

877
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Oh, hell, okay.

878
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,680
I thought it was a, I thought it showed a progressive move on their part.

879
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,200
I think, and I don't mean this to be flamey and I know some people will read into it and

880
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,680
it'll be controversial.

881
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,560
I think the gnome team should just apologize for extensions, RM tack R the entire repo

882
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,160
and start over with KDE.

883
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
Oh God.

884
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,440
And I don't mean it to be controversial.

885
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,720
No, of course not.

886
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
No, not, no, obviously not.

887
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,280
Again, Noble pain on Twitter is where you want to send your feedback.

888
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,280
Right.

889
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Or Alan at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

890
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Alan never replies.

891
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,280
Alan's no fun.

892
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
It's because he's smart.

893
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
He knows.

894
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
He's on Windows 7.

895
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,840
He doesn't even, he can't even get the messages.

896
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:39,680
Linode.com slash coder, go there to support the show and get a $100 60 day credit.

897
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,200
Now I got to check this, Mike, are you slipping a hundred, a hundred dollars into this?

898
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,200
That doesn't seem real.

899
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
How can they afford to do that?

900
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,560
I thought it was just a champagne room.

901
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
I'm sorry.

902
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Nope.

903
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
It's true though.

904
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,440
$100 in, uh, in account credits for 60 days when you create a new account at Linode.com

905
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
slash coder.

906
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,160
I spent everything up on Linode now.

907
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
Like everything.

908
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,640
If it's a game server for my kids or if it's the backend infrastructure for a community

909
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,560
chat system, I spin it up on Linode.

910
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,400
One of the things that we run right now is a piece of software that has replaced Google

911
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,640
docs for me completely.

912
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,640
It's coming along.

913
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,760
It's had a few name changes, but I really like where they're, where they're going with

914
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,760
it.

915
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,760
It's called hedge doc.

916
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,220
It's a self hostable real time collaborative text editing Markdown editor.

917
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,080
It's like everything I needed in Google docs, but it specializes in Markdown and you can

918
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,560
host it yourself.

919
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,280
That's something that we put up on Linode.

920
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,700
So our team has a URL they go to, and that's where our hedge doc instances and it works

921
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,920
great for that.

922
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,920
When we're done with this, we're going to upload these files to a system running on

923
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,540
Linode that our editor drew will download it from, and when he's done, he'll submit

924
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:48,920
it back up to a Linode system that will encode it and then publish it out to the web.

925
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,520
We do all of that on Linode.

926
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,280
So if you're if you're brand new and you just want to get started, Linode has great plans

927
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,960
that are totally accessible price wise and UI wise.

928
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,840
You can get started right away or if you really know what you're doing and you can mix and

929
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,840
match different technologies like their object storage and their cloud firewall and of course

930
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,400
their GPU or dedicated CPU systems, you could really build an infrastructure that's just

931
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,800
unmatchable to anything you could have done years ago.

932
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,160
Linode has been around since 2003, so they have followed this market very closely.

933
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,320
But they were in this, I think, before we were calling this cloud computing, right?

934
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,600
They started before AWS.

935
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:29,040
They started before Google or any of the enterprise cloud providers got into this.

936
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,000
Because of that, they've been able to really focus on a few things and do them extremely

937
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
well.

938
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,680
And they're 30 to 50 percent less in cost than the other enterprise cloud providers

939
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,040
while still having incredibly great network connections because they've been in this.

940
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,160
They can network.

941
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,660
They've been in this for a long time.

942
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:50,040
They know how to serve this up for an end user and make it super accessible.

943
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,600
They know how to check all of those boxes and do it really well.

944
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,360
And they're my server provider of choice because of that and a lot of other reasons.

945
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,760
But I encourage you to just go check it out.

946
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,040
There's only so much I can really tell you in the show.

947
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,620
For the rest, you just got to take a little time and try it.

948
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,320
And that's why they're making this $100 offer right now.

949
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,820
Go to linode.com slash coder, go over there, sign up, support the show and just try some

950
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,160
of it out and see what I've been talking about.

951
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,160
See what you can do.

952
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,640
You can deploy it for infrastructure that's client facing or for back end stuff for yourself

953
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,640
or your community.

954
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,840
And they have 11 data centers to choose from.

955
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,300
So you can find something that's close to whoever is going to be using the system.

956
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,680
Try it out at linode.com slash coder.

957
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,380
I just want you to know the monsters that listen to the show live have been tweeting

958
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,640
me purchasing coder robes.

959
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,800
You know what, Robbros, I appreciate you out there.

960
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,640
I need you this week, Robbros.

961
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,440
I hate every single one of you with a passion that only equals the memory leakage of Swift

962
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,040
versus Objective-C. I completely made that up, but most of you don't write Swift and

963
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,880
I could have totally passed that off as a fact.

964
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,240
Robros includes ladies and also children.

965
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,960
Robros also includes dogs.

966
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,800
That'd be amazing.

967
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,360
So maybe before we get out of here, maybe we should impart people with some wisdom.

968
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,680
You found a really good article about starting a niche, finding your niche and starting in

969
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,680
one.

970
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,640
And we will link to this in the show notes.

971
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,400
It's it's wow.

972
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,660
This is the week of mics.

973
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,680
It's also written by a guy named Michael.

974
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,680
So many of us.

975
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,680
We are leeching.

976
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,800
This is getting weird, man.

977
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,160
This is the like the third or fourth mic-ception.

978
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
That's wild.

979
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,500
But anyways, he starts with the most popular products don't become mass or popular overnight.

980
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,640
It's a process.

981
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,640
Usually their popularity is uneven and they're known in some niches, but not very popular

982
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
in other niches.

983
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,200
When you start a product, sometimes you know that niche already and you can easily define

984
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,880
and target that customer.

985
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,300
But in many cases, you just don't know.

986
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:51,460
And you try to find the niche and the miraculous niche market fit that will work for your product.

987
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:55,480
One of the most common mistakes is to ignore niches and just try to attract all kinds of

988
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,520
customers going just for that general customer.

989
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,600
But I tell you, it's essential to find one or two ponds to start from and then expand

990
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,680
to the other larger, more promising lakes and oceans later.

991
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,560
And then what Michael does is he goes through here and lays out some classic technologies

992
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,120
that started as strange niche products, but now are huge.

993
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:24,120
The telegraph, the telephone, the photograph, the car, the radio, the radio was immediately

994
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,320
adopted by the British Royal Navy.

995
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,100
They thought the radio could speed up communication between ships and they were right.

996
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,040
Really, it took a lot longer until others adopted the radio.

997
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,600
So radio was introduced in 1895.

998
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:42,720
In 1912, the Titanic sent a distress signal, but the radios were turned off on the closest

999
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,560
ships because they just simply weren't using them back then.

1000
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,600
Well, they didn't have the Windows Vista patch.

1001
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
Yeah.

1002
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Yeah.

1003
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,660
Which meant you had to reboot or else your router and radio service were down.

1004
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,360
With apologies to Paul Thoreau.

1005
00:43:54,360 --> 00:44:00,160
VisiCalc also, you know, Excel's predecessor that launched in 1979, classic, first adopted

1006
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,800
by accountants, businessmen and analysts joined the party much later on.

1007
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,760
Accountants saw the value right away in VisiCalc, but the others in the business stack took

1008
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,900
a lot longer before they realized what spreadsheets would be used for now.

1009
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,060
Now entire companies run off of Excel.

1010
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,360
And I thought this just, it really was a really wise article that you found.

1011
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,440
I set it aside to read it and I read the whole thing and he really makes the case for how

1012
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,260
you have to find a niche.

1013
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,280
You have to focus on it.

1014
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,260
He says, how do you find that niche?

1015
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,760
You can use Conway's law, which you can look that up, but he said it's only a partially

1016
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,760
a joke.

1017
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,560
You review a couple of the alternatives, you look at what you know best, you select that,

1018
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,820
and then you execute as best as you can.

1019
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:47,180
In a way, startups are kind of like an experimentation facility that hypothesizes, executes, and

1020
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,840
then measures their results.

1021
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,400
And the startups that are successful are the ones that find the right niche.

1022
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,080
I mean, I have the sense just from doing this for, has it been 400 years yet?

1023
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,560
I mean, are we older than the country?

1024
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,560
Right.

1025
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,200
No, actually, if you check, if you look at the map this week, it's 402 years.

1026
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,200
True.

1027
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,880
And I believe that the title should be payment required because I know my HTTP error codes.

1028
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,760
And by the way, people are going to look at that and they're going to go, what?

1029
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,600
No, they're going to look at it and they're going to buy a poster.

1030
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,880
You understand what I said?

1031
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,680
And more importantly, what I did not say, no, but seriously, buy a robe.

1032
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,240
It'd be a shame for something to happen.

1033
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,160
You should buy a robe just to be careful.

1034
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,360
Let me explain something to you.

1035
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,280
The Thaleo has been a flight simulator for a long time.

1036
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,900
I have been working on drones for a long time.

1037
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:37,860
There may or may not be some sort of interference with the robes where there are chips in them.

1038
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,440
And then one day you're all going to get painted with the worst possible thing I could think

1039
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,720
of, Swift stickers.

1040
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,000
I have to say a supply chain attack on the robes would be the ultimate long troll.

1041
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
That would be pretty good.

1042
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You know what?

1043
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,300
The problem is you have weirdly aligned my incentives with yours.

1044
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,600
Even though I don't think it's a secret that the robes, I thought you were joking and I'm

1045
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,480
really surprised that there are actually robes.

1046
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,200
I say this every week because I'm not over it.

1047
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Like I got to be honest.

1048
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,600
I, what were you smoking?

1049
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
Inspiration.

1050
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,000
You know, the creative inspiration.

1051
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,320
You did give us a hint at your niche there a little bit, you know?

1052
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,320
I did.

1053
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,520
How long did, I mean that, that going back to that point, that wasn't just an obvious

1054
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,000
for, I mean, it seems like it took you multiple years of getting screwed at different things

1055
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,800
before you kind of landed on that niche for a while.

1056
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,800
Aviation niche.

1057
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,800
Yeah.

1058
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,000
So this is the thing where longtime listeners are going to be like, I heard it before.

1059
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,200
In the beginning, Chris, in the beginning, there was darkness.

1060
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,520
Four hundred years ago.

1061
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,480
And then, you know, a guy named, oh my God, I can't remember the guy's name who created

1062
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,400
Java and I feel like a jerk.

1063
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,400
Gosling?

1064
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,400
Gosling.

1065
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,400
Right?

1066
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,400
Oh, I'm right.

1067
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,400
Gosling.

1068
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,040
I wrote Java applets because I needed money.

1069
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,420
That's a good reason to do anything.

1070
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,760
And then the iPhone came out and I had a Dutch uncle who helped me because I was still young

1071
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,600
enough to need help and bought me a very cheap MacBook.

1072
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,940
I'm not denigrating, but he, he, he hates Apple.

1073
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,320
He still hates Apple to this day.

1074
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,880
Got like the base model.

1075
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,520
He got like the MacBook, right?

1076
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,640
It was like whatever.

1077
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,700
And this is, we're going back a long time, so whatever, it's not even like comparable

1078
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,700
to it.

1079
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,640
Like my MacBook Air could like buy and sell this MacBook four hundred times without using

1080
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,640
like one core.

1081
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,640
Right.

1082
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,600
Are we like talking like early, like the first Intel kind of thing?

1083
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,880
I think we might be second or third.

1084
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,880
No, I think it's second.

1085
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,520
Those early Airs were, they were a special kind of slow.

1086
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,520
Yeah.

1087
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,520
Yeah.

1088
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,720
I had a Dell that I was running Ubuntu on at the time and it was bad.

1089
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,240
Like until snow leopard came out, it was bad.

1090
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,520
I mean, it was just not a good mission.

1091
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,280
I cannot believe you just got a snow leopard mention and I just can't believe you till

1092
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,080
the day I die where you sell the company again, whichever, you know, either way, I think they're

1093
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,280
going to be about the same.

1094
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,280
So same.

1095
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,280
Yeah.

1096
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,280
I don't think you'll ever.

1097
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,280
Yeah.

1098
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,880
So yeah, I came up in the, uh, the iPhone app gold rush.

1099
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,600
I did the code journal thing later on the Mac app store.

1100
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,920
That was kind of how I got this guy with the good hair's attention.

1101
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,880
And then how long, how long did I ride the iPhone ride for?

1102
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,160
Cause you were around for that.

1103
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,840
I mean, for as long as you possibly could, I went down hard though.

1104
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,840
I messed up.

1105
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,840
I, I held on too long.

1106
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,840
Yeah.

1107
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,840
Yeah.

1108
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,840
Yeah.

1109
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,840
I mean, I, I mean, have you ever fully let go?

1110
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,840
Let's be honest.

1111
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,880
When Swift came out, I think, I mean, I think you have it on tape.

1112
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,520
I'm pretty sure I let go.

1113
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,520
Yeah, that's for sure.

1114
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,520
Yeah.

1115
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,520
That was rough.

1116
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,520
Yeah.

1117
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,520
I was pretty upset.

1118
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,440
Then there was the, the price bottom dropped out of the market when that's the thing that

1119
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:46,600
is a little bit distant now is it wasn't the norm for an app to be a dollar 99 or to use

1120
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,600
a subscription.

1121
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,600
Well, right.

1122
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,760
When I, when I started, right.

1123
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,160
It was totally reasonable.

1124
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:58,080
Like code journal was originally like 10 bucks and then I put it to five, but like that was

1125
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,120
cheap and I did it on purpose because I was trying to get like attention, right?

1126
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,720
Like I was trying to, for my consulting business.

1127
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,880
But like people were selling iPhone apps.

1128
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,720
I mean, I think most of our listeners will not believe this, but people were selling

1129
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,600
iPhone apps for like 20 bucks.

1130
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,600
Yeah.

1131
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,480
Like it was just like, it was a real, it was a thing.

1132
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,720
I remember there was no one app purchase.

1133
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:25,680
There was no, I ads, there was no, like it was a piece of software and then that changed.

1134
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,480
If you really want to know, you can listen to all my moaning and complaining on the back

1135
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,640
catalog because I, I, yeah, right.

1136
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,280
I went through that like, Oh, I lost 40 grand on windows eight.

1137
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,280
Yeah.

1138
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,280
Oh yeah.

1139
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,280
Windows eight.

1140
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,280
I admire your restraint and not mentioning that.

1141
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,520
Oh, you know, I got it.

1142
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,280
I got a jab at you in episode 400.

1143
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,680
So I thought I just good for a little while.

1144
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,760
And then I tried to do all the cross platform stuff to lower consulting prices.

1145
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,600
Did you discover the current that there are not current, but the, the, cause you know,

1146
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,840
there was some bot time in there and then you really did focus in on aerospace for awhile.

1147
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,560
Did you land on that niche by networking at events?

1148
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,560
Kind of.

1149
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,680
So this is where, where I have to love up a brother Chris here.

1150
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,000
So the first aerospace client came from you, right?

1151
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,360
From the show.

1152
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,700
It's one of your Linux hippies who doesn't really run Linux.

1153
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,500
They bought a Thalia and put windows on it.

1154
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,800
So sorry, Carl, Carl, it's been a rough, it's been a rough night for you, Carl.

1155
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,600
I don't know what to say.

1156
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
Sorry, man.

1157
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,760
I mean, the other day he's still selling the box.

1158
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,640
So yeah, he still sells, sold a thread ripper unit for a amount of money that I could have

1159
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,680
bought a car for.

1160
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,120
So you know, whatever.

1161
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:35,760
And then yeah, then it was events that they recommended and it turned out, and it took

1162
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,280
me a long time to figure this out, like longer than it should have, cause you're right.

1163
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:46,340
I was in love with the whole consumer facing software idea that this niche is people are

1164
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:52,300
willing to pay for stuff and like not fight you about a, you know, $4,000 bill.

1165
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,300
They just pay.

1166
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,300
Yeah.

1167
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,120
They're, they're willing to pay consulting fees that actually pay your bills.

1168
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
Right.

1169
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,120
And like you have to travel.

1170
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:03,640
I mean, COVID, COVID is, I can't say it's messed things up cause we're still up year

1171
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:09,260
over year, but it's, I am very good at podcasting.

1172
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,040
No comment necessary, Chris, cause I know I'm terrible.

1173
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,560
I am very good at trade shows.

1174
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,760
I'm very bad at phone sales and zoom calls and email, which you would think I would be

1175
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,680
able to do zoom calls cause it's just like podcasting.

1176
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,520
But I had a zoom call and I know, I know he listens, but another listener of the show

1177
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,840
who's also a fellow podcaster who I won't name because I don't have permission wants

1178
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,920
to hire us for a job.

1179
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,720
And I find something disorienting about zoom.

1180
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,720
Yeah.

1181
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,360
Like I'm, I feel like I'm confused.

1182
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:46,960
I feel like I don't know what I'm doing, but on a podcast or in person, I'm totally cool.

1183
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,960
Right.

1184
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,960
Like I'm, I'm fine.

1185
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,960
I got it.

1186
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,960
Not a problem.

1187
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,440
I have a similar phenomenon that I experienced and I don't know exactly what it is.

1188
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,640
I find zoom calls to be kind of exhausting, not to sound like a wimp, but yes, no, I mean,

1189
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,880
I need coffee afterwards.

1190
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,880
I'm like tired.

1191
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,880
Yeah.

1192
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,280
I got a caffeinate before and I got a caffeinate afterwards.

1193
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:12,360
Where here I have literally been live for two hours and 26 minutes and I feel great.

1194
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,600
I've been on the live stream for two hours and 30 minutes and I'm totally fine right

1195
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,600
now.

1196
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,600
Yeah.

1197
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,040
I don't know why it's a different, it's a different muscle and it totally is exhausting.

1198
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,240
And I, I, I have a couple of times even.

1199
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,800
I will admit to convincing the participant to let me call them instead.

1200
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,800
And I do a little bit.

1201
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,800
Well, I do a lot better.

1202
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,120
I feel like over the phone even than I do on a zoom call because I get up and I walk

1203
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:40,360
around and I put like, or you know, earphones on wireless ear pods and I walk around and

1204
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,640
I, I gestate like a moron and I, I wouldn't gestate.

1205
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,640
Is that the right term?

1206
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,640
I don't think so.

1207
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,640
Gesture.

1208
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,880
And oh, I thought you were pregnant for a minute there.

1209
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,880
Yeah, I do.

1210
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,920
I gestate ideas like a moron.

1211
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,600
I gestate ideas like a moron, but I gesture around and I walk and I pace.

1212
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,600
That's exactly what I do.

1213
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,880
I pace on speakerphone.

1214
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,880
Yeah.

1215
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,880
Yes.

1216
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,880
And when that's taken away from me, it's, it's, yeah, I'm not as effective.

1217
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:11,040
I was, the reason why I asked is I was having a quasi meeting this morning and we were going

1218
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,160
through like sources and material and we were looking at it and like we have, we have a

1219
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,580
lot of great people that we know in the community over the years.

1220
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,640
And I'm, so I'm not taking away from that, but we haven't really added to the list this

1221
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,640
year.

1222
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,700
Like our little black book of people, we can, we can email up and say, Hey, tell me the

1223
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,760
insight scoop on this hasn't really expanded.

1224
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,600
And that's the first time ever that we haven't added people to that list.

1225
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,400
You just had like a guy from NASA on, on like Saturday.

1226
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,520
Yeah, that was great.

1227
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,400
I know that's the, I was going to say, that's the exception.

1228
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,400
I was going to say like, come on man, what are you talking about?

1229
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,080
That, that, so that was a nice feather in the cap for sure.

1230
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:52,320
But the networking has just dropped off like in terms of what it typically would be, you

1231
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:57,900
know, where I was getting at is if you look at like Alex on self-hosted, he came on board

1232
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:03,160
because I met him at a Linux fest in Texas and we started discussing like our shared

1233
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,800
interest on stuff and realized we had a bit of a chemistry and you know, hit it off.

1234
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,260
And then he became, you know, he became one of my co-hosts and I just haven't had that

1235
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,260
for a while.

1236
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,840
I don't mean to bring it back to that again, but I just was wondering if that was pretty

1237
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,160
influential on how you got to where you're at right now or where you had been.

1238
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,960
I don't know if you're still focusing much on aerospace.

1239
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,960
Is that still the case?

1240
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,760
Uh, well, I mean, might as well open the kimono all the way, I guess.

1241
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,200
Ooh, hello, sir.

1242
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,520
You mean the robe, open the robe all the way.

1243
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:39,320
I am aware that I'm getting money off these robes, but at some point dignity matters more.

1244
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,320
I know, I know, I know.

1245
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,320
Don't worry.

1246
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,320
We'll do a mug soon.

1247
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,280
You know, I have to tell you the odds of me not loving this robe and wearing it all the

1248
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,280
time are zero.

1249
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,280
Cause you know what?

1250
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,280
I am going to love this robe, right?

1251
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,760
I'm going to be like, there will be some tweets of me in the robe with nothing else that will

1252
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,200
probably get me banned for a couple of days from Twitter.

1253
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,200
Right?

1254
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Like that's gonna get you canceled.

1255
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,960
I'm going to get, ah, listen, my ex-wife would love to cancel me.

1256
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,960
It's all right.

1257
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,360
I already, there's already a bunch of them.

1258
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:09,000
Ooh, got the bell, the bell, bell and Carl are getting a lot of work today.

1259
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,320
You know, it's a good, that's how, you know, it's a good episode.

1260
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,600
Hey Carl, where's my keyboard, right?

1261
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,760
He's not going to talk to me anymore.

1262
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,760
We should work out a deal.

1263
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:22,000
I'm saying because I think we could sell some keyboards, you know, you know, it's no robe,

1264
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,600
but he's going to pack in a robe.

1265
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
Carl don't do it.

1266
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,600
Yeah.

1267
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,600
Bundle.

1268
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,600
Right.

1269
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,600
There you go.

1270
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,960
What would you do if system 76 stole your robe idea and just like through their little

1271
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,800
robot Zoe, right?

1272
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,800
That's Zoe.

1273
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,120
It's their robot, the character that they developed for the Thalia.

1274
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,120
They should do that.

1275
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,740
No, honestly, the world needs more robes.

1276
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,740
They should do it.

1277
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,740
They should work the idea.

1278
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,360
No, the world needs more COVID vaccines, green energy.

1279
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,360
Yeah.

1280
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,760
But like number four on that list, right?

1281
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,760
It's robes, right?

1282
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,760
I mean, I can keep you on for another five hours telling you things before.

1283
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,760
That's what you want to do.

1284
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,840
And I don't even remember the question you asked me.

1285
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,840
Hold on.

1286
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,520
Cause we were getting to the Komodo about, so I asked you if you're still focusing on

1287
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:05,560
the aerospace or yes, but we accidentally, cause that's how things happen, fell into

1288
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,520
food production because of COVID.

1289
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:16,760
So it turns out we had a person reach out to us doing food production over in Canada.

1290
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,680
And it turns out that they reached out before like COVID was a thing, right?

1291
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,320
But I also live in the state of Florida.

1292
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:28,680
For those who don't know, Florida is famous for alligators, Florida man and Disney world,

1293
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:34,500
but also like a tremendous amount of agriculture, like a shocking amount of agriculture.

1294
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:39,440
But COVID, when you have a bunch of workers living in basically barracks, uh, that's

1295
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,120
a problem, right?

1296
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:47,600
Because one guy or girl gets, or one guy or gal gets COVID and potentially 50 of them

1297
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,280
have it and your entire farm is, uh, screwed.

1298
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,280
Of course.

1299
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:57,280
If you can embed, God damn it, Python, sure.

1300
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,280
Ruby is better.

1301
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:05,680
If you can embed Python into, uh, let's say IOT devices and you can run a Python flask,

1302
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:12,880
big web servers, and you can have like smart.net based UWP tablet apps for the form.

1303
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,240
I'm going to use the word Foreman, but all these different companies have different names,

1304
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,240
but like supervisors.

1305
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,240
Yeah.

1306
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,560
It turns out you can basically minimize your manual labor, therefore your risk of COVID

1307
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,560
exposure while keeping your crop yield up.

1308
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,360
And I don't want to get too much into agriculture.

1309
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:34,200
One I've had to learn a lot about it in the last year, but it's one of those things that,

1310
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,160
you know, Chris, I'm sure you go to the grocery store, you buy some lettuce, you buy some

1311
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:40,120
strawberries, you know, raspberries, raspberries.

1312
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,120
Okay.

1313
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,120
Well, we're, we're, we're based in plant city.

1314
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:47,080
So strawberries are the main crop, but, uh, we actually have the strawberry festival,

1315
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,440
believe it or not.

1316
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,600
You don't think anything of it, right?

1317
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,660
But there's actually hundreds of people working on that farm, right?

1318
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,600
Our whole shtick now is we're minimizing that work.

1319
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,800
So basically on the aviation side, we're killing people on the other side.

1320
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,800
We're feeding people.

1321
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,800
So I don't know where that leaves me.

1322
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,440
I mean, I got to tell you when, when, when I die, St. Peter is going to be like, I don't

1323
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,440
know, man.

1324
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,440
Got a lot of stuff here.

1325
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,440
Yeah.

1326
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,440
Yeah.

1327
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,360
You know, so you can point, you know, you can say, Oh, I answered some questions on

1328
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,360
a podcast.

1329
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,400
That might, that might've been some good, like I told the truth.

1330
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,160
He's like, yeah, you weren't supposed to do that either though.

1331
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,160
So

1332
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:25,080
Datadog.com slash CoderRadio, this episode is sponsored by Datadog, the unified monitoring

1333
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,440
analytics platform for comprehensive visibility into your entire stack.

1334
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,720
If you have on-premises, if you have cloud, if you have a hybrid, something in between,

1335
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:38,660
maybe multiple clouds, get a unified view into all of it, quickly analyze the performance

1336
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:43,260
of your Linux servers in real time and get dashboards that you can move around and build

1337
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,800
to get the information that you need.

1338
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,960
If you're creating an application, if you're trying to monitor something in production,

1339
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,680
wouldn't it be nice to have analytics that are easy to understand and share with your

1340
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,680
team.

1341
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,000
So that way you can communicate your needs to them.

1342
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,400
That's what Datadog does for you.

1343
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,520
And they help you troubleshoot issues in seconds with these unified metrics and traces and

1344
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,680
logs.

1345
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,920
You can look at all of the environment in one snapshot, look inside a container, look

1346
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,600
at the Linux server and look at the application performance as well.

1347
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,140
And then additionally, they have over 400 integrations, just turnkey integrations to

1348
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,120
get Datadog insights into your application.

1349
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:24,280
You combine that with the server metrics, your performance, and you get it all into

1350
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,160
a customizable dashboard.

1351
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,880
And you can take actual action on what you see.

1352
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,880
But you got to get started.

1353
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,360
So go to datadog.com slash coderadio.

1354
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,880
If you set up one dashboard, you now qualify for some free swag, a Datadog t-shirt, but

1355
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,040
you got to go to datadog.com slash coderadio.

1356
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,480
This is a tool to allow you to communicate.

1357
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:51,040
I say that because that's how Datadog started, as a way for the developers to communicate

1358
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,080
to the sysadmins.

1359
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,880
That's such a quintessential problem, communication.

1360
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:01,320
And to have a tool, analytics and data base that you can use to communicate with your

1361
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,360
teams, that's worth its weight in gold.

1362
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,520
So just get started, just see what it can do.

1363
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:11,360
Go to datadog.com slash coderadio.

1364
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,520
All right, Mr. Dominic, one last thing for you before we go.

1365
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:20,000
You mentioned this at the top of the show, does the release of.NET 6, which is getting

1366
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,040
closer and closer, preview one is out, I think today as we record.

1367
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,800
So it'll be a few days by the time people hear this.

1368
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,240
It's out, it's close, this is it.

1369
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:34,280
This is like them bringing the last several six years or so of work together.

1370
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:43,120
So it's the promise of taking a lot of the, what is it, Xamarin, X-Marion, the X-Marion

1371
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:47,600
tools bringing a lot of that and actually bringing it into.NET and creating something

1372
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:53,480
that's actually usable for desktop, web, cloud, mobile, gaming, IoT, Windows, Linux,

1373
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,280
Android, iOS, Mac, even Apple TVs on the list.

1374
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,720
I mean, this is it, it's here, at least in preview.

1375
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:08,160
I'm just kind of, I don't know, curious to get your take on.NET 6 and their new preview.

1376
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,200
So I'm trying to be a little careful here.

1377
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,600
I have not tried the preview yet.

1378
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,560
It's going to be a big like asterisk on this.

1379
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:22,480
You know, I have scars from the Java applet days and I do worry that.NET is getting a

1380
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,360
little too cross platformy, but I have no evidence of that.

1381
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,080
Like I have no reason to think that other than just.

1382
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,200
It seems like they're promising the impossible.

1383
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,400
Well, it seems like they're promising a lot and not showing much yet, right?

1384
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,240
So it's almost a premature, I mean, all right.

1385
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:47,480
One of my concerns just to kind of put the cards on the table is at some point does it

1386
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,240
become too fractured in a way, right?

1387
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,080
Where there is, it's this big unified framework, but there's all these little asterisks at

1388
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,080
all, but are you on iOS?

1389
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,080
Oh, but are you on Android?

1390
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,760
Oh, but are you on Windows?

1391
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,760
Oh.

1392
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:03,360
It's really a bunch of different tools that have kind of been relabeled and brought together

1393
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,640
is kind of like a crockpot of different stuff in.NET.

1394
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,920
It feels an awful lot like the old Java promises of write once run everywhere.

1395
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,920
Yeah.

1396
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,920
Only this time it's coming from Microsoft.

1397
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,920
Well, sure.

1398
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,760
But like, you know, anybody could promise you anything, right?

1399
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:22,600
I mean, yeah, I'm just saying like, yeah, yeah, no, I do agree.

1400
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,440
I was always reading through their announcement because it, yeah, like I said, it came out

1401
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,040
just as we're about when we're recording.

1402
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,360
And you know, they go through all the standard stuff, but they say our unification efforts

1403
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,240
offer something for all.NET developers.

1404
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,920
If you're a desktop app developer, there are new opportunities for you to reach new users.

1405
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,640
If you're a mobile app developer, you'll benefit from using mainline.NET tools and APIs while

1406
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,000
targeting iOS and Android platforms.

1407
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,320
If you're a web or cloud developer, it will be easier to expose services and.NET mobile

1408
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,840
and apps that share code with them.

1409
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,720
I mean, they're really pushing on that.

1410
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,560
And I think we've had a good sense that when.NET Core came out and they started working

1411
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:07,380
towards this, this was the ultimate scenario is taking these tools that they've invested

1412
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,880
in over the years and bringing them in there.

1413
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:15,480
I mean, even WebAssemblies in this mix, it's all encompassing.

1414
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,040
Unlike you, I kind of have a little bit more of a positive take on it.

1415
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:25,000
It seems like Microsoft has taken really a decade to kind of sift through all of this

1416
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,480
and pull it all together.

1417
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:33,160
And then what's really happened now is.NET 6 is really kind of like it's like an umbrella

1418
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,880
of this stuff that you can do now.

1419
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,680
And so when you're a.NET developer, it's going to mean a whole bunch of other stuff

1420
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,360
all of a sudden.

1421
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,880
And then on top of that, they have the pipeline, right?

1422
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,440
They have the tools on the desktop.

1423
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,840
They have the tools in the cloud.

1424
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,560
They have GitHub.

1425
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:54,440
I think in a way, I am more bullish on what Microsoft is doing here than I have ever

1426
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,440
been on anything I have seen them do.

1427
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:02,160
And I can clearly see the hallmarks of how this benefits Azure.

1428
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,720
I can see how this benefits their GitHub platform.

1429
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,160
I can see how this makes more Microsoft developers.

1430
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:11,840
I can see how this sells more Windows licenses and Visual Studio licenses, like check every

1431
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:12,840
box.

1432
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,840
All right.

1433
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:14,840
But what do they want?

1434
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,940
Like, this is my whole problem with Microsoft right now.

1435
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,640
What the hell do they want?

1436
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,520
Are they trying to get you to use Windows or trying to get you to pay for Visual Studio

1437
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,520
Pro?

1438
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,880
Are they trying to get you to?

1439
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:30,280
This is a respin of an idea that I think I rolled out on the show a while ago.

1440
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,800
So it's been a couple of years, but I've thought about this.

1441
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,480
And this isn't the right analogy, but I think this is the only way to state it where it'll

1442
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,480
click.

1443
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:45,520
It's like they want to recreate the magic of Windows, but they want to be Windows for

1444
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,520
developers.

1445
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:52,160
They want to bring all of this stuff together, and they don't care if you're targeting Android.

1446
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,160
Have at it, Haas.

1447
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,820
If you want to make TVOS apps, have at it.

1448
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:58,660
But you're using a Microsoft editor to do it.

1449
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:04,040
You're using a Microsoft developer platform to put a repo to store your code.

1450
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:08,840
And you're using.NET as the back end, and you're using the.NET SDK and tools.

1451
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:14,960
I just think it's Microsoft wins for every Android device that uses this or every TVOS

1452
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,960
device.

1453
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,160
They don't need you running Windows, but if you want to run Windows, it's going to be

1454
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,160
great.

1455
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:26,680
And I think it's so clever it's devious because they're creating something that's useful.

1456
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,440
It's competitive in the market.

1457
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,820
It answers problems that developers have and corporations, especially enterprises, while

1458
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:39,600
also kind of ensuring that they stay relevant in the game even when people are done with

1459
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,000
the desktop entirely.

1460
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,120
Like this, essentially, what I think this.NET umbrella does and combining it with Azure

1461
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,340
and GitHub and everything else, sorry, sorry, sorry, but it's just going to have to be said

1462
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,240
over and over again for a little bit.

1463
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:54,440
When they're all done, they don't even need Windows.

1464
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,680
They don't even need Windows at all.

1465
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:01,000
Windows can just fade away, and they're totally good because the world will be developing

1466
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,240
for IoT, for the web, for mobile, and for the desktop using their tools.

1467
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:12,040
And even if it isn't totally market dominant, they're probably over time going to be able

1468
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:18,720
to carve out a nice, sizable, long-term percentage, which will include a ton of businesses and

1469
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:23,380
enterprises, dark matter developers, and people on the front lines like yourself that are

1470
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:27,660
just building shops around this tool chain because it's all there.

1471
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:31,340
Every piece of the pipeline is there for you.

1472
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:34,240
You can build a shop around all of these tools.

1473
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,580
It's all there for you.

1474
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:37,400
And you can just start executing.

1475
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,400
I guess.

1476
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,840
I mean, I know months ago, or, oh my God, like over a year ago, we talked about, it

1477
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:46,600
was all about that sweet Azure manna raining from heaven.

1478
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,600
Mm-hmm.

1479
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,600
But...

1480
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,160
They've got to om-nom that Azure manna.

1481
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,160
Om-nom.

1482
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,160
I guess.

1483
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,160
All right.

1484
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,160
I guess I'm with you.

1485
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,880
I sort of feel like I want Windows to get better, and everything you've described is

1486
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,960
it's not really going to get better.

1487
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,480
They don't need it to now.

1488
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,480
And I think they...

1489
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,480
Yeah, I don't know.

1490
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,840
I mean, it's deviously clever, I think.

1491
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,980
I'm very impressed with the strategy because you just don't normally see it.

1492
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:18,840
So you don't normally see a company be able to shift like this in such a clever way.

1493
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:22,200
Usually it's just a large ship, and once it's set up and going in a direction, it goes in

1494
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,880
that direction forever.

1495
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,880
Maybe I'm wrong, but...

1496
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,880
No, I think you're right.

1497
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:33,200
I mean, I think that's the whole thing is they don't care, which I mean, we're going

1498
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,200
way over.

1499
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,680
If you're a.NET developer today, should you be scared?

1500
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,680
I mean, I don't think so.

1501
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:41,760
Look at what they're trying to target.

1502
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,760
That's everything.

1503
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:43,760
They're literally trying to...

1504
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,120
That's every platform that exists, from WebAssembly to IoT.

1505
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,120
Right.

1506
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,120
That's the thing.

1507
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,840
I kind of worry that they're trying to be everything to everyone, and it's just not

1508
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,680
going to work.

1509
01:07:54,680 --> 01:08:02,040
That sounds like Microsoft to a T though, and it will work well enough for a large chunk

1510
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,360
of business, for a large chunk of the market.

1511
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,240
It will do the job, and it will do the job well enough.

1512
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:13,840
The Surface tablets, we do sell development for them at TMB, at the bad botter, because

1513
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,120
they make sense.

1514
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:19,040
But the only reason they make sense is because Android tablets are hot garbage.

1515
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:25,080
Please send your emails to alan at jupyterbroadcasting.com, and because Apple is just a pain in the ass

1516
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,760
about enterprise distribution, right?

1517
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:34,760
If Apple would just not have that policy, I would much prefer develop for iPads.

1518
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,640
Have you heard of our friends over at Google with their Chrome OS?

1519
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,640
Thank you for listening today.

1520
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,560
I'm at Jumanuku on Twitter.

1521
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,560
He's at Chris Lass.

1522
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,560
All right.

1523
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,560
All right.

1524
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,560
Yeah.

1525
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,560
Also, thanks to our members.

1526
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,560
We should say...

1527
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,760
I don't know if we said it last week, but thank you to our members over at coderqa.co.

1528
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,920
We appreciate our members.

1529
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,920
Thank you very much.

1530
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,400
Go get your coderlies.

1531
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,400
Yeah.

1532
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,080
At the bad botter, Inc.'s the company.

1533
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,320
Anything else you want to plug?

1534
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:04,160
I have a book review coming up for Jay LaCroix, a friend of the show, and we met him at System

1535
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,160
76...

1536
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,920
Or I met him at System 76 a couple of years ago.

1537
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,560
He's mastering Ubuntu Server, so that should be up this week.

1538
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:10,560
Cool.

1539
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,560
On dominicm.com.

1540
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,560
Great guy.

1541
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,560
Linux podcaster.

1542
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:14,720
Linux YouTuber.

1543
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:20,080
And sounds like if somebody is administering an Ubuntu server, a very useful resource.

1544
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:24,800
Our links to the stuff we talked about today, you'll find that at coder.show slash 402.

1545
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:28,680
Surprisingly, there's a lot of great things over there at coder.show.

1546
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:32,560
You can find our RSS feeds for all the different ways to subscribe.

1547
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,080

1548
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,520

1549
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:44,440
And of course, links to previous episodes all over at coder.show, including this one.

1550
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:48,920
I'd encourage you to hang out live if you have some time on a Monday evening.

1551
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:53,280
We do this show starting around 5 PM Pacific, 8 PM Eastern over at jblive.tv.

1552
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:56,880
I'm usually dorking around on the stream, and then Mike shows up about the half hour

1553
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:57,880
mark and we kick off.

1554
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,920
And it's a Coder happy hour.

1555
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,200
Share drinks and hang out with friends at jblive.tv on a Monday.

1556
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,280
But thanks for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program.

1557
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,440
We appreciate every single one of you for downloading this here podcast and sharing

1558
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:24,560
