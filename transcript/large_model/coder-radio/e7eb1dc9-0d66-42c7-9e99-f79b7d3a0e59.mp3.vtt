00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 445 for December 20th, 2021.

00:15.760 --> 00:20.200
Hello friends and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.200 --> 00:24.760
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.760 --> 00:30.280
I'm old man Chris and joining me every single week is my host with a surprise, Mr. Dominic.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.280
Hello Mike.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.280
Hello Chris.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.280
How are you?

00:33.280 --> 00:34.280
I'm pretty good.

00:34.280 --> 00:38.080
I got things I have to say, but I feel like you're kind of like in a special place.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.640
I'm a little envious of you.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.680
We got stuff to hash out this episode.

00:41.680 --> 00:42.680
That's all I'm saying.

00:42.680 --> 00:43.960
But I've been seeing some tweets.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.520
I've been seeing some pop OS upgrade tweets.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.080
I mean, you've been popping off.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.240
I've been popping off.

00:50.240 --> 00:51.480
I just feel like we got to catch up.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.440
A lot's happened since our last episode.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.880
It feels like two weeks of stuff has happened since our last episode.

00:56.880 --> 01:00.440
And I see you tweeting about using VMware workstation.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.440
I'm your Linux guy.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.400
I didn't know about any of this stuff.

01:03.400 --> 01:09.240
So here's what happens when you're doing a ton, like a ton of Visual Studio work, Xamarin

01:09.240 --> 01:14.240
forms to UWP to Android because that's my life.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.640
And Parallels is just laggy as hell and you've got a beautiful system 76 Pangolin that you're

01:19.640 --> 01:21.120
supposed to be reviewing.

01:21.120 --> 01:25.680
There's like sitting sadly on your kitchen island.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.800
He's giving you a look and you find out you're going to be home for a little while because

01:28.800 --> 01:29.800
you have COVID.

01:29.800 --> 01:30.800
Oh no.

01:30.800 --> 01:31.800
Cheers.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.800
Breakthrough.

01:32.800 --> 01:33.800
Hashtag unfilter show.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.800
Oh no.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.800
Yeah.

01:35.800 --> 01:40.440
I decided to say, okay, let me daily drive the Pangolin and let me see what the world's

01:40.440 --> 01:44.040
like taking everything I do, not making any exceptions, right?

01:44.040 --> 01:45.040
You know, no switching.

01:45.040 --> 01:48.800
I actually put the iMac pro in a box in the garage.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.320
That's serious commitment.

01:50.320 --> 01:55.200
I brought out one of my old 1080, not old, but it's relatively new, but 1080P view sonic

01:55.200 --> 01:56.200
monitors.

01:56.200 --> 02:01.120
It's just 24 inch to like use it with the Pangolin.

02:01.120 --> 02:07.480
And one of the first things I had to do is get windows on there in a VM because for one

02:07.480 --> 02:11.720
of my main projects right now, we're doing a windows application is Xamarin forms, but

02:11.720 --> 02:17.880
it goes to UWP as well as Android with a flask Python backend.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.800
So obviously it's great to have bolt systems on local host.

02:20.800 --> 02:26.860
If you're, you know, building both the application and the rest service that was surprisingly

02:26.860 --> 02:31.280
good compared to what I was getting on my iMac pro in terms of the performance of the

02:31.280 --> 02:32.280
windows VM.

02:32.280 --> 02:39.360
The only hiccup was parallels of somehow convinced windows to allow me to install windows 11

02:39.360 --> 02:42.440
where VMware workstation windows 11 vomited.

02:42.440 --> 02:45.520
So I installed windows 10 that's probably fine.

02:45.520 --> 02:50.880
I guess the whole TPM, it doesn't fake it out or whatever, but honestly, I mean, I opened

02:50.880 --> 02:51.880
windows.

02:51.880 --> 02:56.600
I do the whole shared shared file system thing where the post OS can go into the guest OS.

02:56.600 --> 03:02.480
So all my command line tools, all my get all that stuff is on Linux anyway, and it's basically

03:02.480 --> 03:07.760
an entire OS just cause I need to run visual studio and the build chain.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.000
It was actually better.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.520
For instance, on parallels, I had to make changes to the little XML file.

03:13.520 --> 03:17.800
It's the app config on windows because of the where the parallels handles the file system

03:17.800 --> 03:18.800
VMware workstation.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.800
No such problem.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.800
Okay.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.800
Just to have it clear.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.680
You were doing parallels on windows, but when you switched to Linux, you also switched to

03:24.680 --> 03:25.680
VMware workstation.

03:25.680 --> 03:29.040
No, I was doing parallels on Mac to run windows.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.040
Oh, oh yeah.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.040
Sure.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.040
Sure.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.040
Okay.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.040
Gotcha.

03:34.040 --> 03:38.640
So then I went to the Linux host, which is Papa West 2110 and just a, I got a license

03:38.640 --> 03:40.240
for VM workstation pro.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.240
It's beautiful.

03:41.240 --> 03:45.600
I truly believe Linux makes such a great virtualization platform because the kernel just has like

03:45.600 --> 03:46.760
all the plumbing right there.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.960
And if you have a virtualization program that takes advantage of that or submits their own

03:49.960 --> 03:52.800
upstream stuff, it works pretty great.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.480
And then you get all the advantages of snapshots and all of that, but what is the price of

03:56.480 --> 03:57.480
workstation pro?

03:57.480 --> 03:59.480
It's gotta be like a couple of hundred bucks, right?

03:59.480 --> 04:00.480
It's a 30 day trial.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.200
I have no idea, but I don't remember that much sticker shock.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.080
I think it's like a hundred bucks.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.080
It might be a license though.

04:06.080 --> 04:11.160
It might be an annual like see now some people in the audience are going to listen to this

04:11.160 --> 04:13.880
and they're going to say, Oh no, just use boxes or just use vert manager.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.000
It's free.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.520
But I just completely disagree.

04:16.520 --> 04:21.120
I think if workstation is working for you and it gives you a workflow that seems efficient

04:21.120 --> 04:25.440
and you can wrap your head around and it's reproducible, it's worth the a hundred bucks.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.440
It's like a no brainer.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.760
Well, so I did actually start with boxes.

04:28.760 --> 04:29.760
Oh really?

04:29.760 --> 04:30.760
Okay.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.000
And the performance was kind of lousy.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Okay.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.180
Like there was actual like visual tearing, but workstation, I'm sure there's ways to

04:36.180 --> 04:40.280
configure it, but workstation pro out of the box windows ran.

04:40.280 --> 04:47.480
I mean, I've just put it in a different workspace on pop and it is pretty much near what I would

04:47.480 --> 04:50.160
expect from a, you know, windows laptop, right?

04:50.160 --> 04:51.840
Like a lower end windows laptop.

04:51.840 --> 04:52.840
Love that.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.760
Not low, low end, but like, you know, the lowest thing I would buy a 16 gig laptop.

04:55.760 --> 05:00.880
You might also in this setup be benefiting from like a newer GPU and a newer Intel chip

05:00.880 --> 05:04.120
with updated, you know, virtualization support and stuff.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.760
So not an Intel chip though.

05:05.760 --> 05:06.760
Right?

05:06.760 --> 05:08.720
So the Pangolin is a whole, a pure AMD system.

05:08.720 --> 05:09.720
Oh, okay.

05:09.720 --> 05:10.720
Kind of thing though.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.640
But yeah, more just, you know, newer hardware that just works better with virtualization

05:13.640 --> 05:15.440
because before it was an older iMac, right?

05:15.440 --> 05:16.800
It was an iMac pro.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.800
Yeah.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.800
Well, nice.

05:18.800 --> 05:19.800
I'm glad you found it.

05:19.800 --> 05:20.800
Good.

05:20.800 --> 05:21.800
I'm looking forward to hearing more about that in the future.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.600
It sounds like maybe we'll be hearing a bit of a review down the road after you've had

05:23.600 --> 05:25.000
a chance to try it out for a bit.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.760
I hope so.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.160
You know, this isn't where I want the show to go and I don't really want it to be a lot

05:30.160 --> 05:35.120
about this, but you know, just hearing you talk about getting sick again, I just, at what

05:35.120 --> 05:41.240
point am I allowed to get really angry because this is really screwing up our industry and

05:41.240 --> 05:42.480
just one of many.

05:42.480 --> 05:46.120
And this just got really personal because we have a get together planned here at the

05:46.120 --> 05:48.620
studio on the second.

05:48.620 --> 05:53.200
And I think just out of an abundance of caution to watch where this thing goes, because something

05:53.200 --> 05:56.760
that's spreading exponentially is kind of hard for us to wrap our head around.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.200
I think I'm going to punt that meetup to the end of January just to give us time to see

06:00.200 --> 06:01.800
where things stand.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.740
It sucks so bad because we have this whole event planned because we're moving up to Tuesdays.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.880
We're launching our new internal server infrastructure.

06:08.880 --> 06:12.360
You know, we wanted to have a potluck and do the whole thing, go the full nine yards

06:12.360 --> 06:15.960
after a year and a half of no events.

06:15.960 --> 06:21.000
And I think I got to cancel it and I got to at least move it and maybe cancel it again.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.560
And you know, you're not feeling well.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.560
You're back at home.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.560
I hope you're feeling OK.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.480
I just can't believe we're still in this position, man.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.480
I'm getting angry.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.440
Well, I will say this is my second.

06:29.440 --> 06:33.400
I mean, we shouldn't turn this into the COVID show, but this is my second go around with

06:33.400 --> 06:34.400
COVID.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.960
And this time has been I had one night where I was I kind of sweat through the sheets when,

06:37.960 --> 06:38.960
you know, not in the fun way.

06:38.960 --> 06:39.960
Right.

06:39.960 --> 06:40.960
How can I put it?

06:40.960 --> 06:42.920
I feel like I've had a mild hangover.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.920
Make your jokes here.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.560
YouTube commenters for it's been a while.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.200
I actually it turned out when we did the show last week, I already had it.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.200
I just didn't know.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.200
Yeah.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.560
And I just got demolished like Tuesday night.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.500
I was like down for two days.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.840
So for the record, I'm you know, I have the vaccine.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.200
I did the two shots.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.520
It's too early for me to get the booster, they said.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.000
And you had it once before.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.680
And I've had it once before in which I took a stroke because I have a heart condition.

07:07.680 --> 07:13.240
Yeah, I was very concerned when I was told that the test was positive because obviously

07:13.240 --> 07:14.240
that's you know.

07:14.240 --> 07:17.440
Yeah, it's frustrating because it's it's risking our health and it is Christmas.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.440
Yep.

07:18.440 --> 07:19.440
It's the family holidays.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.680
So once again, that's all getting screwed up and canceled out again.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.960
Another year or a I hope people out there are taking care of themselves and taking taking

07:24.960 --> 07:28.640
the mental space they need, however they can, because this is getting frustrating.

07:28.640 --> 07:33.360
And we appreciate the how it's, you know, it's worse for a lot of people out there.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.720
It could be worse for us, too.

07:34.720 --> 07:39.000
But one day we will do a live meetup and I will actually show up this time.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.880
Man, I tell you what, I've been actually jonesing to get down to Florida because it's freezing

07:43.880 --> 07:44.880
out today.

07:44.880 --> 07:45.880
It's cold.

07:45.880 --> 07:46.880
It's gray.

07:46.880 --> 07:47.880
It's hot here.

07:47.880 --> 07:52.060
Oh, well, Miami is the center of Bitcoin right now in the United States.

07:52.060 --> 07:56.960
And Alexander writes in with an idea on how to pay open source developers.

07:56.960 --> 08:00.160
He says, how do companies pay folks and projects for open source work?

08:00.160 --> 08:04.520
And this is something I brought up before because I have tried as a business, Jupiter

08:04.520 --> 08:09.820
Broadcasting, and when working with Linux Academy on multiple occasions to pay developers.

08:09.820 --> 08:15.360
When I was part of a larger company, you couldn't just say, yes, send them a PayPal payment

08:15.360 --> 08:16.360
or something like that.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.360
That's not how businesses work.

08:17.360 --> 08:23.480
They have accounting departments and they do invoices and transfers and stuff like that.

08:23.480 --> 08:24.640
Well, Alexander has a solution.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.480
He says, how about Bitcoin?

08:26.480 --> 08:28.040
I can't believe I was thinking it.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.440
I mean, I think Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on the whole are less compelling than the

08:31.440 --> 08:37.640
blockchains themselves are and just likely are just Ponzi schemes in the most cases.

08:37.640 --> 08:42.740
But you know, I really couldn't help but realize that Bitcoin would solve this because he says

08:42.740 --> 08:48.440
there's no middlemen, there's no PayPal, there's nothing else to say who can or can't get money.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.200
All one needs is just a wallet, a piece of software.

08:51.200 --> 08:55.360
I don't know how it scales with legal entities out there, but couldn't this just be a killer

08:55.360 --> 09:01.320
use for cryptocurrencies, large companies paying open source projects for their work?

09:01.320 --> 09:02.320
What do you think, Mike?

09:02.320 --> 09:06.280
Would you be willing to, you know, say you were younger version of you hacking on an

09:06.280 --> 09:07.360
open source project?

09:07.360 --> 09:09.640
Would you be willing to take a bit of a Bitcoin as payment?

09:09.640 --> 09:10.640
Yeah, probably.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.640
Why not?

09:11.640 --> 09:12.640
Oh, what?

09:12.640 --> 09:13.640
Hold on.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.640
Oh, whoa.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.360
I just fell out of my seat.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.360
What?

09:17.360 --> 09:23.080
I mean, after the way we hounded Web3 on this show, I thought for sure you'd come on here

09:23.080 --> 09:28.080
and tell me to eff off and that you wouldn't even consider it now to take a fractional

09:28.080 --> 09:31.760
Bitcoin as a payment for just open source work.

09:31.760 --> 09:32.760
I was already doing.

09:32.760 --> 09:33.760
Why not?

09:33.760 --> 09:35.500
I mean, I'm getting nothing.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.040
Would you hold it or would you cash it out?

09:37.040 --> 09:41.200
I mean, I can tell you what I did.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.920
Did you have Bitcoin at one point?

09:42.920 --> 09:46.080
I did have some Bitcoin coins, plural.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.080
Yeah.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.080
Yeah.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.300
Which today I could buy a Tesla.

09:49.300 --> 09:53.000
I'm not saying this to brag, because I was very early in the mining when the Bitcoin

09:53.000 --> 09:58.560
was around 25 cents, and I may have at one point held 100 Bitcoin.

09:58.560 --> 10:02.960
Every piece of hardware that I am actively using except for the launch keyboard was paid

10:02.960 --> 10:05.160
for with Bitcoin years ago in the studios.

10:05.160 --> 10:10.000
So I cashed it out when it was like around 30,000 or maybe less than that, 14,000, 15,000,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.240
and I basically invested it in studio gear.

10:13.240 --> 10:16.760
I was having a really good conversation with Dave Jones from the podcast index, which I'm

10:16.760 --> 10:21.680
going to play the entire chat in Linux Unplugged on January 9th.

10:21.680 --> 10:27.640
We were going on and on about Web3, but he gave me a pretty solid and interesting example

10:27.640 --> 10:30.040
for a quote unquote Web3-like technology.

10:30.040 --> 10:33.680
Now that's not really what he calls it, but you could probably categorize it as one of

10:33.680 --> 10:34.680
those things.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.680
But here's what it is.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.220
It's called the Hive blockchain.

10:37.220 --> 10:41.540
It's a separate kind of version of the blockchain, but here's what's so freaking cool about it

10:41.540 --> 10:42.600
is it rapidly updates.

10:42.600 --> 10:47.880
I think like every three seconds or so, and you could embed a JSON payload in the blockchain.

10:47.880 --> 10:53.120
So what you get is a decentralized message bus that's updated every three seconds and

10:53.120 --> 10:55.840
anyone can check in on it and receive the messages.

10:55.840 --> 11:00.780
And what they're using it for at podcast index as a new decentralized way to update podcast

11:00.780 --> 11:02.980
players when there's a new episode.

11:02.980 --> 11:09.880
Because the issue today is that all of us have apps that are banging on the podcast

11:09.880 --> 11:14.280
RSS feed server, you know, maybe every few minutes to see if there's a new episode.

11:14.280 --> 11:18.080
And you're doing it for every show you have and you're doing it every time the app is

11:18.080 --> 11:24.320
running or like in the case say Overcast or probably Pocket Cast and Apple Podcasts, there's

11:24.320 --> 11:29.480
a backend server that's doing that scraping and then sending down like a JSON update to

11:29.480 --> 11:30.480
your phone.

11:30.480 --> 11:35.040
If you think about it, it requires something constantly refreshing an RSS feed to see if

11:35.040 --> 11:36.040
there's a new episode.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.120
That's how your podcast catcher knows.

11:38.120 --> 11:43.880
And when you say have a hundred thousand listeners, that's a lot of people hitting your web server

11:43.880 --> 11:46.060
just to check an XML file.

11:46.060 --> 11:50.760
And so what they've done is they're using the Hive blockchain as a message bus to let

11:50.760 --> 11:55.080
the podcast clients know without having to bang on each individual feed all the time.

11:55.080 --> 11:58.880
And that's just one example of a way they can use blockchain technology in a kind of

11:58.880 --> 12:01.040
cool decentralized database way.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.800
But how will they get their dynamic ad insertion?

12:04.800 --> 12:07.480
The other tech they're working on, I'll just talk about this briefly because of the rest

12:07.480 --> 12:11.500
it's in the interview, but the other tech they're working on and they have it set up

12:11.500 --> 12:16.200
already is using the lightning payment rails that are on top of Bitcoin.

12:16.200 --> 12:22.000
They have it set up where you can have a podcast app that has a wallet and you throw a hundred

12:22.000 --> 12:25.200
Satoshis in there, whatever it is, being a big spender.

12:25.200 --> 12:31.140
You can configure the app theoretically to then pay out to the podcaster as you listen.

12:31.140 --> 12:36.040
So it just pays based on how many hours you listen to that podcast, maybe a few cents

12:36.040 --> 12:40.500
every hour, 10 cents, whatever, 50 cents, whatever you thought was appropriate.

12:40.500 --> 12:44.760
And in the background, the app is just doing that over the lightning network and it's sort

12:44.760 --> 12:48.680
of streaming it to the podcast host as you listen, which is an interesting, I don't know

12:48.680 --> 12:54.520
if Bitcoin is the currency you want to use, but that idea, you know, you could set limits

12:54.520 --> 12:59.160
say no more than $20 a month goes to the podcasters I like, but the ones that I listened to the

12:59.160 --> 13:02.440
most that month, they're the ones that get some funding.

13:02.440 --> 13:06.280
And you could see that kind of technology being applied in other ways.

13:06.280 --> 13:12.480
And what's enabling it is that lightning network that makes the transactions super quick, instant

13:12.480 --> 13:15.880
at the speed of light and does it for super cheap.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.760
And there's no middleman taking a cut there.

13:18.760 --> 13:24.200
It totally bypasses things like PayPal or Patreon, which means it's more censorship

13:24.200 --> 13:25.200
resistant.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.200
It means it's international.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.180
It's truly, it's something that everyone in the world has access to.

13:29.180 --> 13:30.560
It's a level playing field.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.080
And that I like about it.

13:32.080 --> 13:38.640
But I think it would really only work in countries where access to getting in and out of Bitcoin

13:38.640 --> 13:39.680
is easy.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.920
Like here in the States and other places, there's the cash app from Square, which just

13:43.920 --> 13:49.440
renamed and it's so stupid simple, you wouldn't even know you're working with Bitcoin.

13:49.440 --> 13:53.960
You just, you know, you hit buy $10, takes the money out of your checking account and

13:53.960 --> 13:54.960
buys a Bitcoin.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.760
And then when you sell it for $20, takes the money out of Bitcoin and transfers it back

13:58.760 --> 13:59.760
to your checking account.

13:59.760 --> 14:03.320
And it's all in a UI that's so fricking simple, you just wouldn't think that's what's happening

14:03.320 --> 14:04.320
on the back end.

14:04.320 --> 14:07.720
But they've abstracted out all of those layers of technology, the blockchain and Bitcoin

14:07.720 --> 14:10.700
and the payment system and all of it, the ACH transfer.

14:10.700 --> 14:14.020
They've abstracted it all the way into this stupid easy app.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.480
And then there's apps like Coinbase and all these others that give people around the world

14:17.480 --> 14:20.520
access to this stuff, but it's still not ubiquitous.

14:20.520 --> 14:24.280
But it's better than the US dollar is probably at this point in terms of access.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.640
So maybe Alexander, but I think you'd have to get the devs to to accept it.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.380
Like I didn't expect Mike to go with it.

14:29.380 --> 14:31.840
So maybe more developers would know.

14:31.840 --> 14:36.120
I actually thought I actually thought it would be a bit of an argument, but maybe people

14:36.120 --> 14:37.120
are seeing the value.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.980
You know, it helps when something's close to $50,000 in value.

14:40.980 --> 14:47.740
We also talked about VR last week, metaverse and crypto currencies seem to have some connections.

14:47.740 --> 14:52.840
And we asked if VR was was really a solution, you know, that could be used further.

14:52.840 --> 14:53.840
And I didn't know it at the time.

14:53.840 --> 14:58.600
But after that episode, I learned that the Home Assistant project uses Facebook's VR

14:58.600 --> 15:03.000
meeting software for all of their meetings and they have a virtual whiteboard.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.480
And Paulus, the head of the project, says it's great because he can view the body language

15:07.480 --> 15:09.360
of the participants.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.360
And here's the other thing.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.920
He says it's faster.

15:11.920 --> 15:18.120
VR meetings are faster because you're just sending the data about positioning of objects

15:18.120 --> 15:19.760
and stuff and the renderings happening on your end.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.380
You're not streaming the video.

15:21.380 --> 15:25.680
You're just streaming the positional information and then an audio feed along with it.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.800
And so he says, we don't have the issue you always have where you're talking over each

15:28.800 --> 15:32.640
other because the latency is just that much faster.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.080
So that sounds pretty compelling.

15:34.080 --> 15:38.560
And so they're popping on these Quest headsets and they're getting in these meetings.

15:38.560 --> 15:42.680
Well, our handsome editor, Drew, wrote in with thoughts on virtual reality says, I was

15:42.680 --> 15:47.600
skeptical about VR at first, but I got hooked once I started playing with the Quest 2.

15:47.600 --> 15:51.480
For those of you listening that don't know, Quest 2 is a standalone VR unit.

15:51.480 --> 15:55.120
Runs Android and you don't need to have it hooked up to a PC, although you can get like

15:55.120 --> 15:57.440
a hundred dollar cable and hook it up to a PC.

15:57.440 --> 16:03.320
Drew continues, while I play a lot of standing action games, which are great for cardio,

16:03.320 --> 16:06.920
there are quite a few relaxing options too, with lots of virtual environments you can

16:06.920 --> 16:11.280
just visit and essentially with Google Earth, you can visit anything.

16:11.280 --> 16:15.640
And besides that, I'd also recommend looking into painting and building apps.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.520
Sounds like Drew's been getting his chill on with virtual reality.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.760
And then the Home Assistant project says that it's made them more efficient as a remote

16:22.760 --> 16:24.360
software development team.

16:24.360 --> 16:28.720
They're sitting around a table again, they have a whiteboard again, their laptops and

16:28.720 --> 16:33.120
screens are in VR, their keyboard is in the VR space, so they can actually see their keyboard,

16:33.120 --> 16:38.240
they can see their laptop screen in the VR space, and the latency is better.

16:38.240 --> 16:43.720
And now, so this latest version of Home Assistant that just shipped, they completely redesigned

16:43.720 --> 16:50.760
the main configuration screen and they collaborated on all of that in this VR Horizons workspace

16:50.760 --> 16:52.320
thing.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.400
Is there actually something here finally?

16:55.400 --> 17:00.320
Is maybe freaking meetings one of the killer apps for virtual reality?

17:00.320 --> 17:01.320
Oh, good.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.920
Finally, an excuse to have more meetings.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.720
That's exactly what we all need.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.000
Oh, yeah, right.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.600
And this time you're really trapped.

17:10.600 --> 17:15.320
I just picture like, you know, a significant other or like a kid walking in on you two

17:15.320 --> 17:18.800
with the VR headset strapped on and you're sitting there in like some intense meeting,

17:18.800 --> 17:22.440
maybe even giving somebody a what for.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.480
Wait, will the VR know if I have no pants on?

17:24.480 --> 17:25.600
It might, man.

17:25.600 --> 17:29.280
The one thing I thought about was like, well, what if we podcasted in VR?

17:29.280 --> 17:33.320
What if we had a virtual studio, right, and you were just like essentially sitting across

17:33.320 --> 17:36.640
from me at the table in VR?

17:36.640 --> 17:39.480
Hmm, could be interesting.

17:39.480 --> 17:43.680
And I could also see it for chilling out, just going to like some really peaceful beach

17:43.680 --> 17:48.880
or something for a bit and pretending like I wasn't trapped in a gray hellscape.

17:48.880 --> 17:53.440
What I would say is podcasting, you know, bandwidth hell is bad enough with audio.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.440
Mm hmm.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.440
Mm hmm.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.480
I can only imagine to really produce a good VR show.

17:58.480 --> 17:59.880
You'd think so, right?

17:59.880 --> 18:03.840
Although they claim since it's not streaming video, it's only streaming the positional

18:03.840 --> 18:06.440
bits that it actually uses less bandwidth.

18:06.440 --> 18:09.120
So that it just reconstructs, it basically draws on.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.120
Hmm.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.120
Yeah, it renders on each side.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.680
I mean, I'd be down to try it.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.680
I'd definitely give it a go.

18:13.680 --> 18:18.880
The thing is, you know, I went and looked at like a Quest and the Quest 2 with the upgraded

18:18.880 --> 18:24.040
strap and you know that you get all in there and it's like 700 bucks almost, which is the

18:24.040 --> 18:26.920
price of the one that actually hooks up to the computer and looks great.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.080
And then like if you want headphones to go with it, those are another hundred bucks.

18:30.080 --> 18:34.240
And by the time you're done, it's like 800 bucks for this thing.

18:34.240 --> 18:37.880
And it feels like if I drop 800 bucks on a Quest 2, it's next month Apple announces their

18:37.880 --> 18:42.360
VR unit and it's going to be better because it's going to have like an M1 in it or something,

18:42.360 --> 18:43.360
you know?

18:43.360 --> 18:44.960
You know, they're going to do this.

18:44.960 --> 18:49.480
It'll be like a pair of glasses that really look like glasses with like an M1 Mini Max

18:49.480 --> 18:50.480
Pro Xeon.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.480
Probably not Xeon, huh?

18:51.480 --> 18:52.480
But yeah.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.440
I love it.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.800
I actually think they're going to do a VR headset first.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.800
I do.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.640
I think it'll have like pass through cameras, but I think the way they're going to get it

19:01.640 --> 19:03.280
at first is going to be like the Quest.

19:03.280 --> 19:08.040
Only it's going to be the iPhone version of the Quest with Apple processors and Apple

19:08.040 --> 19:11.320
screens and probably better hand tracking.

19:11.320 --> 19:15.200
They probably won't even bother with the controllers at first knowing Apple, especially if you

19:15.200 --> 19:16.200
have the watch.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.480
I would imagine they could really get some good tracking.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.240
And I think, you know, they'll have faster processor and they have a better app store

19:22.240 --> 19:25.680
and they now have Apple Arcade so they can strong arm all those developers into making

19:25.680 --> 19:27.600
a VR version pretty quick.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.600
I think it's a foregone conclusion they're going to do it.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.600
Ah, yes.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.440
VR across the road so you can watch your friends get splattered by a Mac truck.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.440
How could you imagine?

19:37.440 --> 19:43.040
Laura's death is still trauma.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.040
Linode.com slash coder.

19:44.040 --> 19:48.120
Go there to get one hundred dollars and sixty day credit on a new account and you go there

19:48.120 --> 19:49.120
to support the show.

19:49.120 --> 19:53.160
And you guys know that this show is made possible by you taking advantage of our sponsor offers.

19:53.160 --> 19:57.440
And the great thing is Linode is one we can enthusiastically endorse.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.600
You know, we're customers ourselves.

19:59.600 --> 20:03.200
It all started when I met them back at Texas Linux Fest and decided I'm going to go sign

20:03.200 --> 20:04.200
up.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.320
I had recently just transitioned off a previous cloud provider.

20:07.320 --> 20:12.440
I was between providers and in the market, if you will, and I discovered Linode.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.640
I didn't fully appreciate at the time but now I realize it makes a difference that they've

20:15.640 --> 20:18.160
been around since 2003.

20:18.160 --> 20:22.160
Eighteen years they've remained an independent company that's independently funded.

20:22.160 --> 20:26.620
They are the largest open cloud provider in the world with eleven data centers around

20:26.620 --> 20:28.920
the world serving nearly a million customers.

20:28.920 --> 20:32.680
But what's great is Linode's mission remains unchanged.

20:32.680 --> 20:35.000
Their focus remains as good as ever.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
They make cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.680
If you've been setting up servers for eighteen years or if you've just gotten into this and

20:42.680 --> 20:47.580
you realize you need some infrastructure or maybe you realize, crap, we are just totally

20:47.580 --> 20:52.440
dependent on one cloud provider and we need to get into some kind of multi-cloud setup,

20:52.440 --> 20:53.440
Linode is great for you.

20:53.440 --> 20:57.240
And you could take advantage of our hundred dollar offer to really try it out, to actually

20:57.240 --> 21:00.520
put it through a test and see if it works for you.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.740
Because with a hundred dollars, you're kicking the tires for real.

21:03.740 --> 21:07.480
It's like going to the car dealership and they let you have the car for a month before

21:07.480 --> 21:11.280
you buy it because they're so convinced you're going to buy the car, right?

21:11.280 --> 21:15.340
Only the great thing about Linode is they're the best in value out there.

21:15.340 --> 21:18.840
They're literally thirty to fifty percent cheaper than the hyperscalers that want to

21:18.840 --> 21:20.680
lock you into their platform.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.680
And Linode still has all the good stuff.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.800
I'd say their dashboard is easier to use.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.860
Their API is clear and easy to understand.

21:27.860 --> 21:31.700
They have S3 compatible object storage, which I just use the hell out of.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.920
They're rolling out bare metal servers for those of you that need that.

21:33.920 --> 21:39.320
They've got cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, a powerful DNS manager, super fast 40 gigabit

21:39.320 --> 21:41.960
connections to the machines.

21:41.960 --> 21:47.120
And then, it's like a cherry on top, they've got the best customer support out there.

21:47.120 --> 21:51.160
And that's the part I hear about over and over and over again from the audience.

21:51.160 --> 21:55.040
I think people's first impressions when they try out Linode is, oh man, it's fast, yeah,

21:55.040 --> 21:56.040
Chris was right.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.040
It is great.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.120
This is nice.

21:58.120 --> 22:00.440
But then, you know, you've been using it for a while.

22:00.440 --> 22:05.080
You start depending on it and you mess something up or something goes wrong.

22:05.080 --> 22:09.240
The fact that they have that 365 support, that first tier support, they don't punch

22:09.240 --> 22:13.780
you to somebody else, they don't put you in a queue, they stick with you until it's solved.

22:13.780 --> 22:16.120
That has made a difference with our listeners every single time.

22:16.120 --> 22:19.500
But you really got to go check it out and take advantage of that $100 for yourself.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.200
Go see what it can do for you.

22:30.120 --> 22:38.380
First up, Rails 7 is here and this is the version we've all been waiting for.

22:38.380 --> 22:43.480
I mean, this is exciting because what I'm hearing, like, the number one, like, take

22:43.480 --> 22:48.280
it all down to one thing that I'm hearing about Rails 7, no node required.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.840
That seems big.

22:50.840 --> 22:51.840
Yeah.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.000
It's so good.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Yeah.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.340
You don't have to have that entire NodeJS stack, which we all know that I love, and

22:58.340 --> 22:59.840
Ah, great.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.840
This seems like a monumental release.

23:01.840 --> 23:07.840
I mean, this feels like this is one that has caught the attention of just about everyone that has ever been in the rail space.

23:07.840 --> 23:14.840
It's a big change, although in a weird way, it's a change, but in a lot of ways it's going back, not technically, of course,

23:14.840 --> 23:25.840
but kind of in philosophy to the original Rails ideal, which was it is one framework, batteries included, of course, gems, blah, blah, blah.

23:25.840 --> 23:34.840
But that one person can build a decent web application and be at least competitive on, like, an indie level, right?

23:34.840 --> 23:39.840
And DHH, the creator of Rails, has a blog post to that effect, the one person framework,

23:39.840 --> 23:50.840
where before its embrace of some of these more advanced, if we're going to be nice, JavaScript practices and frameworks, not so good.

23:50.840 --> 23:57.840
In fact, I would argue that, like, doing an Angular application in a Rails application was actually harder than just separating it out

23:57.840 --> 24:02.840
and doing, like, an Angular application completely separate from just a Rails backend.

24:02.840 --> 24:08.840
But, of course, you lost some of the beauty of Rails, which is, like, the easy forms, the easy ERB.

24:08.840 --> 24:09.840
I don't know what the hell happened.

24:09.840 --> 24:16.840
I have thoughts that are a little controversial on what happened between, like, Rails 5 and 6.

24:16.840 --> 24:23.840
Basically, the Ruby Rails community really felt they needed to chase the JavaScript hipsters.

24:23.840 --> 24:25.840
Many of them are the JavaScript hipsters, right?

24:25.840 --> 24:26.840
A lot of them moved on.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.840
Some of them moved on to Elm, whatever.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.840
People will do their own thing.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.840
Elixir Elm, right?

24:32.840 --> 24:38.840
I don't understand why anyone would think this is a bad release.

24:38.840 --> 24:42.840
And I haven't seen any negative coverage yet, except for the lull Rails is slow.

24:42.840 --> 24:51.840
But, sure, I mean, when it's not as slow as it used to be, Django is roughly as slow, I mean, if not slower.

24:51.840 --> 24:53.840
I mean, it's a high-level framework, right?

24:53.840 --> 24:58.840
So, yeah, I like that post, too, from David Heimner-Hansen, the one-person framework.

24:58.840 --> 25:02.840
That really put it all in perspective for me, and so I'll link it in the show notes,

25:02.840 --> 25:07.840
because he talks a little bit, too, about how some of the security work they did at Hay has influenced this release.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.840
But here's the bit that I thought resonated with me.

25:10.840 --> 25:14.840
He says, the part that really excites me about this vision, though,

25:14.840 --> 25:19.840
is how much closer it brings us to the ideal of the, quote, one-person framework,

25:19.840 --> 25:24.840
a toolkit that is so powerful that it allows a single individual to create modern applications

25:24.840 --> 25:29.840
upon which they might build a competitive business the way it used to be.

25:29.840 --> 25:33.840
And he also adds, there's so much to learn these days.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.840
If you want to be an expert in all the latest tools and techniques,

25:35.840 --> 25:40.840
the conventional path, as paved by solutions extracted from the giant tech companies,

25:40.840 --> 25:43.840
is a journey akin to the Oregon Trail.

25:43.840 --> 25:47.840
You might die of dysentery before you ever get to your destination.

25:47.840 --> 25:53.840
RAIL 7 seeks to be the wormhole that folds the time-learning-shipping continuum

25:53.840 --> 25:59.840
and allows you to travel grand distances without knowing all of the physics of interstellar travel,

25:59.840 --> 26:03.840
giving the individual rebel a fighting chance against the Empire.

26:03.840 --> 26:10.840
You simply can't play by the same rules against an opponent exponentially stronger than you.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.840
Man, that hit me in the feels.

26:12.840 --> 26:15.840
Yeah, I wonder if that doesn't hit him in the feels, too, right?

26:15.840 --> 26:16.840
Yeah.

26:16.840 --> 26:21.840
We spent a lot of time at TMB chasing the JavaScript love parade.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.840
And honestly, it's just not that important.

26:24.840 --> 26:28.840
And I get why, like, listen, if you are starting a Twitter account

26:28.840 --> 26:32.840
and you want to juice your followers, just throw a hashtag JavaScript in there.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.840
Is that all you got to do?

26:34.840 --> 26:38.840
Honestly, there's too much going on to get to the same types of sites

26:38.840 --> 26:41.840
we've been able to build for a long time.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.840
Too many layers of complexity.

26:43.840 --> 26:48.840
I can't tell you how many times, like, for barely comprehensible reasons,

26:48.840 --> 26:53.840
Webpack would just vomit in large-scale Rails applications that I had to work on.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.840
And it would always be something really stupid.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.840
And the answer is like, well, why is this actually better?

26:59.840 --> 27:03.840
Like, why the hell do I need Angular or React in my Rails app

27:03.840 --> 27:08.840
when I could just do this in ERB and cue the old man to get off my lawn?

27:08.840 --> 27:09.840
We need a clip of that.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.840
We need some old man yelling about getting off.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.840
Somebody go and send it to us.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.840
That's going to be trouble.

27:14.840 --> 27:18.840
I don't think many of the new JavaScript front-end development stuff

27:18.840 --> 27:23.840
are really advancements or worth their cost

27:23.840 --> 27:25.840
if you're building line-of-business applications.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.840
I just don't.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.840
I think there's too much overhead.

27:29.840 --> 27:34.840
And the truth is, one of the biggest advancements in JavaScript has been the DOM.

27:34.840 --> 27:37.840
So you don't need a giant framework to get a lot of it, right?

27:37.840 --> 27:39.840
The DOM and some of the nicer CSS stuff.

27:39.840 --> 27:45.840
And it's basically trivial to pull in a nice CSS library of controls or whatever

27:45.840 --> 27:52.840
that I'm more and more just like server-side rendering with some client side,

27:52.840 --> 27:54.840
like, on the DOM JavaScript love.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.840
Oh, man, I love it when you talk like this.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.840
I know that's very old man-ish.

27:58.840 --> 27:59.840
No, it gets me excited.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.840
It saves just a ton of, basically, pain in the ass time.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.840
No, I think all that's right.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.840
But there's just in the back of my mind, I'm wondering now,

28:06.840 --> 28:10.840
you're kind of looking at this from the outside because you're kind of all in on the Python now.

28:10.840 --> 28:12.840
So you're seeing this over, you know, you're seeing Rails 7,

28:12.840 --> 28:16.840
but you're looking at it now probably from more of a Python perspective, I would imagine.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.840
That's fair.

28:17.840 --> 28:21.840
I mean, so it's funny because Dave, my CTO, and I have been having conversations,

28:21.840 --> 28:23.840
as we do because we're friends.

28:23.840 --> 28:27.840
But, you know, more and more we've been releasing these products, right?

28:27.840 --> 28:33.840
We released Alice, we're releasing WinkWink, create your own report tool coming out January.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.840
Cool.

28:35.840 --> 28:39.840
Hopefully, and you can make fun of me when January turns into April.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.840
So we did this backwards.

28:40.840 --> 28:46.840
We wrote kind of a front end, like a GUI demo, you know, see if people actually want this.

28:46.840 --> 28:50.840
And I started writing the backend in FastAPI.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.840
And we're looking at this.

28:52.840 --> 28:57.840
And we were thinking, you know, all of the products we're developing,

28:57.840 --> 29:02.840
we've had years in Rails and now we have a lot of experience in Python.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.840
But like, he comes from a C background.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.840
And when I say C, I mean C.

29:06.840 --> 29:07.840
Okay.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.840
Right.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.840
You can take your plus and your plus and shove them both.

29:12.840 --> 29:13.840
Although he did do C++.

29:13.840 --> 29:18.840
He just, I don't know, apparently him and Linus are like, they're on the same page.

29:18.840 --> 29:19.840
C Maximus.

29:19.840 --> 29:20.840
No, he doesn't like C either.

29:20.840 --> 29:21.840
He loves the web.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.840
He is a can I do it on the DOM.

29:24.840 --> 29:25.840
Okay.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.840
It's the DOM and jQuery is where he lives.

29:28.840 --> 29:29.840
Sure.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.840
Kids these days.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.840
He's like, you know, everything's going to the web anyway.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.840
And he's not wrong.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.840
I mean, it's just to the art and business.

29:38.840 --> 29:44.840
But the way we see things scaling for us is not close more.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.840
I mean, hire us for consulting, please.

29:46.840 --> 29:51.840
But it's not chase the trendiest thing and get more consulting work.

29:51.840 --> 29:56.840
Long time listeners know that's not the best idea.

29:56.840 --> 30:02.840
And, you know, I can just talk about the dark days of mobile.

30:02.840 --> 30:13.840
It's release pieces of productized or big packages of code that provide some set of value to potential customers or clients.

30:13.840 --> 30:18.840
And either build them a custom solution based on that, which is basically what Alice is.

30:18.840 --> 30:19.840
Right.

30:19.840 --> 30:21.840
Like, we're doing a lot of one time conversions, too.

30:21.840 --> 30:29.840
But the bigger jobs are, okay, we're going to put this as like a core and I'm going to build you some custom dashboard or some custom.

30:29.840 --> 30:30.840
Everybody needs a dashboard.

30:30.840 --> 30:31.840
I don't know what to say.

30:31.840 --> 30:32.840
So true.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.840
Everybody loves a dashboard.

30:34.840 --> 30:35.840
They love them.

30:35.840 --> 30:36.840
Everybody loves a dashboard.

30:36.840 --> 30:37.840
I love them.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.840
Yes, they want dashboards.

30:39.840 --> 30:46.840
So that kind of having our own products that are flexible enough to be expanded.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.840
I mean, do you remember OpenCore?

30:48.840 --> 30:50.840
Oh, I remember OpenCore.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.840
Gather around, children.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.840
Stay a while and listen.

30:54.840 --> 31:04.840
I feel like if the world could like not be in a state of constant collapse, go like one year without some major disaster.

31:04.840 --> 31:05.840
That'd be great.

31:05.840 --> 31:06.840
It would be great.

31:06.840 --> 31:10.840
I don't remember the last time there wasn't one, but OK, it would be amazing.

31:10.840 --> 31:12.840
I think it was 2007.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.840
Yeah, I think so, too.

31:15.840 --> 31:23.840
I feel like we're going to end up in the state of we have some sort of possibly open source suite of tools,

31:23.840 --> 31:30.840
and then we're doing custom proprietary development on top of it and licensing a managing service for those tools.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.840
A management service, I should say.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.840
I remember OpenCore was a thing and then it just died.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.840
But is that not the ideal of the old OpenCore?

31:38.840 --> 31:40.840
You know what? Can I say something that's going to get me in trouble?

31:40.840 --> 31:41.840
Get in trouble.

31:41.840 --> 31:42.840
I like the model.

31:42.840 --> 31:43.840
Why did it die?

31:43.840 --> 31:47.840
I know it's like if I put it on Reddit, people are going to say, I mean, people are mean on Reddit anyway.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.840
But why is it bad?

31:49.840 --> 31:51.840
You know, it got associated with a bait and switch, I think.

31:51.840 --> 31:57.840
I think you had a few bad big actors, essentially, that did a little bait and switch with the whole like realize and so surprised.

31:57.840 --> 31:58.840
Now this is proprietary.

31:58.840 --> 32:03.840
Or the other one that was super common was, yeah, the core is open source.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.840
But to get anything intelligible out of it, you have to go proprietary, right?

32:06.840 --> 32:09.840
Like that was so common, especially in my I.T. career.

32:09.840 --> 32:17.840
Like primetime, it was open core, barely functional with like this decrepit command line interface that will give you results out of a printer.

32:17.840 --> 32:24.840
Or here's our big enterprise suite that everyone could use and ties in with your active directory and cost ten thousand dollars a year.

32:24.840 --> 32:28.840
OK, it's horrible that you said active directory because that's basically where I want to make it.

32:28.840 --> 32:29.840
Of course.

32:29.840 --> 32:33.840
So I feel like I'm retreading some sins of the past year.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.840
No, I mean, there's some fundamentals.

32:35.840 --> 32:42.840
If the core is truly open, infrastructure person or application developer can go grab something, run it, do a proof of concept,

32:42.840 --> 32:49.840
actually get value out of it and then convince upper management, the CTO, et cetera, to spend money on the commercial product.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.840
I think that's when open core is perfect.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.840
Yeah. Isn't that the point?

32:53.840 --> 32:55.840
That's not what a lot of people did, though.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.840
That's not what happened.

32:58.840 --> 33:06.840
You know, like it became a bad word because a lot of people made it too crippled or they did a little bait and switch on like the oh,

33:06.840 --> 33:08.840
it was open, but now it's closed source.

33:08.840 --> 33:13.840
Version three, version two was open source, but version three is closed source or some of that going on.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.840
Well, what about like IntelliJ, right?

33:15.840 --> 33:19.840
Like PyCharm, IntelliJ is JetBrains.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.840
Most of you probably know this, but they make a whole suite of IDs, right?

33:22.840 --> 33:23.840
PyCharm is their Python one.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.840
They have PyCharm community, which is effectively free.

33:26.840 --> 33:27.840
It is free.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.840
It's straight up free.

33:29.840 --> 33:39.840
But if you want some of the snazzier SQLAlchemy features, which is the ORM for Python, or if you want, there's a bunch of stuff in pro that you don't get.

33:39.840 --> 33:44.840
But is that not also a version of open core where it's like you can have the base model?

33:44.840 --> 33:46.840
But if you want the fancy one, you got to pay.

33:46.840 --> 33:51.840
You know, I think what you've tapped into is core application with a side of services.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.840
And now the services are the proprietary paid thing.

33:53.840 --> 33:56.840
We just don't call it open core anymore.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.840
Isn't this like Red Hat's original business model?

33:58.840 --> 33:59.840
Yeah.

33:59.840 --> 34:07.840
And I know Red Hat, that became a, maybe we shouldn't go there, but I have also watched Revolution OS, which if you haven't, great documentary.

34:07.840 --> 34:11.840
You can ironically buy it on iTunes.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.840
That is actually pretty ironic.

34:13.840 --> 34:17.840
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

34:17.840 --> 34:20.840
Considering some of the people in that.

34:20.840 --> 34:25.840
I enjoy streaming those folks on my Apple TV via iCloud.

34:25.840 --> 34:28.840
I bet they would just love to hear that.

34:28.840 --> 34:29.840
I bet they would love that.

34:29.840 --> 34:39.840
We're way off here, but this is just like, I feel pretty strongly that open core, maybe I shouldn't use the branding, right?

34:39.840 --> 34:42.840
But like, it just isn't evil.

34:42.840 --> 34:43.840
Yeah.

34:43.840 --> 34:59.840
Because I don't know, the way I make money is that businesses that are exponentially larger than mine pay me a premium to do their work for them or solve what sound like maybe silly problems in some cases.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.840
But it turns out they have some regulatory compliance issue.

35:02.840 --> 35:06.840
And like, if they do not fix this problem, they will be fined.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.840
I've heard numbers that would like make you cry.

35:09.840 --> 35:16.840
There's so many solutions that businesses can be provided that are just simply come down to, they don't know how to do a thing.

35:16.840 --> 35:20.840
Thing is actually quite doable, but they don't know how to do thing.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.840
So they will hire you for your knowing how to do thing.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.840
And that's really, that's it.

35:24.840 --> 35:29.840
It doesn't have to be like you're converting a Cobalt application to a PHP application.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.840
Like, it doesn't have to be something like that.

35:31.840 --> 35:32.840
Right.

35:32.840 --> 35:36.840
You know, I don't know what I was trying to think while you were talking about it.

35:36.840 --> 35:42.840
I was trying to think of another term besides open core that you could call it, but I'm drawing a blank.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.840
Maybe somebody in the audience knows.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.840
I might not even ever say the word open core, right?

35:46.840 --> 35:53.840
Because nobody who doesn't listen to Jupiter broadcasting or like Flaws Weekly is going to know what the hell that means anyway.

35:53.840 --> 35:59.840
So you could get that old crusty IT guy who they loop in as a stakeholder and, you know, he's wondering.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.840
But yeah, I agree for the most part.

36:01.840 --> 36:08.840
In 2003, he got burned by Red Hat and he swears to God he'll never again.

36:08.840 --> 36:09.840
But you know what?

36:09.840 --> 36:11.840
When you tell him that you're a Seuss fan, it'll probably calm down.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.840
A lot of those guys like Seuss.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.840
So is he German?

36:17.840 --> 36:19.840
Shortcut.com slash coder.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.840
Have you ever really been happy with your project management tool?

36:22.840 --> 36:23.840
I know, right?

36:23.840 --> 36:29.840
Most of them are too simple and really not getting the job done or they're so wickedly complex.

36:29.840 --> 36:33.840
You almost need a full time staffer just to manage that and prod people to use it.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.840
That's how Shortcut is different.

36:35.840 --> 36:38.840
It used to be known as Clubhouse, but now it's Shortcut and it's a lot better.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.840
It's project management built specifically for software teams.

36:41.840 --> 36:46.840
It's fast, it's intuitive, flexible, powerful and really all the other things you want to hear from me about it.

36:46.840 --> 36:48.840
I mean, it truly is those things.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.840
Let's just look at a couple of highlights.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.840
I think probably a lot of you are going to appreciate the team based workflows.

36:53.840 --> 37:00.840
Yeah, individual teams could just use Shortcut's default workflows or customize them to match the way you work.

37:00.840 --> 37:03.840
And they have organizational wide goals and roadmaps.

37:03.840 --> 37:07.840
You can make sure that work in there is automatically tied into larger company goals.

37:07.840 --> 37:08.840
Are you starting to get it?

37:08.840 --> 37:10.840
Get everybody rowing in the same direction?

37:10.840 --> 37:15.840
One click to move from a roadmap, then zoom all the way out or zoom all the way into an individual.

37:15.840 --> 37:18.840
It's pretty slick and it has tight VCS integration.

37:18.840 --> 37:22.840
So if you use GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket, Shortcut ties directly to them.

37:22.840 --> 37:26.840
So you can update your progress from the command line.

37:26.840 --> 37:30.840
In fact, I have to say the keyboard friendly interface is something that they've really focused on.

37:30.840 --> 37:33.840
I think it's kind of one of their unique features here.

37:33.840 --> 37:36.840
It's super easy to navigate Shortcut with the keyboard.

37:36.840 --> 37:41.840
They have a power bar allowing you to do virtually everything without touching your mouse.

37:41.840 --> 37:42.840
Throw that thing away.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.840
You're not going to need it with Shortcut.

37:44.840 --> 37:45.840
I think iteration planning is genius.

37:45.840 --> 37:51.840
You can set weekly priorities and then let Shortcut run a schedule for you with a company burn down charts and all the other reporting you need.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.840
Man, go give it a try today and see what you can do.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.840
Shortcut.com slash coder.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.840
Again, Shortcut.com slash coder formerly known as Clubhouse.

37:59.840 --> 38:04.840
Now it's Shortcut because you really shouldn't have to project manage your project management.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.840
So go check out Shortcut.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.840
Shortcut.com slash coder.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.840
My Pop OS workstation.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.840
I don't know if you know this.

38:15.840 --> 38:16.840
It was on Twitter a while ago.

38:16.840 --> 38:17.840
Yeah.

38:17.840 --> 38:21.840
I gave somebody some young guy System 76.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.840
I think it was a lemur.

38:22.840 --> 38:23.840
He listens to the show.

38:23.840 --> 38:29.840
He can correct me to make me a theme that looks like Snow Leopard.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.840
OK, hold on.

38:30.840 --> 38:31.840
Hold on.

38:31.840 --> 38:36.840
You gave someone an entire computer to get a theme that looks like a version of Mac OS from like almost a decade ago.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.840
It gets worse.

38:38.840 --> 38:41.840
Sir, your moment has come.

38:41.840 --> 38:52.840
I will give you a TMB swag pack, including stickers and a fracture print of Alice or one of the other ones, whichever ones I have, or the Fourth of July Mad Botter guy.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.840
If you can update me for 2110.

38:55.840 --> 38:59.840
Because in my heart and I need the right background.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.840
Very important.

39:00.840 --> 39:03.840
In my heart, it is 2011.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.840
And that was peak Mac OS.

39:05.840 --> 39:06.840
I'm sorry.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.840
It's 2010.

39:08.840 --> 39:09.840
Wow.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.840
That was a decade ago.

39:11.840 --> 39:12.840
Geez.

39:12.840 --> 39:13.840
Yeah.

39:13.840 --> 39:14.840
That's kind of a long time.

39:14.840 --> 39:15.840
Mac OS has been on the bad side.

39:15.840 --> 39:18.840
To be fair, I'm not running like I run it every once in a while as a joke.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.840
I will say one thing I do like about Nob.

39:20.840 --> 39:25.840
It is very easy to switch between like the regular.

39:25.840 --> 39:30.840
I don't remember what they call it, but the GTK Plus themes and something weird.

39:30.840 --> 39:38.840
But there's nothing like on a bad day when you're feeling down, when the Ronos got its black polished boot on your throat.

39:38.840 --> 39:47.840
To pretend like it's 2010 and that you are in the mountains of Tibet with a majestic snow leopard.

39:47.840 --> 39:54.840
You know, in a lot of ways, a nice up to date pop OS reminds me of where Mac OS was a decade ago.

39:54.840 --> 40:04.840
You know, if it was like an alternate reality and they just gone a certainly just kind of a different direction more towards power users and less towards general iPhone users.

40:04.840 --> 40:05.840
Because that's really what happened, right?

40:05.840 --> 40:09.840
I mean, come on, Carl Steve Jobs, just give him some weed, right?

40:09.840 --> 40:11.840
He was so close.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.840
Put down the LSD, pick up the pot.

40:13.840 --> 40:18.840
Yeah, I think if you look at it in that way, like Linux desktop is getting in a special space.

40:18.840 --> 40:28.840
The only thing it doesn't have that Apple was really, really great at is that complete developer story with all the APIs and the way to distribute in a single way and monetize.

40:28.840 --> 40:29.840
Sure, it does.

40:29.840 --> 40:30.840
It does, you think?

40:30.840 --> 40:31.840
Absolutely.

40:31.840 --> 40:36.840
But it's because I remember as much as, you know, I might dream that it's 2010.

40:36.840 --> 40:37.840
It's not 2010.

40:37.840 --> 40:40.840
I'll be careful here because somebody is going to say, well, you can't do this.

40:40.840 --> 40:49.840
But for all the practical line of business applications that I need for my business and I've been doing this since I was 19 is when I opened my business.

40:49.840 --> 41:05.840
So every customer I've had, except for a few specialty tablet apps or phone apps in factories on the enterprise side, all of those applications, but for the ones that actually connect to hardware could be done as web apps.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.840
And I don't mean Electron.

41:07.840 --> 41:15.840
I mean straight up in the browser because I think Electron, you're buying another set of problems that Electron is great.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.840
I use Electron apps all day long.

41:17.840 --> 41:21.840
I feel like Electron is in many ways a transitional technology.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.840
And we're going to wind up somewhere else.

41:23.840 --> 41:24.840
I agree.

41:24.840 --> 41:31.840
In fact, pathetically, I have been liking a fricking note taking app that is a web app.

41:31.840 --> 41:34.840
And I can't believe I'm saying that.

41:34.840 --> 41:35.840
I'm not even talking VS code yet.

41:35.840 --> 41:37.840
Check out blankslate.io.

41:37.840 --> 41:38.840
I'm going to do it right now.

41:38.840 --> 41:44.840
Blankslate.io and it's just a quick place where you can capture notes, supports markdown.

41:44.840 --> 41:51.840
And if you have like Grammarly as an extension, Grammarly can also spell check it, which I don't get in my local desktop applications.

41:51.840 --> 41:55.840
And it's I mean, as far as like quit note, it's nice.

41:55.840 --> 41:56.840
It's actually kind of nice.

41:56.840 --> 42:00.840
And I can't believe I'm finding myself taking notes in a web browser now.

42:00.840 --> 42:03.840
I just oh, but it's you're so right.

42:03.840 --> 42:05.840
Do you know how I take my meeting notes?

42:05.840 --> 42:07.840
It's a cutting edge technology paper.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.840
It's a it's graph paper from Amazon.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.840
Thank you, Jeff Bezos, for undercutting Staples.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.840
Yep. And field notes.

42:14.840 --> 42:17.840
And it's number two pencils also from Amazon.

42:17.840 --> 42:23.840
Because again, Jeff Bezos, I don't know who makes number two pencils, but he really did a job on them.

42:23.840 --> 42:27.840
I got an email from field notes and I felt like it was the please save us from Amazon email.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.840
I got the same email right here.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.840
You know, I've got I've got paper notes.

42:31.840 --> 42:34.840
That's how I like to like if you say something I want to remember, I write it down.

42:34.840 --> 42:40.840
But I got to admit, I didn't make the order on field notes because I've got a stack from Amazon of notebooks here.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.840
Well, I used to and in fact, it just expired.

42:42.840 --> 42:45.840
I used to do the field notes annual subscription.

42:45.840 --> 42:46.840
That's what I was thinking on.

42:46.840 --> 42:54.840
They got real into not just doing the regular like dot or graph paper and doing these weird like calendar notebooks.

42:54.840 --> 42:58.840
So I feel bad about wasting paper because like the environment and all that.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.840
And also, I mean, I mentioned field notes on the show years ago.

43:01.840 --> 43:04.840
I love them. I love their notebooks.

43:04.840 --> 43:08.840
But back when I ordered it, they just did graph paper.

43:08.840 --> 43:11.840
What I want is like a mix and match my own subscription.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.840
I like their reporter's notebook when I go to events.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.840
It's like, you know, looks like the old newspaper kind.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.840
I hate that one. So I'll give you mine if I find it.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.840
OK, I mean, I just like it at events outside of that.

43:20.840 --> 43:22.840
Not a big fan because it doesn't fit very well.

43:22.840 --> 43:24.840
I don't mind the designs if they want to put a design on there.

43:24.840 --> 43:27.840
But I just want something I can write stuff down real quick.

43:27.840 --> 43:29.840
That's what I want. Well, I like that they fit in my pocket.

43:29.840 --> 43:32.840
Absolutely. So like if I'm at a meeting and I just seem to oh, this you know, you got to call Bob.

43:32.840 --> 43:36.840
Bob's number is, you know, 505 505.

43:36.840 --> 43:39.840
Yep. Six, I guess you can do that.

43:39.840 --> 43:43.840
Yeah. So it's the same thing. I can't control what I get.

43:43.840 --> 43:49.840
And for me, for whatever reason, if I were to tap that same information into notes on my phone, it'd be gone in 10 minutes.

43:49.840 --> 43:52.840
I'd never remember it if I write it down. I got a good shot at remembering it.

43:52.840 --> 43:56.840
I once tried to be a Evernote power user.

43:56.840 --> 43:58.840
Yep. I owe an apology.

43:58.840 --> 44:06.840
I actually did to an Evernote customer service rep because they said that they could understand my handwriting.

44:06.840 --> 44:15.840
They could not. But much like the Catholic school nun when I was in the third grade, it just wasn't the case.

44:15.840 --> 44:21.840
I got to say, speaking of recognizing handwriting and print the new text recognition,

44:21.840 --> 44:26.840
I think they call it live text or whatever in the whatever they call it in the new iOS update and photos.

44:26.840 --> 44:30.840
Oh, man. So handy. Last night I was paying for a toll.

44:30.840 --> 44:34.840
I drove on a toll road here and they needed my license plate number.

44:34.840 --> 44:39.840
So I knew I had a picture with my car in it from a couple of days ago and I couldn't remember my license plate number.

44:39.840 --> 44:43.840
So I just opened up photos, scrolled up, found the photo, tapped on the photo,

44:43.840 --> 44:50.840
zoomed in and just highlighted the text right off my just highlighted my license plate and copied it right off the photo and then went back over to work.

44:50.840 --> 44:54.840
Yeah. And it does, man. And I went right back over and pasted it in.

44:54.840 --> 44:58.840
It's great. I often need my DL number and I often don't know it.

44:58.840 --> 45:02.840
Yeah. Or like you take a picture of a sign, you know, it'll OCR that text. You can go in and get that.

45:02.840 --> 45:06.840
It's actually pretty nice. You know what else is amazing in the new iOS?

45:06.840 --> 45:09.840
What? It's merciless desire to kill the Mac.

45:09.840 --> 45:12.840
Yeah. We knew this was coming.

45:12.840 --> 45:18.840
Apple has released Swift Playgrounds now with support for actually creating apps on the iPad.

45:18.840 --> 45:22.840
It only took, you know, forever. A decade.

45:22.840 --> 45:26.840
Did it take forever? I just want to say Snow Leopard is very fresh in my mind.

45:26.840 --> 45:30.840
So I would maybe calm down with that. It's only version four. It's only you're right.

45:30.840 --> 45:33.840
It's only version four. So maybe four years took about four years.

45:33.840 --> 45:42.840
So the scariest thing about this update for me personally is that my son theoretically can create an app to automatically screw with my pets.

45:42.840 --> 45:46.840
Now what now? My son has an iPad. Yeah. But how does he screw with your pets?

45:46.840 --> 45:50.840
I don't know. Tell me about this. Also, did you get a new kitty?

45:50.840 --> 45:55.840
We did get a new kitten. Yes. Oh, congrats. It's adorable. I saw the picture on Twitter. It looks cute.

45:55.840 --> 46:00.840
Like all cats, she notices when Visual Studio Code is open and that I haven't saved the file.

46:00.840 --> 46:04.840
Of course. Immediately jumps up. Oh, no.

46:04.840 --> 46:07.840
And there's a barrel roll on the keyboard. Look at me.

46:07.840 --> 46:12.840
I also made the mistake of keeping the little glowy kind of rainbow.

46:12.840 --> 46:15.840
Oh, yeah. I got that. I got that going right now. It's nice.

46:15.840 --> 46:21.840
I like the pinwheel one, but I've changed it because I don't want to think about Mac because, you know, the breakup just happened.

46:21.840 --> 46:24.840
Oh, and it draws the kitty's attention.

46:24.840 --> 46:27.840
Trying to get the cats like, bam, smack, smack, smack, smack.

46:27.840 --> 46:29.840
Cats like launch keyboards. You heard it here.

46:29.840 --> 46:39.840
So no, what my kid likes to do is because we have a senile dog and a little dog who's like hyper aggressive against other dogs.

46:39.840 --> 46:45.840
He likes to play. I made the mistake of downloading a National Geographic app for him.

46:45.840 --> 46:47.840
They have like a kitty app. Wow.

46:47.840 --> 46:51.840
And in this app, you can play different animal sounds. Oh, sure.

46:51.840 --> 46:56.840
And one of the sounds is wolves howling. Uh oh. Kitty doesn't like that.

46:56.840 --> 46:59.840
No, the cats are like, whatever, if you're an idiot, it's an iPad.

46:59.840 --> 47:04.840
But the dogs? The dogs are like ready to go to war. Oh, yeah.

47:04.840 --> 47:09.840
They're snarling. They're growling. They don't understand what's happening right now.

47:09.840 --> 47:14.840
So in many ways, my dogs are the junior JavaScript developers of the house.

47:14.840 --> 47:15.840
Right.

47:15.840 --> 47:20.840
And my kid is an Objective C developer who refuses to work and it's just being better than them.

47:20.840 --> 47:25.840
I mean, you know, this is this is the sign that the Mac could be replaced one day.

47:25.840 --> 47:26.840
It is. Yeah.

47:26.840 --> 47:34.840
Until an iOS device could create its own apps. Now it can make iPad and iPhone apps and iPhone apps and Mac apps.

47:34.840 --> 47:37.840
Now it has the ability to replace the Mac. Now, they're not going to be very sophisticated, obviously.

47:37.840 --> 47:40.840
It's early days. But this was the first step required.

47:40.840 --> 47:42.840
That's what they said about Swift.

47:42.840 --> 47:48.840
Doesn't it just seem obvious that Swift Playgrounds is eventually going to do an iMovie Final Cut kind of split too?

47:48.840 --> 47:52.840
It just seems like what's going to happen. And it will be some kind of Xcode for iOS.

47:52.840 --> 47:56.840
Yeah, I think what's going to happen is Swift Playgrounds is, yeah, exactly like iMovie Final Cut.

47:56.840 --> 48:01.840
You're exactly right. It's going to gain functionality, but not fast enough to take out.

48:01.840 --> 48:06.840
And, you know, Xcode on Mac will always have a place for your worthy enterprise. Right.

48:06.840 --> 48:11.840
Well, and your big builds with all the M1 cores in there and whatnot or whatever they're going to be, you know.

48:11.840 --> 48:20.840
I've read some frightening speculative pieces on how much more they can get out of the M1 without significantly increasing thermals.

48:20.840 --> 48:22.840
If that's true.

48:22.840 --> 48:27.840
And I've also heard speculation of like iCloud Xcode build too, which would sort of normalize that.

48:27.840 --> 48:33.840
I just want to talk about it. Can we talk about iCloud Core Data again?

48:33.840 --> 48:38.840
Yeah, I wouldn't touch that with the authors.

48:38.840 --> 48:42.840
Yeah, but they got to figure out something now because all these Apple employees are staying home.

48:42.840 --> 48:46.840
You see this. Apple has delayed the return to offices indefinitely,

48:46.840 --> 48:51.840
which the reason why that's remarkable is because Tim Cook was thrown down earlier in the year about people.

48:51.840 --> 48:55.840
People said, we don't want to come back. And they said, and now they're saying, oh, OK.

48:55.840 --> 48:58.840
Not only that, here's a thousand dollars to go buy yourself something nice.

48:58.840 --> 49:03.840
One Tim Cook is like every Mac Daddy ever. Here's a thousand bucks, honey.

49:03.840 --> 49:08.840
Here you go. Yeah. And I will take my cancellation now, please, because I'm tired.

49:08.840 --> 49:11.840
I feel like this is the right choice, right?

49:11.840 --> 49:17.840
I mean, as I sit here and according to my doctor, almost certainly infected with Omicron,

49:17.840 --> 49:24.840
which is just running through Florida because Florida.

49:24.840 --> 49:27.840
And I mean, it's actually running through everywhere. That's why I'm thinking about I got it.

49:27.840 --> 49:32.840
I got to postpone my meetup on the second. Yeah, I feel like I don't know.

49:32.840 --> 49:35.840
I mean, can I fry some? I'm not even going to call it bacon because bacon is fun.

49:35.840 --> 49:38.840
Oh, man, I brought all this bacon in, but I understand you don't want to waste.

49:38.840 --> 49:43.840
No, I'm going to boil some cauliflower. All right. Good for you. OK, I hate cauliflower.

49:43.840 --> 49:46.840
All right. But, you know, when you boil it, it makes it real good.

49:46.840 --> 49:53.840
I'm pretty sure we've got like two more years of this crap.

49:53.840 --> 49:56.840
I was doing the boiling. Oh, I heard you. It was beautiful.

49:56.840 --> 50:01.840
Two more years of the lockdown, no more getting together, meetups, no more business stuff.

50:01.840 --> 50:08.840
Yeah, this I mean, we're not fully locked down. I mean, I'm locked down for another like four days or three days.

50:08.840 --> 50:13.840
I don't know. I don't think we're going to be having.

50:13.840 --> 50:17.840
Like, there was no DevFest Florida, which is my conference I look forward to every year.

50:17.840 --> 50:21.840
I don't think there was no Linux fest Northwest, and I don't think there's going to be one in April.

50:21.840 --> 50:26.840
Is there? No, I don't think so. I like how every week we end here where we just lament.

50:26.840 --> 50:30.840
I know. I know. I got a solution. It better not be Facebook VR.

50:30.840 --> 50:33.840
I don't know why a podcaster from Seattle had to be the one to figure it out.

50:33.840 --> 50:38.840
But the solution just have everyone test every day, rapid testing every day.

50:38.840 --> 50:42.840
You test before you go to the event. You test before you go into the office.

50:42.840 --> 50:47.840
You test before you go to school. You test before you go to a meetup. And if you're sick, you stay home.

50:47.840 --> 50:52.840
And the thing is, is even if the testing only gets you when you're at your peak infection rate, it's going to get you the next day.

50:52.840 --> 50:55.840
It's going to get everybody who are at that event if they also are rapid testing.

50:55.840 --> 51:02.840
So if even if the testing doesn't catch it on day one, if everyone is practicing rapid testing, you'll catch it real quick.

51:02.840 --> 51:06.840
It doesn't involve anyone injecting themselves. It doesn't involve anyone taking any medication.

51:06.840 --> 51:09.840
It's got nothing to do with any kind of mass or social distancing.

51:09.840 --> 51:13.840
You just test yourself. You test yourself every single day before you go out.

51:13.840 --> 51:18.840
And that's all it would take. And you just print up the way I did the test of the doctor.

51:18.840 --> 51:21.840
Don't want me to come to the weird medical reasons that Mike has.

51:21.840 --> 51:25.840
I would have had to go to the hospital and he didn't want me to go. But you can buy them.

51:25.840 --> 51:31.840
Yep. Yeah, you can. Yep. You can have someone deliver them to your door for like three bucks.

51:31.840 --> 51:39.840
I paid the guy more because I felt bad, but I think Joe Biden ought to send everyone a Christmas card with a batch of federally funded testing.

51:39.840 --> 51:45.840
I mean, we're willing to spend trillions on everything else and we have testing sites that we're setting up. Those are expensive.

51:45.840 --> 51:48.840
This would be a real practical solution and that would still let people function.

51:48.840 --> 51:51.840
I know I'm a genius and I'm sure I've thought of every single dynamic.

51:51.840 --> 51:56.840
So let's have our COVID moment. Let's have our feefies, right? Let's have our feelings.

51:56.840 --> 52:02.840
I could not have imagined if you had told me and let's say 20.

52:02.840 --> 52:06.840
Early 2019, if you had said, Michael.

52:06.840 --> 52:10.840
Thinking about the business for the next couple of years.

52:10.840 --> 52:14.840
You're not going to go physically see clients for two years.

52:14.840 --> 52:20.840
And you're not going to do any shows, trade shows right now, but you'd say you're putting me out of business.

52:20.840 --> 52:26.840
I'd say, did I die? Right. My expectation would be, is it because I'm dead?

52:26.840 --> 52:29.840
We're in this strange, I almost feel like holding pattern.

52:29.840 --> 52:33.840
Like everybody, like I saw all the articles about Apple allowing remote work.

52:33.840 --> 52:38.840
What were they going to do? Yeah. A sick workforce can't work.

52:38.840 --> 52:41.840
I mean, it's not it's not even him being benevolent, right?

52:41.840 --> 52:47.840
It's covering his own ass. If they force everyone to come in and then everyone gets Omicron at the office, that's on Tim Cook.

52:47.840 --> 52:51.840
And then they can't work for two weeks. I mean, I don't know.

52:51.840 --> 52:57.840
Not only does it wreck the productivity, but it also is, you know, hey, man, you made us come back and then we all got sick.

52:57.840 --> 53:02.840
I mean, that sounds well, and then you potentially have liability and lawyers are fun.

53:02.840 --> 53:08.840
The only real ray of hope is that perhaps the symptoms are lighter.

53:08.840 --> 53:17.840
My neighbor had it and they believe it was the Omicron variant and it was mostly a cold for him, you know, a few days.

53:17.840 --> 53:22.840
Yeah. Get your bacon out. I got you here. Oh, I knew it. You see, I was going to put it away.

53:22.840 --> 53:26.840
All right. Welcome to Morgan Dominic. It's like Morgan Stanley, but we killed Stanley.

53:26.840 --> 53:34.840
OK, we're going to have a party in Seattle. We're going to do it up right with some Denver pot.

53:34.840 --> 53:38.840
I don't smoke pot, but I understand that Chris does. It is joking.

53:38.840 --> 53:43.840
What I like is you might as well. I mean, why not? You're flying in for a little while. Enjoy yourself.

53:43.840 --> 53:51.840
It's a big part of the tourism thing here. The worst part is I'm with my I could technically get a card, but it's I just chose not to.

53:51.840 --> 53:58.840
We're celebrating a merger, a marriage, if you will. A marriage, a beautiful relationship.

53:58.840 --> 54:05.840
I will say it's kind of a May, December situation. Microsoft by System 76.

54:05.840 --> 54:12.840
I'm sorry, what? What? Why? Either I'm delirious because I'm dying of Omicron and I don't know it or.

54:12.840 --> 54:17.840
I think this is that will change the world. Sure would think about this.

54:17.840 --> 54:27.840
Windows 12. Exclamation point underscore OS. I do like it. I do like love you guys.

54:27.840 --> 54:31.840
I like it. And then you just you show up. It's a pop desktop with a Windows icon.

54:31.840 --> 54:35.840
You double click it and it's the Windows 11 experience inside Pop OS.

54:35.840 --> 54:41.840
You just flip that crap, right? So it's it's a Linux desktop with the Linux subsystem for Windows.

54:41.840 --> 54:46.840
And I'm telling you, that would work for me. Tell you what. All right. Well, you know, it was a week or so ago.

54:46.840 --> 54:51.840
We launched Jupiter Party where you can go to sign up and become a network member and get access to all the special stuff.

54:51.840 --> 54:59.840
So you get Coder QA for this show. You get the self hosted post show. You get the Linux unplugged live show, which is like two shows in one.

54:59.840 --> 55:03.840
And you get Linux action news totally ad free at Jupiter Party.

55:03.840 --> 55:07.840
And you can sign up right now until the end of the month. Then it expires.

55:07.840 --> 55:10.840
But if you sign up right now, you get two dollars off for a year.

55:10.840 --> 55:13.840
So the cost of two memberships. But with that two dollar discount, it's even cheaper.

55:13.840 --> 55:17.840
And all the shows are now ad free, all ad free in that feed.

55:17.840 --> 55:21.840
So go enjoy it. Support the network and all that at Jupiter Party.

55:21.840 --> 55:27.840
You can also give it as a gift. If Coder is your jam, we appreciate our QA members more than ever.

55:27.840 --> 55:31.840
You know what? You guys have been awesome this year. Thank you so much to the Coder QA squad.

55:31.840 --> 55:36.840
You can become a member of this show at Coder QA dot co and support Coder Radio directly.

55:36.840 --> 55:43.840
We appreciate all of that. And even if you can't financially support us, we love it that you've listened, you've downloaded, maybe showed up live once.

55:43.840 --> 55:47.840

55:47.840 --> 55:53.840
Or maybe you've just been silently listening and enjoying the show. Either way, we're tremendously grateful for you doing that.

55:53.840 --> 55:56.840
So thank you very much. Take care of yourselves out there.

55:56.840 --> 55:59.840
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send people this week as we wrap up?

55:59.840 --> 56:04.840
Alice Dot Dev, as always. And if you are the snow leopard engineer for Gnome, hook them up.

56:04.840 --> 56:09.840
This is your moment. Cook me up. It's time for a refresh time. The time is now.

56:09.840 --> 56:14.840
Jump into action, sir. You can follow the show on Twitter at Coder Radio Show.

56:14.840 --> 56:20.840
The conversation is always going in our network telegram. That's Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash telegram.

56:20.840 --> 56:24.840
And then, yes, if you're matrix brave, there is a Coder Radio section in there.

56:24.840 --> 56:30.840
Our matrix server is Colony dot Jupiter Broadcasting dot com. You can join in there. There's Coder Radio feedback and all that kind of stuff.

56:30.840 --> 56:39.840
And of course, links to everything we talked about today, our feedback feed page and our RSS feed at Coder dot show slash four four five.

56:39.840 --> 57:04.840
Thanks for joining us. See you back here next week.
