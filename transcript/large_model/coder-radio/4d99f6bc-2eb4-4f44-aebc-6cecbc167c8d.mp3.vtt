00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 464 for May 2nd, 2022.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.040
Hello good looking and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:19.040 --> 00:24.420
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.420 --> 00:29.160
My name is Chris and joining us, probably with a musical instrument in hand, it's our

00:29.160 --> 00:30.640
host Mr. Dominic.

00:30.640 --> 00:31.640
Hello Mike.

00:31.640 --> 00:36.840
Hello and welcome to the very southern episode of KOTOR Radio.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.000
Oh no, this is my fault.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.440
I mentioned Kevin Spacey, now we're all Frank.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.440
And I'm here for it, I'm here for it.

00:46.440 --> 00:50.760
First of all, if I'm going to eat spare ribs, I'm going to do it before the restaurant opens

00:50.760 --> 00:54.840
in an alley creepily wearing half a suit.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.360
Right, I mean that's how you got to eat your barbecue, right?

00:57.360 --> 01:01.960
And then when I take a girl on a date, if we're near a train, maybe you got to watch

01:01.960 --> 01:02.960
out.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.160
Don't go in the subway with Frank.

01:04.160 --> 01:10.120
Although I should have read that Netflix contract quite a bit more carefully, quite a bit more.

01:10.120 --> 01:14.520
Netflix might be knocking on the door of some of their original content actors and creators

01:14.520 --> 01:17.800
because maybe they need to run the hits again, they're not doing so good my friend.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.960
You know what, in America you can sue everybody.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.480
I think we're about to witness peak streaming, we'll see.

01:23.480 --> 01:27.040
Maybe the great streaming consolidation will happen.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.000
I just want to interrupt here.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.920
Someone heard my Kevin Spacey just now in the chat and literally said, bring back Jar Jar.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.560
Oh no.

01:35.560 --> 01:41.680
In 13 years, this is the first time anybody has ever asked for Jar Jar.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.040
We didn't think it could get worse.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.800
But if you some miss me, me some back bitches.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.960
No we don't miss you.

01:49.960 --> 01:54.120
Phantom Menace is better than the new prequels?

01:54.120 --> 01:56.560
You know what, you might be right.

01:56.560 --> 02:00.660
First of all, The Force Awakens is literally A New Hope with like a spit shine.

02:00.660 --> 02:02.760
So that doesn't count.

02:02.760 --> 02:03.760
Sorry.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.760
Sorry.

02:04.760 --> 02:08.780
Oh and Hayden Christensen is coming back because we can't help ourselves.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.040
Let me ask you this though.

02:10.040 --> 02:13.040
Okay, brace yourself because I think I got you here.

02:13.040 --> 02:18.500
Isn't it more of an atrocity because Lucas was hands on with the prequels, whereas these

02:18.500 --> 02:24.120
Disney bastardizations, they're like it's a whole new group of people, I mean it's some

02:24.120 --> 02:27.280
people from LucasArts, but you know it's not it's not George.

02:27.280 --> 02:32.800
But like the prequels were really bad and the acting and the writing was really really

02:32.800 --> 02:36.060
bad and that's all on George's hands, right?

02:36.060 --> 02:38.660
Like which is a bigger atrocity in my opinion.

02:38.660 --> 02:39.660
It's worse.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.600
I'm gonna tell you why it's worse.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.360
See George Lucas is like a guy who was really really drunk and crashed his car and totaled

02:45.360 --> 02:47.080
it.

02:47.080 --> 02:52.960
Disney intentionally crashed the car stone sober for the insurance money for that sweet

02:52.960 --> 02:54.960
sweet merchandising revenue.

02:54.960 --> 02:55.960
That's probably true.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.840
Plus it makes for some sweet theme parks.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.480
I mean of course you need a Darth Vader for Gen Z.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.960
I'm just saying like a look at what they did.

03:02.960 --> 03:03.960
Who's Obi-Wan?

03:03.960 --> 03:04.960
Um, Rey?

03:04.960 --> 03:07.200
Kind of Luke I guess but like really Rey, right?

03:07.200 --> 03:11.920
Oh and we have to add a super handsome dude who's a pilot because well didn't Han Solo

03:11.920 --> 03:12.920
exist?

03:12.920 --> 03:15.880
Yeah yeah he has to be like that certain kind of character too.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.240
He's kind of roguish, right?

03:17.240 --> 03:18.240
Exactly.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.120
You know you know he's a good man but he's got some edges you know like like if you know

03:22.120 --> 03:26.720
if your daughter brought him home you'd be like I don't know honey but damn he's so charming.

03:26.720 --> 03:33.620
Let me throw another curveball at you because in the era of streaming a lot of classic legacy

03:33.620 --> 03:36.200
I guess I don't know what to call them other than IP but I was trying to think of a better

03:36.200 --> 03:40.480
word but you know what I'm talking about like your Star Trek's your Star Wars your Teenage

03:40.480 --> 03:45.320
Mutant Ninja Turtles they've been brought back right like CBS All Access has like a

03:45.320 --> 03:50.640
whole slate of Star Trek shows but they're all written by the same like team so all the

03:50.640 --> 03:53.640
shows are kind of the same even though they're all different they're all different shows

03:53.640 --> 03:57.220
but it's are all written by the same core writers and producers.

03:57.220 --> 03:59.280
Do we have to bash Discovery again?

03:59.280 --> 04:04.460
I mean I'm always I'm here for sure of course I mean that's easy but here's where I'm going

04:04.460 --> 04:08.280
and I don't know if this is true or not but I'm wondering what you think.

04:08.280 --> 04:14.760
Could it be that the problem is is that we are now watching content being created by

04:14.760 --> 04:16.920
people that are younger than us?

04:16.920 --> 04:20.040
So this is okay you have just opened a door.

04:20.040 --> 04:25.400
There I say you have activated the spore drive and we're on the mycelial plane and I'm about

04:25.400 --> 04:27.320
to dunk hard on Discovery.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.280
Do you know what's wrong with Discovery?

04:29.280 --> 04:30.280
What?

04:30.280 --> 04:35.840
And I just finished watching all of Discovery and I thought I didn't like Voyager.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.640
It makes Voyager look amazing and Voyager frankly isn't that bad.

04:39.640 --> 04:42.400
Dude people hated Enterprise at the time.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.760
You know what Enterprise is good.

04:43.760 --> 04:47.680
It is taken to a whole nother level now and when you view it after watching Discovery

04:47.680 --> 04:49.640
and Picard I'd seriously if you're a Star Trek fan.

04:49.640 --> 04:55.240
If you're just curious about how how writing has changed, watch Picard or watch Discovery

04:55.240 --> 04:58.880
and then go watch Enterprise and Enterprise was like the peak Star Trek production where

04:58.880 --> 05:01.040
like the production was all normalized.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.320
They had a whole machine behind it.

05:02.320 --> 05:06.560
They had like these go-to character actors that played like pivotal roles like Jeffrey

05:06.560 --> 05:11.440
Combs and Dorian.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.440
He also plays a Ferengi.

05:12.440 --> 05:16.880
I just watched the episode last night where he plays a Ferengi and it's just so great.

05:16.880 --> 05:22.720
Even their weak episodes are better than the highlights of the season from Discovery.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.760
So we're throwing out the doc at least for now.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.760
Apparently yeah.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.640
We're going with modern Star Trek.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.640
So TNG doesn't count.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.280
That's old Star Trek.

05:32.280 --> 05:36.960
I just want to say I would say modern Star Trek starts with DS9 and Voyager which were

05:36.960 --> 05:41.960
weirdly for folks who don't know like chronologically synchronized right like they're didn't they

05:41.960 --> 05:46.000
air on opposite nights or something like they were they were direct competitors.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.240
For our first couple of seasons of Voyager DS9 ran but I feel like the new era does start

05:50.240 --> 05:55.000
with TNG but it just wasn't fully flushed out until like season six and seven.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.360
Yeah I feel like most of TNG is basically better effects original Star Trek and then

06:00.360 --> 06:04.880
DS9 it's really midway into DS9 where they start to get like the story continuity and

06:04.880 --> 06:05.880
stuff like that.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.800
I really I know people don't like DS9.

06:07.800 --> 06:13.600
I actually really like DS9 and I've mentioned this before but I don't know I'm super down

06:13.600 --> 06:17.960
with the idea that like what if you had to actually hold your goddamn ground right right

06:17.960 --> 06:21.600
like you weren't just like flying away and having adventures that yeah.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.480
And as a result they got some of the best guest stars exactly.

06:25.480 --> 06:30.040
So the problem with Discovery is the most interesting character on the first season

06:30.040 --> 06:33.280
of Discovery is Captain Lorca.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.400
My wife says this every time we watch Discovery.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.520
It's not that he's evil right it's not the spoilers I guess.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.920
So I'll give you a beat one two.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.300
There's your two beats.

06:43.300 --> 06:46.660
If they didn't do the alternate dimension of bulls**t and just make him like a cartoon

06:46.660 --> 06:53.160
character level villain in the next season how about an actual guy or gal it could be

06:53.160 --> 07:01.040
a gal it's not a gender thing it's it's whatever that was a Starfleet captain but kind of like

07:01.040 --> 07:06.120
didn't buy into all the bulls**t right that kind of was like no we need to kill our enemies

07:06.120 --> 07:09.120
because if I'm easy on them they kill my people.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.440
Remember the Battle of the Binaries that's this whole thing right.

07:11.440 --> 07:15.440
His whole argument before they make him a cartoon villain is but they murdered lots

07:15.440 --> 07:19.120
of our people and they're super cool with killing women and children and civilians.

07:19.120 --> 07:22.680
Yeah he was an interesting character he was a new spin on that role.

07:22.680 --> 07:26.600
Honestly he's a more realistic like before they make him a cartoon character he's a lot

07:26.600 --> 07:30.840
more like what like an actual military man would be like like no we gotta win.

07:30.840 --> 07:34.560
Which would be time appropriate that would have been time appropriate back then.

07:34.560 --> 07:38.900
But they couldn't help it because like we have to understand the people like the best

07:38.900 --> 07:44.080
episode I think is the first season the Klingons are attacking the mining colony and you see

07:44.080 --> 07:50.520
the man he's holding his child you know kids and everything and Lorca is just like no we're

07:50.520 --> 07:57.440
getting there we're gonna dunk on them like the thirsty rigid head folks that they are.

07:57.440 --> 08:02.000
And somehow we decided to have feelings again like this is Star Trek's fatal flaw to me

08:02.000 --> 08:05.920
it believes in a reality that can't possibly exist and it is not the warp drive that's

08:05.920 --> 08:08.920
the problem or the spore drive I hate Discovery.

08:08.920 --> 08:13.260
If you watch the rest of Discovery like the emerald chain like that lady has a point right

08:13.260 --> 08:18.440
like she's not wrong all the dilithium crystals are gone no one can do warp travel.

08:18.440 --> 08:22.460
I love it you always identify with the villains it's so great.

08:22.460 --> 08:27.680
No it's just like she's like dude let's make an alliance because we have to keep in line

08:27.680 --> 08:34.380
if we don't keep it in line crazy pirates do crazy things and yeah they do.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.320
Here's what I'm thinking and here's where I go with this.

08:37.320 --> 08:42.540
So I think what it is is that the writers of these shows have a different set of values

08:42.540 --> 08:47.480
so it reflects that in their writing and now I'm wondering as we talk about this does this

08:47.480 --> 08:53.560
also apply to software like so let's just say for a moment that the average developer

08:53.560 --> 08:58.820
of GNOME is like 25 27 maybe 30 years old.

08:58.820 --> 08:59.820
Is that true?

08:59.820 --> 09:03.420
I don't know I don't think so but I have talked to several members of the GNOME project that

09:03.420 --> 09:05.900
are young so they're like you know early 20s.

09:05.900 --> 09:08.880
I mean we're not that much older.

09:08.880 --> 09:12.740
It's a 20 year difference for me and so maybe there's just a different set of values and

09:12.740 --> 09:14.260
10 for me but okay sure.

09:14.260 --> 09:18.300
I'm wondering if that does play a factor in software development if what you know what

09:18.300 --> 09:22.680
age you are what you value at that time what you focus on which may change over time better

09:22.680 --> 09:26.700
or worse I'm not making a judgment call there but I wonder if that reflects just like we're

09:26.700 --> 09:33.700
seeing it potentially reflected in Star Trek and in Star Wars do we see it in software

09:33.700 --> 09:38.140
and is that maybe one of the problems we have in free software is we either have this issue

09:38.140 --> 09:43.700
where it's a bunch of gray beards and once they age out nobody replaces them or we have

09:43.700 --> 09:48.060
the opposite end of the spectrum where it's sort of like college kids or kids getting

09:48.060 --> 09:52.840
out of high school which is great but also maybe not the best if they're the majority

09:52.840 --> 09:53.840
of the project.

09:53.840 --> 09:57.460
Well this is funny because you and I were having a private conversation earlier today

09:57.460 --> 10:01.420
and every once in a while I will mention on Twitter that I'm going to open a Cora Alice

10:01.420 --> 10:06.000
or I'm going to try to and I get more hate for that than just saying I'm keeping it proprietary

10:06.000 --> 10:08.780
to help you guys pay me.

10:08.780 --> 10:12.500
Right and you know what it might be and I think this is what you're driving at I think

10:12.500 --> 10:19.100
you just nailed it is it's like exposure bias because we are exposed to availability which

10:19.100 --> 10:27.060
is Twitter, YouTube, things like Telegram, real-time chat rooms they're kind of a selective

10:27.060 --> 10:32.860
group of people they're not necessarily representative of the broader spectrum of folks who have

10:32.860 --> 10:38.780
a very busy life and don't have time to participate in an online community or don't have anything

10:38.780 --> 10:43.100
to promote they don't have anything they want to let people know about so they literally

10:43.100 --> 10:47.340
have no reason to engage in social media and can't be bothered to and so they don't get

10:47.340 --> 10:49.940
their positions reflected properly in the conversation.

10:49.940 --> 10:53.900
I'm gonna hit it a little harder though the folks being super negative and like mean to

10:53.900 --> 10:58.540
each other also have very little or nothing of their own to promote and so there's no

10:58.540 --> 11:03.180
cost to them right like every time I do or say something stupid there's a cost to me

11:03.180 --> 11:06.940
same for you right you've been everybody makes a mistake sure I mean folks don't know how

11:06.940 --> 11:12.700
hard it is to do a live show every week it's easy to misspeak it's easy to say something

11:12.700 --> 11:17.700
maybe where you assume that people are gonna take it with charity but uh I don't know if

11:17.700 --> 11:21.060
you've ever been on reddit you can't always be up in your head either about well what

11:21.060 --> 11:25.260
is the psychology of the person listening because then it just locks you up and it freezes

11:25.260 --> 11:31.400
you up so it is it is a particularly challenging kind of work because you want to speak freely

11:31.400 --> 11:37.060
so that way you can tell your you know your actual honest truth you can also be engaging

11:37.060 --> 11:41.220
and at the same time if you're processing how are people gonna take this all the time

11:41.220 --> 11:46.100
which you can't help but do but if you're doing that a lot you kind of ruin it you kind

11:46.100 --> 11:50.260
of wreck the conversation and it kind of becomes this watered down discussion and that's a

11:50.260 --> 11:57.140
tricky tricky thing and people can be upset because you know they look at situations differently

11:57.140 --> 12:00.060
anyways I didn't mean to derail you but I just wanted to kind of underscore like how

12:00.060 --> 12:05.780
challenging that that is a challenging thing there yeah it's tough I mean we you know we've

12:05.780 --> 12:09.940
gotten a lot of feedback you know this week some of it you know we've chosen to respond

12:09.940 --> 12:16.340
to privately I mean I hadn't thought about it the way you had that maybe like I'm a little

12:16.340 --> 12:22.300
younger than you right sorry your hair is better though so what do you care but like

12:22.300 --> 12:29.260
we're not that far apart right maybe it is a generational thing that you know and who

12:29.260 --> 12:35.580
knows right like maybe they're right I don't know I just you know to me I I came up in

12:35.580 --> 12:42.220
that time when the big win if you were an engineer was to go talk to your manager or

12:42.220 --> 12:46.780
the VP or whoever the director you know the companies of word structures and get them

12:46.780 --> 12:51.860
to open source anything and even if that was like Apache or BSD open source even if they

12:51.860 --> 12:58.060
were doing it for purely like to edge out a competitor like bad reasons that was a win

12:58.060 --> 13:02.860
you got a gold star here's your tux plushie and it didn't matter who you were right you

13:02.860 --> 13:07.260
could be you know Planned Parenthood you could be the Catholic Church right if I'm trying

13:07.260 --> 13:12.220
to go to extremes now it's kind of like well no but is the person who open sourced it in

13:12.220 --> 13:16.420
some way evil I don't know I you know what there's a reason I'm gonna watch Star Trek

13:16.420 --> 13:21.020
original series again and make myself feel better that's we should move on that's yeah

13:21.020 --> 13:26.180
it's like it's TNG is like my security blanket I love it it's never goes wrong now DS 9 man

13:26.180 --> 13:31.700
do you know why if Quark's bar ever existed I don't think I'd ever show up to the show

13:31.700 --> 13:35.940
oh man I'd come down there I join you and we just do it from the bar in the holodeck

13:35.940 --> 13:42.220
you just throw me in the holodeck actually would be down for that I could go for a holodeck

13:42.220 --> 13:45.860
that's why maybe the VR was so appealing we're not gonna talk about our disappointment yet

13:45.860 --> 13:52.260
are we no I was more like picturing us chilling in the bar you know having some drinks talking

13:52.260 --> 13:56.100
some code or stuff I think that'd be pretty great I could drunk and at least talk to Cleons

13:56.100 --> 14:00.660
and see how that goes see yeah we'll see how long that last all right well now getting

14:00.660 --> 14:08.300
into the show ask not what your podcast can boost for you but what you can boost for your

14:08.300 --> 14:16.660
podcast snooze ejects boosted in with 2222 sets speaking of free software funding from

14:16.660 --> 14:22.980
last episode did you guys know that the Mozilla Foundation is the 100% owner of a for-profit

14:22.980 --> 14:26.520
corporation known as the Mozilla Corporation and did you know that the same person that

14:26.520 --> 14:31.580
runs the foundation also runs the corporation and that the Linux Foundation has gotten into

14:31.580 --> 14:37.340
selling NFTs on their hyper ledger while also selling their platinum membership which is

14:37.340 --> 14:43.860
$500,000 a year to companies like Microsoft Meta Oracle VMware and others do you think

14:43.860 --> 14:47.780
these types of foundations are bad for developers I can't help but notice the people who run

14:47.780 --> 14:51.820
these foundations get rich and only a small handful of the people writing the software

14:51.820 --> 14:56.260
make anything close to a livable wage I note here that this is a conversation that you

14:56.260 --> 14:59.980
and I have been skirting around I think snooze eject kind of nails it right on the head in

14:59.980 --> 15:04.940
an uncomfortable way that we didn't really want to say out loud curious and curiouser

15:04.940 --> 15:09.260
I mean it does become concerning doesn't it yes that is definitely a diplomatic way to

15:09.260 --> 15:13.980
put that yes I don't know what else to say about it though really you can't undo it I

15:13.980 --> 15:16.900
don't think at this point you're not gonna unwind these foundations and in some way they

15:16.900 --> 15:21.300
are at least paying for some stuff I just want to say for over a decade you and I have

15:21.300 --> 15:26.060
been discussing funding software development and it's still a problem and I think that's

15:26.060 --> 15:30.820
where maybe we should leave it I mean I know you're right and I know it's it's hopeless

15:30.820 --> 15:34.380
but this is why I have been talking about the value for value model more and more even

15:34.380 --> 15:38.580
though people hate it when I do but I think they need to hear this I think we have to

15:38.580 --> 15:43.940
consider that foundations and Google and Amazon are not going to solve this problem and I

15:43.940 --> 15:49.500
think we have to consider just building in and and and and creating this culture of a

15:49.500 --> 15:54.740
mindset that if you get value from a free software project you exchange value in some

15:54.740 --> 15:59.180
way back be it be documentation be it code be it monetary I mean I have another word

15:59.180 --> 16:04.020
for that open core sure good that could be a way you could contribute core you could

16:04.020 --> 16:08.840
contribute code back to the core you could help bug test it right you could have open

16:08.840 --> 16:12.560
core can be very liberal right you think the beautiful thing about writing the license

16:12.560 --> 16:15.980
is that you get to write the damn license I don't you can write any light it's like

16:15.980 --> 16:19.380
any contract I think it's a culture problem I don't think it's a I don't think it's a

16:19.380 --> 16:24.340
license problem I think it's a culture issue and I think I believe open source and free

16:24.340 --> 16:29.480
software projects haven't been been selling their value they haven't been pitching they

16:29.480 --> 16:33.700
don't they don't sell they don't sell that's basically they don't sell and they don't tell

16:33.700 --> 16:39.980
users that we actually need this and I am also of the opinion that there really hasn't

16:39.980 --> 16:44.420
been a good facility and means to do it and I think these boost type systems where you're

16:44.420 --> 16:49.060
doing a peer-to-peer payment system where you can afford to send three dollars or two

16:49.060 --> 16:53.140
dollars you can't even do that with the US dollar none of these payment systems make

16:53.140 --> 16:58.520
it viable to send that kind of amount of money and so we have people who listen to this show

16:58.520 --> 17:03.980
and they have turned on sat streaming in their podcasting 2.0 app and as they listen they

17:03.980 --> 17:09.660
just send us a few sats in the background every few minutes and it ends up being maybe

17:09.660 --> 17:13.020
55 cents for them at the end of the listening session or a dollar that you know whatever

17:13.020 --> 17:19.380
they said it to and we could be doing that same exact thing we could be all of the technology

17:19.380 --> 17:24.140
pipeline is there but we would still hit that cultural issue so we have to also fix that

17:24.140 --> 17:28.220
it's something we have to bake in it's something we used to talk about more and it got away

17:28.220 --> 17:33.460
from us and I think part in part because of these sort of centralizations that have occurred

17:33.460 --> 17:37.860
and in part because of blowback that's occurred I mean I've been thinking about this a lot

17:37.860 --> 17:42.280
it's been coming up a lot on the show I've also seen more free software projects embracing

17:42.280 --> 17:47.700
things like matrix and mastodon for their coordination I even joined the podcasting

17:47.700 --> 17:51.460
2.0 mastodon I'll put a link to that in the show notes just because you know I don't not

17:51.460 --> 17:58.460
a big mastodon not a big social media person but it's sort of like a really niche focused

17:58.460 --> 18:03.060
communications platform where people are talking about the back end development that's happening

18:03.060 --> 18:07.100
for podcasting 2.0 and the developers are communicating with other developers about

18:07.100 --> 18:13.700
the things they're working on in this very vertical mastodon instance that might have

18:13.700 --> 18:19.500
legs long term I don't know maybe not but it does feel like we've we've reached a tipping

18:19.500 --> 18:25.220
point that is not healthy for small developers or developers of all these libraries that

18:25.220 --> 18:29.800
kind of end up being the glue bits that you know turn colors on or can do something that

18:29.800 --> 18:34.080
just is it nice to have that gets pulled in as a dependency and turns out you know tens

18:34.080 --> 18:38.060
of thousands of projects are using that and that person's not making a dime and we have

18:38.060 --> 18:42.820
the means we just don't have the will or the care to do it I think that's it not enough

18:42.820 --> 18:47.500
people give a this is really not my role but I'm going to try to take down the negativity

18:47.500 --> 18:53.940
oompa maybe there's a way forward I'm going to shut up about open core because it usually

18:53.940 --> 18:58.980
lends us with a lot of bad emails but sometimes a compromise is better than nothing right

18:58.980 --> 19:01.980
because I got to tell you with the and we're going to talk about Intel in a minute here

19:01.980 --> 19:09.740
but with the M1 chips with Apple's just frankly Thanos level grip on independent developers

19:09.740 --> 19:14.980
right now in terms of mobile but frankly the whole world right I think maybe we need to

19:14.980 --> 19:20.980
make some compromises with values because the the alternative is these big listen the

19:20.980 --> 19:26.300
Facebook VR store we had last week was horrific right fit what is it 50 percent they wanted

19:26.300 --> 19:32.500
yeah basically it's it's unbelievable so if what you're doing isn't working you have to

19:32.500 --> 19:37.220
stop and that's what I feel about frankly the Linux community at this point we're fighting

19:37.220 --> 19:44.140
about stuff for no reason and I know and you know you and I both know a lot of folks who

19:44.140 --> 19:48.860
are pretty deep into the community that are now quietly running M1 Mac pros and basically

19:48.860 --> 19:53.180
not participating much not participating right they got good jobs or they they're doing their

19:53.180 --> 19:57.740
businesses because they're just tired of the nonsense well this is an interesting email

19:57.740 --> 20:02.300
that came into the show that kind of reflects on this so Jimmy wrote in about the cycles

20:02.300 --> 20:06.180
of centralization he says I like to listen on my walks and bike rides but I always forget

20:06.180 --> 20:09.580
to send feedback maybe this will be great he says about the boost since it's right there

20:09.580 --> 20:12.860
in the podcast app while I'm listening but he sent this in via the contact form he says

20:12.860 --> 20:16.620
I know you guys have been talking a lot about decentralization in different contexts and

20:16.620 --> 20:21.140
I wanted to add that I think this is just part of the oscillation of capitalism in general

20:21.140 --> 20:25.280
it seems like industries have a tendency to centralize over time like gravity if you will

20:25.280 --> 20:30.140
for a variety of reasons it's not just because a dominant player buys out others but also

20:30.140 --> 20:35.060
because there is a certain economy of scale that lowers the price of products and services

20:35.060 --> 20:39.560
also coincides with the lower barriers of entry for new users and customers and users

20:39.560 --> 20:43.380
want the most with the least amount of effort and someone will always come around to offer

20:43.380 --> 20:49.140
that which leads eventually to centralization and this routinely happens with technology

20:49.140 --> 20:53.900
it'll even happen with cryptocurrencies eventually and you already do see it happen with companies

20:53.900 --> 20:57.820
like coinbase and robin hood and cash app and stuff like that but he says technology

20:57.820 --> 21:01.620
will then oscillate back and something will break out to decentralize once again like

21:01.620 --> 21:06.320
Batman and the Joker they're doomed to do this forever it's a feature not a bug we're

21:06.320 --> 21:11.480
definitely in a centralization cycle right now and I think Jimmy kind of nails it maybe

21:11.480 --> 21:16.580
some of these things we're talking about are gonna lead to to decentralizing more and maybe

21:16.580 --> 21:23.060
we'll find a balance there it would be really interesting if all of this upset around Twitter

21:23.060 --> 21:28.380
and the Elon purchase leads to Twitter becoming less relevant and then essentially we have

21:28.380 --> 21:33.140
a decentralization of social media so then no one social media platform drives the media

21:33.140 --> 21:37.480
narrative as much as we're seeing today that could be a great outcome it's essentially

21:37.480 --> 21:41.980
Twitter becomes less relevant why do you think it'll become less relevant I could see it

21:41.980 --> 21:46.900
happening simply because the folks behind the media companies are not going to take

21:46.900 --> 21:51.340
a platform run by Elon they're not gonna run their whole slate of programming off of that

21:51.340 --> 21:54.020
do you remember when we were watching the news and all of a sudden they just like started

21:54.020 --> 21:57.980
putting up screenshots of Twitter all the time and it like it was weird right I think

21:57.980 --> 22:04.240
that fades away because Elon changes the general tone on the platform and the narrative I think

22:04.240 --> 22:08.260
that means that they don't want to use it as a source of truth anymore it just seems

22:08.260 --> 22:11.820
like it's a drug that's too easy to hit but we got to keep moving yeah you're right it

22:11.820 --> 22:15.740
is it is very handy bossy right saying he says been listening for a few months love

22:15.740 --> 22:19.000
the show I was wondering what your take is on Elon statement that free speech law should

22:19.000 --> 22:23.540
apply to social media and what that means for the comment sections on places like websites

22:23.540 --> 22:28.860
especially if it results in some sort of legislation do you think this will eventually have a trickle

22:28.860 --> 22:33.620
down concern for small shops down the road once again love the show if kind of one of

22:33.620 --> 22:37.460
the reactions to this is we start like you know following up on defamation and stuff

22:37.460 --> 22:40.500
like that on social media like Twitter do you think that would spread to the rest of

22:40.500 --> 22:49.280
the web yes but I have a probably surprising take on this I don't like a lot of what I

22:49.280 --> 22:55.540
consider an overreaction to history in the moderation stuff like I really don't think

22:55.540 --> 23:01.020
you should go dig into someone's tweets or emails or whatever when they were like 18

23:01.020 --> 23:06.580
or 17 or like a kid to them out of a job I sort of think we just all need to grow up

23:06.580 --> 23:13.220
and like teenage boys in particular are kind of bad people and that's that's fine right

23:13.220 --> 23:19.080
their kids kids are stupid Chris and I are both fathers we were pretty pretty they do

23:19.080 --> 23:25.140
dumb things right that's why you have to protect children that's why they can't so like this

23:25.140 --> 23:29.100
I hate this like witch hunt thing where we go back well when you were in college you

23:29.100 --> 23:34.100
said this misogynist the thing I'm like well I don't know like Chris and I were lucky enough

23:34.100 --> 23:39.620
that social media and for him it's even better was not a huge thing like it was just new

23:39.620 --> 23:44.200
and I remember Facebook wasn't even at my school there are things I said in the really

23:44.200 --> 23:49.660
early podcast like our cast a blast a podcast that we would never say or do now well right

23:49.660 --> 23:56.260
like like I just want to say like teenage boys have some bad ideas because mostly they're

23:56.260 --> 24:02.700
joking and they're like immature so I I sort of I don't know how you can't you can't make

24:02.700 --> 24:08.020
this a law you can't like legislate a free speech shield that no one can ever because

24:08.020 --> 24:12.260
ultimately Twitter is a private corporation I think of it as clubs right if you're from

24:12.260 --> 24:16.180
the north and I they have them down south but it seems to work differently here it's

24:16.180 --> 24:20.340
a private club right if you're a member of the club there are certain standards of behavior

24:20.340 --> 24:24.940
that they expect you to hold I have never been a member of one of these clubs because

24:24.940 --> 24:30.740
I wasn't all right folks here's another Mike lesson in history stay a while stay a while

24:30.740 --> 24:36.920
and listen part of living up north is like wasp exists if you don't know what that means

24:36.920 --> 24:41.880
and if you are one you definitely know what that means and they don't like certain types

24:41.880 --> 24:46.820
of people and it's surprising how expansive they are about not letting them into their

24:46.820 --> 24:55.340
clubs and to me that's annoying it's been a source of irritation for me because I'm

24:55.340 --> 25:01.740
the way I am but I feel like a private company a private platform is a club ultimately and

25:01.740 --> 25:07.600
if the owner of the club doesn't want you there well then he or she can throw you out

25:07.600 --> 25:13.060
they could set the rules so again I hate that technology is so intertwined with this media

25:13.060 --> 25:17.640
crap now it's moderation crap because I would much rather be talking to you about cool python

25:17.640 --> 25:23.580
packages but we we can't escape it I mean it affects my business it definitely affects

25:23.580 --> 25:29.720
Chris's because advertising is a part of a whole mother he could speak to it more but

25:29.720 --> 25:33.580
like you cannot piss off your advertisers and they're more sensitive than they've ever

25:33.580 --> 25:38.220
been before not our specifically like the thing he's getting at with Elon is that the

25:38.220 --> 25:41.540
big media brands will get mad because they don't like Elon and when they were pulled

25:41.540 --> 25:45.460
the ad they were advertising from Twitter is that fair that is definitely one of the

25:45.460 --> 25:51.260
concerns it seems to be yeah right so it's it's like I I don't know my my inner libertarian

25:51.260 --> 25:57.180
is like yeah it's a private club you can throw people out but I can't imagine running my

25:57.180 --> 26:01.220
business the Mad Potter Inc without being able to use any social media because someone

26:01.220 --> 26:05.380
didn't like that I'm like not super I think that's it I think that's the nut of it and

26:05.380 --> 26:09.780
I've been really struggling because I I really don't care but then I realized people view

26:09.780 --> 26:15.700
this as like the platform they go to to express their position and now they're concerned that

26:15.700 --> 26:19.420
ability is going to be taken away from them and other people go there because they feel

26:19.420 --> 26:23.180
like they have to to be in order to even just reach a few hundred people I don't really

26:23.180 --> 26:26.740
know I maybe there is something to it maybe it's more important than I realized or maybe

26:26.740 --> 26:30.220
it's not maybe we're about to discover it's not that important at all and I feel like

26:30.220 --> 26:34.340
that's the fork in the road we're at right now if you had to advertise to small and medium

26:34.340 --> 26:39.340
businesses the idea of getting your company account or even your account banned on Twitter

26:39.340 --> 26:47.220
or Facebook would be it's just not acceptable I mean it it is it is the most cost efficient

26:47.220 --> 26:51.140
way to reach out to these folks all right well since we've already taken the show off

26:51.140 --> 26:58.340
the rails completely I'm gonna go even deeper I've started a conversation that is really

26:58.340 --> 27:04.660
already exploding we're redoing everything online for Jupiter broadcasting us it's a

27:04.660 --> 27:09.060
massive project I gotta have the community's help and that conversation kicked off in office

27:09.060 --> 27:13.720
hours episode three office hours dot hair go there even if you just go there for the

27:13.720 --> 27:19.420
links it's office how office hours dot hair slash three new website energy is the podcast

27:19.420 --> 27:26.500
episode title we sat down with Alex Brent West myself just kind of outline some of the

27:26.500 --> 27:30.620
ideas we have and then we put up a GitHub repo where we can start collecting ideas and

27:30.620 --> 27:34.580
it's just it's huge already and so I'd like to get the coder audience involved that seems

27:34.580 --> 27:38.340
like an obvious step next and so I wanted to let everybody know I brought and bringing

27:38.340 --> 27:42.780
you in behind the curtain for a moment that's happening right now it's a summer project

27:42.780 --> 27:48.180
our hosting provider let us know we have until the end of summer to get the F off the platform

27:48.180 --> 27:52.700
so it's something we have a deadline we're serious about and we're kind of taking in

27:52.700 --> 27:57.340
ideas and we've already gotten some ideas we hadn't even considered before so office

27:57.340 --> 28:02.380
hours dot here to check that out I am thinking things are about to get a little bit more

28:02.380 --> 28:08.380
sketch Intel CEO Pat Gluster anticipates at the end of the chip shortages won't be until

28:08.380 --> 28:15.380
2024 in fact he was originally saying 2023 but now it looks like things are even worse

28:15.380 --> 28:21.260
I got a just a brief clip of him talking to Bloomberg about this issue overall though

28:21.260 --> 28:27.660
the big story is around building up the semiconductor capacity and we had felt like 23 we start

28:27.660 --> 28:33.020
to see that equilibrium now in no small part because of some of the equipment shortages

28:33.020 --> 28:37.300
the equipment that goes into the fabs that we're building we're seeing those lead times

28:37.300 --> 28:42.140
push out substantially and as a result we expect the overall semiconductor shortage

28:42.140 --> 28:50.180
to not be resolved until 2024 now as some of those capacities come online yeah and Apple

28:50.180 --> 28:55.260
in their earnings call a couple of days ago said they expect an eight billion dollar reduction

28:55.260 --> 29:00.720
in sales due to in large part the COVID-19 lockdowns in China that will reduce supply

29:00.720 --> 29:08.260
chain and Tim Cook said they're considering spinning up more supply chain or more manufacturing

29:08.260 --> 29:11.780
but the supply chain issue would still remain an issue so even if they bring manufacturing

29:11.780 --> 29:17.180
over to India he said they still can't get the bits they need to actually build the devices

29:17.180 --> 29:22.140
eight billion dollars by the way is like an entire business right it is all of like the

29:22.140 --> 29:28.580
iPad sales for Apple well yeah I guess but it's a big chunk of change it's a lot of money

29:28.580 --> 29:34.460
and here's what's even scarier is Intel didn't meet their expectations that's not good so

29:34.460 --> 29:39.180
Intel stock is down but it's not too bad it's bounced back a little bit but the CEO in there

29:39.180 --> 29:43.500
in that full clip that I'll have linked in the show notes part of what he says is gonna

29:43.500 --> 29:49.020
make things work out and everything's gonna be rosy and we don't need to worry is that

29:49.020 --> 29:55.800
he says they're expecting a large commercial purchase in the fall for like refreshing machines

29:55.800 --> 30:00.340
at businesses now that people are coming back to work and he expects a whole bunch of business

30:00.340 --> 30:04.800
machines to be replaced and so he thinks that's gonna boost their sales a whole bunch may

30:04.800 --> 30:10.900
happen but if it doesn't happen it looks like Intel could be set for some serious losses

30:10.900 --> 30:14.620
I'm gonna avoid the political stuff because I think we've done enough of that here but

30:14.620 --> 30:19.100
like it would be great if maybe things weren't built in one specific place right just saying

30:19.100 --> 30:23.980
yeah but that that's that is what it is now right so that that's that ship sailed right

30:23.980 --> 30:31.380
that happened in the 80s or late 80s really nice I you know it if I was buying a laptop

30:31.380 --> 30:44.420
right now and my choices were Intel AMD one of the new AMD is right or Apple I would probably

30:44.420 --> 30:49.540
Intel would be my last choice I guess is how I should put it they're frankly not that competitive

30:49.540 --> 30:52.900
but that's why I think they think this what the CEO says in that interview like the commercial

30:52.900 --> 30:58.380
market now is their bread and butter the business machines people that I have work desktops

30:58.380 --> 31:04.220
run Windows I can see that Dell effectively Dell yeah your Dell's in your HP's right and

31:04.220 --> 31:09.100
then you have gamers are probably buying rise in systems or some of the high-end Intel systems

31:09.100 --> 31:12.500
but they're just not a huge percentage of their purchases and now you have Apple one

31:12.500 --> 31:16.340
of the largest PC sellers is no longer using their chips and so they're focusing on commercial

31:16.340 --> 31:21.200
well and the other news we don't have the notice is that Apple's Mac sales have skyrocketed

31:21.200 --> 31:25.300
the reason Apple's reporting a shortfall is because they can't make enough of them in

31:25.300 --> 31:29.900
fact I think they were the only PC manufacturer to show significant growth in the last quarter

31:29.900 --> 31:35.340
yeah it's those M1 machines but it's not just Intel and Apple it's gonna be the whole industry

31:35.340 --> 31:40.940
and you know at first we were back in 2021 we were told you know it'd be better it'd

31:40.940 --> 31:45.860
be better mid 2022 then we got to 2022 or so well it looks like it's gonna be 2023 now

31:45.860 --> 31:49.660
we're not even to mid 2022 and they say well now it's gonna be 2024 both Apple and Intel

31:49.660 --> 31:56.740
are saying this isn't gonna be better until 2024 and I wonder if there is opportunity

31:56.740 --> 32:03.840
for developers in the midst of this chaos and I this could be way off but what if we

32:03.840 --> 32:11.820
saw a bit of a kind of Cuban car moment happen with our technology where because we cannot

32:11.820 --> 32:18.380
get our hands on the new stuff in this case it's supply chain issues but for the Cubans

32:18.380 --> 32:23.540
you know it was an embargo and so they couldn't import new cars and so they had no choice

32:23.540 --> 32:27.940
but to develop a car culture and repair them and keep them running and now they have some

32:27.940 --> 32:32.000
of the most beautiful classic cars in the world and they're like a specialty item that

32:32.000 --> 32:37.460
that rich people import and I have an article about this that talks about how once that

32:37.460 --> 32:44.540
US embargo was created and the banning of American cars and parts was in place Cuba

32:44.540 --> 32:51.020
just essentially did a huge DIY repair program what if we saw something like that happen

32:51.020 --> 32:55.220
again maybe not like full-fledged it's only gonna be for a few years but what if what

32:55.220 --> 32:59.380
if like those kiosks in the mall start coming back that offer screen repair and battery

32:59.380 --> 33:04.660
replacement and yeah it's not as easy but at least they can do it and you know maybe

33:04.660 --> 33:09.260
maybe we start seeing more of that and people reuse stuff instead of get rid of it is that

33:09.260 --> 33:14.280
an impossibility yeah I mean I think that's possible I don't think it's gonna be as widespread

33:14.280 --> 33:19.940
as you'd like I mean the dirty little secret here is for most business users you know the

33:19.940 --> 33:25.100
current processors are just fine yeah I mean we we have a story that I don't think we're

33:25.100 --> 33:29.220
gonna dive into deeply this week but we'll do it next week about it's from Hacker News

33:29.220 --> 33:33.940
why why are all these terminal development companies going to the cloud to the web and

33:33.940 --> 33:40.200
the answer is well because the world has changed having a honking workstation is not that important

33:40.200 --> 33:46.860
for most business users in fact most things are now over the network so I mean we mentioned

33:46.860 --> 33:55.500
warp terminal the forgot his name Zach Zachary something but he's a formal Google Drive engineer

33:55.500 --> 33:59.660
he's a he had a fancy title but you know his whole thing is he basically wants to take

33:59.660 --> 34:07.440
the Google Docs experience to the terminal and that's I don't know I mean I'm currently

34:07.440 --> 34:11.620
hiring something we're gonna talk about a little bit that I would prefer to hire on

34:11.620 --> 34:17.460
site but that seems almost impossible though my point is it makes less and less sense to

34:17.460 --> 34:22.600
spend a lot of money on individual folks as computers than it does to spend on honking

34:22.600 --> 34:27.440
frankly server equipment or cloud services that can synchronize our work between everybody

34:27.440 --> 34:32.520
totally I could see cloud workstations become even more popular in this supply chain crunch

34:32.520 --> 34:37.940
and what a great time to also save cost yeah and then also that really works a lot better

34:37.940 --> 34:41.360
for work at home too because they can just open up that remote cloud terminal using a

34:41.360 --> 34:48.580
client software at home and they have the same experience in security and for for InfoSec

34:48.580 --> 34:52.740
if the person leaves the company or whatever no shows for three days you just disable their

34:52.740 --> 34:57.140
access that's it they have nothing I know we have some listeners that are using cloud

34:57.140 --> 35:00.760
desktops and they've been using them for a little bit so I'd love to know what your experience

35:00.760 --> 35:05.560
has been and if you see this market growing coder dot show slash contact or send us in

35:05.560 --> 35:10.280
a podcasting 2.0 boost and let us know what your experience has been and where you think

35:10.280 --> 35:19.960
it's going lino.com slash coder go there to get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account

35:19.960 --> 35:25.240
and you go there to support this here show Linode is fast reliable fantastic cloud hosting

35:25.240 --> 35:28.640
you've got to go try it for your next project it's what I've used for the last couple of

35:28.640 --> 35:33.560
years now and Linode has been rolling out MVME storage so the rigs are super fast they

35:33.560 --> 35:38.320
have 11 data centers around the world and they're always optimizing for performance

35:38.320 --> 35:43.660
and they have 30 to 50 percent lower prices than the big hyperscalers that want to lock

35:43.660 --> 35:49.060
you into their esoteric platforms and if you're gonna be at KubeCon EU say hi to Linode they

35:49.060 --> 35:55.460
got a booth there May 16th through the 20th in Spain man am I jealous of that if you're

35:55.460 --> 35:59.600
a performance hound you're gonna love Linode if you've never set up a server before you're

35:59.600 --> 36:04.920
gonna be fine at Linode and if you've been racking and stacking boxes for 20 years you're

36:04.920 --> 36:10.480
gonna love how much easier Linode just made your job they have great documentation their

36:10.480 --> 36:15.740
API is clean and simple and the reality is there's a ton of tooling already built for

36:15.740 --> 36:22.640
you to take advantage of libraries command line tools apps it's great Linode's been doing

36:22.640 --> 36:27.980
this for nearly 19 years so they've built a passionate community and a dedicated following

36:27.980 --> 36:35.380
some of your absolute favorite projects apps media companies the whole range they run on

36:35.380 --> 36:40.820
Linode Linode turns out is the secret sauce behind a ton of our favorite online companies

36:40.820 --> 36:44.320
not all of them talk about it all the time because you know it's part of their secret

36:44.320 --> 36:50.480
we get it but we know oh we know and often you'll find people proudly talking about it

36:50.480 --> 36:55.040
because when you've been a Linode customer you generally have great things to say and

36:55.040 --> 36:59.800
one of the things I hear from coder listeners all the time is that nobody beats Linode support

36:59.800 --> 37:07.000
so when you got great pricing great performance great support and it's a way to support independent

37:07.000 --> 37:11.920
productions like this here podcast well that's a pretty good combination so go try it for

37:11.920 --> 37:17.920
real go learn something go build something go try something and get that $100 Linode.com

37:17.920 --> 37:24.080
slash coder stay a while and listen I've been waiting to hear a bit of a story from you

37:24.080 --> 37:29.960
I I have a sense that you had a comedy of errors occur oh yes so we'll do this quick

37:29.960 --> 37:34.960
because we're at the end of the show so we had a partnership uh or have I'm not gonna

37:34.960 --> 37:41.120
exactly name names because I didn't get permission I got an email abruptly telling me that you

37:41.120 --> 37:44.960
know basically go pound sound we were not interested in being in business with you this

37:44.960 --> 37:49.200
was an Alice partnership oh lovely lovely if you're a longtime listener of the show

37:49.200 --> 37:54.360
you can imagine how I would respond to that kind of thing not not well not well and you

37:54.360 --> 37:58.800
know poor form on my part too it turned out that what had happened is that there was another

37:58.800 --> 38:05.280
dude named Michael that they were in a partnership with no and the the yes the person had a medical

38:05.280 --> 38:12.220
issue that I was dealing with and he had to be on leave for a week so his interim got

38:12.220 --> 38:19.320
confused and very awkwardly sent a check to the other company who the gentleman running

38:19.320 --> 38:25.240
that company's name was Mike and fired us of course it was it wasn't they weren't a

38:25.240 --> 38:31.020
client it wasn't a firing but it was like a dissolving our our relationship so this

38:31.020 --> 38:35.800
guy comes back and we had done nothing that we had agreed to do because obviously you

38:35.800 --> 38:40.600
know I thought whatever happened happened and there was this very I can only describe

38:40.600 --> 38:47.880
this this zoom call as the most cringe core thing I've ever had where basically like well

38:47.880 --> 38:52.760
you freaked out what's going on I'm like well you know you guys you you didn't keep your

38:52.760 --> 38:57.920
obligations and then you just ghosted us and then you came back and said and it just ended

38:57.920 --> 39:04.400
up the two of them I thought wait huh they muted there was a misunderstanding he had

39:04.400 --> 39:10.160
the wrong email there's another Michael at something yeah that is literally what happened

39:10.160 --> 39:15.120
it's common there's a lot of Chris's out there too and it's made me think like we really

39:15.120 --> 39:20.400
should have come up with some kind of ID verify in email yeah like maybe not mandatory but

39:20.400 --> 39:24.040
really common practice would have been great well and I just want to say the email I got

39:24.040 --> 39:30.840
was was was like hard it wasn't a hey man sorry things it was a frankly go-pound-sand

39:30.840 --> 39:35.700
email somebody was surprised they just got a big bill and they were angry right and which

39:35.700 --> 39:38.720
is weird because we didn't build them anything because we were partnering with them and doing

39:38.720 --> 39:45.760
a rev share so I was kind of like what and then of course the natural response to so

39:45.760 --> 39:49.920
scummy MBA types well unless I skim this mean but MBA types when they send you a mean email

39:49.920 --> 39:53.960
will never answer your calls again they want it all documented but I tried like the next

39:53.960 --> 39:58.460
morning because the email came in like midnight I'm like you know what I've been there I've

39:58.460 --> 40:03.060
sent the bad email I've sent the bad slack message maybe somebody's you know frankly

40:03.060 --> 40:09.080
in their cups let's just take a breath we'll call in the morning oh I couldn't even like

40:09.080 --> 40:12.820
I was getting straight like you can tell when your numbers blocked because it just rings

40:12.820 --> 40:19.000
out and you always get the voicemail right and yeah it was it still continues to be awkward

40:19.000 --> 40:23.320
so we should write it back and like hey go learn about GPG keys let's get this no I'm

40:23.320 --> 40:27.800
kidding of course that's not gonna work I sent them Alice stickers actually because

40:27.800 --> 40:35.960
I'm a dick tailscale.com slash coder go there to get a free personal account for up to 20

40:35.960 --> 40:41.880
devices and of course you're supporting the show tailscale is a zero config VPN you installed

40:41.880 --> 40:46.400
on any machine or device in minutes it'll take care of the firewall rules and I gotta

40:46.400 --> 40:53.920
say it also manages that dreaded carrier double net some of us end up with hand on heart last

40:53.920 --> 40:59.920
night before bedtime this was for me I'm an old man is about 9 30 p.m. and I realized

40:59.920 --> 41:05.600
that I had just figured out how to fix something on one of the devices in the studio like it

41:05.600 --> 41:11.760
just came to me and I was like oh god it's so obvious and you know the beautiful thing

41:11.760 --> 41:19.040
is is on my iPad I have tailscale and I have the Termulus app and I have my tailscale IPS

41:19.040 --> 41:25.800
for my different hosts already saved in there so I fired my iPad in you know half a second

41:25.800 --> 41:32.760
and I'm connected even quicker to this host that's here at the studio and I'm parked out

41:32.760 --> 41:39.000
in the woods at the foot of the Cascade Mountains on Verizon or AT&T or you know I don't know

41:39.000 --> 41:43.520
brand I don't know which network I was on because I'm on this mobile setup I have but

41:43.520 --> 41:50.560
either way I am natted up the wazoo and tailscale just works instantly you can quickly and easily

41:50.560 --> 41:56.040
create a secure flat network between you your servers your computers your devices this is

41:56.040 --> 42:00.160
a way I've brought my different VPS systems together on their same network and I can actually

42:00.160 --> 42:05.600
connect them to my systems that I have here at the studio there may be running in a VM

42:05.600 --> 42:09.720
it's also how I keep connected to my family's computers and provide support I have a run

42:09.720 --> 42:15.240
on everything from Raspberry Pi to iPads huge arch x86 boxes openSUSE and machines I mean

42:15.240 --> 42:20.920
you name it and the devices they connect through your existing identity provider and there's

42:20.920 --> 42:26.000
a lot of consumer options but you can easily also use a business option and work with multi-factor

42:26.000 --> 42:31.560
authentication de-authorized devices as you need and all of this is protected with WireGuard's

42:31.560 --> 42:36.640
noise protocol I knew WireGuard was going to change the game but tailscale has taken

42:36.640 --> 42:40.920
this to the next level and they've just made a solution here that's changed the way I work

42:40.920 --> 42:45.120
forever you got to try it for yourself and you can try it for free for up to 20 machines

42:45.120 --> 42:52.080
and you go to tailscale.com slash coder free for up to 20 devices and you support the show

42:52.080 --> 43:02.920
tailscale.com slash coder this is a weird awkward situation a longtime free app used

43:02.920 --> 43:08.960
by many in our community is looking to go subscription telegram is adding a premium

43:08.960 --> 43:14.080
subscription according to current betas and we don't know the price yet because that information

43:14.080 --> 43:19.760
is not in the beta builds but we do know it looks like as a perk you're going to get very

43:19.760 --> 43:26.300
special stickers and you're going to get a special emoticon customizer and probably other

43:26.300 --> 43:34.240
things of which we do not know yet but here we are in 2022 and another app that's been

43:34.240 --> 43:40.440
essentially supercharged by being free I got to imagine it's expensive because I've uploaded

43:40.440 --> 43:44.960
like 400 megabyte video files to telegram and they take them right I mean the file storage

43:44.960 --> 43:51.480
alone just based on having 2,000 users on our matrix server I can tell you it's astronomical

43:51.480 --> 43:57.240
if they have you know millions and millions but here we are I just feels like another

43:57.240 --> 44:02.840
subscription are you serious like I love telegram and I use the crap out of it but oh my god

44:02.840 --> 44:08.400
dude another subscription I'm gonna die I want to like cut back and like what I subscribe

44:08.400 --> 44:14.040
to is like really considered stuff that really makes a difference stuff that makes a difference

44:14.040 --> 44:21.040
in my life or or whoever I'm supporting and I just cannot get behind like arbitrary subscriptions

44:21.040 --> 44:27.480
for all of this stuff what else can we do I don't know but there it is telegrams going

44:27.480 --> 44:32.520
premium you don't care you're not a telegram user anymore are you no I don't use telegram

44:32.520 --> 44:38.000
anymore that's how I feel that's how I feel because I know I'm gonna get it I'm gonna

44:38.000 --> 44:42.960
be getting upselled 30 times a day eventually that's how it all it always goes this way

44:42.960 --> 44:47.560
you know it always comes back to you how do we fund software development I swear to god

44:47.560 --> 44:51.360
if they would just let me throw them a few sats you know once a day or something I'd

44:51.360 --> 44:55.380
be happy all right just a little follow-up before we get to your hiring news we talked

44:55.380 --> 45:00.600
about this last week Apple has now shared a new developer update clarifying its App

45:00.600 --> 45:04.580
Store improvement policies it's extending the amount of time it's giving developers

45:04.580 --> 45:09.820
to update their apps that have been updated in two years from 30 days to 90 days but here's

45:09.820 --> 45:15.880
the part that I do not like Apple says that apps that have not been updated within the

45:15.880 --> 45:23.600
past three years and which do not meet a minimum threshold for downloads i.e. extremely few

45:23.600 --> 45:28.800
or limited downloads in a rolling 12-month period are still subject to the policy and

45:28.800 --> 45:34.340
those developers will get notices via email so I guess an apps value is determined by

45:34.340 --> 45:39.400
its downloads you know I could see where they were coming from but there's there was a good

45:39.400 --> 45:45.080
conversation on the iOS dev I think or underscore dev there's two of them on reddit were game

45:45.080 --> 45:48.960
developers were kind of bitching like you guys don't understand we write the game we

45:48.960 --> 45:55.880
update unity and it basically runs for years we and you know we their sales are so meager

45:55.880 --> 46:00.800
for the for most of them right it's a video game right they sell the you how many times

46:00.800 --> 46:05.720
everybody is about to be forced to buy Sonic one two and three again because Sega's releasing

46:05.720 --> 46:11.880
them it's the same it's the same and I'm gonna be one of you so I don't this is not me dunking

46:11.880 --> 46:17.440
but it's like this is a stupid policy if if the app works if the game works Apple should

46:17.440 --> 46:22.360
just leave it on the store here's my angle like you can't have a both ways Apple if you

46:22.360 --> 46:27.200
don't want a sideloading and I got a small team and you know we need an app for doing

46:27.200 --> 46:31.380
business or maybe we're maybe when we're out in the field doing live stuff we have like

46:31.380 --> 46:38.140
a Jupiter broadcasting team app and it's got 10 users so you know okay well should I come

46:38.140 --> 46:41.440
up with some way to sideload that so we all enroll in some sort of developer program should

46:41.440 --> 46:46.800
I should I force all of the volunteers of JB to to get enrolled in some sort of device

46:46.800 --> 46:52.040
management system like what is my solution here other than to distribute in the App Store

46:52.040 --> 46:56.160
and now because I've built something and I've utilized the only distribution mechanism they'll

46:56.160 --> 47:00.800
let me use in any real meaning way meaningful way because I've utilized the only system

47:00.800 --> 47:06.240
they've made available I'm now being punished for it like there are actually apps I mean

47:06.240 --> 47:09.920
they probably should be pulled but there are apps that we've distributed like that just

47:09.920 --> 47:14.560
want you know some quick app that we've created as a tool or a concept that we put in the

47:14.560 --> 47:20.040
App Store we only internally you know had you know we told a few people about it wanted

47:20.040 --> 47:24.620
to be able to tell randos so we wanted it public and you know that probably would not

47:24.620 --> 47:31.200
qualify it's probably been cold let the people sideload Apple make it a pain in the ass never

47:31.200 --> 47:37.380
gonna happen all right well you know what is happening the mad botters hiring that's

47:37.380 --> 47:43.520
happening got several positions yes we are we have three positions yes typescript developer

47:43.520 --> 47:48.320
lot of ionic lot of angular very mobile focus but you know desktop too right because the

47:48.320 --> 47:53.760
world is hard we have three positions a more senior Python developer a junior Python developer

47:53.760 --> 47:58.360
and this typescript position all of them are preferred on site and plant city which I think

47:58.360 --> 48:03.360
is going to be the topic of next week's show Chris what do you think I'm down okay but

48:03.360 --> 48:08.960
there are remote options available with the caveats that we only have what do they call

48:08.960 --> 48:13.280
them employment charters or that's not the right word but in the US you have to have

48:13.280 --> 48:18.360
a license but you have to be registered as an employer in each state so right now we're

48:18.360 --> 48:22.480
only registered in New Jersey and Florida ah so they have to be a contractor if they're

48:22.480 --> 48:26.520
remote if they're not in either of those states they would have we would have to work something

48:26.520 --> 48:31.320
else out yeah yeah yeah or we could open like if it's Georgia it's different because you're

48:31.320 --> 48:36.400
right here but yeah I want a job but I just want to get paid under the table for it is

48:36.400 --> 48:43.160
that doable yeah it's very hard to do that anymore trust me I mean whoa no no so two

48:43.160 --> 48:49.680
Python roles we're very heavy on fast API and flask a lot of ginger to lot of ginger

48:49.680 --> 48:54.880
too and the types of stuff is almost all angular all right we'll have a link to that in the

48:54.880 --> 49:01.320
notes at coder dot show slash 464 oh and a fancy new domain name because I was jealous

49:01.320 --> 49:06.680
of your office hours are you ready yeah are you ready totally ready forget the mad potter

49:06.680 --> 49:17.720
dot com what is that crap whoo so long t mb dot i n c t mb dot inc and inc in the ink

49:17.720 --> 49:21.680
that's that is that's legit you know it's legit that's how you do it dot hairs over

49:21.680 --> 49:26.520
in clown town but that's that's getting to work I tried to buy the dot hair and it's

49:26.520 --> 49:30.920
weird it showed me a giffy of you yeah like flipping your luxurious locks that wouldn't

49:30.920 --> 49:35.520
let me do it I got to be careful also hits the microphone makes a big noise I want to

49:35.520 --> 49:39.880
say a special thank you to our members over at coder qa.co that's a way to give value

49:39.880 --> 49:45.400
back to the show on an ongoing basis and it really makes a difference it lets us be picky

49:45.400 --> 49:50.180
you know I don't talk about it because it sounds like we're bragging but we get lots

49:50.180 --> 49:56.200
of offers every single week for all kinds of weird sponsorships or limited run things

49:56.200 --> 50:03.360
or fly-by-night operations or another really common one is people want to pay us to have

50:03.360 --> 50:09.320
like their marketing person on the show or something like that and our members give us

50:09.320 --> 50:13.720
the flexibility to say no to all that kind of stuff and as a thank you you get an ad

50:13.720 --> 50:18.160
free version of the show you get the coderly report and you can become a member at coder
