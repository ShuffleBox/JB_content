8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
My name is Chris, and joining us every single week fighting off the swamp monsters and keeping it all together, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hello, Mike.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hello, sir.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I congratulate you on surviving the holiday week, never easy on the small businessmen or lady out there.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So congratulations for getting through and chucking on.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Even if you yourself don't particularly celebrate a holiday that others are observing,

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
there's still a disruption to just the flow of business and routine, which has knock-on effects that then make the return week not as effective.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
For me, it was people just kind of around Wednesday stopped responding to emails.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Took me a little bit.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I was like, oh, I got to wait till Monday now before I get this taken care of.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thanksgiving is pretty much the worst holiday for small business because nobody's working that beginning of that week really.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Everybody's thinking about their plans, whatever.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Everybody takes the Friday off.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And it's like, well, we got nothing done.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And then to compound it, Christmas, like the week before and after Christmas is a total disaster, too.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's both good and bad because then you have quiet time if you utilize it right.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But what happens to me is I'm so heads down.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm go, go, go, go.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And then all of a sudden I get there and there's just this lack of preparedness for this downtime.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And now I just have this downtime that I didn't plan for and I don't know how to use it effectively.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Does this ever happen to you?

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All the time. All the time.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Were you sneaking away to get tea while I was?

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I think I caught you. And it's the worst because I'm sitting there.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I finally get some time off. I finally get some downtime.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But instead, I'm kicking myself for not properly utilizing like for me, I could be traveling or, you know, in the RV or I could be working on a home project or something for a future episode.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And I usually end up watching a movie, but I actually ended up having a really good Thanksgiving.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The smoked turkey went off really well.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The prototype and then the beta turkey were extremely necessary.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And production turkey turned out fabulous.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I did not smoke any laptops, so I take the win.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, let's get into some feedback as we do here on the show.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And we're going to take a moment to talk about keyboards.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Thanks to not Johnny says, I know you guys have talked about DOS keyboard in the past.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I wonder if you have seen DOS Keyboard Q. Have you seen this, Mike?

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I did today.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm going to play a little bit of their promo video, which has perfectly good audio to explain what this thing is.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But think of it as a mechanical keyboard with LED light up keys that are programmable for your notifications.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We'd like to introduce our all new DOS Keyboard 5Q.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's going to revolutionize the way you gather and track the information you care about by transforming your keyboard into a dashboard keyboard.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And you will never want an input only keyboard after this.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Are you an overtabber?

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Do your web browsers look like this?

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Which one of these is my inbox?

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
How many notifications do you get in a day?

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How long before you just start ignoring them all?

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The things you want to know can easily get drowned out by all the other stuff out there.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And it's made information gathering kind of a pain.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But fear not overtabbers and alert snoozers. DOS Keyboard is developing a new kind of keyboard that's going to change all of that.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
DOS Keyboard 5Q is an RGB LED keyboard that's software driven and allows you to customize the color and pattern of every key based on the information that you actually want to follow.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Instead of relying on snoozable momentary alerts from different devices, DOS Keyboard 5Q allows you to ambiently track subtle changes to data over time without actively seeking updates or constantly receiving new alerts.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:41,000
All right, you get an RGB selector, you can select a color and a notification pulse for a region of keys or a single key for a type of notification.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So this kind of feels like that couple weeks I tried Vim.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It seems like it would be a great idea, you can customize it, but you end up just working on your setup and not doing your actual work.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Talk about a total toy for that, right? You're so right.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, yeah. I mean, it is tempting, honestly, when I saw you put it in the dock, I was like, maybe I could use the new keyboard.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Right. But but I don't know. What are your thoughts?

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
First of all, when they say a software app that you use to program the buttons, I first I worry that's going to be crap.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And then I also think it's probably not going to work on Linux. But beyond that, I don't think this is the direction for me.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And I was once the the guy that wanted that OLED keyboard where all of the buttons were a programmable OLED screen.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I was the guy who wanted to get the Logitech keyboard that has an LCD screen built into it with a Linux box that like connects to your machine and shows you system stats or plays video on a keyboard screen.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I mean, I have been down this road and now I'm kind of on the other end of it.

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I have to be honest, what I like now are elegant, simple mechanical keyboards that are really nice to type on, really well built and depending on my requirements, at least at home, small.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And it's actually kind of hard to find a small mechanical keyboard that still has decent arrow keys and function keys.

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
A lot of them are like these 60 percent keyboards and they drop the arrow keys and I'm not having that.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm not having no arrow keys. So I landed about a year and a half ago on the Vortex Race 3 mechanical keyboard.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll have a link in the show notes about one hundred and forty dollars. And God bless it, Mike.

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's one of the best little keyboards I've ever used in my 35 years of using keyboards.

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And I'm saying like I love like the IBM PS2 keyboards. These are this is a real nice to type on keyboard.

79
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You can get it with whichever kind of key you prefer and it's super compact.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It has 83 keys. So it's got the arrow keys.

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It also comes with a couple of optional keys that you can pop off and replace.

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So it has some color, which is nice.

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So like the delete keys and escape key are red. Alt can be blue.

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Shift is green. Just kind of helps catch the eye. But it also just comes with all one color if that's what you prefer.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's also a metal casing, which is a nice CNC aluminum that feels really high quality.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And then it has what it calls layers. Now, get your brain noggin out for this one, Mike.

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:31,000
These programmable layers allow you to in the keyboard firmware map like Mac mode, PC mode, all these different options that you can just by a key combo activate.

88
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And then it has an LED light that kind of lights up to indicate which layer it's on.

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So the code mechanical keyboard that I used, which I think is made by WASD, also has this concept.

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And this is for like guys like us who bounce between OS is all the time. Really nice.

91
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And the vortex is nice and small. It's it's been super reliable.

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's not wireless, which would be kind of nice. But I also appreciate not having to fuss with with batteries ever.

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So I'm going to put your code keyboard in the in the show notes, too. There are things I would prefer.

94
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I would like a wireless option and I would like it to light up.

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And vortex does make a version of the race three that lights up. But the key caps aren't transparent.

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
They're not see through. So it's just under key lighting. Not really quite what I'm looking for.

97
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's it's I'm surprised it took me this long to find a good keyboard in 2020 that worked for my situation that wasn't massive.

98
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That feels really good to type on. You know, it's one of those keyboards where I even a year, year and a half into it,

99
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I sit down and I still really enjoy typing on it. And I feel like I can type really fast.

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Is this full sized? I'm looking at your vortex.

101
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I want to say it's like a 70 percent keyboard or a 65 percent keyboard.

102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And that's one of the things I really appreciate about it is in a small space.

103
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't have a lot of room at home. It doesn't take up and it fits in a backpack.

104
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And I've actually just brought it with me in the backpack before and it totally does fine.

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't worry, I've got my own keyboard. So like have gone will travel have keyboard.

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I actually what I did for a little while is I made a virtualization bag where I had a portable HDMI 1080p monitor.

107
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I had this keyboard and I had a ThinkPad ThinkStation Thunderbolt 3 dock with an Nvidia graphics card in it.

108
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And what was so great about this is you take that one Thunderbolt 3 cable and you pass it through to the VM software for hardware pass through.

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And everything on the dock now shows up to the virtual OS.

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So the physical USB ports, the Nvidia graphics card, the SD card slot reader, all of it shows up to the virtualized guest and it gets direct access to it.

111
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And so I would hook up a monitor and a keyboard and a mouse and I would use a virtual machine through a Thunderbolt 3 dock connected back to my laptop.

112
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And that was some serious virtualization. That's nuts.

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't think you I think my honestly, if you sat down at it, you would have no idea it was a VM.

114
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You could work on it all day long and really have no idea because it had dedicated GPU and you were using a dedicated monitor and keyboard and mouse.

115
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm a little jealous. I know. Sometime you come out here to the Pacific Northwest.

116
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You'll kick out for a bit. Yes. I mean, maybe even go down the block at one point.

117
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's coming soon. Maybe. Maybe one day.

118
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If you have if you have some keyboard solutions, honestly, something that's wireless, that lights up with keys that you can actually see when the lights are on and is about like the Vortex 3 that I have linked to the show notes or any other kind of keyboards that have kind of changed your game.

119
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Do let us know. Kota show slash contact.

120
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I would like to I would like to geek out on that with you because I'm really, really happy with mine.

121
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But if I can tell, there is some room for improvement for some of the basics.

122
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
There's always room for tooling improvement. That's true.

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's exactly I think that's a long running theme of this show.

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Listener Mike. So not this Mike wrote in.

125
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He says, guys, what is the world come to when portability is one of your primary reasons for buying a new machine?

126
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What kind of companies are paying developers to spend so many hours in meetings or on airplanes?

127
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Granted, some devs like computers that are easy to tow back and forth.

128
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But then again, I ask you, what has this world come to?

129
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I think that's kind of directed at you, Mr. Laptop purchaser.

130
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Can't imagine why. Yeah.

131
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I mean, I don't know. I've always found laptops to be a bad value, but a necessary evil.

132
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Granted, you know, 20, 20. Sure.

133
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But that aside, I don't know. You have to give presentations. You have to go on site, right?

134
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So when I got this email when I was reading this this morning because I batch him before the show.

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I was thinking, you know what else it is, Mike, that we don't really implicitly state often is both you and I are also the boss.

136
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We're also the CEO. Yeah. We're landing sales.

137
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So we're the lead sales engineer, whatever you want to call it.

138
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's not just the pure development. There's also the team management aspect, the sales management aspect, the company management aspect.

139
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And that does demand some portability.

140
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah. I mean, I spent a lot of time in Google Docs, right, doing presentations, whatever.

141
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No wonder you're not feeling so good. If you were going to clone PowerPoint, you could have put someone other than the intern on it.

142
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So I'm going to say. Oh, man. Yeah. Yeah. All right.

143
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So Josh writes in with a quickie. I just listened to three eighty nine and I wanted to make a comment about the M1 and Rosetta 2.

144
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Part of me feels that unless Apple puts an end of life on Rosetta 2, developers are just going to ignore the new architecture and just build their apps for X86.

145
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It runs good enough, similar to how Proton is being utilized for Windows games on Linux.

146
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And developers are now avoiding porting their games. Just wanted to add my two cents.

147
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Thanks for the entertainment on my way to work, Josh.

148
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Do you think this is going to be an issue at all on the Apple platform?

149
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Apple is going to eventually flip the switch in Xcode or whatever, you know, their tools are, you know, the command line version of Xcode.

150
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And I'm sorry, the Xcode command line tools got this naming and they're going to force you.

151
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There's also going to be a race to, like, make interesting M1 apps.

152
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Sure, Adobe is going to be stubborn, whatever big companies.

153
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But of all the things I would be worried about with the M1, it's not it's not this.

154
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Apple is going to swing the hammer. Completely agree.

155
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I think what you'll see happen is two years after the last Intel Mac ships, they'll shut it down and they'll remove it from the current version of Mac OS at that time, just like they did with the power PC transition.

156
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Two years, I think it was after the last power PC Mac sold that version of Mac OS didn't include Rosetta.

157
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm going to go to Mac OS Little Tyke or whatever the next version is going to be.

158
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
They're just going to say, if you have Intel, you know, whenever they do this, right, they're just that version is not going to work on Intel Macs.

159
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, exactly. And what do you think of this?

160
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You know, you're seeing more and more people now concerned that Apple is really going to create a locked in ecosystem that they'll be able to ratchet down more and more.

161
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What? Apple locking down? Come on.

162
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I actually have a bit of a counter view on it. I'm not as concerned about it, but I wanted to give you a first shot at it.

163
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I mean, yeah, it's proprietary design, isn't it?

164
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Like always, though, the Mac has been a proprietary design. I mean, it does make it more appealing one.

165
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I think that's really the underlying uncomfortableness is that there is a big competitive advantage that they have right now with speed and performance.

166
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And I think it makes people a little uncomfortable because it's going to more people buy it because of that.

167
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And it means more people be locked into an ecosystem that's very expensive, semi-user hostile at times.

168
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And when I say semi-user hostile, I mean in such that and for good and bad, Intel will move the platform forward.

169
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Like Mike answered that question about Rosetta 2 being aged out with absolute confidence.

170
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And that's that's actually, if you think about it, pretty significant.

171
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's kind of important that your developers, developers going into this right now in 2020 when we've only got a handful of M1 Macs, they already know what the game is.

172
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
As Mike just demonstrated, they already know that ultimately they're going to have to port.

173
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And there's it's just it's just the way Apple runs the ship for better or for worse.

174
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I think that sometimes results in leaving some users behind.

175
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
If you look at like my family members and friends who have some older Macs, I feel really bad.

176
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You know, it's hard for them to understand where the lines drawn on what Macs are supported and what isn't supported and what that means.

177
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's not really clear like it is on the Windows platform.

178
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's it's very clear what what Windows is supported and what applications run on what versions of Windows.

179
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But when you're kind of not really familiar with this stuff and say you're buying a used Mac on eBay, which is extremely common for the average consumer who maybe doesn't have Apple money, but they still want the Mac experience.

180
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They get something that's no longer supported and they can't even put the latest OS on it or get the latest apps.

181
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And they just don't understand what's going on. And so that can be somewhat user hostile.

182
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But at the same time, it's how Apple moves the platform forward.

183
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So I sort of don't get all the hand-wringing about the M1, right?

184
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You can't ask them to make a shittier product, right?

185
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You can't ask them to not make it proprietary.

186
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
True. So I don't get it. Like, it does suck to be Dell right now, right?

187
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But I'm my expectation is that the industry is just going to have to catch up.

188
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And Apple's not going to be dominant with this. You were right. They have quite an advantage right now.

189
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But I don't see that, I guess, as a permanent thing.

190
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, and interestingly, there is already people working to get Linux on there.

191
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Linus was asked about it and he said he'd absolutely love to have Linux on an M1 MacBook.

192
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
In fact, he kind of makes them a dig. He says, you know, Apple runs Linux in their cloud, but their laptops don't.

193
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
However, some entrepreneur developers like Hector Martin have been digging into this.

194
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And it seems Apple has left a user controllable option for their secure boot setup that allows the user to override the default mode and essentially boot any OS they want on the ARM Macs.

195
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's massive. And so Hector Martin is actually looking at launching a Patreon.

196
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
He's got some experience in this area.

197
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He's thinking about launching a Patreon to get funding to start working on porting Linux to the M1.

198
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So maybe it'll happen. Maybe it won't be such a lockdown platform.

199
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But I think ultimately what I hope will happen, I said this before the announcement even, is that I hope it will encourage some companies.

200
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
This, I should say, Apple's move here, combined with NVIDIA's purchase of ARM.

201
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Shall we not forget that just recently happened?

202
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I think is going to bode well for RISC-V long term and open platforms like OpenPowerPC, which ultimately will benefit everyone.

203
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's just we needed a couple of things to push it because so far the x86 dominance has been, quote unquote, good enough for so long that no one's been really compelled to solve this problem.

204
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But now with NVIDIA and Apple, we've got two really good reasons to start working on other solutions.

205
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And I think it will just naturally start to happen. It'll just take a little time to get there.

206
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Right. And your GNOME extensions will still crash the whole system. So I had to.

207
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No, it's fair. I've been having problems this morning.

208
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah. I've been having problems this morning.

209
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm feeling I'm honestly feeling like maybe I really am getting close to new machine time.

210
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So why don't we take a moment speaking of that and thank System76.

211
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
System76.com. If you've been thinking about getting a new rig, there's probably never been a better time to get a System76 machine.

212
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's their Merry 15th birthday sale. Now, until January 4th, you can get a great deal when you upgrade.

213
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You save on laptops and desktops. It's their birthday, but you get the good deals.

214
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And this means I've been a System76 customer for 15 years.

215
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That is mind blowing. And they have some of their best machines.

216
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, they do just hands down, too. I mean, the Thalia workstation, which recently just got the Mega, which looks amazing.

217
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But you might have your eye on a laptop and this sale could be the perfect opportunity.

218
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The Galico Pro starts at under a thousand dollars and it has an 11th gen Intel Core i5 or i7 CPU.

219
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But here's the really impressive thing. You're not going to believe it when you see how thin this laptop is.

220
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And it starts at three pounds. That's the base weight, three pounds. But you can get an optional NVIDIA GTX 1650 in that thing.

221
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Up to two terabytes of PCIe 4 NVMe storage. And of course, it's loaded with System76's open firmware.

222
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So you know it's going to be easy to manage. You have some faith and trust in security.

223
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But also it boots super fast. That's what you'll notice on the day to day usage.

224
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And even if you load this thing up with multiple disks, the i7, the optional NVIDIA GTX card, it's still going to be a super light portable laptop with great battery life.

225
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And there's never been a better time with their sale. Also, if you're looking for battery life, check out the Lemur Pro.

226
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That has 14 hours of battery life. It's remote workers bliss.

227
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
If you need to get out of the house from time to time and you need some battery life, the Lemur is the way to go.

228
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Man, that Galago Pro. That is so tempting with that optional NVIDIA card.

229
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Man, that's the one I'd pull the trigger on right now if I were getting a System76 laptop.

230
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Check out the Thaleos too if you want the desktop line.

231
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I mean, they're just gorgeous. They're gorgeous machines.

232
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And you can get a discount because it's their birthday. The Merry 15th birthday sale at System76.com.

233
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And go there when you check out, tell them the Koda radio program sent you.

234
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Say they demand it. I buy a Galago Pro. System76.com and Happy Merry Birthday to you guys over there.

235
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
System76.com and thanks for sponsoring the Koda radio program.

236
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Well, the big hoopla is right now as you and I talk, the speculation is that Slack is going to sale to Salesforce.

237
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Slack is what? What am I trying to say? You know what I'm trying to say. Slack is going to sell.

238
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This seems like a shit deal to tell you the truth. And I'm not happy about it.

239
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No, I hate Salesforce. Having been their customer once, they are a bunch of d-bags.

240
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It looks like it's going to go for a fair amount of money.

241
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It seems like maybe somewhere in the 25, 24, 20 billion range, which is pretty good.

242
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Microsoft rumored to offer 8 billion in 2016 when Slack said no.

243
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's sort of when they said, all right, we're going to start on Teams.

244
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And now here we are and Slack is selling.

245
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And a bit ironic because I don't know if you recall, but they made that Dear Microsoft post where they

246
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
condescendingly welcomed Microsoft to the revolution and said they were glad that they'd help give them a little competition.

247
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And they said, quote, we're sure you're going to come up with a couple of new ideas on your own, too.

248
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And we'll be right there and ready. I forgot about that. That was it's embarrassing.

249
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Well, almost like something I would do. That's like crazy.

250
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's just like, you know, they were feeling like they turned down the sale and Microsoft announced what they were going to do.

251
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And Slack knew the backstory at that point. I guess they were feeling brazen and they were feeling on top of the world.

252
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But the reality is, I don't think they've really managed to leverage the pandemic, for lack of a better term, like Zoom and Teams have.

253
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, I was going to say, you know, because Teams and Zoom just like ate their cupcake, right?

254
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah. Zoom's a problem here, too, right? Zoom's grown to 300 million, 300 million daily active participants, which is ginormous.

255
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And then, of course, Teams is bundled with Office 365 and has 32 million daily active users.

256
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And functional PowerPoint. Yeah. And the new number is 115 million as of last month.

257
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Slack stopped updating their daily active user number last year when they reached 12 million.

258
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So we don't actually know what Slack's active millions are. I'm sure it's more than 12, though.

259
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But 115 is Office 365 and 300 million daily active Zoomers.

260
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And that had to have been a factor for Slack as well.

261
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Why does Salesforce want them just to buy it? Because it's like it just doesn't seem to go with the rest of Salesforce's offerings.

262
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That's funny. That's what the analysis that I saw on CNBC before the show was saying is that it's like, oh, really?

263
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Not really. The funny because one of the guys like, yeah, I have some Salesforce stock and I am not happy about this because this is just going to be a hard merger.

264
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's going to be extremely difficult to integrate these in a way that doesn't does either just doesn't work or just doesn't ruin Slack.

265
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Or it's one of these leave them totally independent. And then it's like, what's the point of dropping 25 bill?

266
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Right. Because how are you going to integrate like their CRM and their data services with Slack?

267
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I mean, I guess you can, but you can already do that now. I don't get it. I don't get it either.

268
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And I'm I got to be honest, man. I'm I'm really disappointed that when the lockdowns hit and the stay at home orders hit,

269
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:50,000
it was Zoom and teams that reap the benefits and and not things like Jitsi or or even Slack, because at least they're an independent small company.

270
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I mean, no shade over to our friends that listen at Microsoft. But I've used teams.

271
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I've used teams. It's no slack. We've all used teams. And, you know, if you're a file centric, if you're a SharePoint, former SharePoint or still SharePointers.

272
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yep. You're a big one driver. It makes a lot of sense if you're in that active directory. Yeah. Yeah. If you're in that ecosystem, it makes a lot of sense.

273
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And it just works. You know, it's one of the things about Microsoft products is individually on their own.

274
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Some of them are OK. Some of them are good. Some of them are not so good, like a lot of their corporate stuff.

275
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:31,000
But it all works together. It's all centrally administered. It's really kind of the whole that makes it an appealing product.

276
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And when Covid hit, they just started handing out teams like crazy for free to anybody that would take it.

277
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,000
This may be a little mean, but I kind of think that Slack wasn't able to leverage it because their video offering their call off.

278
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Have you ever done that? I've used it for like meetings and stuff. It's at least for us.

279
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's super rough. Oh, really? Yeah. And there's no way to like add and like make it a call where external folks can come in.

280
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So we have to have that and Google meet. Yes. Yes. Right. So it's like, I mean, we have Google anyway, but it's one of those obvious features that you would think they would have developed.

281
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But instead they want to have like mixed workspaces. I don't know. I have lots of complaints about Slack.

282
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah. And the mixed works mix workspaces thing requires a paid account for some functionality you can get from free for other stuff or in dedicated apps.

283
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah. And they've struggled to make that really a value. And I have to be honest, I've never really been super comfortable with Slack.

284
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The backstory for JB is Slack became a product at literally the right moment in time where we were having a conversation about needing a way to collaborate on a couple of projects.

285
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And it was one of those we're way behind. We got to get moving. What are we going to do? Oh, hey, there's this thing.

286
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,000
In a few clicks, we now have a free chat environment. And over the years, a lot of great open source alternatives have popped up.

287
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But we had gone all in at that point on Slack and it was a settled deal.

288
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And then as the industry adoption and network effect took off, it just sort of reinforced the choice and made it harder and harder to to move away.

289
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But as I've sort of rebooted and we're doing JB 3.0 now, I got to really question that.

290
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Hey, the cost is outrageous. It's like twelve dollars a month. And the whole idea is bringing as many people in to collaborate.

291
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Right. So screw you. You're going to be paying out the nose. You're going to be paying several hundred dollars a month to use this product.

292
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Give me a break. And the reality is, there's just so many other self-hosted options now that I think with this acquisition, it just sort of seals the deal.

293
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Now it's more of a get it on the schedule and figure it out kind of thing.

294
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And I guess so long to the network effect, which does come up. That's going to be something I've already been thinking about the emails.

295
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm going to have to send saying, hey, look, we're dropping Slack. And so we're going to have to leave your little cross lack thingy.

296
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And it'll be just a little awkward. But I just I can't do it anymore. And if they're part of Salesforce, just give me a break.

297
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
That's what I was going to say. Like, you know, Salesforce isn't going to not try to pull you into the rest of the ecosystem.

298
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Right. But why else buy them? Think I've had it. I've had it. You know, I've just had it with this crap. I've had it with these services.

299
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Yeah. That are one thing for a while. And then they either get sold or they need to.

300
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You know, they need to change how they generate revenue and the deal changes.

301
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm just I've had it with that kind of thing. There does seem to be a theme going through the last however many years.

302
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But you can show of an inability to get like medium sized independent businesses that don't just get crushed or gobbled up by the big guys.

303
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Well, and don't forget the VC kind of thing, too. That's been huge since the show started and just really exploded, which is these VC companies, which I didn't really fully appreciate until I recently had some hands on experience.

304
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:47,000
They're they're really kind of set on a trajectory. When you inject tens of millions of dollars into a company, it fundamentally alters everything.

305
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And it sets the requirements differently. I mean, it just I guess I didn't really understand that fully.

306
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I got it conceptually, but then witnessing the difference was really educating.

307
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And I think that's played a big factor into why we've seen these medium sized companies sort of sort of come up out of nowhere and then either pop or sell or be destroyed.

308
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Like once again, pour it out for sun. Yeah. Or get acquired.

309
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That's often their absolute best case scenario is one of the big five tech companies acquires them.

310
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I know a VC down in the St. Petersburg, Tampa area here, and his first question to folks pitching him now is who are you going to sell to?

311
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah, like that's that is the first question, because the IPO is just such a long shot, right?

312
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's such a long shot. It takes so long. And I just like, you know, Slack was going to want to or Microsoft wanted to buy Slack.

313
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Slack said no. So Microsoft just, you know, I cloned it. Right. Right.

314
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It reminds me of jobs trying to buy Dropbox. And when they said no, they said, well, we're just going to build it ourselves then.

315
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You know what? I Cloud Drive. Yeah. Yeah. Dropbox is a little better. I know.

316
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah, I keep trying to quit Dropbox and it just pulls me right back in. Damn it.

317
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But it is it is it is true that it just I guess it was I almost feel now looking back at it.

318
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
If this this by the way, we're talking about this like it's happened because this show is supposed to come out a day after its news.

319
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So we don't actually know at the time we're recording. But it looks like a pretty sure bet.

320
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's multiple sources. A lot of smoke. It seems like it's a sure bet.

321
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And looking at it now, I feel almost kind of naive for not expecting this.

322
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yeah. How could I not see it coming? Right. Let's move on because it just upsets me so much and it gets me on my open source soapbox and therapy session.

323
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Right. And then everybody has to, you know, hear me get worked up. So let's talk about something good.

324
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Amazon freaking loves rust in like a in like a we're putting money where our mouth is kind of low.

325
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Like I can't sleep, you know, refreshing Russ's Facebook page over and over again sort of way.

326
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Yeah. Awkwardly stocking. AWS has announced its intention to hire more rust developers in the coming months.

327
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:08,000
They've dedicated one of their managers to basically taking this on to just hiring rust engineers. Shane Miller, a senior software engineering manager at AWS, has been tasked with hiring rust engineers.

328
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:20,000
She explained the importance of rust AWS. She says, quote, Rust is a critical component of our long term strategy, and we're investing to deliver rust engineering at Amazon scale.

329
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
That includes developer tools, infrastructure components, interoperability and verification.

330
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:37,000
They currently have one hundred and twenty rust related vacancies, spanning software development, hardware development, support engineering and system security engineering.

331
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And I'll link in the show notes to an article that just talks about a handful of some of the apps at Amazon now that are using rust or large components are written in rust.

332
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Then they went on to say on their own blog. It was Matt Assay on their main blog wrote that.

333
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Let's be clear. We understand that we are net beneficiaries of the exceptional work that others have done to make rust thrive.

334
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,000
AWS didn't start rust or make it the success it is today, but we'd like to contribute to its future success.

335
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We are convinced that investing in the wider rust ecosystem helps our customers and those who may never become our customers.

336
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And that's OK. That's how open source is supposed to work. And then Miller adds, we're not just hiring a couple of folks.

337
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Rust is a critical component of our long term strategy, and we're investing to deliver rust engineering at Amazon scale.

338
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Then they highlight that they're trying to support the rust community in other ways.

339
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And even outside of hiring and that there has been more than five thousand five hundred contributors to us since its inception with an average of three hundred and thirty contributors to each release.

340
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And they end up by saying they're grateful to be part of this welcoming, productive rust community.

341
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Kumbaya Mike. Yes. Yeah. They have some rust love. Crab of people.

342
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Crap. Seriously, they're the rust stations are growing strong. Didn't didn't Apple just do a thing like this, too?

343
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
They were like, we love rust. Yes. And Microsoft as well. 1.0 was out in 2015.

344
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I mean, this is us. This is this is quite the if you got on rust in 2015, there's some seriously significant jobs out there for you at this point, it sounds like.

345
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Honestly, I think it's going to keep going this way.

346
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh, it's also Stack Overflows when they do their Stack Overflow developer survey and they survey survey like sixty five thousand developers.

347
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Rust is the was rated the most love programming language on the list.

348
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So there you go. Yeah. So I don't know. I don't really have much with that.

349
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
No, I think it's interesting that. Yeah. And that is becoming a standard, right?

350
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
We'll have a link to the show notes if you're interested in some of that.

351
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Maybe you can contribute. I don't know. Maybe you can go get a job at Amazon if you do. Let us know.

352
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Feedback on any of these. Coder dot show slash contact. And of course, the links, like I just mentioned, Coder dot show slash three nine zero.

353
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I mentioned last week, but you know, I should have done this at the top of the show.

354
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
We have a Black Friday sale for the Coder QA team and it's two bucks off, which is a great deal.

355
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You just use the coupon code Black Friday. So go to Coder QA dot co. That's Coder QA dot co.

356
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And use the coupon code Black Friday and you get two bucks off.

357
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And with that, you get the warm feeling of supporting the show and keeping us independent.

358
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
A limited ad feed. So that way you get more of what you love and less of what you don't.

359
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And you get the Coderly report, which will be coming out kind of soonish.

360
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That'll be soon. Something we'll put on our radars.

361
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And while I'm talking about Black Friday sales, be sure to check out a Cloud Guru's Black Friday sale.

362

372
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Again, that's Coder.show slash three nine zero.

373
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Well, Mr. Dominic, I've made my decision and I pulled the trigger on the X1.

374
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It is on the way. It'll be in the mail. Dice.

375
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I have literally no idea what I'm going to do. I was I was determined to just run Fedora.

376
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
That's why I bought it. For years now, I've been buying machines preloaded with Ubuntu.

377
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And I thought, well, let's give it a go. For the first time ever, I can buy one preloaded with Fedora.

378
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And that just that that means something to me as a longtime desktop advocate.

379
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But I'm not sure ultimately if I'll keep it on there or not. We'll see. I'm not sure what I'll do.

380
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to do about Windows on there. I'm just everything's on the table right now.

381
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The whole the whole setup. And I've got I'm kind of rethinking my whole desk setup.

382
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That's why the keyboard is also kind of on the table. I think I'm going to think I'm going to get a monitor mount.

383
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm going to get I'm going to get a visa laptop mount that mounts to that monitor stand and I can put the laptop on there.

384
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah, very nice. Yeah. Yeah. And then I think I'm going to get another 1440p screen to connect with that because I like at least two monitors when I'm working.

385
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm going to just try to really get myself set up for working from home in a way that's comfortable because right now it's it's bonkers.

386
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And I don't think that's going to be wrapping up anytime soon. And if I can make my home set up just a little bit better for a reasonable price, I think it's time to do it.

387
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Should have done it a while ago, to be honest with you. But I just I really have been on the fence about what hardware to get.

388
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But ultimately, I made my decision and I thought about it some more.

389
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And I've had some conversations and I thought the opportunity to buy a machine loaded with Fedora from the vendor directly.

390
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
That was just such a neat opportunity. I wanted to pull the trigger on it.

391
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So when I get it and I've had a chance to try it for a little bit, I'll let you know what I think about it as a as a piece of hardware as a as Nick in the chat room says.

392
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Obviously, it's going to run sues. You notice the feedback's dropped off.

393
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I notice the lizards have withdrawn. I guess they feel like they've had their victory.

394
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Yes. But no, I don't. I don't think so. Have you tried Sousa as a desktop?

395
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I did not care for it. What? How outrageous.

396
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fair enough.

397
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Mr. Dominic, is there anything you want to mention this week before we get out of here and let you get some rest?

398
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
No. Wear a mask if you know. Yeah.

399
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Wear a mask. Yeah. It's not it's not the Rona you got, right? You're not.

400
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I don't think so. It's the jackass. We had, you know, you have a holiday. You deserve to suffer.

401
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Although I didn't. Yeah, I just it's a Thanksgiving tradition that even if I don't see anyone, I get sick.

402
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah, it's sort of like it's a it's part of your rhythm, your body's. Yes, your body rhythm.

403
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So go follow Mr. Dominic on Twitter at Domenico. His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.
