00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Koto Radio, episode 335 for December 10th, 2018.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.000
Hi everyone, and welcome to Koto Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and its related technologies.

00:39.000 --> 00:53.000
This is our 335th episode, I am back in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, and I am joined every single week by my co-host, the one, the only, the dodging the illness, Mr. Dominic.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Hello Mike!

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Dammit Captain, I'm a JavaScript programmer, not a software developer.

00:58.000 --> 01:08.000
Burn, nice, coming in strong this week. I like it. Get everybody fired up. How are you doing? Are you good? Have you avoided any travel plagues or kid plagues?

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Because when you've got kids and a lot of travel, it's like you're Neo in the Matrix dodging bullets right now.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
So, the kid cancelled my trip to Denver.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
What?

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
I really think this is a conspiracy, actually.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
No!

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I think my wife is trying to keep us apart.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
You know, I think it's what it is, because I was planning to wine and dine you while you were in Denver, you know?

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
I was going to take you out, feed you good, and drag you back to your hotel room.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Wait, what now?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I mean, four or five, nothing.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
Anyways, let's restart. So, how are you doing? You good? You sick? We'll just cut all that. We'll just delete all that.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah, I'm sure we will.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
I'm a little under the weather. My son is okay.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
But, of course, he is not traveling to the family event with the missus, and therefore, I got childcare.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
And you know how childcare can be. They cancelled.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
Yeah, and because I'm living in a swamp, I have no one to call but the friendly neighborhood alligator.

02:12.000 --> 02:23.000
So, yeah, I will be staying home while you get to drink Linux and open source beers off of the stomach of, I can only imagine, Carl Rochelle from System76.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah, that or I'm going to glitter the town pink with Emma.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
I'll tell you though, we're going to have a party. We'll just have to reschedule. Eventually, one day will happen.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
But you know...

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
You know what? WWDC. We could do it live, and I could, like, light myself on fire right on stage.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Are you going to go to WWDC this year?

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
As much as I'm fond of spending money, $1,600 and then, like, $1,000 for a hotel room is not going to happen.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah, I didn't think so. Yeah, I didn't think so.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
No, we'll figure it out. Although, you know, now we know that the show won't get weird. Like, for all we know, had we met...

02:57.000 --> 03:05.000
See, here's the thing, though, is what I'm worried is if we go too long, then it's going to have negative consequences on our relationship.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
You know what I'm saying?

03:06.000 --> 03:15.000
Like, because what we have going on between you and me is special, and we've never met in person.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
So, if we meet in person, we might not like each other anymore.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
It could happen.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
You never know. So, I mean, probably not, but it could have happened, and now...

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
See, the dirty secret about me is I'm a lot less crazy in person.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Huh. I wonder if that's true for me.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
It depends on the day you get me and the people I'm around.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
I can be one low-key mother-effer, or sometimes I can be, like, the most, like, fired up, like, intense person.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Although, in Denver, you never know. You pick up the wrong cookie, and you're flying, so...

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
I'll show them a thing or two. Let me tell you what.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
All right.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
So, you know who else is flying?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Who?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Right off the edge of glory.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Is this unbelievable or what?

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
You know what? Five years ago, I would have bet you any amount of money this would never have happened.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Five years ago? Five minutes ago?

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
I mean, just because this was a fundamental 20-plus-year investment by Microsoft,

04:16.000 --> 04:26.000
and now for Microsoft to be moving edge to Chromium is one of the biggest platform shifts I think we've ever seen.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
And because think of the size of Microsoft, and think what this means for Electron. Think about that.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Think about what this means for Electron.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
And you know where this is going, don't you?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
This is going...

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Tell me where it's going.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
This is... I'll tell you why Microsoft's doing this.

04:43.000 --> 04:51.000
Because what they're going for is more valuable than Edge or Triton or whatever you want to call the rendering engine.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
What they're going for is creating, I think, or recreating a lot of their apps in Electron.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
We've got Skype in Electron now. We've got Visual Studio Code in Electron.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
Microsoft is... I guess, so I don't have any public things to point to,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
but I have reason to believe that Microsoft is working on projects behind the scenes

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
that are applications that haven't been publicly released yet that are also Electron based.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Are we still in the alternate universe from last week, the dark universe here?

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
I guess. I guess maybe we never got out.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Maybe we never... It's like those Holodeck episodes where you leave the Holodeck, but you really just are still on the...

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
It's like a new simulation.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah, that's what's happening.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
So, of things I might want for Christmas this year, because you know, we're in the holiday season, Chris.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
More Electron was not on the list.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
Well, what if instead of running a dozen different Electron engines or Chrome engines to power these Electron apps,

05:55.000 --> 06:03.000
what if your operating system had one super efficient engine built in that these Electron apps could just run off of?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Could we call it the Windows subsystem for Electron?

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah, or we would call it the Edge engine or something.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
So, one Edge engine, so you could have Slack and all your other applications that maybe it's Visual Studio Code,

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
maybe it's a yet unreleased but very large Microsoft product that is rewritten in Electron.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
I think about this, too.

06:23.000 --> 06:31.000
Think about as all roads eventually lead to Azure, and as things like Office 365 become one of their premier services platforms,

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
it just makes a lot of sense to start building some of those things that connect back to those roads in Electron,

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
because otherwise they're writing the applications twice in the case of Office 365.

06:42.000 --> 06:51.000
So, my understanding of the architecture of Electron, though, is that would also require significant changes in how Electron itself works.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Yeah, and it's going to require significant changes to Chromium.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Although, who owns Electron?

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
And, you're catching on.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
You're catching on here, yeah.

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
And, who has the power to become probably the second largest contributor to the Chromium code base?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
And, who has an app store that doesn't have any apps?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
There you go.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Was that too mean?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
No, you're on point there, too.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
So, this is, I think, why they're willing to kill a 20-year legacy.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
So, you just blown my mind.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
I took this – see, I think I'm fighting the battles of the early 2000s.

07:27.000 --> 07:37.000
I'm thinking about web standards and how it is truly the case that Chromium is now the IE6 of our time.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
But, maybe you're right.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Maybe we should just welcome our new Chromium overlords.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
Well, I think there's just no getting out of it just because of the sheer market size of Android.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
And, iOS is also WebKit, which is pretty damn close to Chromium.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Damn near just cousins.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Kissing cousins sometimes.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
You got to factor that in.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
And, there's just – there is no territory to win anymore.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
And, I feel bad for Mozilla.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I feel really bad for Mozilla.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I always feel bad for Mozilla.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
But, this might be the better way to influence something this large now.

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
Is, instead of pretending like it doesn't exist and siloing all your innovations into your own engine that 1% of the web uses –

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I'm being mean there, but you get my point.

08:23.000 --> 08:31.000
Instead, use your incredible weight now as one of the world's largest open source contributors to affect the Chromium project

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
and push it in a direction that is complementary to your platform.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
And, that's what they're going to do.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
They're going to make – I bet Windows will be the best platform to run Chrome on, which it almost already is anyways.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
But, we did have this – or something similar to what you were describing before, right?

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
The Windows – and I'm going back to WinRT again, people.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Yeah, buddy.

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
Win.js, right, where it was native hooks via JavaScript into the WinRT, I believe, APIs.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Did you see – yeah, I agree.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And, ARM is part of this.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
ARM is definitely part of this.

09:03.000 --> 09:14.000
They are already – have already been contributing upstream to the Chromium project specifically to improve it on future to be released ARM devices.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
How is this not just like IE6 2.0 though?

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
Well, at least it's an open source project.

09:24.000 --> 09:32.000
I mean, it doesn't sound as horrible as I thought it was going to be, but, you know, like, you still have – I'm trying to think, trying to play this out.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Like, okay, you're an app developer.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
You want to run a desktop app.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah, I guess it works.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
I mean, the only thing that's going to happen is on Linux and Mac, but particularly Mac,

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
your app is going to be like a hundred times shittier than it is on Windows.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Because my assumption is – well, that's interesting though.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Is Microsoft going to embrace and modify Electron?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
I didn't say extend.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
See, there's so many things they could do, right?

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
They could – yeah, so we're getting way too off the rails, but they could make it like –

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
No, I don't think we're off the rails at all.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
I think if you look at why they bought GitHub, I think Electron was part of that.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
Well, I could see Electron – I think somebody in the chat minutes ago said something about

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Electron being like a new.NET.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
I would say less.NET, but like a new UWP targeting platform where maybe you can target

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
with the.NET languages, right?

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
Or like you can target Electron as your platform and write using C Sharp, perhaps.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
Or maybe you just – maybe you can't, but things get weird if you make Electron a OS

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
level available framework instead of being –

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
No, you're not making Electron.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
You're not making Electron.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I don't think so.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
I think it's a little – it's a Chrome runtime that is system level.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
So it's going to be an Electron-like thing that gets –

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
I think Electron gets updated to recognize when it's running on Windows, instead of running

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
its own rendering instance, it uses the built-in system rendering.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Oh, so it's like ActiveX.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Kind of, yeah.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
You know what?

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
They're going to bake it into the OS like they baked IE in is what they're going to do.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
So it's going to be this weird situation where, for instance, like a giant Electron app that

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
I use is VS Code, right, and I use it on Linux, Mac, and Windows in that order because Windows

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I tend to be in proper Visual Studio.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
But theoretically, VS Code in the world you just laid out would perform astronomically

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
better on Win 10 than –

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
All of these apps that are being built out there would.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
And the word on the street is there's other application vendors creating applications

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
in Electron Adobe that we haven't seen yet either.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
And there's going to be larger and larger incentives to have a first-class Electron platform.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
I don't know if I believe it.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
This is just what people tell me.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
And I, you know, I ingest, think about it, and relay it, really.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I don't know if I believe it's going to happen.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
But I could definitely see that's what Microsoft's getting ready to do.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
And then they can keep pushing multi-platform applications.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I mean, there's a lot of benefits to them.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
Keep pushing Visual Studio, right, because like, yeah, especially if it's Electron because

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
you just have like a wizard you run through in Visual Studio proper that like builds it

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
into an IPA or a DMG.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
And then let's just say, you know, a new kind of like light version of Photoshop,

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
like the rebuild of Photoshop one day, launches.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And it's an Electron application.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Well, guess where you're going to have the best Photoshop performance?

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
On a Windows desktop.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
So that's a great selling reason for their hardware partners like Dell to say,

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
come buy a first-class Photoshop system with our, you know, Dell whatever tower.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
So it just could be a huge investment in the future for them.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Jesus, it's just such a savage move.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
It's savage, you know?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Savage.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Isn't it?

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
You know, we haven't covered all of it, but they've done a lot with this GitHub acquisition

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
that has been, and then the speed of it has just been really like fast.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah.

12:53.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah, it's like, I think what surprises me the most is the shit sandwich they had

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
to eat as a team to decide to do this.

13:03.000 --> 13:10.000
Like the conversation that has to start internally to say, hey, you know that thing

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
that is maybe one of the most associated things with our brand and that we have,

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
we were almost destroyed by the federal government and shattered into many different pieces over.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
If people have been through that, the magnitude of what has happened is mind-bending.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
Microsoft was almost destroyed as a corporation over this web browser that they have now just decided,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
job done, we'll ship that stuff.

13:35.000 --> 13:44.000
It's astronomical that they as a company had the capacity for that level of self-analysis,

13:44.000 --> 13:52.000
that humble attitude towards their own product from a detached perspective and they must have had

13:52.000 --> 13:59.000
a come to Jesus moment about the market reality and just decided this is the next step that we have to take.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
And it's just, that's why I say it's savage.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
It's just, it's cutthroat.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
It's ruthless.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
It's impressive.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
It's impressive.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And that's not all they're doing.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
No, no, no.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I mean, I think they're going to just wrap it up there.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
No, yeah, no.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Visual Studio 2019 turning some heads.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
It has some interesting stuff.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
They're pushing the live share, which is their collaborative coding thing again.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Going to skip over that for now because I haven't tried it.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
It's one of those things though, if you're working in a remote team like I am, that might be what you want.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Probably a little bandwidth dependent.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
It's probably not much worse than Google Docs.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
It's probably like, you know, a tech stream.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Yeah, well, see, I've never used it.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
That I have to admit.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
The one that really turned my head, well, actually, I'm jumping ahead, Chris.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
An image button class in Xamarin Forms.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Oh, yeah.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
It's only taken like five years.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Yeah.

14:57.000 --> 15:04.000
So for those who haven't done Xamarin Forms, the idea of having a button that is an image,

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
which is simple on both Android and iOS, was stupidly hard in Xamarin Forms.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
You had to usually import like third party stuff.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
There was like a Xamarin Essentials pack.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
Way back in the day, there was something called Xamarin Labs that you had to import and it was kind of janky and bad.

15:19.000 --> 15:27.000
This is, for me, the most important announcement of Microsoft Connect because it took five years to get an image button.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
Oh, I thought you meant the release of the new Visual Studio preview.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I just want my image button.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
I thought you were going to talk about the Azure integration with this one. It is very strong.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
It's like one click up. Now you're working with Azure storage.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Microsoft account. OK, you're good to go.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
How about the AI IntelliSense? Did you see that?

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I did. I am reserving judgment.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
It sounds very trendy.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
But the demo looks good, man.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I mean, of course it's a demo.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Microsoft knows to be careful, though, with IntelliSense.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
IntelliSense is one of their things they're well known for.

16:06.000 --> 16:15.000
And I think if they're going to roll out a new version of IntelliSense and slap AI on there, they're going to be, I would bet, it's in good shape.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
But I do wonder, though, my understanding is it's Azure powered.

16:18.000 --> 16:24.000
So is it like constantly phoning home or is it like is there some local capabilities there?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
That wasn't I don't know if you saw that wasn't super clear to me.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
No, yeah, it's not clear. Yeah, I haven't seen it.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
I didn't see it in the blog.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
Okay, that's where I was reading about it was on their blog.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
But, you know, you could see if there was a way to anonymize that stuff.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Like people are often correcting IntelliSense.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I'm sure they are. Right. Yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:49.000
And then if you could pull metrics on how many times people are trying to fix something that IntelliSense gets wrong, then you could adjust it.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
Now, the question is, are they just storing that?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And then how do they refresh it?

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
Local, you know what, after the show, I'll try to look into that because that is fascinating the more I think about it.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
The other thing I was trying to figure out, is this something where works best in Visual Studio proper?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
What about Visual Studio Mac?

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah, well, this is for Visual Studio 2019 proper.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
Right. I think all of these things we've been discussing, except for my image button, which is on everything because it's amazing.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Sorry.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
Is basically Visual Studio proper, which, you know what, I have to be honest.

17:24.000 --> 17:34.000
Speaking of like things one might, you know, right cross platform, I was sort of hoping for VS proper or at least VS for Mac Linux version.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Because it is just mono develop under the hood.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah, that's called me for a little bit.

17:40.000 --> 17:47.000
Yeah, like why not just, you know, oh, and by the way, Xamarin now works with GTK sharp, has for a while.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Come on, I was just do it.

17:50.000 --> 18:05.000
I was going to mention to just before we go too far off of the IntelliSense code, that new AI assisted IntelliSense code capability is available as an extension to Visual Studio code, the current version 2017.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
So you could.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Yeah, I think.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Or at least.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
No, no, no, no, no, it's visual.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
No, I'm wrong.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
It's Visual Studio 2017.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
So if you're on Visual Studio 2017.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
Right, Visual Studio proper, you could install this new AI assisted IntelliSense code.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
I wish didn't call all three of these products the same name.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
That's why I got it mixed up.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah, yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
So we find ourselves covering Microsoft a lot in the show now.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Yeah.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
What the hell's what's up with that?

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
You know, I was just looking over the year in total because we're going to do like a year wrap end of year.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Yeah.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Yeah.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
For like Linux action news and for Linux unplugged for the new cycle.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
And you look at Microsoft and there's just there's so many things they've done this year.

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
But just a couple of the big ones that are pretty noteworthy is they joined that open innovation network.

18:51.000 --> 18:57.000
And, you know, that Linux definition and said, OK, no more patent suits over that stuff in this Linux definition.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
That was pretty big.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
Of course, we know about their continued releases in dot net core and.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
PowerShell core and all that stuff, but also the GitHub acquisition was in June.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
That was back in June.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
They made they announced the GitHub acquisition.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
That was a huge fundamental deal.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Huge deal.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Huge deal.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
And there's been other things.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
There has been there has been significant improvements to the subsystem for Linux this year.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
There have been multiple distros that entered the Windows Store this year, including one that's actually 20 bucks.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
It's actually for pay.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Sphere OS, which is going to be a big deal next year.

19:32.000 --> 19:39.000
The Sphere OS, which the devices they not only did they announce them, but they actually shipped when they said they would ship and they run Linux.

19:39.000 --> 19:47.000
And this year, Microsoft announced that Azure runs more than half Linux and that sometimes it's well into the high 60 percentage.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
Almost 70 percent systems are running Linux on Azure.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
That is just the highlights.

19:54.000 --> 20:02.000
That's not even getting down to the nitty gritty releases and individual project things and stuff like that, like their contributions to Chromium and the kernel.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Like it's just it's unbelievable.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
When I go through that list, I was just looking like going, holy shit, Microsoft, like, what the hell?

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Savage. Is that the word of the day? I don't know.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Probably I probably shouldn't say it's probably I don't know.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
You know, I should be careful those kinds of things.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
But I just look at that and I go, they are really on fire.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
They've they've gotten into a gear and you look at the moves they've made like that GitHub acquisitions.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
Just so so on point like that was such a good move for them.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
And now this move to the Chromium base again, just the whole thing is surprising.

20:37.000 --> 20:44.000
What's weird is like GitHub has been made better, in my opinion, so far with this Microsoft exhibition.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Any specifics or just a feeling?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I do have a couple of specifics.

20:49.000 --> 20:55.000
Some of the continuous integration stuff for the what they used to call the Mobile App Dev Center, which was a terrible name.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
And I think now they then they called Microsoft development something. And now I think they just call like Azure apps.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
The naming thing has not gotten better.

21:03.000 --> 21:10.000
But basically, it's the continuous integration service for Xamarin, iOS native and Android native and like Cordova apps.

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
So mobile apps, Microsoft App Center, I think is the right name now, maybe.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
And that's like a pretty quick process.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
And if you're using GitHub, it's very easy just to link your GitHub repo.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
And without having to write a bunch of scripts, trigger everything when you want it to.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
I wonder and also like deployments to Azure, even if you're not a Visual Studio developer.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Of course. Right out of GitHub, baby.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Yes, of course. Of course. Not a problem.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
You know what I would say, too, is I'd ask the audience Coder dot show slash contact.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
What does Microsoft need to do now in twenty nineteen to close the gap to be?

21:50.000 --> 21:57.000
To convince you if you're not convinced yet or what what is still the big outstanding thing that we're not talking about?

21:57.000 --> 22:05.000
Like, you know, there's like the elephant in the room, for example, some of their core desktop applications not available for desktop Linux probably never would be.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
But what a ton of legacy. Yeah. But what what could they do to close that gap?

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
If there's if you still haven't been convinced Coder dot show slash contact, let us know.

22:13.000 --> 22:19.000
But we want to take a moment and chat with Peter Kratzmann, who's coming on to talk about the hashtag.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
No estimates movement, which Mike and I have both been on part of at one time and now have learned.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
But we'll save that for a moment. Peter's coming on to talk about no estimates.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
And this is a man who has thought a lot about it.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
He's from the Seattle area and he took a moment while traveling to join us today.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
Peter, welcome to Coder Radio. Thank you very much.

22:38.000 --> 22:46.000
Glad to be here. I got to say, Mike, I was kind of surprised when you invited Peter on because some of this stuff goes against what you and I have discussed on the show for ages.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
Some of some of what we've come around to more recently.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
But we have said some things that we are guilty of in Peter's post here in several years ago.

22:55.000 --> 23:02.000
Peter had some issues. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So, Peter, we kind of wanted to start with maybe all position.

23:02.000 --> 23:15.000
I'll paraphrase our previous position, which we have changed on is we used to try to make the case for starting work with no complete estimates on this show from a somewhat experience based.

23:15.000 --> 23:21.000
Continuous disappointment of estimates, never really properly setting expectations, never really preventing scope creep.

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
But one of the things you touch on is a lot of times the arguments are more anecdotal.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
And so we're ours. Our arguments were anecdotal. You also say it's often jives at evil management.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
A lot of ours were. Is this is this an area where we all make a very common mistake?

23:40.000 --> 23:47.000
Because it feels like we we we made these very mistakes. Well, it stands.

23:47.000 --> 23:54.000
I hesitate to call it a mistake, although I clearly think in in general, no estimates is is a very big mistake.

23:54.000 --> 24:05.000
But it's a natural thing for people to drift into who have encountered bad use of estimates or not been able to make their estimates jive and been frustrated by that.

24:05.000 --> 24:20.000
And I recognize and acknowledge that very strongly. That said, I still think that there are reasons why people need to talk about why estimates are useful and how we can help actually make them more useful.

24:20.000 --> 24:31.000
One of the things I did want to say, because you mentioned anecdotes, my take on this is that almost base almost every stance we have regarding software development, essentially on anecdotes.

24:31.000 --> 24:44.000
We've seen what we've done and it's very difficult to have certainly parallel studies that explore two different ways of going about the identical task because you can't step in the same river twice.

24:44.000 --> 24:54.000
So, you know, that said, I still think that there are arguments and logic that need to prevail as people grapple with these ideas and different stances.

24:54.000 --> 25:03.000
I think I completely see where you're at now and now with a bit of more experience behind us. And part of it was learning to do it right.

25:03.000 --> 25:12.000
And you said something there that I'd like to pick your brain more about doing these estimates better, doing them right. What are some what are some tips you have for that?

25:12.000 --> 25:26.000
Well, in some ways, recognizing the fact that it's not black and white and estimates aren't guesses, which is kind of what the no estimates movement will very quickly try to lead you into saying that estimates are guesses.

25:26.000 --> 25:33.000
And all that means really is that they're not 100 percent guaranteed. Well, that's why they're called estimates.

25:33.000 --> 25:53.000
And when you when you insist that something be 100 percent accurate, you're really not recognizing the reality of most of the things we do in life, let alone software development, where we have to make the best call we can based on imperfect information.

25:53.000 --> 26:11.000
And with the mindset of, oh, how can we make this useful? How can we make it so that it is helpful to us and not harmful to us? How can we clearly delineate the difference between an estimate and a target and a commitment or a schedule?

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
I mean, and those things are not equivalent. None of those is equivalent to the other.

26:16.000 --> 26:24.000
And often you will hear people, oh, estimates turn into commitments. Well, that's bad when they do directly.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
However, I also point out that commitments are always based on some kind of estimate.

26:29.000 --> 26:35.000
You can't possibly say I'm going to do X, Y or Z by a given time unless you are form of.

26:35.000 --> 26:46.000
And so you have to understand that you need to bake the estimates that you come up with, which are in my mind best rather than being time driven, being estimates of effort.

26:46.000 --> 26:53.000
And you kind of accumulate all those together and you determine what the appropriate schedule is.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And now with some experience, I totally follow what you're saying, Peter.

26:57.000 --> 27:05.000
But I noticed something you said there that I'd like to expand on a little bit. You suggested there could be ways to improve estimates,

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
do them a little bit better so that way they're not being called guesses, essentially.

27:09.000 --> 27:15.000
What is your advice or thoughts around improving estimates?

27:15.000 --> 27:24.000
A lot of it is going into it with the appropriate mindset that estimates can be useful and that they are not 100 percent guarantees.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
They're not a schedule. They're not a commitment.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
And people tend to who get pulled into the no estimates viewpoint,

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
they tend to start equating those things because they've seen it happen.

27:35.000 --> 27:42.000
They've seen estimates turn into commitments. And, you know, that's by nature a bad thing when it happens directly.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
I would point out that with commitments, commitments are a desirable thing in business.

27:47.000 --> 27:54.000
You actually need to have them between teams, between vendors, between partners in a business engagement.

27:54.000 --> 28:02.000
And if you're going to make commitments, you're going to need to base those in some form on some kind of estimate.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
And so, yes, the fact that commitments are based on estimates should be a given

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
and that you have to do the best you can to come up with the best information and modify as appropriate.

28:13.000 --> 28:22.000
But understand that you don't make commitments without estimates of some form and they don't turn directly into that schedule.

28:22.000 --> 28:29.000
You compose a schedule after coming up with the estimates and you have a bunch of buffer

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
and you figure out what the appropriate mix is of the things you have to do

28:32.000 --> 28:38.000
and you figure if you're on board with the scope overall or whether you need to reduce it.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
And you commit, in essence, not just to what you're going to produce,

28:41.000 --> 28:49.000
but you commit to reevaluating that constantly at every juncture to see if you're on track and you do risk mitigation.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
If you're not going to be on track, what is your approach?

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
What's your plan B? What are you going to drop? What are you going to maybe extend in time frame?

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
There's no one single answer, but it's sort of a maturity outlook in my mind.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
That sounds offensive, but it is a kind of maturity that you need to adopt.

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
One interesting thing I've seen, Peter, you and I got hooked up because I was asking on Twitter

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
some of the no-estimates folks to explain to me how that worked.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
As someone who runs a consulting shop, it was pretty quick to find out that many –

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
and not to put words in their mouth, we should one day have some of them on –

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
many of them are thinking of internal development, not necessarily where you're an outside consultant or indeed running a dev shop.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
Just the idea, the reason I was originally asking of saying, oh, we don't have an estimate is insane.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
I can't bid on an RFP without an estimate.

29:43.000 --> 29:52.000
I do have some sympathy to the case of – it sounds like there has to be, I'll use your word, maturity on both sides.

29:52.000 --> 30:00.000
You can't have the end customer or let's just say the client kind of say, oh, well, I thought that should have been included.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
Do you get what I'm saying? You need to be in – like how would this work in let's say a fixed bid world?

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
Well, I'm not the one to talk to that because I don't think it does work in a fixed bid world.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Neither do I, so that's perfect.

30:11.000 --> 30:19.000
But let me address what you said about internal because most of what I do these days is actually –

30:19.000 --> 30:26.000
oh, it's probably 70, 30 or more in terms of internal development, internal systems,

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
companies that are putting major software, internal software endeavors together,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
major modifications to some kind of internal platform, et cetera.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
And there, the notion of internal commitment is just as important.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
You have a relatively large company, you have a marketing department, you have a sales department,

30:43.000 --> 30:48.000
you have a customer care department, and they are all depending on a particular schedule being met.

30:48.000 --> 30:54.000
And if it's not going to be met, there are going to be repercussions down the line of people needing to adjust other things,

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
failing to meet other commitments on the part of the company,

30:57.000 --> 31:03.000
lack of confidence by the end-to-end customers in the company's product overall, and so on.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
So I don't see it as a dichotomy between internal and external.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
I think that estimates need to be a factor in both.

31:11.000 --> 31:20.000
In almost, not every, but in almost situation, estimates are present whether they are spoken directly or not.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
Sometimes they are kind of under the surface.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
People don't really talk about them, but they are still really there.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Yeah, that's very true.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
So I guess it seems like the challenge is probably for some people in our audience

31:32.000 --> 31:39.000
and people getting started in the industry is estimates are hard to do right when you are new.

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
And part of what you touched on there was a feedback cycle where you look at what you got right,

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
look at what you got wrong, and you iterate on your ability to estimate.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
But when you are brand new, you don't really have much to draw on,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
and it seems like it's particularly tricky at that early stage.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
What are your thoughts about that?

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Oh, yeah.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
Well, I mean, the common view that's expressed about estimates is that it's just somebody kind of stopped in the hallway saying,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
oh, Joe, how long is this going to take?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
And Joe says, oh, three weeks.

32:06.000 --> 32:13.000
And the next thing you know, Joe's manager is going, Joe, you said it would be three weeks, and here we are, and you're not done yet.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
That's sort of the nightmare scenario.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
That's not the way that one does estimates.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
Ideally, you don't do it with a hallway conversation.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
You don't do it with a one-off flip judgment.

32:25.000 --> 32:33.000
You do it with some kind of process that people essentially collaborate on where you go back and forth

32:33.000 --> 32:39.000
and what the necessary requirements are going to be, what the implications are of the scope, what things are hard,

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
what things are easy, what the timeframe really needs to be.

32:43.000 --> 32:51.000
And you bake all that into a reasonable schedule, and you have some rigor to the process.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
And by the way, you use data where appropriate.

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
You use data on throughput of the team and likely, you know, past efforts along these lines

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
and how well they've done in terms of throughput.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
And you don't say, well, we'll do this one in a month where the last one took us six months.

33:06.000 --> 33:14.000
Or if you do, you have a really darn good reason for that kind of optimism, which is almost always misplaced.

33:14.000 --> 33:21.000
So that sounds a lot like one of my hobby horses, which is always have a documentation

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
and for lack of a better term, discovery process for any new work.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Is that something you would agree with in terms of –

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
Yeah, absolutely.

33:29.000 --> 33:37.000
I mean, there should never be just sort of a – from some, you know, undefined process

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
where suddenly everybody decides we're going to be done by the end of March.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Well, we want to see what the assumptions were behind that.

33:42.000 --> 33:49.000
You want to be able to point out when those assumptions go awry when it's January or February.

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
And you want to be able to re-estimate as appropriate when that kind of thing happens.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
And unless you have things written down, if you're just going by gut and you're just going by just,

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
oh, today we're just going to work on what seems like the most important thing, that doesn't happen.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
It just gets lost in the ozone.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
And what turns out is that it's a disservice to the development team

34:11.000 --> 34:18.000
because basically there's no defense against somebody saying, oh, we're going to say you'll be done by March 31st.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
And, you know, without some kind of process that has examined what that really means

34:23.000 --> 34:29.000
and what the assumptions are behind that and collaborative understanding and buy-in to that date,

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
it's meaningless and there's no defense against it.

34:32.000 --> 34:41.000
Estimates are one of development's best defense against target dates being set from on high with no facts behind them.

34:41.000 --> 34:46.000
Oh, sure, such as a trade show or – there's lots of examples of that, yeah.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Yeah, or even not, right?

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
I mean, often – and this is what people – you know, people say, oh, trade show, I understand trade show deadlines.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
I understand the Christmas holiday season, sure, but, you know, every other date, every other deadline is arbitrary.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
Well, actually, no, no, it isn't.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
Arbitrary kind of means chosen at random, and they're usually not chosen at random.

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
They're usually chosen with an idea of, okay, we're going to set this line in the sand

35:09.000 --> 35:15.000
so that we can do some meaningful coordination of efforts here and we can plan for further work downstream.

35:15.000 --> 35:22.000
And so deadlines do matter even if they don't have a looming absolute trade show deadline behind them.

35:22.000 --> 35:30.000
So what would you say to the developer who's, you know, fairly frustrated, let's say on Reddit, on Twitter,

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
you know, screaming hashtag no estimates from the rooftops because, I don't know, they've just been burned, right?

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
They just got a tongue lashing from their manager and they can't take it anymore.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
What would you say to him or her?

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
What's, I guess, the first step?

35:44.000 --> 35:52.000
Well, try to understand what is driving the need for estimates rather than simply say they're arbitrary, they're useless,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
they don't do me any good whatsoever.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Try to understand the bigger picture.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
And that often, you know, understanding the bigger picture is something that, you know,

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
the more we emerge into adulthood, you know, the more we acquire that, right?

36:05.000 --> 36:10.000
In terms of, you know, I have a seven-year-old at home and a lot of working with him is, you know,

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
getting to understand what things are, you know, sort of out of his control

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
or what's the bigger picture on why he can or can't do something.

36:18.000 --> 36:24.000
And, you know, not to equate developers with seven-year-olds by any means, but it is the same kind.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
It is the same kind of thing in the sense of we have to recognize, you know,

36:29.000 --> 36:36.000
that reasons for things that are outside of an individual's particular span of view.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
And that's often what developers – and I speak from experience here.

36:40.000 --> 36:47.000
I grew up through the ranks and I was, you know, along the same lines when I was in my 20s as a young developer

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
of not understanding the bigger picture behind what the company was trying to achieve,

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
what the larger aspects were, some of the gating factors, etc.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
Right. So we all want to be respectful of your time, of course.

36:59.000 --> 37:05.000
What tools could a, let's say, relatively junior to intermediate developer use

37:05.000 --> 37:11.000
to kind of get better – I hate to use this, but like the craft of estimating?

37:11.000 --> 37:17.000
Well, I mean, the first thing is to really read up on – and it isn't like this hasn't been covered.

37:17.000 --> 37:22.000
And so the book that I always recommend, and I'm just a huge fan of this individual in general,

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
but particularly of this book, is Steve McConnell's software estimation,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
The Black Art, I think he calls it.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
And he does that with a little bit of humor behind it because, yeah,

37:33.000 --> 37:39.000
there's no absolute, you know, recipe type of thing of how you do estimates.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
But there are a lot of factors entailed.

37:41.000 --> 37:48.000
And he goes carefully through why estimates are asked for, what uses they serve,

37:48.000 --> 37:54.000
you know, what's the best way to go about them so that you mitigate some of the anchoring effect, for example,

37:54.000 --> 38:00.000
or the hippo opinion that just declares that and offers, better than I can summarize here,

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
a whole bunch of strategies for dealing with those from every aspect,

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
from the developer aspect, from the middle manager aspect, and so on.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
And a lot of it is just cross-education.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
And that just doesn't mean education of the developer.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
It often means education of the manager, like, you know, what is driving this?

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
I need to understand this.

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
I need to understand what's going to happen to this estimate and, you know, exactly why you need it.

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
All of those are fair questions to ask in a non-combative way,

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
in the spirit of looking for the collaboration that needs to occur.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
Yeah. And it seems like that could lead to actual success on all sides

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
because then you have understanding and expectations are set correctly for what the estimate is

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
and what it's trying to accomplish and why everybody wants it.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Peter, I can tell you've thought a lot about this.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
And I want to suggest people check out your website, PeterKratzman.com.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
We will have a link in the show notes.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
Are you a Seattle native, Peter?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
No, not native, although I think of myself now as one.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
I've lived here for 30 years.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Oh, I think that counts. That counts.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
That's pretty native to me.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Well, that's pretty great.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
I'm just about 40 minutes up by five.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
That's where we have our studio at.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Oh, got it.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
Yeah. Peter, it was great chatting with you.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I'm going to follow you on Twitter, keep tabs on what's going on.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Maybe we can chat again in the future.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
I think this has been super informative, and I really appreciate you taking the time.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
I'm always interested in dialogue.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
People can reach me on Twitter at Peter Kratzman.

39:29.000 --> 39:38.000
And it's really interesting to me to engage on these ideas when people can do it with kind of a calm attitude,

39:38.000 --> 39:44.000
avoid the name calling that seems to enter into the dialogue way too often,

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
and just throw around the different ideas and approaches.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
And Peter mentioned a book, but he's got a whole bunch of other recommendations on his website.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
Again, that was PeterKratzman.com, and he's got a recommended reading link on there.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
If you want to grab some other books, Peter, thanks again.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
I appreciate it.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Thank you, Peter.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
That's going to give me a lot to think about.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
So thanks again to Peter for joining us.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
Before we get out of here this week, though, I wanted to mention Linux Fest Northwest.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
I'm trying to get it out there early before we're even close to it.

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
Well, close-ish, so maybe you'll consider coming out and seeing us.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
It's not only going to be a huge one for Jupyter Broadcasting.

40:24.000 --> 40:31.000
It's been a big year for us, and we've got a bigger team than we've ever had, and we have big plans.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
There's talk about maybe even getting a dedicated room and holding talks all day

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
from some of our hosts and other people associated with Linux Academy

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
and just sort of having like a Jupyter Broadcasting room if we can get all our crap together.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
But at the minimum, we're going to have a live booth with swag.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
We'll be having an after-party with barbecue.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I'll have Lady Jups parked out in the parking lot.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I'll be cooking up food for everybody.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
And Bellingham is one of the prettiest places in the Northwest.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
So if you can make it out, go to linuxfestnorthwest.org for details.

41:03.000 --> 41:09.000
It is April 26 through the 28th at the Bellingham Technical College.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
If you're in the States, you may check to see if you can just fly into Bellingham.

41:13.000 --> 41:19.000
They do have an airport, and oh boy, that's like a 15-minute drive or so to Linux Fest.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
But you can also fly into SeaTac, and they have shuttles to get you up north.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
There's people organizing rides.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
We'll have some vehicles, all of that.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
And we'll be having a hell of a party.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
We'd love to have you there.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
We have some big stuff to share.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Linux Fest has some big stuff to share.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
And they're doing a theme for the whole thing, past, present, and future.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
All right, I've said my bit.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Maybe that's where I'll finally meet you, Mike.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
You should come out.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
We already talked about it.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
You're not going to make it to Linux Fest.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Not a chance.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Mike won't be there.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
I'm not allowed in the state of Washington anymore.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
After that time, I dressed up as the BSD devil at Linux Fest.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I'm turning my efforts on Joe this year.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I'm going to get Joe out so we can do a live Linux action news thing.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Nice.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Yeah, I think that would be fun.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
From DVK, all right.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Yeah, well, so now where should we send people for you?

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Peter, we should plug you.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Where do you want people to go?

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
Follow at Dumanuco on Twitter, and go to themadbotter.com.

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
And also, if you need something developed, and you want it to be crazy and possibly fly,

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
check it out.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
We can do that for the new year.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
That's pretty neat.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
Boy, that's interesting.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
I'll just say this.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
Follow me on Twitter, at chrisles.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
The network is at jupitersignal.

42:23.000 --> 42:30.000
And everything we talked about today is linked on our website, coder.show slash 335.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
It's really simple.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
You can also go to coder.show slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes,

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
and coder.show slash contact to give us your feedback.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
And last but not least, we also have a subreddit, coderradio.reddit.com.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
There you go.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
Check that before every show.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
It's a great way to slip in a little feedback, get in front of our face,

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
also to submit a few stories you want us to talk about, vote them up, things like that.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Coderradio.reddit.com.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Thank you for joining us.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Come back next week live.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
We'll be recording a double for the holidays, so it'll be an extended livestream next week.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
jblive.tv jupitersignal.com slash calendar for the lifetime.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Thanks for being here.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
See you next week.
