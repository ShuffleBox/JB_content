00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 424 for July 26, 2021.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,560
Hello friend and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,320
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,240
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,640
A Cloud Guru has cloud playgrounds.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,580
Now these are Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

7
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,760
Go get certified, get hired, get learning at thecloudguru.com.

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,640
My name is Chris and joining us one last time from the beach of Florida, it is our host,

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Mr. Dominic.

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Hello, Mike.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
Hello, Mr. Fisher.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
How are you?

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,560
You know, I just assume you do every episode on the beach down there with that beautiful

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Florida sand, crystal clear water.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,560
No, it's kind of a dreary day today actually.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,560
Really?

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,520
Yeah, but this is, this is our last, you know, official regular Florida episode.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,680
I feel like it's going to be a shift, you know, cause there was pre-Florida and then

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,480
there was post-Florida and now, I don't know, it's not really, it's not really going back

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,680
because like when I went independent again, it wasn't a backwards step.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,400
It was a good forward step.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,280
Like for you, it seems like this is actually a good move, but it's like how it used to

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
be.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,680
And now they're coming back the way they were.

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
Right.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,920
We're normalizing back to our one o'clock right after lunch or, or, you know, your lunchtime

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
break.

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
You know?

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,480
We are staying live on Mondays, but we're moving it to 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern.

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,800
So that's no more drinking.

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,080
Well, I mean, maybe actually sometimes a lunch drink is kind of nice actually.

32
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,960
If you listen back to the bad catalog, that definitely wasn't true.

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,880
Actually, I kind of love the idea of like going out to lunch, having a drink, coming

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
in, shooting, shoot.

35
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,720
Actually for me, it'd be brunch, right?

36
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,760
Come in, shoot the crap with you and then go lay down and take a nap.

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,240
That actually sounds like a great afternoon.

38
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
Yeah.

39
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,320
Well, this is back, you know, and for those who haven't performed closely, I will be doing

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,820
Jersey Mike is going back to Jersey.

41
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,820
How is that going?

42
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,840
I know you've been doing stage one and we want to talk about working during the move,

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,920
but just like on a high level status update, how is that move going?

44
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,840
You know, on a high level, like any big project or move, there's been complications, but it's

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,240
overall going well.

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,200
It's and I hate to say this, but it's on schedule, but you know, that, yeah, just like any dev

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,920
project saying something's on schedule is like begging for a problem, right?

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Yeah.

49
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,440
It's just basically means you haven't figured out what's going wrong yet.

50
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
Right.

51
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
Well, I will.

52
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
We'll get to it shortly, but I did.

53
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Something did go wrong.

54
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,440
You know, tomorrow is a big day.

55
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,880
I'm flying with with the little one tomorrow.

56
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,120
Ah, that's the day, huh?

57
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,200
The flight is at six a.m.

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,760
Both of you have to be up at four a.m.

59
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,760
Yes.

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,480
So this, you know, and, you know, mass mandate, fine.

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,400
Makes tons of sense to me.

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
But five year olds.

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
I don't know.

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Right.

65
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,240
This is going to be, I think, a little taxing.

66
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Yeah.

67
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Yeah.

68
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
Yeah.

69
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
It's a lot.

70
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
That's a big ask for someone that age.

71
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Right.

72
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Especially don't touch this.

73
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
You got to wash your hands.

74
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
You got to plus security.

75
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
I bet it should be fine.

76
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,920
I've flown with him before, but this is, you know, I just had a travel experience both

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,600
on the Amtrak and which for those outside the US is basically our what is it, like a

78
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,160
weird federal pseudo government train system, right?

79
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,160
This is more an unfiltered topic.

80
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,160
But you know, Amtrak is actually the government.

81
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Yeah.

82
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Yeah.

83
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
Yeah.

84
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
It's like some weird private.

85
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Yeah.

86
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Pseudo private, whatever.

87
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
And then I flew.

88
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,560
And like on the one hand, I got to give it to Newark Airport, which I so I took the train

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
up and I flew back.

90
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,240
I don't know how this is possible, but somehow COVID has made them more efficient.

91
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
What?

92
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
They're just fast.

93
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,760
I think it's because they like are less concerned.

94
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Yeah.

95
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Less people.

96
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
Maybe that's probably what it is.

97
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,360
Actually, I didn't think of it, but, but the Amtrak was a goddamn mess.

98
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Really?

99
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Okay.

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Well, we'll get there.

101
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
We will get there first.

102
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,080
I need your advice on this.

103
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,560
You know how we get a lot of these emails into the show about, Hey, you know, so-and-so

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
just put a book out.

105
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,920
Would you like to have them on the show or so-and-so just sold their first company?

106
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Would you like to have them on the show?

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,640
Like we get, we get so many of those a week, people constantly trying to, trying to come

108
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,960
on the show to like market their thing.

109
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,920
And like, sometimes they try to pretend like they listen to the show and sometimes they

110
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
don't.

111
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,240
They just, it's just obviously a template, but I want, I want to know what you think

112
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,400
I ought to get about this one.

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,500
So I opened up this one.

114
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,620
I don't even open them all anymore cause I can spot most of them by the subject line,

115
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:40,040
but this one comes from Sarah M and she writes, would you be interested in acquiring Dell

116
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,440
EMC user data?

117
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,440
We provide an extra edge to companies like yours by providing user data to unleash the

118
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,680
competition and gain an aggressive lead over your arch rivals.

119
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,920
You'll get a continuously updated data set with access to direct dial of phone numbers,

120
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,680
email addresses, and professional background information so that accordingly you can craft

121
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,080
the right sales pitch to target the right prospect.

122
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,160
Let me know if this is something that would interest you and I'll share a sample file

123
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,840
for your review along with the total counts available for pricing.

124
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Thanks.

125
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,560
Sarah Moon, marketing manager at tech data optimizer Inc.

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,200
I looked up tech data optimizer Inc doesn't exist.

127
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,520
Not a real company.

128
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,000
You just answered a huge question for me.

129
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,680
I've been getting tons of spam on my work email.

130
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
This is why, isn't it?

131
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
It's the damn show.

132
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,200
They hacked Dell EMC or somebody did.

133
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,880
They got Dell EMC user data apparently and now they're just selling it out there.

134
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Wow.

135
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Yeah.

136
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,720
It's like as if, as if the Coder Radio program would want to buy this hot user data and like

137
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,320
market to people in it.

138
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,240
I don't know what you thinking.

139
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,600
I have been getting tons of these.

140
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I thought it was just like my email was on some stupid list.

141
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,640
Oh, it probably is.

142
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,000
Do I report this to Dell?

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,640
Do I like forward this to some, is there some email address?

144
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,960
I just marked them as spam.

145
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
Is that bad?

146
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Should I be reporting this stuff?

147
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,440
I mean, I normally do too, but when she's sitting there selling user data from Dell,

148
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,240
how do you know it's real user data?

149
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,040
She says she provides samples.

150
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,720
You mean the, the, the almost certainly illegitimate spammer.

151
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,000
It's wild.

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,120
Just the emails we get in.

153
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,080
And that's why I appreciate the legit emails.

154
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,080
And honestly, how do you know she's a she?

155
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Just throwing it out there.

156
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,400
I don't, I don't, you know, I mean, I don't even know if Sarah Moon doesn't even sound

157
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
like a real name.

158
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,920
I'm thinking it's like EMC.py, right?

159
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
It's a Python script.

160
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Yeah.

161
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,920
I wonder if they have any, any data on Alan Jude, you know, we get some good market research

162
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
on Alan Jude.

163
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,240
You know, if we could spy on those BSD people, that's, that's good.

164
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Might be worth it.

165
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,000
Now, if they want it to sell me the M one specifications, well, all right.

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,740
So Daniel writes in, speaking of the M one, he says, hi Chris and Mike, I was listening

167
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,420
to the recent show and Mike was complaining about the terminals on the Mac and talking

168
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,000
about how he's liking the direction of the new windows terminal.

169
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,160
Well, good news for you, Mr. Dominic, are you ready for this?

170
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,660
There is a new terminal emulator that's in the work.

171
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,840
It's currently in private alpha, but you can request access to it.

172
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,240
It's available at warp.dev.

173
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,480
The project is focusing on Mac OS first and then branching out to Linux and windows and

174
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,880
the web has a really nice slick look to it.

175
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,260
And from the screencast they have available online, it seems very impressive.

176
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:31,200
And I think Chris will enjoy the fact that it is written in rust.

177
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,200
I do.

178
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:41,240
Yeah, so it's called warp, warp.dev, I'll have a link in the show notes.

179
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,240
And I mean, as far as terminals go, I'm not a very picky guy anymore, but it, it does

180
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,280
look awfully fancy.

181
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,600
And it's just a pleasure to see something not written in basically electron, you know,

182
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,400
at least not using electron and written in web, web technology, because so many of these

183
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,360
things that I've seen recently have just been web apps.

184
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,880
Yeah, I actually, uh, I read this email this morning.

185
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
I got excited.

186
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,360
I actually reached out to the warp folks.

187
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Did you?

188
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
So I'm hoping to hear back.

189
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Yeah.

190
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
Cause, uh, they tease you with this beautiful looking website and then it's like, Oh, but

191
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,880
we'll let you know when you can try the beta.

192
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,080
I'm like, give me the beta.

193
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Yeah.

194
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
I signed up for the beta.

195
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Yeah.

196
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,160
I don't do that often, but I was like, no, give me the beta.

197
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,120
But Ethan writes in, it says, loves the show, uh, and he says, I have to agree with Chris's

198
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
take on gnome.

199
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,400
I certainly didn't know their philosophy before I didn't realize they were so delusional.

200
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,240
Sadly, though, as a blind Linux user, who's worked on and off Linux over the past decade,

201
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm pretty much locked to gnome.

202
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,520
This is primarily because of Orca, the gnome screen reader for Linux, which is the only

203
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,120
screen reader for Linux that is not console based and works with the majority of applications.

204
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,960
This therefore means I'll always need gnome no matter what desktop environment I may want

205
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,640
to go with.

206
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,920
There's some like LXDE that do pretty good, but it all really comes down to Orca.

207
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,120
And since Orca is a gnome based product, it generally works the best with gnome based

208
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
applications.

209
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,020
I tried plasma earlier this year because you've spoken so highly of it, but unfortunately

210
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,040
it was inaccessible for me.

211
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,360
Then I found out that much of gnome and even other apps like electron based apps are not

212
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,960
accessible when they're on Wayland.

213
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,480
I'm not quite sure why it is, but it seems like they're supposedly going to be working

214
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
on it.

215
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,160
However, when someone is blind or has a visual impairment who must use a screen reader for

216
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,880
everything to use Linux, I along with the majority of blind Linux users just have to

217
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,720
use gnome or LXDE pretty much exclusively.

218
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,160
I'd love to hear your thoughts about this.

219
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,120
I'm quite sad that gnome has fallen so far because they once used to be a great organization,

220
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,360
but I'm even sadder that I can't switch away.

221
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Ethan.

222
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,600
I'm going to let you go first on this one.

223
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,080
I wish I had something better to say.

224
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,360
This has been an ongoing problem for a really long time, and I know each desktop environment

225
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,040
has their different initiatives, but often I have heard that Orca is the best screen

226
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,980
reader for Linux, and that's a really tricky area because Linux is already so understaffed,

227
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,240
if you will, in the desktop area.

228
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,340
There's really nobody that's handling some of these really hard problems that could be

229
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,680
involved at all the decision-making levels because if you think about, in order to support

230
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,440
something like screen reading top class, you have to be part of the conversation when you're

231
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,840
designing the UI of applications and the system and the control panel applets and all that

232
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
kind of stuff.

233
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,760
You really have to be thinking about it consistently and continuously, and it has to be a member

234
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,200
of the team who's advocating for those things, and that's not how free software development

235
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
works.

236
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,400
It's different people desperately working on different aspects of a code base on their

237
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,240
own, and they don't have a PMO who's making sure that they hit these key results for this

238
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
application.

239
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,840
It's just not how things go, and so I think it's an area where Linux struggles particularly

240
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,400
badly, and it's an opportunity for improvement, and it's an area where commercial desktops

241
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,720
and platforms in general are generally going to be a little more disciplined about that

242
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,980
kind of thing in my experience, and so I appreciated Ethan's perspective on that GNOME conversation

243
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
we were having.

244
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,080
Yeah, I mean, for me, I don't know much about Orca.

245
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,480
I mean, it sounds great, man.

246
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,920
If the screen reader is working for you, that's awesome.

247
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,040
I almost feel like I'm going to have to just pass on this one, only because I have nothing

248
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,360
new to say on GNOME that I haven't already said.

249
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, boy, man.

250
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,620
Here's the thing, too.

251
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,880
The vast majority of our email this week was about this, like...

252
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
Was extremely negative.

253
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Right.

254
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
It was, yeah.

255
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Yeah.

256
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Yeah.

257
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,600
So here's what I did, because we couldn't just do this.

258
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,000
We legitimately could fill three episodes with just the feedback about GNOME.

259
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,400
I am reading it all.

260
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,920
I've grabbed one more for this episode, and then I think what I'll do is I'll read the

261
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,640
others and maybe one other will come on, or I'll just respond to them directly or whatever.

262
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,920
I still want to get people's thoughts.

263
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,320
It helps me inform my position.

264
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,760
Getting people's experiences at a large scale is actually a pretty useful data signal, data

265
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
point for me.

266
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,600
Anyways, Dan comes in with his own GNOME hot take, and this is our last one.

267
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,320
He said, I want to chime in with your discussion for the GNOME desktop, and I 100% agree.

268
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,200
The GNOME developers are building a terrific product for a market that is not there.

269
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,320
I've recently tried out Fedora Silverblue, and the default GNOME experience is pretty

270
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,280
good out of the box, but I always reach a point where things start driving me nuts.

271
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,880
What really annoys me about this, though, is not a new problem.

272
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,040
It's been like this for a decade.

273
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
I have to agree.

274
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,420
GNOME would be a terrific environment if desktop Linux was a thing outside of, like, developers.

275
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,080
I can imagine my grandma using something like Fedora Silverblue or OpenSUSE or MicroOS Desktop

276
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,200
with GNOME 40 after I explained it to her.

277
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,540
But beyond this niche, there's Windows, there's Mac.

278
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,200
They're already solving this problem, and I don't see anyone using a vanilla GNOME install

279
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
at all.

280
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,160
Have a great week, and a successful and quick move to Michael.

281
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,560
Well, thank you for the well wishes, of course.

282
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,840
I have to say, I was pretty blown away by the amount of feedback we got on this one.

283
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,980
I think, you know, we have an audience that's very technical.

284
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,040
They're using these as development workstations in a lot of cases, and that's not the direction

285
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
the project's going in.

286
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,820
So I think that's why it resonated with people so much.

287
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,880
You've already made your peace with it when your backgrounds couldn't be changed anymore.

288
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,960
You made your peace with this, right?

289
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,000
But there's a whole new generation or a whole new wave of GNOME users who saw this blog

290
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,960
post and went, oh, man, they're detached from reality, and they're not building this for

291
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
me.

292
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Like, this confirms it.

293
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
They put it over the top for a lot of people.

294
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,840
You know, I feel like this is one of those topics that's going to seem, and there were

295
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,240
a bunch of them over the years, right?

296
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
We've been doing this forever.

297
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,360
That's going to seem like a really big deal for maybe another six to eight months.

298
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Yeah.

299
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,500
But by mid-2022, let's say this time next year, it's going to resolve itself in one

300
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
of two ways.

301
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,880
And I could give you my prediction if we're going to fry some bacon here.

302
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,640
You have a prediction?

303
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,080
It's kind of an A or B prediction, right?

304
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,880
One of two things is going to happen.

305
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,400
Someone in desktop Linux is going to, quote unquote, resolve these issues, right?

306
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,080
I'm not going to get into the pissing contest of are these real issues.

307
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,720
I think they are.

308
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,160
Other people don't, and I get that.

309
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,360
Or goddamn, those M1s are sexy, and people are going to go back to the Mac.

310
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,840
And when I say people, I mean the people who would listen to this show, right?

311
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,560
The more pragmatic developer audience.

312
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,760
And I know we have a lot of freedom diehards.

313
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
And that's cool.

314
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Great.

315
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,640
You know, I personally, I did accept the KDE challenge.

316
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
I haven't done it yet.

317
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,320
I'll do it probably over the winter break.

318
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Yeah.

319
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Take your time.

320
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Don't rush it.

321
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Right.

322
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,580
So maybe I'll use plasma, and it'll be like, you know, suck off his eyes wide open, right?

323
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,580
By the way.

324
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,640
There you go.

325
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,880
My hot tip for taking on a plasma challenge is, say it's a five-day challenge or a seven-day

326
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,600
challenge, each day adopt a new plasma way of doing something.

327
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,440
Train yourself on something new each day, like maybe how you launch an application or

328
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,040
manage Windows or something.

329
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,000
And that made it a lot smoother for me.

330
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Okay.

331
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,440
Todd wrote in, he summed it up and said, yeah, here's the thing, guys, and you missed this

332
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
point.

333
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,600
Basically, I'm summarizing Todd, but he said, the thing that's going to save Linux, and

334
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,080
it's always the thing that saves Linux.

335
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Server.

336
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Is choice.

337
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,680
Well, yeah, right, but the server.

338
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,780
But the thing that really is going to save the desktop environment is you have choice.

339
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,760
On Mac OS or on Windows, if they may, if Apple makes a bad UI decision or Microsoft makes

340
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,420
a bad UI decision, you're screwed.

341
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,260
But on Linux, you can just switch to a different desktop environment.

342
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,400
And because you have choice, it saves everything.

343
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,240
And I just don't know if I agree with that anymore.

344
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,440
I used to think that way, but now looking at the years of just all of the energy and

345
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,520
developer time being dispersed into all of these different areas and the fragmentation

346
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,320
that it's caused and talking to developers who didn't really know how to even begin to

347
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,520
target the Linux desktop for years now, I don't know if I totally agree with Todd.

348
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,480
I think it is also the thing that saves Linux at the same time, though.

349
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,600
It's both a huge impedance, the fragmentation, and it's also, I think, ultimately, kind of

350
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
an organic savior.

351
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,760
Well, I mean, I think there's a lot of things going on, right?

352
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,240
Like, when I first started out with Linux, way back, you know, when I was listening to

353
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,960
you and Lunduke, when I was, oh, we owe you that, in the early aughts, whatever it was,

354
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:21,240
you know, it was no offense to everybody at Canonical, but Ubuntu was fucking garbage,

355
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
right?

356
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,900
Like, it just was, it was, it was bad.

357
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
I mean, it was-

358
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,760
And early Ubuntu was considered a pretty big step up from standard Linux back then.

359
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Right.

360
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,640
But, you know, if, if Pop OS existed, I mean, maybe I would have still went the way I went

361
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,560
because of, like, you know, my, my kind of breakout thing was iPhone development.

362
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,720
But barring that, I don't know that I ever would have been, like, over to the Mac side.

363
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,440
My point being, it's, it's important to recognize there's been just a ton of progress, right?

364
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,360
I remember fiddling with Wi-Fi drivers and having to, like, ethernet in to download some

365
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,860
stupid script that you had to run or copy pasta something into ETC, whatever.

366
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,280
Now you just have to adjust the power mode so that way your transfer rate's reasonable,

367
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,280
but it connects.

368
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,560
Oh, you're using my own tips against me.

369
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,400
We'll link to that in the show notes.

370
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Wow.

371
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
That was good, right?

372
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,720
And I like how that's broken on, like, most of the laptops that most Linux vendors ship.

373
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Yeah.

374
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Ooh.

375
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Anything that's really used in Ubuntu, right?

376
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,880
Well, because they want to pump their battery life.

377
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,980
So they default to the power.

378
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,880
So for those who don't know, on Twitter, I was having just a bear of a time with my Wi-Fi

379
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,480
speeds and I had my Mac book next to my system 76.

380
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
And this is an, oh, I'm sorry.

381
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Next to my ThinkPad.

382
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,200
Actually all three of them.

383
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,480
And I was getting roughly just shy of double the bit, the I'm talking down, right?

384
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,840
The down bandwidth on the Google speed test and using the same speed test, the same network,

385
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,920
same machines averaging out, doing everything the right mathematical way.

386
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
And it took me forever.

387
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,960
And I started like, you know, you get into this world where you're on the dark side of

388
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,920
the Ubuntu forums that haven't been looked at since like 20, 2015.

389
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,360
You're already, as soon as you see the post date, you're like, oh no, I'm screwed.

390
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,520
And there's like one dude who's like, dude, just going to get them or nano and you sick

391
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
weirdos.

392
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Somebody wrote in about nano.

393
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Hell yeah.

394
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,680
And edit this file.

395
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,800
Change a three to a two, I think is what it was, but you can, it's in my Twitter feed

396
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
somewhere.

397
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Sure.

398
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,480
Change a three to two, save it, restart the machine.

399
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,600
That sounds stupid.

400
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,160
I did it right on par with the Mac.

401
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Now it's faster.

402
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Yeah.

403
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,440
But there's a price.

404
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Battery life went down.

405
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Yes.

406
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Yeah.

407
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
I'm both the think one carbon.

408
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
I'm sorry.

409
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,280
The ThinkPad carbon and the, uh, I, I believe it's the lemur that I have, right?

410
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
That sounds right.

411
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
I always confuse it with the Galileo.

412
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,640
I think it's a lemur.

413
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,340
So I don't know.

414
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,120
Is it to me, I pay a lot for bandwidth.

415
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
I like having bandwidth.

416
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,480
I'm just going to say my M1 Mac can do it without any power savings.

417
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,760
Well, yeah, it's probably doing it dynamically or some, you know, clever thing like that.

418
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,180
I will also know while we're talking about laptops, the framework laptop has started

419
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,240
shipping to customers.

420
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,440
That's that DIY modular and the early reviews decent sounds like it's early days for the

421
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,840
hardware Linux, you know, longer, older Linux's are still not really well supported yet, but

422
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
it's getting there.

423
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
It's getting there.

424
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,520
I may, I may end up, uh, asking for a review unit or see if I can't twist his West's arm

425
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,440
on actually pulling the trigger on purchasing one he's been thinking about.

426
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
We'll see.

427
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
Cause I wanted to see it.

428
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,080
I want to see it to believe it.

429
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,640
I want to see everyone's faces too.

430
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,560
We have two meetups coming up, one in Salt Lake city on August 7th, the other in Denver,

431
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,080
August 20th links to both those meetups will be in the show notes or you can just go to

432
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,040
meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

433
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,960
We have locked in the venues, really great venues for both Salt Lake city and Denver.

434
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,480
I have a box full of swag I'm bringing with me some great art that Linode helped us put

435
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
together.

436
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,840
Their design team created some really great unique stickers just for the road trip.

437
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,040
So if you're in the area and you can make it love, I'd love you to join us.

438
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,360
It'd be great to actually see people again.

439
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,000
It's super, super useful to actually like put faces to names and the whole thing.

440
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,120
Like it's, it's part of the process and we'd love to have you involved, meetup.com slash

441
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,320
Jupiter broadcasting and then like a maniac, I'm going to have a live tracker on me during

442
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,540
the road trip.

443
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,760
So if you're in our route, if it looks like we're going to be in your area, maybe you

444
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
can get ahold of me.

445
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,880
I'll have a form and all of that at colonytracker.live once I'm on the road.

446
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,280
That's all coming up very, very soon.

447
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,300
Linode.com slash coder.

448
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:49,440
Go there and get $100 in credit on your account for a new account, I should say for 60 days

449
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,880
and Linode is our cloud computing provider.

450
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,960
So I think you're going to love them because I've tried them all and Linode's the one I've

451
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
stuck with.

452
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,800
Now they have been around since 2003 so they've been doing this for 18 years and they've really

453
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,920
honed what they have done.

454
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,000
Like they, that's, that's, I love the way they have just stayed focused and made their

455
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,360
platform better and they've made it more price aggressive.

456
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,120
They've made their interface cleaner and you know what Linode does is they, they just upgrade

457
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
you.

458
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,200
They, they just, at the price point you're paying, you get more for it later on.

459
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,440
I've seen that over the last couple of years is it's, they, they invest continually in

460
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,520
their hardware.

461
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,840
They're not just sitting around on their laurels, they're, they're, they're always moving forward.

462
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,460
They're always making the service better and that's one of the things that checks my boxes

463
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
for Linode.

464
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,240
But I think truly you can see in the product when you use something that is as well refined

465
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,160
and focused as Linode's platform is after 18 years, you can see it in there.

466
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,400
They are focusing on just making cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible.

467
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,040
They got started back in 2003 when user mode Linux was landing in the Linux kernel and

468
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,800
some of the people on their team now recognize where it was going and realized there was

469
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,400
an opportunity here to scale out Linux in a way that had never been done on the internet

470
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
before.

471
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,680
All right, this is before AWS started, this is way before Azure started, way before Google

472
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,720
cloud services, Linode had their head in the game and they saw where this was going.

473
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,120
So they built out something that's easy to use and it's powerful.

474
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,380
If you've never deployed a server before, you're going to be fine.

475
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,160
If you've been deploying servers for 20 years, you're going to love what they offer.

476
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,400
And then they have a bunch of services on the back end that I use the hell out of, like

477
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,800
S3 compatible object storage, they have DDoS protection, they have VLAN support, powerful

478
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,420
DNS manager, and of course they have traditional block storage.

479
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,080
If you just want to get like some block storage on a device, I use that sometimes as well.

480
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,320
And they'll plug in with your management platform, so if you're using Terraform or Kubernetes,

481
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
they support all of that.

482
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,840
They have one click application deployments, if none of that's your bag and you just want

483
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,720
to hit something and get started.

484
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,520
And the nice thing about Linode, the other thing, there's another check for one of my

485
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,760
boxes, fantastic performance, very fast, super fast networking between their data centers

486
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,980
with pricing 30 to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers.

487
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,560
And maybe you should also consider a multi-cloud strategy, something that Linode exceeds at.

488
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,880
Check it all out, get started, kick the tires as they say, experiment with it, see what

489
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,780
you can do by going to linode.com slash coder.

490
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:23,560
Use that $100 to test your network out, Linode makes it really simple to deploy iperf and

491
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,840
then just get a real read on your network performance.

492
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,000
Something like that, super simple, there's all kinds of opportunities when you get $100

493
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
in credit.

494
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,280
So go sign up today at linode.com slash coder, get $100 in credit and support the show, linode.com

495
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,360
slash coder.

496
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,980
You've had a busy week and I want to cover a couple of things.

497
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,800
You're doing a giveaway I want to get to, before we get into that, there's a little

498
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,560
bit of hoopla we should probably talk about because it's in our wheelhouse.

499
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:01,120
And it's this takedown of IDOS2 from the Apple App Store and it just is so infuriating,

500
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
it's the worst.

501
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,440
Yeah, I mean, this one really, really, God, this just...

502
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,880
The back and forth, the back and forth with Apple, right?

503
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,040
He's been going back and forth with Apple for years and for a while in a period of time,

504
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,520
he couldn't even update his own app.

505
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,620
Apple like cut him off, then they let him back in September 2020, they let him roll

506
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,360
out a few changes and now, oh, nope, you're all again, you're all again, you're just,

507
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,240
you're violating the app store rules around executing code, you have 14 days or something

508
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,520
like that to fix your app or you're out of here.

509
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:41,560
Yeah, so this guy Choji Lee, I hope I'm saying your first name right, pretty sure L-I-S Lee,

510
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:47,000
has an app called IDOS2, what it does is exactly what it sounds like, it is a very, I think

511
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,040
kind of cute, because it's got like the old DOS, it looks like an old DOS computer, like

512
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,520
the old IBM, whatever.

513
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,840
Yeah, I've got the app, it looks just like that.

514
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,240
I bought it myself, yeah, it looks just like that, that's right, so one, probably the best

515
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,960
marketing he could have ever hoped for, but let's just move on from that.

516
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,640
Yeah, it's sort of like a, I guess a silver lining kind of way, you know, he's been on

517
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,120
the app store since 2014.

518
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, so this app has been around, he's had updates rejected here and there, but basically,

519
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,640
it's exactly what it sounds like, it's a DOS emulator, for lack of a better term, and he

520
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,920
submitted a bug fix update and Apple decided that running DOS code is not okay.

521
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,280
It's too dangerous, it's too dangerous.

522
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,720
They say in their rejection letter, quote, specifically, your app executes IDOS packages

523
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,640
and image files and allows iTunes file sharing and file support for importing games.

524
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,520
Executing code can introduce or change features or functionality of the app and allows for

525
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,800
downloading of content without licensing.

526
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,900
Right, so they're making two arguments, right, it's theoretically insecure, although he goes

527
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,000
to great strains to some of the articles that have been written to explain that he actually

528
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,240
only does anything in the app sandbox, so, you know, it's sandboxed, right?

529
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,040
Right, it seems like Apple would be aware of how their sandbox security model works,

530
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,840
but then again, maybe it doesn't work.

531
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:22,480
There is a licensing issue, I suppose, that I guess someone from 1985 or four could come

532
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,760
back and be like, yo, you got this random thing you packaged up as an IDOS package and

533
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,080
shared with somebody, therefore we're going to sue Mr. Lee, and probably Apple because

534
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,480
lawyers scumbags, but I don't know, man, I mean, OpenMU runs just fine on my Mac.

535
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,600
Well, and you could make the same claim, I shouldn't even say it out loud, with ISH,

536
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,200
which lets you run a Linux environment on an iPad.

537
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Yeah.

538
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,560
And you know what's also really weak about this is that you got 14 days to fix this or

539
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
you're out.

540
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Well, fix this would be to remove the ability to run DOS apps, which is the core function

541
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,640
of the app.

542
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,040
Or I guess you could preload a bunch of like your own DOS apps in the thing, and it's just

543
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,160
like a weird curated DOS museum, right, but that's garbage.

544
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,860
So there's actually another couple takes of this, one, Apple is pushing the iPad Pro as

545
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:23,760
a computer replacement, while executing code is a pretty fundamental goddamn thing that

546
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
pros do at computers.

547
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,640
Yeah, I mean, why else do I have this keyboard and this trackpad and this M1 and these things

548
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
now, right?

549
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,640
Come on.

550
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,100
Also, this is why text editors on Mac generally suck.

551
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:41,160
This is why it's hard to get a good linter that's not doing some insane like cloud stuff.

552
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,960
I'm sorry, not on Mac on iOS on iPad.

553
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,400
This is the problem.

554
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Right here.

555
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,940
This is the problem.

556
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:54,560
Given the sandboxing mechanism and how it works, it ought to be pretty possible to execute

557
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,760
code within a package and keep it relatively secure.

558
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Yeah.

559
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Right.

560
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,440
And I would I would go even further to say that maybe you only you know, you you add

561
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,240
some automated checks, make sure it's staying in package.

562
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,560
Obviously people in the past have done things to avoid app review and cheating with the

563
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,600
automated checks, but whatever.

564
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Honestly, some of this falls down on the OS like have a security model where only allowed

565
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
things can execute.

566
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,800
I just I mean, there's se Linux, this can manage something like this.

567
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,860
I mean, at certain points, I find like I find that two things here.

568
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,120
It's like they don't trust their own sandbox.

569
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,760
And two, shouldn't their OS be robust enough to handle something like this?

570
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,160
Well, is it they don't trust their own sandbox or, you know, over the years, we've had these

571
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
stories all time.

572
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:50,360
I'm starting to think, are they afraid of the iPad in particular, somehow eclipsing

573
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
the Mac?

574
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
Right.

575
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,360
These restrictions.

576
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,040
I mean, some of them are they want their 30% cut, right?

577
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,720
That's, you know, pretty, pretty common.

578
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,440
This one just feels like, like, I understand they have a general principle about executing

579
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
code.

580
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,460
But there's also like the specific case of this dude has a little DOS emulator.

581
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,360
What the hell is gonna happen?

582
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,360
Right.

583
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,480
And as far as the license content argument goes, I mean, Safari can download unlicensed

584
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,920
content, Chrome can, can download mail dot app could download unlicensed content.

585
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,560
I mean, it's it's a bogus argument.

586
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,200
Well, also, DMCA exists.

587
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,080
I mean, I'm a rinky dink developer, and I had my old app code journal pirated, and I

588
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,800
had to take down on it.

589
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,160
Yeah, I remember that.

590
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,280
Why is this different?

591
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
I just don't get the logic.

592
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,480
Well, so to your point about Apple trying to, like, prevent the iPad from stealing MacBook

593
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,640
sales.

594
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Apple's kind of famous.

595
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,880
I mean, I don't know if it's true in all cases, maybe things have shifted, but aren't they

596
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,560
they're famous for cannibalizing one product line to sell another product line.

597
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,240
They cannibalized iPod to sell iPhones.

598
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
For more money.

599
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Yeah.

600
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,480
Well, that's the big difference here.

601
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
That is right.

602
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
I mean, you got to figure a MacBook.

603
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,120
I mean, a MacBook starts at the high end of an iPad price, right?

604
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,560
And now they're making them basically out of the same components.

605
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,800
It's just one's got a metal case and one has less case.

606
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,440
But remember one has an expensive touchscreen with the feedback for the pencil.

607
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,040
I mean, in your mind, what is the logic behind this kind of rule?

608
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,880
Well, there is the original mindset that Apple wanted to treat this thing like an appliance,

609
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,160
like a console.

610
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,720
And so they have a very specific idea of what can and can't be done on it.

611
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,200
And because of the security issues, and because of this idea, this thought model they have

612
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,840
about what the iPad is and what iOS devices are, they may have just reflexively acted.

613
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:55,000
But what seems so strange is the way App Review didn't have an issue with this core functionality

614
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,880
since September 2020, when they've allowed the developer to resume updating it.

615
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,280
It's not like he just added the ability to execute applications.

616
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:10,040
And when you see these kind of shifts all of a sudden, one on its own doesn't tell you

617
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
much.

618
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,360
But we have seen shifts in Apple policy, I think you'll recall like around the hey email

619
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,080
day, we saw Apple lean heavy on how people did subscriptions and made sure Apple got

620
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,080
their cut.

621
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:27,880
It was like a new initiative that was being pushed by Apple leadership via App Store Review.

622
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,400
And you don't really know if that's what we're going through right now until you start to

623
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,120
see several of them happen.

624
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,560
I mean, maybe ISH gets their door knocked on next.

625
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
I hope not.

626
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
God bless.

627
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
I hope not.

628
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
That's such a good project.

629
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,280
Well, no, but that's actually a great point, right?

630
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:48,720
Because Apple, they like to, when they want to hit somebody big, they usually go after

631
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,080
somebody a bunch of small people and say, well, we're consistent.

632
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,160
Look at these 20 other apps.

633
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,480
We did take we did not take downs, but we did rejections for right.

634
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
They're building.

635
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
They're building to something.

636
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
They're building the case.

637
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Right.

638
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,960
Because what was one of Fortnite's sorry, Epic Games defense?

639
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Because of Fortnite.

640
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,920
Well, look at all these other apps that you're ignoring the rules from.

641
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
What did Apple do?

642
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Start taking them down.

643
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Right.

644
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
Yeah.

645
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
Yeah.

646
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,600
So also, we have we don't want to go too much into this, but from the epic lawsuit, we

647
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,080
have the emails that were put into discovery.

648
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,720
Where right from the jump in like 2010, Apple was thinking about the app store as a mechanism

649
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,600
to leverage value out of developers and to control their platform.

650
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,800
And that control has made a good product.

651
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,880
It really has.

652
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,380
And a ton of money.

653
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,460
But the technology hasn't stood still.

654
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,160
And they have to update the way they treat these things and their policy around software

655
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,120
on these as the capabilities of these machines becomes truly PC level.

656
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Well, do they have to?

657
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
No.

658
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,520
I mean, unless somebody makes them how they have what I mean, Mr. Lee for for all the

659
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,720
positive press he's getting.

660
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,400
The best case for him is he makes some negotiated solution with Apple and he's still gonna his

661
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,880
app is still going to be slightly, you know, disabled or gamed.

662
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,040
If I were him, I would be selling my core technology to some old famous dos games company,

663
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,200
you know, and getting them to use it as a runtime to prepackage up like five other games.

664
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,280
That's a great line of business for something like this, right?

665
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,440
You sell it as a B2B product.

666
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,360
Play Apple's game and make more money.

667
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,000
I mean, even hey, they ended up like they claim they won, but I don't know, they ended

668
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,720
up kind of having to compromise, right?

669
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,360
Like they didn't get what they wanted.

670
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,240
People do crazy stuff for what to get into Walmart to get to get their product on the

671
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
shelf of Walmart.

672
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,760
They'll make crazy sacrifices.

673
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,760
So maybe it's worth it for some I feel like as a company who is building a technology

674
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,520
product, they should care about technology.

675
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,820
And if you care about technology, then limiting what these machines can do in this way artificially

676
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:55,200
when you're putting 16 gigs of RAM and an M1 processor in there, just it feels negligent.

677
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,400
It feels like you don't care about the technology, really.

678
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,800
You just, you know, you're doing it to do it, I guess.

679
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,600
I just don't get that sense from all of Apple.

680
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm sure that could be true at some levels of leadership.

681
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,560
But I think they would say they care about the users and they're protecting the users.

682
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,400
But in the darkest corners of their private management meetings, they also care about

683
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
the 30 percent.

684
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,280
And when you when you get to be their size, you don't get bigger by cutting the ways you

685
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
make money out.

686
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,440
Like, you don't get bigger by cutting back revenue.

687
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,060
And they need every penny they can if they want to be because Wall Street always wants

688
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,060
them to be growing.

689
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,060
Right.

690
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,860
And for the last few years, we were speculating on what that services revenue chunk that was

691
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,840
growing and growing and growing was, right?

692
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,000
Could it possibly be iCloud?

693
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,120
Well, the Epic lawsuit once again showed us, no, they consider the App Store revenues like

694
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,840
the third part of services.

695
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,640
This like the biggest piece.

696
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,920
Yep, that's it.

697
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,080
I mean, once you understand that little piece of it, a lot of it starts to make sense, I

698
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
think.

699
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,720
And and then it's just like, how much are they willing to sacrifice to not get their

700
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,240
heads chopped off over it?

701
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,740
They got to find that line.

702
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,120
And I think there's like I feel like sometimes a mandate comes down from upstairs that says,

703
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,100
all right, start enforcing this.

704
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,480
If you see an app that comes through that does this, let us know.

705
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,580
And, you know, maybe he's maybe he's the right size.

706
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:14,320
So he's the first one, or maybe he just happens to be submitting at the wrong time when this

707
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,000
new policy is in effect.

708
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Probably both.

709
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Right.

710
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
He wrong time.

711
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,560
But he has enough of a following that he could get attention.

712
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,880
I'm sure if we cast our net wide, this is going on with a bunch of other developers

713
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,240
who can't get a Verge article or a MacRumors article.

714
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
Right.

715
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,240
That's how it works.

716
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,240
Right.

717
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
So.

718
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,240
Yeah.

719
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
Yeah.

720
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
All right.

721
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
Well, hey, let's talk about something fun.

722
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
Sure.

723
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,240
You're giving away another computer.

724
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Not just a computer, Chris.

725
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,660
It's just a computer Thalia, as always.

726
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,960
This is the first time I don't have the contest fully formed, but I figured I'd give the

727
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,320
code radio folks a pre announcement.

728
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,920
So I missed Earth Day this year.

729
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,760
So I'm doing something for back to school end of the year, probably shipping around

730
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,400
Thanksgiving something false.

731
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Same deal as always.

732
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,900
You got to be a U.S. middle school or high school student.

733
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,920
And you know, your your submissions and I'm going to write this all up and we'll link

734
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,280
it in next week's show.

735
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,760
But your submission has to be public on GitHub and the winner will get a I actually already

736
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
have the Thalia.

737
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:20,320
It is a black Thalia with a 12 gig NVIDIA chip and I think 64 gigs of RAM and it rise.

738
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,760
Of course, because I don't I don't do until when I don't have to.

739
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,280
That is a heck of a giveaway.

740
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Really?

741
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
Yes, really.

742
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
So we'll have a link soon.

743
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,280
It's also there's some info on Mike's Twitter feed as well.

744
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,360
Yeah, well, could you imagine as a being a student going to get a machine like that?

745
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,280
Oh, that's going to be cool.

746
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
All right.

747
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,200
So let's talk about your your adventures coding on the train.

748
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,680
So you got on the Amtrak for better for worse and you had work to get done.

749
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
I assume.

750
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,280
How did all this go?

751
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,840
What did you bring with you?

752
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,960
Was it a horrible mistake?

753
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,600
So I had to take the Amtrak, the old train, which for those who don't know is a train

754
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,760
where you can drive your car on or you can load your car onto it.

755
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,760
And then you get in the train.

756
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,960
Unfortunately, there was some sort of accident and the train was wildly delayed about five

757
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,280
or six hours.

758
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Like a train accident?

759
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,620
No, there was a storm and they were saying some kind of just like crap fell on the tracks

760
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,460
and it delayed another train.

761
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,240
So I mean, this is way inside baseball, but I learned a lot about how Amtrak works.

762
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,800
Amtrak does not own the railroad line.

763
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,200
Amtrak is not, in fact, the federal government.

764
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:33,600
They lease the lines from a company called in this case, CTX truck, CTX rail or something.

765
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,160
What happens is when there's an accident, either a train accident, you know, suicide,

766
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,040
God forbid, or in this case, a weather related problem.

767
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,760
The owner of the line, the freight train company, CTX, or there's different ones, right, for

768
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:52,860
different lines, prioritizes their trains that go very slow.

769
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,200
Amtrak gets last bid most of the time.

770
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,700
Because it's just what it's just the it's just the people.

771
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,520
It's just the just the middle class who cares about them.

772
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,000
With the exception of like the Acela line, which is the fancy, you know, New York to

773
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,200
D.C. to Boston line, which this was not Amtrak basically does not make money.

774
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
The Acela line does.

775
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,240
The Northeast Corridor does.

776
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,060
This line, the auto train is arguable.

777
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:25,800
So there was a lot of just like sitting in the train and I had work to do.

778
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,360
So with me, I had my M1 MacBook Air.

779
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,040
My Verizon, whatever they call it, 5G.

780
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:39,120
Don't call it ISIS because they used to call it that hotspot thing.

781
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,760
And an iPad.

782
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
And let me tell you something.

783
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,240
Did you bring charging cables with you?

784
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
I did.

785
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
I know.

786
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
OK.

787
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
All right.

788
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
All right.

789
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Goddamn lie.

790
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,440
Oh, 5G truth are here, everybody.

791
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
What happened?

792
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,120
It worked fine in Florida.

793
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:03,280
We hit South Carolina and North Carolina basically didn't work.

794
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,660
And it was down to LTE, but really spotty LTE.

795
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:12,120
So at that point, Zoom calls became impossible.

796
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:17,440
And I was having like get remote hung up, timed out stuff going on.

797
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:24,560
You get further up north, the train runs from Sanford, Florida to Lorton, Virginia, I believe.

798
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,040
Virginia, everything works again because you're close to D.C., right?

799
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,720
And of course, the closer you are to the FCC headquarters, the better your wireless signal

800
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,360
is going to be in a very general kind of way.

801
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:44,440
So I cannot express how disappointed I am in this rather expensive, unlimited 5G thing

802
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:51,680
that looks like a brick, like an actual brick that I bought from Verizon, because I don't

803
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,160
know where people are talking about the race to 5G or, you know, getting rid of home Internet

804
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,240
and just 5Ging it up.

805
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,200
That is just not like this was for me.

806
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,940
This was like, all right, I got this business line with 5G.

807
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,940
It's unlimited.

808
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,080
I'm going to see what I can do.

809
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,000
And it just it wasn't like a throttling issue.

810
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,440
It was a coverage issue.

811
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,760
Yeah, it's really disappointing, huh?

812
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:19,320
It's weird what I have over here on the West Coast is I'll be driving around in this backwoods

813
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:29,040
rural area that is two and a half, three hours from Seattle, and I'll have screaming 5G coverage,

814
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,040
screamer 5G.

815
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,400
And then I get into downtown.

816
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
I got nothing.

817
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,540
And like, I get into city towns, like small towns up north of Seattle, nothing.

818
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:41,580
You get out into the into like the rural areas, 5G again.

819
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,960
That's been very frustrating for me.

820
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,880
It's not widely deployed.

821
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
I'm sorry.

822
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
I was crying a little bit.

823
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,520
Yeah, well, I couldn't even get LTE for half the trip.

824
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,400
Yeah, that just sounds like you didn't have coverage at all.

825
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,000
I've just built my whole setup in the RV around LTE at this point.

826
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,720
But I've got Verizon, AT&T, and I've got through Ting, I've got a couple of other networks

827
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,720
that are backup networks.

828
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,720
Well, so that's the thing.

829
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,880
I was relying on one network, right?

830
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:14,840
So maybe if I had an AT&T or a T-Mobile SIM, I might have gotten lucky.

831
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,920
That's generally your best route in the US, Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile.

832
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,340
But it's very expensive to do that.

833
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,280
In the moment, it feels so worth it, though.

834
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,000
But then when you're sitting here and you're not actually out and about, it's a big chunk

835
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,960
of change to be paying for data.

836
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
It is.

837
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,200
But there is a hero of this journey.

838
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,360
Oh, yeah?

839
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,400
The M1 MacBook Air, baby.

840
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,080
How am I not surprised?

841
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,600
That battery life, right?

842
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,160
Battery life plus performance.

843
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,920
As long as I didn't have to hit a network, I was in good shape.

844
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,560
I was wondering if you would be screwed since you get on the train, you're expecting it

845
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,840
to be X amount of hours, delays, delays, delays make it a lot longer.

846
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,820
I was wondering if battery life was going to be a problem, but also did you end up just

847
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:05,320
having to eat all of their prepackaged sandwich food type stuff?

848
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,480
Absolutely not, because I was fasting.

849
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,640
I would rather not eat.

850
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,360
Yeah, I hate the train food.

851
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
It's such a bummer.

852
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,920
Fasting on the train is a brilliant idea.

853
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,560
Then you just avoid the temptation.

854
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,560
That's what I do.

855
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:23,560
I drink tea and I had a tonic, not a gin and tonic, for the listeners, jumped out by the

856
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,880
but tonic because there's sugar in it and it fills you up.

857
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,200
It also settles your stomach for when you don't eat and you feel nauseous.

858
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,160
You're going to be beating the ladies off with a stick when you get to Jersey.

859
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,520
You're going to come back with that Florida glow plus that fasting slimness.

860
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,840
You're going to be beating them off with a stick.

861
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840
You're not going to know what to do.

862
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,120
I already got one.

863
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,520
I'm fast like the M1.

864
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,440
She better prepare for competition, that's what I'm saying.

865
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:54,320
So next time, flight, flying up, you guys get there, you're done.

866
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,480
You're not going back anymore after that.

867
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,540
Not for any long periods of time.

868
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,140
We still have the server facility in plant city, so I'll be back maybe once a quarter

869
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,120
for like two or three nights.

870
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Yeah.

871
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,120
Wow.

872
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,120
That's huge, though, man.

873
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,600
Oh, man.

874
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,440
The bulk of stuff is moved now then, or is that getting still in transit?

875
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,440
Like how's that working?

876
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,000
Like the big the big items.

877
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,400
So this is, again, a little inside baseball for folks who do the Amtrak auto train.

878
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,640
I loaded most of the expensive equipment for for the Mad Botter in my car that then went

879
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,720
on the train.

880
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,160
So that is up there.

881
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
That's so nice.

882
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,720
We don't have that on the West Coast, though.

883
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,960
There is no equivalent.

884
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,960
I don't think so.

885
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,480
No, I've never seen one.

886
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,000
So I don't have a space for it yet.

887
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,400
So it's just sitting in the in the townhouse I'm going to be living in.

888
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,360
But I like personal effects, clothes, the kids toys are all going to I have movers,

889
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,520
they're going to like deliver it, whatever.

890
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,520
That's good.

891
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,520
Good for you.

892
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,520
Like the iMac Pro is up there.

893
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,040
The thick couple Thalios are up there.

894
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,240
I now have the joy of trying to find a space to work out of or where I have this whole

895
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,800
thing of like, do I finish a basement to make a working space?

896
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
I don't know.

897
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
That's a job, too.

898
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,120
That's a whole other set of projects.

899
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,720
Yeah, there's all kinds of weird fun coming up in Koda radio with mics.

900
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,600
Oh, my God, I'm back in Jersey and I I had to remember how to drive in New Jersey.

901
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,600
Oh, yeah.

902
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
Yeah.

903
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,600
Yeah.

904
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,800
It's like that when I come back to Seattle when I'm on a road trip, I have to change

905
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,960
how I drive because people here cannot drive.

906
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,640
People there can drive, but you got to dial up the aggression like 50 points.

907
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,680
Yeah, I will be in studio for next week's episode.

908
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,600
And then after that, for a few weeks, I'll be on the road doing the show was everything

909
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,400
still planned as normal, but I'll just be doing it from the road.

910
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,160
So that should be nice and crazy and wild.

911
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm actually freaking out today.

912
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,920
Today's the day because it's like, oh, it's just one week away and then I'm pretty much

913
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,040
hitting the road.

914
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,000
And that's really soon.

915
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Life is always just a series of projects, isn't it?

916
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,280
Like you're going through a bunch of projects right now.

917
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,800
I'm going through a bunch of projects and sometimes they're personal projects, sometimes

918
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,880
they're work projects.

919
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,920
Usually it's all at the same time.

920
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,920
That's it.

921
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,000
So good luck to you.

922
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,100
And don't forget everyone to join us next week.

923
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:10,760
If you want to join us live, you can join us at one p.m. Eastern, 10 a.m. Pacific or

924
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,640
just get subscribed at Koda dot show slash subscribe and get the show and it's a regular

925
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,640
time.

926
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,040
It's perfect when you get it because we're just recording a few hours earlier.

927
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,160
If you're not a Coder QA member yet, Coder QA dot co, go get a membership going, support

928
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:31,040
the show, get a limited ad feed and also a brand new Coderly is out perfectly on theme.

929
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,320
So it's posted to the members area for direct download.

930
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,220
If you're a member, you can just go log in and grab it.

931
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:39,320
Or if you're already subscribed to the limited ad feed, I just added it to that feed.

932
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,200
So it just shows up in your podcatcher.

933
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,880
And if you're not a member yet, Coder QA dot co, you get access to all previous Coderlys,

934
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,120
which we do once a quarter.

935
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,520
Go find Mr. Dominic on Twitter.

936
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,520
He's at Dumanuku.

937
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,920
His company is at the Mad Potter Inc.

938
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,160
Is there anything else you want to mention before we get out of here, Mr. Dominic?

939
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,160
Nope.

940
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Just see you guys back in Jersey.

941
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,160
All right.

942
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,160
Well, you can follow me.

943
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,200
I'm over there at Chris LAS.

944
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,540
The network is at Jupiter Signal and the podcast is at Coder Radio Show.

945
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:11,360
That's a great way to get like show announcements, news, release information, those accounts

946
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,360
will do.

947
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,800
Links to what we talked about today, that's going to be at Coder dot show slash four to

948
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,800
four.

949
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,920
You'll also find our contact form.

950
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,720
Your emails are a big part of our show.

951
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,240
They'll also get the RSS feeds over there and all that good stuff.

952
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,640
That's at Coder dot show.

953
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:31,960
And join us live next week, 1 p.m. Eastern, 10 a.m. Pacific at jblive.tv.
