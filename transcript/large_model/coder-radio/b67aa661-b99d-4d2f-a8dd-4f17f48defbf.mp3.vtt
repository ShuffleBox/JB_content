00:00.000 --> 00:15.600
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 488 for October 17th, 2022.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.960
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.960 --> 00:24.680
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.680 --> 00:29.520
My name is Chris, and joining us every single week, and I smell a little Linux, it's our

00:29.520 --> 00:30.760
host, Mr. Dominic.

00:30.760 --> 00:31.760
Hello Mike.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.720
You will all be assimilated into TUX.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.520
So you're still, are you on the Thaleo still?

00:36.520 --> 00:39.200
I'm on the Thaleo right now, yep.

00:39.200 --> 00:43.560
You know, I can tell, I can almost tell there's a slight sound, it's not bad, there's just

00:43.560 --> 00:45.040
a difference.

00:45.040 --> 00:49.280
It's actually a step up in quality, so I like it, but it doesn't make any difference because

00:49.280 --> 00:50.880
you record locally also.

00:50.880 --> 00:55.280
But I can tell now when you're on the Mac, usually, or when you're on the Linux box just

00:55.280 --> 00:57.320
by the sound of the remote connection, how about that?

00:57.320 --> 00:58.320
Really?

00:58.320 --> 01:03.440
It's a little, just a little slightly different, slightly different, but it's sticking it sounds

01:03.440 --> 01:04.440
like.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.440
Yeah, it's sticking.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.760
You know, you never know, Apple could release a shiny tablet, you know how I am, but it's

01:09.760 --> 01:13.480
been Thaleo and Dev1 exclusively for a while.

01:13.480 --> 01:17.680
I am packing up my Thaleo and sending it back because I just have the review unit.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.000
It's a little sad, it's a little sad.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.320
I think if I were to build my perfect Thaleo, I talked about this on Love this week, I think

01:26.320 --> 01:30.360
I might actually, although I love the Ryzen system, I might actually go for an all Intel

01:30.360 --> 01:40.040
box, Intel 12th Gen i7 and these new Intel Arc GPUs that are actual hardware dedicated

01:40.040 --> 01:42.200
GPUs that you plug into a PCI slot.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.680
Have you seen these?

01:44.680 --> 01:50.880
They basically iterated on their integrated GPU, they've made it way more powerful, it's

01:50.880 --> 01:55.320
the same open source graphic stack, it's based on the same open source code, so it's fully,

01:55.320 --> 02:00.640
if you have Linux 6.0 and the latest Mesa, you just plug this thing in, you've got 100%

02:00.640 --> 02:05.960
Linux compatibility, you don't have to do anything else other than just plug it in.

02:05.960 --> 02:06.960
And it's gameable.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.720
I don't know if I'd compare it to a high end Nvidia or Ryzen, or I mean AMD, but it is

02:11.720 --> 02:12.720
gameable.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.280
It's a new era.

02:14.280 --> 02:21.280
And like the mid-level one, it's like $280, it's not bad when, you know, the new Nvidia

02:21.280 --> 02:24.440
stuff is $600 up, so I'm excited about that.

02:24.440 --> 02:28.200
I think they're gonna make for some really great workstations, because you gotta give

02:28.200 --> 02:30.200
it this, that Intel stuff is rock solid.

02:30.200 --> 02:34.640
An all Intel system, you know, maybe it's not the absolute edge cutting performance

02:34.640 --> 02:39.000
thing, but you know, the 12th Gen's are pretty good, and you just get, with Linux, you just

02:39.000 --> 02:42.200
get absolute rock solid stability.

02:42.200 --> 02:48.320
You combine that stack with something like ECC RAM, oh baby, oh, Crash would be a thing

02:48.320 --> 02:50.840
of the past, no doubt about it, no doubt about it.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.120
So yeah, it's a little sad to send it back, but I'm gonna box it up and then I'm gonna

02:54.120 --> 02:55.120
think on it.

02:55.120 --> 03:01.160
I may end up replacing my OBS machine with an all Intel Thalio, that may be my route

03:01.160 --> 03:02.160
I go.

03:02.160 --> 03:06.600
You're all Intel, I'm all AMD, it's like a civil war.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.520
So would that make, yeah, I guess that would be I'm team blue, you're team red, something

03:09.520 --> 03:10.520
like that.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.520
I don't know.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.520
Привет, comrades.

03:12.520 --> 03:19.560
All right, so Sean asked for our thoughts on something going up in Canada right now.

03:19.560 --> 03:24.760
And the term software engineer is under attack, an Alberta regulator says.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.100
Calm down, Jordan Peterson.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.100
You can't do this every time.

03:27.100 --> 03:30.040
I know, it's gotta be, it must have been Peterson.

03:30.040 --> 03:34.880
An Alberta regulator says, no, you can't just go around, slap an engineer at the end of

03:34.880 --> 03:37.600
a developer's title and make them an engineer.

03:37.600 --> 03:44.160
In order to be a, quote, software engineer, they must hold a permit and they must pay

03:44.160 --> 03:47.080
fees for that right.

03:47.080 --> 03:51.080
This is coming, I think this was started by the Association of Professional Engineers

03:51.080 --> 03:55.580
and Geoscientists of Alberta, APEGA for short.

03:55.580 --> 04:00.760
They asked the court to order one of the province's leading software companies known as Jobber

04:00.760 --> 04:05.720
to stop using the term engineer in job titles and postings unless they get a permit from

04:05.720 --> 04:06.900
the regulator.

04:06.900 --> 04:12.960
And over in Quebec, they've successfully sued Microsoft in the early aughts to stop

04:12.960 --> 04:17.480
them from calling their graduates of the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineers, engineers.

04:17.480 --> 04:19.560
They can't use it.

04:19.560 --> 04:23.680
And they gave them a thousand dollar fine, maybe, I don't know if it was per person or

04:23.680 --> 04:26.360
in total, pretty minor fee.

04:26.360 --> 04:31.680
But they cannot use the term software engineer without actually being an engineer and then

04:31.680 --> 04:35.380
getting licensed and paying a fee.

04:35.380 --> 04:39.600
And this is, I guess, happening in Alberta and over in Quebec.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.160
And I think there is some truth to this.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.960
I mean, I hate to be this guy, but...

04:44.960 --> 04:46.360
Okay, be this guy.

04:46.360 --> 04:51.680
I have participated in the watering down of the term engineer.

04:51.680 --> 04:55.880
You know, I think we had people when I was at Linux Academy on my department's team that

04:55.880 --> 04:56.880
were like...

04:56.880 --> 04:57.880
Audio engineer?

04:57.880 --> 04:58.880
Yeah, I knew you were going to go there.

04:58.880 --> 05:04.020
Audio engineer, podcast content engineer, you know, that kind of stuff.

05:04.020 --> 05:08.040
And I've also seen it really abused, like, you know, somebody goes and takes a couple

05:08.040 --> 05:12.720
of basic Microsoft certifications and I don't mean to demean it because they're part of

05:12.720 --> 05:13.720
building a career.

05:13.720 --> 05:17.720
But, you know, Microsoft starts throwing around the term engineer pretty much out of the gate

05:17.720 --> 05:22.340
if you learn how to manage a Windows box and now you're an engineer and you're certified

05:22.340 --> 05:24.520
by Microsoft as such.

05:24.520 --> 05:30.480
So I think it has been watered down, I think in part, maybe to help with wages, you know,

05:30.480 --> 05:34.920
to help justify high tech wages and things like that.

05:34.920 --> 05:38.720
But I'm curious, do you consider developers engineers and should we be able to use this

05:38.720 --> 05:42.820
term without big Govy coming down and demanding fines?

05:42.820 --> 05:47.560
So I went back when I saw you put this in the show notes.

05:47.560 --> 05:51.480
We have literally covered, not this exact case, because, of course, the Tim Hortons

05:51.480 --> 05:56.760
shrinkers decided to, I guess, they don't have a First Amendment per se, right?

05:56.760 --> 06:01.200
So if you really want to hear all about this, listen to old Jordan Peterson, but I would

06:01.200 --> 06:05.480
caution you on the newer stuff, something weird happened to him.

06:05.480 --> 06:06.760
You know, he spent some time in Russia.

06:06.760 --> 06:07.760
Yeah.

06:07.760 --> 06:08.760
Yeah.

06:08.760 --> 06:09.760
I don't know what happened.

06:09.760 --> 06:10.760
He came back a little different.

06:10.760 --> 06:11.760
A little bit.

06:11.760 --> 06:17.440
I mean, I know some would argue he was always like that, but yeah.

06:17.440 --> 06:20.560
We've actually covered this topic several times because there was a bunch of prominent.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.560
Really?

06:21.560 --> 06:22.560
Yeah.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.560
Am I that old?

06:23.560 --> 06:24.560
Wow.

06:24.560 --> 06:29.560
Not this exact case, but there is a very prominent, particularly in the kind of older engineering

06:29.560 --> 06:34.120
developer, I should say, community, that was suggesting that there should be some kind

06:34.120 --> 06:35.120
of exam.

06:35.120 --> 06:39.560
Way, way, way, are you ready for this?

06:39.560 --> 06:43.400
2013, we were talking about this.

06:43.400 --> 06:48.480
And one of the very prominent.NET developers in that community was hinting that there should

06:48.480 --> 06:53.560
be, you know, this is a person who's big into, like, agile certifications and stuff like

06:53.560 --> 06:54.560
that.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.560
Okay.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.540
And you and I both took a giant dump on it.

06:57.540 --> 07:00.720
You know, maybe I've changed my mind over the years then.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.920
I'm going to say, I think we've both kind of changed our mind because I think there's

07:03.920 --> 07:06.280
the big difference is age.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.640
I think this is one of those things.

07:08.640 --> 07:09.760
You know what?

07:09.760 --> 07:14.100
Let's talk about a prominent software engineer, Tucker Carlson, for a moment.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.760
Everyone is familiar with his software engineering prowess.

07:17.760 --> 07:23.140
But I was reminded, thanks, weirdly enough too, as of Reclined's podcast, that early

07:23.140 --> 07:28.080
Tucker Carlson was a hilarious liberal, not liberal, Libertarian party boy.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.080
Okay.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.080
Okay.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.040
I kind of remember him on that Crossfire show with his little bow tie.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.040
Yeah.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.120
Well, even before that, he was on MSNBC and he was like, I want to have like three girls.

07:37.120 --> 07:41.120
He's like, let's drinks and girls, baby, all day long.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.920
And now he's like, you know, the family, blah, blah, blah.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.440
I don't like you, whatever, conservative stuff.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.440
It's just age.

07:48.440 --> 07:49.440
Right?

07:49.440 --> 07:52.960
You and I were like, we were pretty hardcore on, I mean, Alex, I'm sure we'll find it.

07:52.960 --> 07:58.480
We were pretty hardcore against this idea to like, I think some of that on my part was

07:58.480 --> 08:00.960
straight up fear, right?

08:00.960 --> 08:05.400
Like that I could just simply be disqualified out of my own business if they passed a law

08:05.400 --> 08:07.320
that said you had to have the credentials.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.320
Sure.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.320
Yeah.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.160
I'm going to have an actual nuanced take for once.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.640
So part of this is just like Canada is not America, right?

08:14.640 --> 08:18.480
In America, this lawsuit could never really happen because first amendment, you can say

08:18.480 --> 08:22.040
whatever the hell you want, unless you say it on Twitter and then they will shut down

08:22.040 --> 08:23.040
your business.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.420
But that's not the government.

08:24.420 --> 08:27.000
That's just yay.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.800
I don't think this matters as much as people want it to matter.

08:31.800 --> 08:40.360
I understand why to a certain mindset saying you're an engineer might sound better.

08:40.360 --> 08:49.160
I would even avoid the title altogether because if you look at the salary wages right now,

08:49.160 --> 08:54.800
people are hiring developers, engineers, coders, code monkeys, JavaScript ninjas, if you're

08:54.800 --> 08:59.080
doing node apparently, and they're paying, right?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.800
There are also tons of layoffs happening.

09:00.800 --> 09:08.800
So we're in this weird transition state, but this is a fight that I understand why if you're

09:08.800 --> 09:14.440
maybe super early or just like getting to that intermediate stage and things that you

09:14.440 --> 09:21.960
feel a visceral like, well, don't screw me over reaction to, but it really doesn't matter.

09:21.960 --> 09:26.720
Your salary is not going to be different if you're working at Dark Matter Dev Inc. and

09:26.720 --> 09:32.000
your software engineer level two, or your software developer level two, or your code

09:32.000 --> 09:35.600
monkey Jabberwocky level two, they're going to pay you the same because they have to compete

09:35.600 --> 09:36.600
with everybody else.

09:36.600 --> 09:40.760
Now, this might matter for things like Microsoft certification, right?

09:40.760 --> 09:44.560
What is it, MCSE, Microsoft Certified Software Engineer, isn't that?

09:44.560 --> 09:46.360
Yeah, there's a few of them, but that's one of them.

09:46.360 --> 09:47.360
Yeah.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.760
That might be problematic in good old Canada.

09:49.760 --> 09:50.760
I don't know.

09:50.760 --> 09:51.760
I'm not Canadian.

09:51.760 --> 09:52.800
I don't know how the law works.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.520
I'm not a lawyer nor Canadian nor am I a Canadian lawyer.

09:56.520 --> 10:00.600
I have a friend who's a traffic engineer and she's always like dunking on me that coders

10:00.600 --> 10:05.240
aren't engineers, sure, but it's getting close, right?

10:05.240 --> 10:09.520
I think the question you really want to ask is should they be, right?

10:09.520 --> 10:15.760
Should there be some type of software development that you actually have to acquire and maintain

10:15.760 --> 10:18.560
a engineering license for?

10:18.560 --> 10:22.000
And if so, what is that process like?

10:22.000 --> 10:28.920
Is it like a CPA license or like an engineering license, right?

10:28.920 --> 10:31.880
You have to take ongoing classes every couple of years.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.440
You have to, you know, requalify.

10:34.440 --> 10:40.840
I don't know, that gets real messy and real tough because we're not, you know, just think

10:40.840 --> 10:45.720
of like the 20 JavaScript frameworks that have been released since we started the show

10:45.720 --> 10:47.640
15 minutes ago.

10:47.640 --> 10:51.160
How the hell do you properly license people?

10:51.160 --> 10:52.160
Or is it more abstract?

10:52.160 --> 10:57.920
Okay, well then we go the thing that I hate, the low-level algorithms and design patterns

10:57.920 --> 11:04.240
trivia test where it's, all right, man, we have this set of data and I want you to, here's

11:04.240 --> 11:09.280
10 sorting algorithms, pick the fastest one, okay.

11:09.280 --> 11:13.100
It's still stupid, still impractical because it usually doesn't matter.

11:13.100 --> 11:16.400
When I say usually one out of like 10 million times.

11:16.400 --> 11:22.320
And we're already, I think, this is one case where shocking, Mike thinks the free market

11:22.320 --> 11:23.320
works, right?

11:23.320 --> 11:28.040
I think the market has worked in that, you know, Google needs those dudes and the way

11:28.040 --> 11:33.580
Google does it is they make their interview process an incredibly arduous, painful, somewhat

11:33.580 --> 11:36.680
maybe overboard experience.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.360
I think you could argue too, they're paying an engineer's salary over there.

11:39.360 --> 11:43.040
And they're paying it, right, and they're paying, well, it's, although not all engineers

11:43.040 --> 11:44.360
make that much money, right?

11:44.360 --> 11:48.960
So it's, I think the money argument's a little weaker, but we're already doing it.

11:48.960 --> 11:55.560
But you know, your bank, or bank's probably a bad example, but your Dunder Mifflin up

11:55.560 --> 12:00.920
in Scranton who just needs another Java developer to keep their damn HR system running kind

12:00.920 --> 12:04.760
of doesn't care if you use the less efficient sort algorithm.

12:04.760 --> 12:08.280
You know, I agree with everything you're saying in principle.

12:08.280 --> 12:14.080
I think where I get hung up is human behavior shows us that we do place value on certain

12:14.080 --> 12:18.840
terms and the word engineer has just kind of become one of those respected terms, kind

12:18.840 --> 12:20.320
of like a doctor.

12:20.320 --> 12:26.600
So it makes sense that we would have kind of co-opted its use to bring some of that

12:26.600 --> 12:31.880
official shininess over to this new field to legitimize it a little bit.

12:31.880 --> 12:37.200
And I think in doing so, we got away with applying engineer to one thing, and then we

12:37.200 --> 12:39.920
tried applying it to another type of work, and then another, and now it's just sort of

12:39.920 --> 12:43.960
anyone's an engineer, you just actually literally just put engineer in the job title, and that's

12:43.960 --> 12:44.960
just human behavior.

12:44.960 --> 12:50.440
Do you think it was intentional, or was it because in the 50s and 60s, like the original,

12:50.440 --> 12:55.360
you know, software developers, engineers, whatever, maybe more so the early 70s, it

12:55.360 --> 12:57.920
was a lot more related to actual engineering, right?

12:57.920 --> 13:02.720
So like you were working on these circuits, you were, you know, I think, I mean, it's

13:02.720 --> 13:05.080
just it's JavaScript's fault.

13:05.080 --> 13:09.600
Yeah, well, there's that maybe a little bit of real basic and visual basic in there as

13:09.600 --> 13:10.600
well.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.600
Right.

13:11.600 --> 13:16.620
The problem is the craft or art or I firmly I mean, this is an argument against calling

13:16.620 --> 13:17.620
it engineering.

13:17.620 --> 13:19.840
It is in no way a science.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.840
Like I did.

13:20.840 --> 13:21.840
It's just not a science.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.200
I know people get pissy when I say that.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.840
The reason you know, it's not a science is because there are many different ways to do

13:27.840 --> 13:29.320
the same thing.

13:29.320 --> 13:35.760
And most importantly, you improve over time and practice, which makes it an art.

13:35.760 --> 13:36.760
That's how that works.

13:36.760 --> 13:37.760
Right?

13:37.760 --> 13:42.500
If this the very, you know, Renaissance way to think about it, but that's generally where

13:42.500 --> 13:44.120
you go.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.600
So I don't know, is the term developer or less offensive to you?

13:47.600 --> 13:49.640
Well, it clearly hasn't been enough.

13:49.640 --> 13:53.920
You know, they've clearly felt the market I'm speaking that they broadly just have felt

13:53.920 --> 13:57.480
like because otherwise we would just work on software developer instead of software

13:57.480 --> 13:58.480
engineer.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.480
All right.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.480
I'm going to fry some Klingon bacon here.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.480
Oh, all right.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.480
Oh, geez.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.640
You know, the Targs have particularly tough bacon.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.160
Yeah, we're really going to get that oil hot.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.920
You know why it's called why it's called engineering?

14:08.920 --> 14:12.200
I'm just going to go with this because we're all nerds.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.880
And when it started, a bunch of Star Trek nerds were like, which which section of the

14:15.880 --> 14:16.880
enterprise would we be?

14:16.880 --> 14:17.880
Engineering, of course.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.880
I'd be Scotty.

14:18.880 --> 14:19.880
Scotty.

14:19.880 --> 14:20.880
Right.

14:20.880 --> 14:21.880
Yeah.

14:21.880 --> 14:22.880
Yeah.

14:22.880 --> 14:23.880
I guess that could be it.

14:23.880 --> 14:30.800
I mean, I don't think there's a center circle ball of white coated nineteen sixties eyes.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.800
We're like, right.

14:31.800 --> 14:36.320
Hey, we'll make four hundred dollars more a year if we say we're engineers and maybe

14:36.320 --> 14:42.920
what we're seeing up there in Quebec and in Alberta is a swing back to kind of reclaiming

14:42.920 --> 14:45.220
the sanctity of the engineer term.

14:45.220 --> 14:48.360
Every actual licensed engineer I know hates, hates this.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.360
Right.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.760
And could you imagine, though, if we did bring some sort of licensing to software engineering,

14:52.760 --> 14:56.040
it just seems like it would stifle innovation like I wonder it would be great for me.

14:56.040 --> 14:59.560
How does something like rust come along in this license world?

14:59.560 --> 15:01.600
Is rust recognized by a board?

15:01.600 --> 15:02.600
And then you can be.

15:02.600 --> 15:08.800
You and I both know someone who would gleefully go on Twitter and say that if you are not

15:08.800 --> 15:12.960
a licensed rust engineer, then you are not a real developer.

15:12.960 --> 15:13.960
We know this dude.

15:13.960 --> 15:14.960
It's not me.

15:14.960 --> 15:15.960
Yeah.

15:15.960 --> 15:24.720
Linode dot com slash coder Linode makes the cloud simple, affordable and accessible to

15:24.720 --> 15:26.200
anyone at any skill level.

15:26.200 --> 15:31.120
And when you go to Linode dot com slash coder, you'll get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit

15:31.120 --> 15:36.860
to try it out, to really get a feel for what Linode is like fast, reliable.

15:36.860 --> 15:41.680
Those are words that come to my mind and honestly, a great deal, 30 to 50 percent less than the

15:41.680 --> 15:43.640
hypervisors out there.

15:43.640 --> 15:49.720
Linode's app marketplace makes it super easy to deploy a lot of popular open source software

15:49.720 --> 15:52.160
and the next cloud deployment has been taken to the next level.

15:52.160 --> 15:56.360
In fact, Linode seems to be working directly with the next cloud project and they just

15:56.360 --> 16:02.680
published a really great interview and background on Frank, the founder of next cloud and next

16:02.680 --> 16:06.560
cloud, the company and kind of how they're organized as a group.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.680
That's not a super long read either.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.160
So I'll link to this in the show notes.

16:09.160 --> 16:13.880
If you're not familiar, next cloud provides like a open source productivity suite now

16:13.880 --> 16:17.600
closer to Office 365 with their hub three that they just announced, which will be released

16:17.600 --> 16:19.080
soon.

16:19.080 --> 16:25.240
You basically have an alternative to the Google workplace product, Office 365, Slack, all

16:25.240 --> 16:31.440
of that in one self hostable package that you can deploy with just a couple of clicks

16:31.440 --> 16:32.800
on Linode.

16:32.800 --> 16:38.020
Same with GitLab and other just absolutely essential tools, including some cloud IDEs.

16:38.020 --> 16:42.360
Or if you prefer, which is honestly the route I often take if time allows, you can build

16:42.360 --> 16:46.320
it up from the ground on Linode and today they have 11 data centers and throughout next

16:46.320 --> 16:49.440
year they're going to fire up a dozen more.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.000
They are their own ISP, so their connections are super fast.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.500
They've got dedicated CPU rigs with AMD epic CPUs.

16:55.500 --> 17:01.640
They've got dedicated GPU rigs with the super high end Nvidia data center GPUs in there

17:01.640 --> 17:07.040
and they've got systems that will just be what you need to run a blog, maybe something

17:07.040 --> 17:10.580
simple for yourself, like a gallery site, or maybe your own Nextcloud instance just

17:10.580 --> 17:11.580
for a couple of people.

17:11.580 --> 17:13.360
Like the whole range is there.

17:13.360 --> 17:18.600
Our matrix server for Jupiter broadcasting is a 48 core Linode.

17:18.600 --> 17:19.600
It's a monster.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.120
It won't always be that way.

17:21.120 --> 17:27.960
In fact, we started, I think like maybe a four core and we scaled up as demand needed

17:27.960 --> 17:31.740
the same rig, the same install all the way up to 48 cores.

17:31.740 --> 17:34.840
I think it's like 128 gigs of RAM.

17:34.840 --> 17:39.720
It's something just astronomical mind blowing and for somebody who was super happy when

17:39.720 --> 17:44.440
his computer had two megs of RAM and that was after I put an upgrade stick in and we're

17:44.440 --> 17:48.500
just scale it back down once we've reconfigured it with more workers and whatnot.

17:48.500 --> 17:53.520
It's so powerful what you can do with Linode, the tooling, the backups, the snapshots.

17:53.520 --> 17:57.500
It's truly one of our secret weapons here at JB that lets us have the reach and the

17:57.500 --> 18:03.440
infrastructure of the billion dollar companies when we're just a small little bespoke podcast

18:03.440 --> 18:04.440
shop.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.440
So go try it for yourself.

18:05.440 --> 18:13.000
Go try it for your business and go get that $100 linode.com slash coder.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.880
So the internet's pretty upset this week because it seems with a little bit of tweaking, you

18:17.880 --> 18:25.560
can quote block public code that copilot emits and what you end up with, surprise, surprise,

18:25.560 --> 18:29.400
seems to be quite a bit of copy written code when you change that setting.

18:29.400 --> 18:34.360
And this was noticed over, I don't know, was it the weekend by Tim Davis on Twitter and

18:34.360 --> 18:40.040
he writes, with at GitHub copilot and the public code block setting, it now emits large

18:40.040 --> 18:44.580
chunks of my copy written code with no attribution and no LGPL license.

18:44.580 --> 18:50.060
For example, and he shows a simple prompt with a sparse matrix transpose CS, it produces

18:50.060 --> 18:57.800
his exact code and he has his original code in the screenshot up and then he pulls up

18:57.800 --> 19:04.560
the copilot produced code and it's line for line identical and it seems clearly like it's

19:04.560 --> 19:07.720
just reproducing his code without his permission.

19:07.720 --> 19:14.080
And this has provoked the conversation that copilot, much to I think your concern, it's

19:14.080 --> 19:15.080
actually happening.

19:15.080 --> 19:21.840
It is enabling copyright laundering, code laundering essentially, and you can just use

19:21.840 --> 19:25.640
somebody's copy written code and then when somebody comes after you, you can just put

19:25.640 --> 19:33.640
your hands up and say, I didn't, a copilot gen, I didn't, I had no idea.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.640
People are getting pissed.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.540
Yeah, so we should define our terms real fast though, right?

19:37.540 --> 19:44.640
So apparently public code in code pilot parlance means permissive licenses, I think that's

19:44.640 --> 19:45.640
what it sounds like.

19:45.640 --> 19:46.640
All right.

19:46.640 --> 19:52.360
And when they say, when you say copy written code, we are not talking private repos here.

19:52.360 --> 19:57.600
We are talking code that is in fact public, is in fact open source, but is under a more

19:57.600 --> 19:59.400
aggressive license you could say, right?

19:59.400 --> 20:01.940
Like a GPL, LGPL, whatever.

20:01.940 --> 20:07.720
Before I get into some concerns on this, I have some really bad news for you guys.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.720
Uh oh.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.920
People are doing this all the time.

20:10.920 --> 20:14.960
People who even like engineering developers, code monkeys, whatever we're calling them

20:14.960 --> 20:20.280
now who don't involve themselves in the Linux community.

20:20.280 --> 20:24.080
I know for a fact, routinely just steal GPL code.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.080
Oh, oh sure.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.520
Yeah, I, I, I, I, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.240
So this isn't like a big change.

20:29.240 --> 20:34.880
In fact, I would say, you know, your dumb sort algorithm when I, this Tim Davis guy

20:34.880 --> 20:39.080
is actually an academic, so his stuff is real, but like you're, you're dumb, like, you know,

20:39.080 --> 20:41.240
iterating through some dictionary.

20:41.240 --> 20:47.560
If somebody happens to copy that via code pilot unwittingly, eh, come on buddy.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.880
You didn't, you know, come on.

20:49.880 --> 20:54.440
The other thing is I'm going to push back a little, even though I'm what was one of

20:54.440 --> 20:57.280
the earlier persons concerned about this.

20:57.280 --> 21:03.440
If you put a prompt that looks, first of all, the prompt thing in code pilot is super, super

21:03.440 --> 21:04.440
problematic.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.440
I agree with that.

21:05.440 --> 21:07.960
You shouldn't be able to ask the code genie to generate you code.

21:07.960 --> 21:11.440
It should just do it intuitively for lots of reasons.

21:11.440 --> 21:16.320
One, if you do it intuitively, it looks at your own code first locally, which code cohesion

21:16.320 --> 21:18.720
is the thing you want that it's good for you.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.760
It's good for your organization.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.760
End of rant.

21:22.760 --> 21:29.440
But if you, you know, string together a prompt intentionally trying to get your code back

21:29.440 --> 21:35.320
and succeed, that's a little, that's a little sus as the kids would say, right?

21:35.320 --> 21:37.040
That's a little, I mean, fair point.

21:37.040 --> 21:41.820
You've made your point, but you've made your point, you know, in the way that lots of lawyers

21:41.820 --> 21:43.960
make their point that if the glove fits, you must acquit.

21:43.960 --> 21:47.500
And if Wookiees live on indoor, like it's a totally contrived argument.

21:47.500 --> 21:52.620
What about Jeremy Saller's argument that you could basically use this for illegal source

21:52.620 --> 21:53.620
code laundering?

21:53.620 --> 21:56.960
That's just automated by GitHub is that you could just literally find any piece of code

21:56.960 --> 22:01.480
you want under an incompatible license, and then you just keep probing copilot until it

22:01.480 --> 22:02.480
reproduces it.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.520
And then you have plausible denied ability later.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.880
Now this is a way to kind of copy that GPL code.

22:07.880 --> 22:11.920
Like you were saying, people do already and put it in there like, you know, close source

22:11.920 --> 22:15.300
company app or whatever operating system.

22:15.300 --> 22:20.000
But now you can do that with this tool and also have legal deniability.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.480
So it's like, it just makes it even easier to get away with it now.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.480
Okay.

22:24.480 --> 22:30.540
So what I would say generally is that there's a lot of overheated takes on this.

22:30.540 --> 22:37.660
And I think that's a little silly calling it code laundering is, uh, one of the things,

22:37.660 --> 22:41.280
so this is a little dangerous territory that I think pushes people away from the FOSS community

22:41.280 --> 22:44.580
is the more militant aspects of it.

22:44.580 --> 22:49.800
People aren't just running around looking to rip off, rip off your open source project.

22:49.800 --> 22:55.800
They're doing it by accident because either they don't know, or in, I guess, very, very

22:55.800 --> 23:01.040
few cases, it's a business decision made by some startup who I hate to break it to you.

23:01.040 --> 23:05.000
But when you sue them, they're probably by the time the lawsuit hits a judge, they'll

23:05.000 --> 23:09.960
probably be bankrupt for other reasons, right?

23:09.960 --> 23:14.640
So this is like the biggest tempest in the littlest teapot.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.920
And I know there's going to be a visceral reaction to that because I understand the

23:17.920 --> 23:23.320
people who've truly philosophically believe in FOSS for its own sake.

23:23.320 --> 23:28.560
This is like, you know, the Virgin Mary being the centerfold and playboy, but not only does

23:28.560 --> 23:33.800
this not matter, to be honest, reading some of these takes put me off.

23:33.800 --> 23:37.600
It's one of those things that every time I come into this community, I kind of get like,

23:37.600 --> 23:42.280
all right, you guys need to like have a shot of reality.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.640
Most code that I've seen code generate is actually bad.

23:45.640 --> 23:49.040
I'm just saying like, it's not good.

23:49.040 --> 23:54.320
So if some super, you know, I'll get accused of gatekeeping here, but super like newbie

23:54.320 --> 23:59.460
person who just came out of a boot camp wants to rip off some code I have in a public repo

23:59.460 --> 24:08.040
or a gist and just like try to shoehorn it into their project, what would you like me

24:08.040 --> 24:09.040
to do?

24:09.040 --> 24:10.040
Should I sue them?

24:10.040 --> 24:12.640
Should I sue GitHub?

24:12.640 --> 24:16.800
I mean, I'm pretty sure GitHub has in that EULA that you indemnify them.

24:16.800 --> 24:20.040
So here's something I've noticed recently.

24:20.040 --> 24:24.520
And all of this is prefaced with I think Twitter is pretty much a dumpster fire.

24:24.520 --> 24:29.040
And in all of these cases, if people just stayed the fuck off Twitter, they would have

24:29.040 --> 24:34.300
a lot easier simpler life and a lot less stress and things would be a lot smoother professionally.

24:34.300 --> 24:38.320
And you know, an example of this is Hector Martin, who I have a lot of respect for because

24:38.320 --> 24:45.060
Hector has led the charge on porting Linux over to Apple's M1 hardware and the Asahi

24:45.060 --> 24:47.760
Linux project has incredible success.

24:47.760 --> 24:51.120
But Hector is also involved in this culture of like, got to have a hot take.

24:51.120 --> 25:00.320
And it seems GitHub has entered this size and territory now where every single action

25:00.320 --> 25:01.320
GitHub takes.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.320
Pun.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.320
Wow.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.320
TM.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.320
Action TM.

25:05.320 --> 25:06.320
Yeah.

25:06.320 --> 25:07.320
Yeah.

25:07.320 --> 25:10.960
There is both a massively positive reaction and a massively negative reaction.

25:10.960 --> 25:15.880
And GitHub is so large that when they do something, anything, they end up touching things with

25:15.880 --> 25:17.820
negative consequences.

25:17.820 --> 25:23.500
And so on October 14, GitHub tweets, this handy action flag issues and PRs that go untouched

25:23.500 --> 25:25.080
for a certain amount of time.

25:25.080 --> 25:28.920
Try it with your repo today and start closing out those old stale issues.

25:28.920 --> 25:32.560
And it's an action that, you know, you could set an X amount of time and it will go through

25:32.560 --> 25:35.600
and close certain issues and PRs that have been untouched.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.400
So it's an issue of janitor effectively.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.400
Yeah.

25:38.400 --> 25:42.180
Hector Martin quote retweets that don't do this ever.

25:42.180 --> 25:45.320
This is insulting and disrespectful to your users.

25:45.320 --> 25:51.520
Everybody is entitled support from volunteers and FOSS projects and they absolutely do deserve

25:51.520 --> 25:55.600
not to have the issues they took time to file actively thrown away.

25:55.600 --> 25:58.440
If you haven't fixed this bug, it stays open.

25:58.440 --> 26:04.280
This then kicks off a conversation that between Hector and other people that essentially devolves

26:04.280 --> 26:10.800
into if you use this action, you hate free software and you hate free software users.

26:10.800 --> 26:16.420
And it goes from like, you know, like here's the thing, here's a perfectly reasonable way

26:16.420 --> 26:17.420
to tweet this.

26:17.420 --> 26:23.420
You could tweet, hey guys, here's a suggestion, you know, quote retweet and say, in my experience,

26:23.420 --> 26:25.560
this actually can discourage future contributions.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.760
You might want to consider not using this.

26:28.760 --> 26:32.280
But the reality is every project is unique.

26:32.280 --> 26:35.400
Everybody has different use cases because you could argue that also in a free software

26:35.400 --> 26:39.720
project, people open up a lot of bogus PRs and a lot of bogus issues that the project's

26:39.720 --> 26:43.640
never going to touch and they pile up and they pile up and they become overwhelming

26:43.640 --> 26:47.880
and demotivating to the developers because they have hundreds of open issues that they're

26:47.880 --> 26:49.860
never going to touch, but they don't know what to do.

26:49.860 --> 26:54.000
Like we have a small GitHub for Jupiter broadcasting and that's already come up a couple of times

26:54.000 --> 26:56.680
as like, well, what do you do with these issues that don't really fit here?

26:56.680 --> 26:57.680
They're not really a problem.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.680
They're more of somebody's opinion.

26:58.680 --> 26:59.680
Like, what do you do?

26:59.680 --> 27:00.840
Do you just close it?

27:00.840 --> 27:03.400
Do you say thanks for your contribution, then close it?

27:03.400 --> 27:05.520
Do you just let something come along and clean it up?

27:05.520 --> 27:07.320
Like there really is never a right answer.

27:07.320 --> 27:11.500
And so when you go in so hard and so hot on these takes, I can't help but lose respect

27:11.500 --> 27:15.800
for somebody a little bit because it's just, you boil it down to this sort of like, don't

27:15.800 --> 27:18.300
do this ever.

27:18.300 --> 27:19.300
And it's like, well, wait a minute.

27:19.300 --> 27:21.920
Now that's just never the right recommendation.

27:21.920 --> 27:26.000
It's funny because, you know, we follow many of the same people on Twitter.

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
I also follow this very large, I would say larger than the kind of more experienced FOSS

27:32.000 --> 27:37.680
developers we're talking about, community of, love you guys, but super newbie developers

27:37.680 --> 27:40.280
that have just come out of bootcamp.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.280
And they love co-pilot.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.280
Do you know why?

27:42.280 --> 27:46.160
Because they literally don't know how to do that iterate through the dictionary thing

27:46.160 --> 27:49.000
I was joking about, right?

27:49.000 --> 27:54.840
And I don't know, we always talk about accessibility and not, you know, quote unquote, gatekeeping,

27:54.840 --> 27:57.400
which is a term I fricking hate.

27:57.400 --> 28:03.200
What is that, so as soon as you slap like a license on it, I also don't think you should

28:03.200 --> 28:06.560
wantonly violate open source licenses.

28:06.560 --> 28:11.780
I don't, but the idea that this wasn't going on before co-pilot and the idea that the answer

28:11.780 --> 28:19.960
is to codify some militant force of angry senior developers who are going to scold you

28:19.960 --> 28:25.000
like you're in a British boarding school seems stupid to be honest.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.520
It seems really dumb because you know what the biggest threat to open source projects

28:29.520 --> 28:31.560
is on average?

28:31.560 --> 28:35.920
Not being, bringing enough people in to maintain them over the long haul.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.540
Not a problem if you're the Linux kernel, sure, because everybody, you know, that's

28:38.540 --> 28:41.680
prestige and you have big money behind you.

28:41.680 --> 28:47.660
But I'm not sure that our response, and I truly believe that code pilot is being used

28:47.660 --> 28:53.340
by a lot of these junior just out of bootcamp devs as a crutch and maybe that's not good

28:53.340 --> 28:54.440
for their learning.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.440
Maybe it is.

28:55.440 --> 29:00.560
I think we're going to need a couple of years to figure that out, but regardless of whatever

29:00.560 --> 29:07.800
mistakes they may make, I don't think having, you know, an openly hostile kind of honestly

29:07.800 --> 29:12.160
condescending DBAG reaction is the way to go.

29:12.160 --> 29:17.080
I feel bad because I like some of these people, and I used to do a lot of this angry crap

29:17.080 --> 29:24.920
on Twitter and it never gets you the result you want, I would say.

29:24.920 --> 29:28.160
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and it's a great way to support

29:28.160 --> 29:29.160
the show.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.080
Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.720
It'll get on any device in like minutes.

29:32.720 --> 29:33.720
It's impressive.

29:33.720 --> 29:37.040
It'll manage your firewall rules and it works from anywhere.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.400
Devices connect directly to each other using WireGuard's noise protocol.

29:40.400 --> 29:46.720
So it builds you a flat mesh network with the absolute best VPN in the business.

29:46.720 --> 29:50.520
And you can quickly and easily create a secure network between your machines.

29:50.520 --> 29:59.360
I'm talking servers, VMs, iPad, Android phone, Raspberry Pi cluster, a single Raspberry Pi,

29:59.360 --> 30:00.360
you name it.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.120
And Tailscale will manage the firewall.

30:02.120 --> 30:06.900
It'll take care of the NAT if you have it or even carrier grade double NAT, it even

30:06.900 --> 30:09.040
manages to work with that.

30:09.040 --> 30:12.800
And Tailscale will support DNS in that flat network and they just announced a partnership

30:12.800 --> 30:14.840
with NextDNS.

30:14.840 --> 30:18.640
So now you can put a DNS resolver using NextDNS in there or you could use something like Pi

30:18.640 --> 30:20.720
Hole or just straight up bind.

30:20.720 --> 30:25.240
It'll let you choose exactly how you want to manage it and then you can do name resolution

30:25.240 --> 30:27.200
for all your machines in the Tailscale network.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.960
And there's Tailscale Send which is like Airdrop but for all of your machines that have Tailscale

30:30.960 --> 30:34.240
including your Linux boxes of course.

30:34.240 --> 30:37.320
There's things like Tailscale SSH that helps you manage your SSH keys.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.600
You log in with your Tailscale credentials.

30:39.600 --> 30:44.160
It's powerful stuff and it's surprisingly simple to get going.

30:44.160 --> 30:49.400
And you can use it for free up to 20 devices when you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

30:49.400 --> 30:54.000
This is truly one of those tools that I advocate in my personal life to my friends and my family.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.640
Literally this weekend, I was getting my dad set up with Tailscale.

30:57.640 --> 30:58.640
I'm surprised I hadn't done it earlier.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.880
I just hadn't had a chance to see him.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.240
Now he's got it set up though.

31:02.240 --> 31:03.240
Go try it out.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.240
See why I love it.

31:04.240 --> 31:11.280
See why everybody around us, everyone at JB uses it, tailscale.com slash coder.

31:11.280 --> 31:17.360
So the Wall Street Journal and Business Insider have been hitting Meta week after week on

31:17.360 --> 31:19.160
a scheduled attack.

31:19.160 --> 31:23.480
And I've grabbed a couple of pieces because they're just eviscerating.

31:23.480 --> 31:29.080
The first one that I noticed Meta sunk 15 billion dollars building the Metaverse.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.680
Where did the money go?

31:30.680 --> 31:35.320
They say that precise details of where the money has gone remain fuzzy.

31:35.320 --> 31:40.120
Some experts express disappointment that Meta and the updates that Meta announced last week

31:40.120 --> 31:45.740
with their Meta keynote, which I watched parts of.

31:45.740 --> 31:53.440
The biggest thing they announced was legs for avatars and the new Quest hardware.

31:53.440 --> 31:58.280
Which is not even, I don't even have a tinge of desire to buy.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.040
And we're still using the Quest one.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.040
We just used it this weekend.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.280
We really enjoyed it.

32:02.280 --> 32:06.080
But I don't even have the slightest tinge to buy the $1200 Quest hardware.

32:06.080 --> 32:09.560
So they are kind of a disappointment in that regard.

32:09.560 --> 32:15.560
And then next, this one is super damning, I think.

32:15.560 --> 32:19.680
Most Metaverse users don't even last a month.

32:19.680 --> 32:24.960
Internal documents show that Meta's Horizon Worlds platform is struggling bad to retain

32:24.960 --> 32:25.960
users.

32:25.960 --> 32:29.080
This is the kiss of death for these platforms.

32:29.080 --> 32:34.560
So if you can get the hardware, you know, like you can maybe pick up a Quest one now

32:34.560 --> 32:41.200
for $400, most Metaverse users don't return to the Horizon Worlds platform after the first

32:41.200 --> 32:43.200
month of usage.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.200
They are losing users.

32:44.200 --> 32:48.760
So people buy the hardware, and I have to say, that is absolutely the way it worked

32:48.760 --> 32:49.760
for us.

32:49.760 --> 32:53.360
The very first thing my kid wanted to do when I gave it to my oldest is he wanted to check

32:53.360 --> 32:54.360
out the Metaverse.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.840
He checked it out for one night.

32:55.840 --> 32:59.120
I don't think they've ever gone back.

32:59.120 --> 33:02.920
My middle child said she checked it out for one night, and then she's never gone back.

33:02.920 --> 33:07.040
They'll play Beat Saber, you know, they'll do that stuff.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.040
Metaverse sucked for them though.

33:08.040 --> 33:09.040
What are your thoughts?

33:09.040 --> 33:10.040
I don't know.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.960
This is exactly what my experience was.

33:11.960 --> 33:15.000
I mean, I have the Quest as well.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.880
I think I went in the Metaverse for a whopping 10 minutes, then I went back and fought Darth

33:19.880 --> 33:20.880
Vader.

33:20.880 --> 33:21.880
I apologize.

33:21.880 --> 33:25.800
I don't remember the name of the game, but it's, I mean, I'm sure if you have a Quest

33:25.800 --> 33:29.440
and you listen to the show, you've probably fought Darth Vader too.

33:29.440 --> 33:30.440
That is good times.

33:30.440 --> 33:34.600
But then I was like, okay, let me buy this other game.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.600
It was garbage.

33:35.600 --> 33:40.480
My stepdaughter, honestly, it looked like she was taking some sort of seizure, but she

33:40.480 --> 33:45.840
did the Beat Saber game to Lady Gaga quite a bit until she like almost busted her ass.

33:45.840 --> 33:49.020
That pretty much put an end to that.

33:49.020 --> 33:56.280
And it is sitting in my closet, I joke you not, laying wrapped in my coderly robe.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.200
Something Meta about that actually.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.760
Yeah, I don't, I don't know.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.880
I know you and I talked a lot about this being for like virtual meetings or virtual events.

34:03.880 --> 34:09.040
I don't, I don't know that I could actually tolerate wearing it for more than like 15,

34:09.040 --> 34:10.040
20 minutes.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.040
Yeah.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.040
Yeah.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.040
This is definitely not the one, right?

34:13.040 --> 34:17.960
You know, when I see people who have stuck with the Quest, like they use it actively,

34:17.960 --> 34:19.680
they've replaced the headgear stuff.

34:19.680 --> 34:20.920
They've replaced the straps.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.800
They've added a ton of stuff to make it more comfortable.

34:23.800 --> 34:30.080
Part of the problem is, is that there is a heavy duty set of lenses and a smartphone

34:30.080 --> 34:31.520
on the front of this thing.

34:31.520 --> 34:35.780
And so it's pulling down on your face constantly.

34:35.780 --> 34:40.640
And I already am getting what I call a tranche in my hair, which is a real tragedy.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.120
Oh yeah, from headphones.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.120
Yep.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.620
From the headphones and from my CPAP.

34:44.620 --> 34:48.440
So I wear a strap all night that goes in the same place my headphones do.

34:48.440 --> 34:50.120
And then I wear headphones all day.

34:50.120 --> 34:53.280
And then when I play them, when I play on the Quest, I'm putting a strap on again.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.180
And so I get this tranche.

34:55.180 --> 35:00.160
It's like I'm basically, I have a strip of balding in the center of my head.

35:00.160 --> 35:04.360
It's just the hair has parted like the ocean from straps all the time.

35:04.360 --> 35:08.440
And so like the last thing I want to do is put another strap on.

35:08.440 --> 35:13.280
It's just, it needs to be a lighter device and it needs to be more comfortable than I

35:13.280 --> 35:14.280
could see it.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.280
I could see it.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.460
I still love the idea.

35:16.460 --> 35:20.760
The one thing they touched on more in their more recent keynote, to back up just a moment

35:20.760 --> 35:22.400
to kind of set the context.

35:22.400 --> 35:25.800
You remember how we talked about recently, the first couple of Apple watches, they really

35:25.800 --> 35:29.920
hadn't figured out fitness and then they really honed in on fitness.

35:29.920 --> 35:36.560
I feel like maybe they're going that direction with the Quest and home offices and you know,

35:36.560 --> 35:40.920
work from anywhere setups where you have an awesome virtual office and because they made

35:40.920 --> 35:46.280
a couple of references to how they're putting a lot of work into a new virtual office space

35:46.280 --> 35:48.760
where they're creating their own first party app.

35:48.760 --> 35:52.920
You have a virtual office, you pull your desktop screens in and you can do conferencing in

35:52.920 --> 35:54.080
there as well.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.600
They made a reference to down the road.

35:56.600 --> 36:04.400
Their goal would be your entire computer is in that Quest headset and I actually think

36:04.400 --> 36:05.400
that could work.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.360
So you put, you know, it's powerful enough.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.600
I mean, imagine if you had, you know, iPad Pro hardware in there.

36:10.600 --> 36:15.440
You put that thing on, it is your entire computer so you don't need to like bring in the screens

36:15.440 --> 36:17.040
from your laptop or your desktop.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.160
It has all your screens.

36:18.160 --> 36:24.760
It has all your apps and you just put it on and you're in your perfect workspace wherever

36:24.760 --> 36:29.280
you're at and you and I played with this a little bit and it was early days when we looked

36:29.280 --> 36:35.200
at it, but if somebody like Meta or Apple really focused on that idea, I think that

36:35.200 --> 36:40.960
could be the killer app like fitness was the killer app for the watch because that with

36:40.960 --> 36:45.160
work from home and work from anywhere because work from home is really just work from the

36:45.160 --> 36:49.480
internet and so if you could like for me, I could be sitting in my passenger seat of

36:49.480 --> 36:50.480
the RV.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.760
I put that headset on, boom, I'm in my office.

36:52.760 --> 36:53.760
I've got all my screens.

36:53.760 --> 36:54.760
I've got all my apps.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.160
I've got all my messages in their current state.

36:57.160 --> 37:00.760
That sounds super powerful to me and I can't be the only one that would use the crap out

37:00.760 --> 37:01.760
of that.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.760
Yeah, I don't know.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.800
Yeah, I know.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.000
I agree.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.320
It seems, it does seem, it seems just as sketch as it did two, three years ago.

37:11.320 --> 37:15.480
I feel like for the last three to five years, the industry has been searching for the next

37:15.480 --> 37:16.480
new thing, right?

37:16.480 --> 37:21.360
The next mobile, the next iPhone, whatever it is, and these are all solutions desperately

37:21.360 --> 37:23.320
searching for a problem.

37:23.320 --> 37:26.120
Like I work in a home office.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.120
It's fine.

37:27.120 --> 37:31.720
Yeah, although as homes get smaller and we all get packed into smaller and smaller Japanese

37:31.720 --> 37:35.000
style apartments, maybe you don't have room for a computer desk.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.240
I honestly think you and I will live to an age where the computer desk is looked at as

37:39.240 --> 37:43.160
like those antique TVs that were like an entire credenza.

37:43.160 --> 37:47.760
I think that's how we'll view the computer desk and the idea that you had a room that

37:47.760 --> 37:52.760
had a desk with screens that you just sat at all day will look archaic and well, no

37:52.760 --> 37:54.300
wonder everybody was so overweight.

37:54.300 --> 37:57.760
That's I think honestly where hopefully by the time you and I are dying, that's how the

37:57.760 --> 37:59.120
world will look at computer desks.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.720
Well, but isn't this what we've been hoping for for a long time, right?

38:01.720 --> 38:03.120
The Star Trek tablets.

38:03.120 --> 38:07.880
I mean, Microsoft is the closest to what I think is actually going to happen.

38:07.880 --> 38:12.640
They're just Microsoft and you know, are cursed to never succeed in the consumer space other

38:12.640 --> 38:13.640
than Xbox.

38:13.640 --> 38:14.640
Right?

38:14.640 --> 38:15.640
Yeah.

38:15.640 --> 38:18.160
You know where the HoloLens is alive and well?

38:18.160 --> 38:19.160
JPL.

38:19.160 --> 38:23.200
When you walk the JPL campus, which I had the opportunity to do recently, they have

38:23.200 --> 38:24.200
HoloLens.

38:24.200 --> 38:28.880
They're kind of like QR codes, but more complicated throughout the campus.

38:28.880 --> 38:33.000
So that way you can sync up your HoloLens to different areas as you're walking the JPL

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
campus.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Yeah.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.280
And I think of just like the surface, the idea that your main device, I mean, most of

38:39.280 --> 38:43.160
the time I'm not working at my Thale home, I'm working on the Dev one because you hit

38:43.160 --> 38:44.160
the nail on the head.

38:44.160 --> 38:50.000
The idea of just sitting at a desk and like in my case, my bedroom, you know, and being

38:50.000 --> 38:56.820
totally locked in is not conducive to the new world of work from home when you have

38:56.820 --> 38:58.080
kiddies running around.

38:58.080 --> 39:02.060
Yeah, it's not conducive to flow and it's not good for the body.

39:02.060 --> 39:08.000
And now that I'm getting old, it's like I notice that if I just work a few extra hours

39:08.000 --> 39:12.920
a day, so say, so I've been staying at the studio since last Coder because I'm getting

39:12.920 --> 39:16.840
some work done on JOOPS and I pick her up after today's episode.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.620
Because I'm here, I work longer.

39:18.620 --> 39:24.120
I work basically from like six a.m. to like six thirty seven p.m.

39:24.120 --> 39:28.560
And I notice that my RSI is significantly worse just by adding a couple of hours more

39:28.560 --> 39:30.880
to my day or just consistently working longer.

39:30.880 --> 39:34.200
Like it's not unusual for me to work those hours, but maybe it's unusual for me to work

39:34.200 --> 39:36.320
those hours like seven days in a row.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.920
And as I do that, I can feel my hands are starting to hurt.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.840
It's my my body is just getting old.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.800
I got to take more breaks and I got to move about more.

39:43.800 --> 39:47.800
And I think part of the way to do that is using different equipment and working in different

39:47.800 --> 39:49.420
work positions.

39:49.420 --> 39:52.440
So I got to wrap my head around like, what is the best tool when I want to do this kind

39:52.440 --> 39:54.520
of thing and where should I do that from?

39:54.520 --> 39:57.040
I think I'm going to spend a little bit of time this winter kind of figuring that stuff

39:57.040 --> 40:03.960
out just to kind of try to habitualize a new routine of working.

40:03.960 --> 40:09.040
And what I'm hoping for, although who knows, is sort of like train myself like a dog.

40:09.040 --> 40:13.760
Like when I'm in this area and I'm using this equipment, I'm doing this task.

40:13.760 --> 40:18.820
And so maybe I get into flow a little bit easier because it's like I'm training my body,

40:18.820 --> 40:25.200
my mind, this place, this equipment, these apps go, you know, I could see it working.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.200
I don't know.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.200
Why not?

40:27.200 --> 40:29.160
If you can work from the Internet, you can work from anywhere.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.400
Well, unless you have a data cap.

40:31.400 --> 40:32.400
Yeah.

40:32.400 --> 40:33.400
Yeah.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.400
Oh, man.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.400
Let's not forget about Comcast.

40:35.400 --> 40:38.360
Or like, you know, technical issues like this last road trip was just horrendous.

40:38.360 --> 40:40.880
Or it's, you know, three months out of the year in Florida.

40:40.880 --> 40:41.880
Yeah.

40:41.880 --> 40:48.960
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

40:48.960 --> 40:51.000
We got some boosts into the show this week.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.080
Thank you, everybody who boosted in.

40:52.080 --> 40:55.600
We do just select some of them to come onto the show, but we read all of them.

40:55.600 --> 40:56.760
I appreciate all of them.

40:56.760 --> 41:01.880
And our first one came in from Soham with nineteen eighty four sets.

41:01.880 --> 41:02.880
Hmm.

41:02.880 --> 41:03.880
Hmm.

41:03.880 --> 41:04.880
I see what you did there.

41:04.880 --> 41:05.880
Boost.

41:05.880 --> 41:12.520
He says every episode you all get so close to realizing capitalism is doomed by definition.

41:12.520 --> 41:15.400
Come on over to the red side.

41:15.400 --> 41:16.400
Do we?

41:16.400 --> 41:17.400
Is that what we do?

41:17.400 --> 41:18.740
I don't know if I agree with that.

41:18.740 --> 41:21.520
I feel like we recognize that it's sick.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.520
It's it's definitely sick.

41:22.520 --> 41:25.960
I don't know what else is doing so well.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.880
I like how we have a communist underground that listens to the show.

41:28.880 --> 41:29.880
I know.

41:29.880 --> 41:30.880
I know.

41:30.880 --> 41:31.880
It's really kind of it's very Dostoevsky.

41:31.880 --> 41:34.560
It's it's like it's it's kind of perfect, isn't it?

41:34.560 --> 41:36.120
We appreciate you, comrades.

41:36.120 --> 41:39.280
Yeah, we can we can reach across to all sides.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.960
Works from home boosts in with a thousand sets.

41:41.960 --> 41:47.280
B-O-O-S-T. Regarding Chris's uniform, I have two words for you.

41:47.280 --> 41:48.280
Shoulder pads.

41:48.280 --> 41:51.240
Yes, it's nineteen eighties, nineteen eighty four.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.480
It's perfect.

41:52.480 --> 41:54.240
You know, they're going to come back, right?

41:54.240 --> 41:55.280
You know, they're going to come back.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.240
So let's just get ahead of the trend.

41:57.240 --> 42:01.920
So now that now that I am back from the road trip, I have been considering this a lot.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.460
I'm giving it some thought.

42:03.460 --> 42:05.480
I've been looking for where I can source stuff.

42:05.480 --> 42:08.840
So I am beginning the process of figuring out the uniform.

42:08.840 --> 42:09.840
Oh, my God.

42:09.840 --> 42:10.840
Yeah, it's happening.

42:10.840 --> 42:11.840
It's it's happening.

42:11.840 --> 42:15.960
Optimus Gray boosts in with twenty forty eight sets coming in hot with the boost.

42:15.960 --> 42:20.040
I'm boosting Coder because this has to do with Chris's wardrobe and uniform.

42:20.040 --> 42:21.040
Jesus Christ.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.040
Velcro, guys.

42:22.040 --> 42:25.160
OK, let me say Velcro sleeves and upper left chest.

42:25.160 --> 42:29.520
I mean, maybe you could wear the same shirt but have Velcro patches for luck.

42:29.520 --> 42:30.520
Oh, my God.

42:30.520 --> 42:34.560
For Coder and for self-hosted.

42:34.560 --> 42:35.560
That's great.

42:35.560 --> 42:39.120
Said I'd buy a self-hosted Velcro patch all day and then the Bitcoin dad talks.

42:39.120 --> 42:41.080
You can wear a patch for that show.

42:41.080 --> 42:42.360
This is a great idea.

42:42.360 --> 42:46.520
It's just one shirt with different Velcro patch patches depending on the show you're

42:46.520 --> 42:47.520
doing.

42:47.520 --> 42:49.520
That's I mean, that means we have to do it.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.240
We'd have to launch a whole patch line investigation.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.240
You know, you'd be like the Thaleo of shirts.

42:53.240 --> 42:57.200
You have all the different face plates.

42:57.200 --> 43:00.720
Also keep keeping in with our 80s theme because now Velcro is back.

43:00.720 --> 43:01.720
OK.

43:01.720 --> 43:02.720
Yeah.

43:02.720 --> 43:03.720
Right.

43:03.720 --> 43:04.720
Yeah.

43:04.720 --> 43:05.720
Right.

43:05.720 --> 43:06.720
I mean, there's something to this here.

43:06.720 --> 43:07.720
Shoulder pads and Velcro and patches.

43:07.720 --> 43:14.040
John eight came in with I think our biggest boost of the episode with seven thousand sets.

43:14.040 --> 43:17.040
Seven thousand for the seven percent interest rate.

43:17.040 --> 43:18.040
Ouch.

43:18.040 --> 43:19.040
Yeah.

43:19.040 --> 43:23.160
And then CPI was up since we got together again.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.160
Every seven days.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.560
Oh, it's bad.

43:25.560 --> 43:26.760
It is something, man.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.840
We are watching some incredible times.

43:28.840 --> 43:33.280
And also, it really shows you just how long all of this stuff takes to work its way through

43:33.280 --> 43:34.280
the economy.

43:34.280 --> 43:35.280
Right.

43:35.280 --> 43:38.480
Because the Fed has basically been hawkish since November of last year.

43:38.480 --> 43:41.860
We're almost a year now in a hawkish action by the Fed.

43:41.860 --> 43:43.440
And inflation is still increasing.

43:43.440 --> 43:47.640
Hey, question, if you go to the unemployment line, you say you're an engineer or developer,

43:47.640 --> 43:48.640
which is better?

43:48.640 --> 43:50.840
Might be something to think about.

43:50.840 --> 43:51.840
Yeah.

43:51.840 --> 43:52.840
Think about that, everybody.

43:52.840 --> 43:57.560
Bond boosted in with one, two, three, four sets to love the truthful take on crypto.

43:57.560 --> 43:58.780
That's right.

43:58.780 --> 43:59.780
No B.S. here.

43:59.780 --> 44:04.960
By the way, since we've been live, top of Hacker News or at least it was a half hour

44:04.960 --> 44:09.640
ago, former FBI director says they actually loved crypto the whole time because it was

44:09.640 --> 44:12.560
far easier to track than real money.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.840
One hundred percent underscored.

44:14.840 --> 44:19.960
Everybody that tells you that like Bitcoin is great for cybercrime and criminals has

44:19.960 --> 44:22.040
no idea what they're talking about.

44:22.040 --> 44:25.920
Every single transaction is traceable on the block chain, especially if you're using a

44:25.920 --> 44:27.520
centralized wallet, kids.

44:27.520 --> 44:28.520
Yeah, that's.

44:28.520 --> 44:29.520
Yeah.

44:29.520 --> 44:31.800
Well, and just about every Bitcoin you buy today, unless you use something like Robo

44:31.800 --> 44:34.920
stats is it's tracked from the moment you buy it.

44:34.920 --> 44:36.760
They have your name, your ID, your information.

44:36.760 --> 44:40.960
When you buy that Bitcoin, they know that address is associated with your identity.

44:40.960 --> 44:45.520
The exchanges will hand that over immediately to the authorities when they want it.

44:45.520 --> 44:55.040
There is the most private, secure, untraceable way to pay for crime is cash, art, precious

44:55.040 --> 44:56.040
metals.

44:56.040 --> 44:57.520
And that's truly what the criminals use.

44:57.520 --> 45:00.000
They don't use Bitcoin, Monero potentially.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.920
But the value of Monero is so low that you and the liquidity of Monero is so low that

45:03.920 --> 45:06.020
you can't move really anything serious.

45:06.020 --> 45:08.120
You can't do like a big drug deal in Monero.

45:08.120 --> 45:11.680
You know, I guess that depends on your definition of big, but there's just not enough.

45:11.680 --> 45:14.720
There's also not a lot of liquidity in crypto.

45:14.720 --> 45:15.720
It's not a huge market.

45:15.720 --> 45:18.140
So you can't move millions of illegal dollars.

45:18.140 --> 45:22.120
And if you did, it would fundamentally shift the price.

45:22.120 --> 45:26.960
Like the entire community would notice if like 10 million dollars of illicit funds move

45:26.960 --> 45:33.440
through the Bitcoin network and it would be so obvious and it would be so traceable.

45:33.440 --> 45:35.320
It's not what you want to use for illegal activity.

45:35.320 --> 45:36.620
So this is your PSA.

45:36.620 --> 45:41.400
If you want to join the heights of organized crime, as Chris and I apparently have, buy

45:41.400 --> 45:42.400
some Van Gogh.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.480
There you go.

45:43.480 --> 45:44.480
In cash.

45:44.480 --> 45:45.480
Hunter's got pictures.

45:45.480 --> 45:46.480
He'll sell.

45:46.480 --> 45:47.480
He takes diamonds of payments.

45:47.480 --> 45:53.080
I joke, but that does give you a little insight into how the elite do that kind of business

45:53.080 --> 45:54.080
off the record.

45:54.080 --> 45:55.080
It's fascinating stuff.

45:55.080 --> 46:02.920
If you put the political stuff aside, it's fascinating.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.120
Just a couple of thank yous out there.

46:04.120 --> 46:06.520
We got 2048 sats from our 30s.

46:06.520 --> 46:12.700
He says, sending in some thanks with the sats he earned, just listening to podcasts in fountain.fm.

46:12.700 --> 46:18.720
And we've got a classic row of ducks from Mr. Quackers, Quacka Wacka.

46:18.720 --> 46:19.720
It's a treasure.

46:19.720 --> 46:20.720
Yippee.

46:20.720 --> 46:21.720
Coming in once again.

46:21.720 --> 46:24.880
We see you out there, Mr. Quackers and appreciate you appreciate everybody who boosts in.

46:24.880 --> 46:29.440
You can go get yourself a brand new spanking new podcast app and new podcast apps dot com.

46:29.440 --> 46:32.900
These are podcasting 2.0 compatible along with the boosting.

46:32.900 --> 46:38.500
There's a bunch of other great 30 other fantastic features that a really brilliant, really fast

46:38.500 --> 46:40.540
moving community are developing.

46:40.540 --> 46:41.760
It's really exciting times.

46:41.760 --> 46:45.120
We talk about it actually a lot on office hours, if you're curious, office hours, not

46:45.120 --> 46:46.120
here.

46:46.120 --> 46:49.220
So I try to get it all out over there so I don't fill these shows up with something I'm

46:49.220 --> 46:50.720
just so super excited about.

46:50.720 --> 46:54.260
I think it's just really time the podcast industry had some improvements that were done

46:54.260 --> 46:57.460
decentralized that aren't tied to Apple or Spotify.

46:57.460 --> 47:01.220
It's a movement that you can join by upgrading to a podcasting 2.0 compatible app at new

47:01.220 --> 47:03.200
podcast apps dot com.

47:03.200 --> 47:08.340
I want to say a big thank you to our members to you invest in the ongoing production of

47:08.340 --> 47:09.340
these shows.

47:09.340 --> 47:12.720
And as a thank you, we have created an ad free feed for you so you get a nice tight

47:12.720 --> 47:14.900
coder still produced by Drew.

47:14.900 --> 47:16.520
Just no ads in there.

47:16.520 --> 47:19.540
And of course, you get the coderly report when a fresh one is available for you every

47:19.540 --> 47:21.380
single quarter, which will be coming up soon.

47:21.380 --> 47:26.380
You can join at Coder QA dot co or you can support every show and get every show on the

47:26.380 --> 47:29.160
network ad free at Jupiter dot party.

47:29.160 --> 47:32.460
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send the good people this week?

47:32.460 --> 47:37.580
Well, after your admonishment about Twitter, you're right.

47:37.580 --> 47:39.700
I was going to go on Twitter, but you know what?

47:39.700 --> 47:42.080
Let's challenge ourselves for seven days.

47:42.080 --> 47:44.620
Let's just like be nice to the other tech nerds.

47:44.620 --> 47:45.940
There's not that many of us.

47:45.940 --> 47:47.700
We could do it for seven days.

47:47.700 --> 47:48.700
Seven days.

47:48.700 --> 47:49.700
We could do it.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.780
You know where people are actually genuinely nice?

47:51.780 --> 47:52.780
Our matrix chat.

47:52.780 --> 47:57.620
That is shorter that show slash matrix going 24 seven good people, not a huge crowd, but

47:57.620 --> 48:00.140
a really good crowd in there.

48:00.140 --> 48:01.140
That's a spot, too.

48:01.140 --> 48:02.300
And sometimes Mr. Dominic pops in.

48:02.300 --> 48:03.300
I do.

48:03.300 --> 48:05.380
And sometimes I play Magic the Gathering with the people in there.

48:05.380 --> 48:06.380
I saw that.

48:06.380 --> 48:07.380
That's so great.

48:07.380 --> 48:09.460
I believe I've thus far gone undefeated.

48:09.460 --> 48:10.460
So, yeah.

48:10.460 --> 48:13.020
Oh, very nice.

48:13.020 --> 48:17.060
If you are on the Twitter, you can check out at the Mad Botter Inc, you know, or the podcast

48:17.060 --> 48:18.060
at Coder Radio Show.

48:18.060 --> 48:19.060
You could do that.

48:19.060 --> 48:20.060
I suppose.

48:20.060 --> 48:22.020
I mean, there is the whole network to add Jupiter signal.

48:22.020 --> 48:23.020
I don't know.

48:23.020 --> 48:24.020
I don't know.

48:24.020 --> 48:25.020
It's weird.

48:25.020 --> 48:26.020
You know, we have the Telegram group.

48:26.020 --> 48:27.020
That's not Twitter.

48:27.020 --> 48:28.020
That's podcasting.com.

48:28.020 --> 48:29.020
Telegram.

48:29.020 --> 48:30.020
I don't know.

48:30.020 --> 48:31.020
Most people listen.

48:31.020 --> 48:32.020
Just want to listen.

48:32.020 --> 48:33.020
They don't even need any of this social crap.

48:33.020 --> 48:34.020
God, that's so nice.

48:34.020 --> 48:35.020
So simple.

48:35.020 --> 48:39.100
But then again, I'm part of the problem because I like talking to people, you know, don't

48:39.100 --> 48:40.100
know what to do with that.

48:40.100 --> 48:41.580
I like posting memes on Twitter.

48:41.580 --> 48:43.420
Yeah, that is fun.

48:43.420 --> 48:47.140
Well, links to what we talked about include any memes or hot Twitter threads over at Coder

48:47.140 --> 48:49.060
dot show slash four eight eight.

48:49.060 --> 48:50.540
You'll find our contact form there.

48:50.540 --> 48:51.540
We want your emails.

48:51.540 --> 48:53.220
We need more emails into the show.

48:53.220 --> 48:55.380
And we say you should probably get the RSS feed.

48:55.380 --> 48:56.380
I mean, just to be a pro.

48:56.380 --> 48:57.380
Go grab that RSS feed.

48:57.380 --> 48:58.380
That's what we say.

48:58.380 --> 49:01.740
You can join us live Jupiter at two Mondays at nine a.m.

49:01.740 --> 49:02.740
Pacific.

49:02.740 --> 49:27.140
See you next week.
