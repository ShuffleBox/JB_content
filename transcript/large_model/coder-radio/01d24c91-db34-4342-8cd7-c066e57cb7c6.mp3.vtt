00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
This is KOTORadio, episode 468 for May 30th, 2022.

00:10.000 --> 00:19.040
Hey, good looking and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:19.040 --> 00:24.680
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development in the world of technology.

00:24.680 --> 00:30.200
My name is Chris, and toughen it out like the pro podcaster he is, it's our host, Mr.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.200
Dominic.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.200
Hello, Mike.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.200
What's up?

00:33.200 --> 00:35.080
Questionable restaurant food is still questionable.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.560
No.

00:36.560 --> 00:37.560
Food poisoning?

00:37.560 --> 00:39.000
So you and I talked earlier.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.760
I'm hoping it's not the Rona.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.040
That's one of the things with the new Rona.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.040
I've heard.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.040
I've heard.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.040
Mm-hmm.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.680
You know, the new improved Rona.

00:46.680 --> 00:51.000
Well, if it is Rona, this would be round three, which I think is unfair.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.560
Seriously, three?

00:52.560 --> 00:53.560
Totally unfair.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.560
Totally unfair.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.000
I know a couple of people who are on round three right now.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.160
I'm drinking tonic without the gin just to settle my stomach.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.160
Must taste weird.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.160
All right?

01:03.160 --> 01:06.280
Like when you always have a drink with alcohol in it, then you go to drink it without alcohol,

01:06.280 --> 01:07.280
it totally tastes weird.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.680
It's much sweeter than I would have thought.

01:10.680 --> 01:11.680
Yeah.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.840
Well, you got to get healed up because, you know, next week's a game week.

01:14.840 --> 01:20.080
It's big week next week, WWDC, the only developer conference that has any hype.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.080
Let's apple it up.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.080
Yeah.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.940
But we don't have to worry about that right now.

01:23.940 --> 01:27.840
This week, this week, we're going to we're just going to put that out of our minds for

01:27.840 --> 01:28.840
a little bit.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.320
We're going to focus on some feedback.

01:30.320 --> 01:35.920
Nuclear Nick writes in and he says that work from home study smells a little suspicious.

01:35.920 --> 01:40.240
He says you guys recently discussed a study which concluded that the developer productivity

01:40.240 --> 01:42.320
is not hampered by remote work.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.800
I agree with you guys.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.600
That is complete BS.

01:45.600 --> 01:50.800
I work at a medium-sized fintech that offered three days remote per week as an option.

01:50.800 --> 01:54.320
On any given day, there would be at least 20 engineers in the office.

01:54.320 --> 02:00.040
The amount of incidental learning, impromptu brainstorming, et cetera, was just unbelievably

02:00.040 --> 02:01.140
satisfying.

02:01.140 --> 02:02.560
Things like, it looks like you're stuck.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.280
Do you need a rubber duck?

02:04.280 --> 02:06.600
Could I get your thoughts on this tricky problem?

02:06.600 --> 02:08.680
And other things like, what are you folks busy with?

02:08.680 --> 02:10.620
Oh, I have seen this before.

02:10.620 --> 02:14.520
And more than just these, there was just no way a junior dev could have possibly had the

02:14.520 --> 02:18.080
same experience onboarding as before if he's remote.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.080
Love the show.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.080
Keep up the great work.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.080
Thank you, circular Nick.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.960
I know you're done talking about remote work, but they just keep bringing it back.

02:23.960 --> 02:24.960
I know.

02:24.960 --> 02:29.680
I think the part about junior devs mentoring is super strong.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.960
That's definitely, it's just not the same.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.480
You touched on that, and I think it's your strongest point.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.360
We did get some emails in that also are like, you know, by the way, it's really great for

02:38.360 --> 02:41.040
people with accessibility issues to work from home.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.040
There's a big perk there.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.040
And I get that.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.040
Yeah.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.040
For sure.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.040
Yeah.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.040
All right.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.040
I just thought that was interesting to add to the conversation.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.120
I feel like we've talked it to death.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.940
So moving on, Donald's writing in.

02:51.940 --> 02:55.040
He wrote in years ago, years ago, looking for guidance.

02:55.040 --> 02:59.320
He says, hello, Chris and Mike, a longtime fan, been listening since season one.

02:59.320 --> 03:02.280
I like the idea of calling the first run of the show season one.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.280
Ooh, season one.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.280
I like it.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.280
It's a hell of a season though.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.280
What is that like?

03:06.280 --> 03:07.280
Yeah.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.280
All right.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.280
But I'll take it.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.280
I'm with you, Donnie.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.280
I'm with you.

03:11.280 --> 03:16.560
He says, I wrote back in 2012, 2013 about my anxieties about finding a job while I was

03:16.560 --> 03:18.460
studying at a university.

03:18.460 --> 03:24.000
Since then, I graduated and I have been working as a software engineer for seven years.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.320
Give me a, give me a bell.

03:25.320 --> 03:26.320
Give me a bell.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.320
I know, right?

03:27.320 --> 03:28.320
Do it.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.320
Coderadio success story.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.320
Right here.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.320
Donald.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.320
He says, you were right.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.320
There was work to be found.

03:33.320 --> 03:37.720
However, like a lot of software engineers, I find the anxiety never really goes away.

03:37.720 --> 03:42.560
Hearing about GitHub Copilot, GPT-3 and other automated code generators, whatever you want

03:42.560 --> 03:44.280
to call them.

03:44.280 --> 03:47.500
How do we just stay relevant to make sure we won't be out of a job and say three to

03:47.500 --> 03:49.400
five or 10 years down the line.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.400
Love the show.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.400
Keep up the new work.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.080
So he just went from worrying about one thing to the next, but it is a common question we

03:54.080 --> 03:55.080
get.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.160
No, dog, I get you.

03:56.160 --> 04:02.240
So my new fiance has introduced me to hip hop and not my genre of choice, but there's

04:02.240 --> 04:05.840
a song and somebody will put it in the chat room because I know I'm sure you guys love

04:05.840 --> 04:06.840
it.

04:06.840 --> 04:11.440
It's, you know, you was coding to, it's rapping, but you was coding to just for the hell of

04:11.440 --> 04:12.440
it.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.440
Now you're coding to stay relevant.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.440
That's the challenge, right?

04:14.440 --> 04:15.440
You did it for fun.

04:15.440 --> 04:16.740
It was your hobby.

04:16.740 --> 04:22.020
And now, you know, all the big boys are, I just want to say when I started my business,

04:22.020 --> 04:28.060
my software consulting business, I never thought that PricewaterhouseCooper, the giant accounting

04:28.060 --> 04:32.400
firm would be a competitor, but they certainly are.

04:32.400 --> 04:38.160
They just opened an office here in Tampa for technical consulting for dev basically.

04:38.160 --> 04:43.440
It's just the way it is, Don, you're going to be, you're going to be chasing this dragon

04:43.440 --> 04:44.440
forever.

04:44.440 --> 04:50.000
And yeah, I mean, as people have realized how important this stuff is, they're trying

04:50.000 --> 04:53.680
to make tools to lower their economic costs, right?

04:53.680 --> 04:58.240
Although I will say GitHub co-pilot, I would, Dan, yeah, no, that's not gonna, don't worry

04:58.240 --> 04:59.240
about that.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.240
Yeah.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.920
It feels like as time goes on, it's less of a threat and more of a technology demo, right?

05:02.920 --> 05:03.920
I feel like it's dumb.

05:03.920 --> 05:04.920
Maybe I'm just mean.

05:04.920 --> 05:05.920
I just think it's stupid.

05:05.920 --> 05:06.920
It's a waste of resources.

05:06.920 --> 05:07.920
No, I agree.

05:07.920 --> 05:12.680
It does seem like it's sort of, I think it's a show off piece, right?

05:12.680 --> 05:13.680
It's a.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.440
Look how epic we are.

05:15.440 --> 05:20.320
And would you like some Azure, please, please buy some Azure Harold.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.800
He spots shenanigans and he writes in about it and he writes, remember me, I told you

05:23.800 --> 05:28.400
about bru successor T the package manager that raised a lot of money and it has some

05:28.400 --> 05:29.560
web three lingo in it.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.560
Well guess what?

05:30.560 --> 05:32.920
The lingo, it spreads.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.800
It's been picked up by JFrog, Docker, and Oracle and some others.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.200
Check out.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.200
I'm going to say Pyrus.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.200
I don't know.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.360
Actually, I'm just, this sounds so dumb.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.920
I think it's Pyrus.

05:43.920 --> 05:44.920
Yeah, I know.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.920
I was trying to think of like parasite or something like a play on that, but it's P Y

05:47.920 --> 05:49.920
R S I A dot IO.

05:49.920 --> 05:50.920
Pysra.

05:50.920 --> 05:51.920
It's got to be Pysra.

05:51.920 --> 05:52.920
Pysra.

05:52.920 --> 05:53.920
Yeah.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.280
They pitch themselves as the decentralized package network, the open source software

05:57.280 --> 06:00.920
that helps protect the open source supply chain.

06:00.920 --> 06:01.920
Here's what they say it does.

06:01.920 --> 06:07.040
So JFrog and other open source technology leaders, including Docker, deploy hub, futureway

06:07.040 --> 06:14.240
and Oracle work together to establish project pariah to network and validate the sources

06:14.240 --> 06:17.300
and security of open source software packages.

06:17.300 --> 06:21.240
It aims to seamlessly integrate with the package management systems to develop that developers

06:21.240 --> 06:22.760
are already using today.

06:22.760 --> 06:26.720
So they're going to integrate somehow with package managers, the developers already use

06:26.720 --> 06:27.720
today.

06:27.720 --> 06:32.160
So that way they say they can certify their software components without foregoing compatibility,

06:32.160 --> 06:38.440
security or efficiency, and to help developers and guide them on the process of using this

06:38.440 --> 06:44.800
to validate their software components, a select few entities will build and publish images

06:44.800 --> 06:51.880
that will be available for everyone's use, otherwise known as bootstrapping the project.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.960
What the hell are they talking about, dude?

06:54.960 --> 06:57.000
I can't put it together.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.720
I have no idea.

06:58.720 --> 07:03.880
I think this is all just nonsense, right, cashing in on what I'm hoping is the end of

07:03.880 --> 07:06.400
the VC drunken bender.

07:06.400 --> 07:12.960
So Google just recently announced that for Google Cloud customers, they're going to offer

07:12.960 --> 07:16.640
repos of common popular open source projects that they vetted.

07:16.640 --> 07:20.600
So Google, it checks the project out, it runs it through all of their internal, which is

07:20.600 --> 07:25.280
a litany of tests that they use, validates that it's secure, and then posts it up for

07:25.280 --> 07:27.200
Google Cloud users to use.

07:27.200 --> 07:31.880
And I wonder if this isn't like a response to that, if this isn't these companies getting

07:31.880 --> 07:32.880
together.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.840
What really throws this sideways for me is the fact that Oracle's in there, I'm not going

07:35.840 --> 07:37.140
to lie.

07:37.140 --> 07:41.040
It feels like there's got to be like some sort of weird blockchain angle to this that

07:41.040 --> 07:45.880
they're just not telling us about, because they talked consistently about how important

07:45.880 --> 07:50.200
the open source supply chain is and how it's a critical issue and how they got to secure

07:50.200 --> 07:51.200
it.

07:51.200 --> 07:55.880
Well, but is it not just fear mongering to make a buck, right?

07:55.880 --> 07:56.880
Could be.

07:56.880 --> 07:57.880
We've had some stories.

07:57.880 --> 08:02.840
What was that kid a couple weeks ago or months ago who intentionally borked his own package

08:02.840 --> 08:06.160
just to screw with people he didn't like?

08:06.160 --> 08:08.480
And we've had bugs in other libraries.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.280
I feel like, you know what, Silicon Valley, right?

08:12.280 --> 08:17.960
The sales lady tells the CEO of Pied Piper, corporations are pussies.

08:17.960 --> 08:18.960
They are, right?

08:18.960 --> 08:21.900
If you could tell them it's a security thing, it's a liability thing, they'll basically

08:21.900 --> 08:22.900
hand you money.

08:22.900 --> 08:23.900
Yeah.

08:23.900 --> 08:24.900
This is a money grab.

08:24.900 --> 08:28.240
This is a money grab while the free money building's falling down, right?

08:28.240 --> 08:30.720
They ran in, they got a little money and they're running out possibly.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.720
All right.

08:31.720 --> 08:32.720
I'll go with that.

08:32.720 --> 08:37.160
And then I'll mention that this London meetup we talked about last week, I think this thing's

08:37.160 --> 08:38.160
happening.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.160
I think it's happening.

08:39.160 --> 08:40.160
55 people are now signed up.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.160
Cheerio, bitches.

08:41.160 --> 08:42.160
Yeah.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.160
Yeah.

08:43.160 --> 08:45.560
I think it's happening.

08:45.560 --> 08:50.480
55 people have signed up and I think it's still getting sorted out, but there's a great

08:50.480 --> 08:54.740
opportunity to get involved and start talking with people, get some plans.

08:54.740 --> 08:59.660
There's already comments trickling in, so London meetup provisional with Alex from Self

08:59.660 --> 09:03.680
Hosted and the community, Saturday, August 6th, 2022.

09:03.680 --> 09:07.400
Mike and I won't be there, but one day, one day I hope we get out there.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.400
That's right.

09:08.400 --> 09:12.760
We have to get even with those bastards, those redcoats for what they did to us in the Revolutionary

09:12.760 --> 09:13.760
War.

09:13.760 --> 09:17.280
You know, my thought is with that is maybe they were right.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.280
You know?

09:18.280 --> 09:19.280
You know what?

09:19.280 --> 09:20.280
I'll take it.

09:20.280 --> 09:25.360
I'll take it with the Queen.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.960
Linode.com slash coder.

09:26.960 --> 09:31.400
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

09:31.400 --> 09:32.400
show.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.560
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting, perfect for developers.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.040
You got to try it for your next project.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.520
It's what we use for everything we've deployed in the last couple of years.

09:40.520 --> 09:45.480
I was using it last night, deploying a new server, and I always love doing that because

09:45.480 --> 09:47.600
there's always something new to try.

09:47.600 --> 09:52.720
This time we were putting NixOS on our Linode, something we want to experiment with, and

09:52.720 --> 09:58.000
they have a handy guide that they updated semi-recently to help us figure it all out.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.560
It took us a little bit because we tried to do it the hard way and then we realized there's

10:02.560 --> 10:05.200
actually a much simpler way to do it.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.600
What's so great about Linode is it's one click deployment stuff.

10:07.600 --> 10:12.580
If you want something just really approachable, I'm talking like a lot of common open source

10:12.580 --> 10:18.160
and free software applications, GitLab, Jitsi, ZoomKiller type stuff, you know, just really

10:18.160 --> 10:22.560
good productivity apps like NextCloud and a bunch of gaming stuff and all kinds of stuff

10:22.560 --> 10:25.320
for developer back end tools that I never really mentioned on the show, but they're

10:25.320 --> 10:26.320
all there.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.320
They're worth checking out.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.120
It's a great way to support the show too, but you can go all the way down to the metal

10:30.120 --> 10:32.000
if you want, and that's what I love about Linode.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.160
They let you go as far as you want.

10:33.160 --> 10:38.320
Plus they got 11 data centers around the world, fantastic performance, and I hear that the

10:38.320 --> 10:39.320
support is great.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.960
I've never really had any trouble.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.880
Their documentation's always really been able to cover anything I needed.

10:43.880 --> 10:47.200
One time when I was creating like a monster server, they're like contact support and let

10:47.200 --> 10:48.200
us know what you're doing.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.600
And that was a great experience, but I'll have in the show notes, I'll have a link to

10:52.600 --> 10:54.100
a white paper.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.100
It's really an ebook.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.100
It's not a white paper.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.520
It's an ebook that Linode has published.

10:58.520 --> 11:04.080
It's a free ebook that covers infrastructure as code, and it's a step-by-step guide and

11:04.080 --> 11:07.520
a high level look at Terraform, Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and Salt.

11:07.520 --> 11:11.400
If you're kind of curious if there's something maybe from one of these tools or a couple

11:11.400 --> 11:15.640
of these tools combined that you could use to make your infrastructure better, maybe

11:15.640 --> 11:19.340
a little more consistent, a little easier to deploy, a little quicker to deploy, more

11:19.340 --> 11:23.120
consistent backend infrastructure, this ebook's pretty good.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.840
I've gotten some great feedback last time I mentioned this on the show, so I'm gonna

11:25.840 --> 11:26.840
give it another plug.

11:26.840 --> 11:31.480
Go learn about Terraform and Ansible and Puppet, Chef, and Salt in Linode's Infrastructure

11:31.480 --> 11:32.480
as Code ebook.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.700
We'll have a link in the show notes, totes free.

11:34.700 --> 11:35.840
Don't even need to give them your info.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.680
You just, I'll have a link directly to it in the show notes, and they've got all kinds

11:38.680 --> 11:42.480
of great resources like that over at Linode, including a weekly security digest and all

11:42.480 --> 11:46.600
kinds of stuff that just covers the industry in the nuts and bolts stuff, so if you're

11:46.600 --> 11:49.320
in the space, it's something you need to know about.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.320
Linode's all over it.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.360
It's part of the job.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.960
It's all just part of what makes them a great host.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.240
Go check them out, support the show, and try something.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.840
Go learn something.

11:57.840 --> 12:02.280
Linode.com slash coder.

12:02.280 --> 12:07.520
So Build 2022 was last week, and there was some things.

12:07.520 --> 12:11.460
There was some things, but probably the thing that I thought would be the most interesting

12:11.460 --> 12:16.520
to chat with you about is how Microsoft seems to be really going in on Project Volterra,

12:16.520 --> 12:19.760
which is this ARM-based mini PC designed for Windows developers.

12:19.760 --> 12:26.160
It's gonna have a Qualcomm Snapdragon in there, and they're making a big stink about the fact

12:26.160 --> 12:28.360
that it has a neural processing unit.

12:28.360 --> 12:32.240
In fact, Microsoft's gonna build some facilities into Windows.

12:32.240 --> 12:36.880
Surface Pro X has the SQ1, which was co-developed by Qualcomm as well.

12:36.880 --> 12:43.400
They're really going all in on NPUs, and Microsoft said in a quote, one of their devs, or actually

12:43.400 --> 12:50.280
he's an EVP, they expect NPUs, neural processing units, to be built into most, if not all future

12:50.280 --> 12:54.680
devices, phones, desktop, servers, everything, and we're gonna make it easy for developers

12:54.680 --> 12:59.560
to leverage these new capabilities by baking support for NPUs into the next end-to-end

12:59.560 --> 13:00.560
Windows platform.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.880
That's nice, it doesn't matter.

13:02.880 --> 13:03.880
No?

13:03.880 --> 13:04.880
Nope.

13:04.880 --> 13:09.040
The M1 will always be better for the foreseeable future.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.220
This might not be shocking, but the developers who don't use Windows, which I think are frankly

13:13.220 --> 13:18.320
a lot of them and a good percentage of our audience here, are not using Windows because

13:18.320 --> 13:20.100
they really need a neural processor.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.560
They're not using Windows because it's goddamn Windows.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.360
I agree with you there.

13:25.360 --> 13:31.960
I feel like when you got Apple and Microsoft really pushing neural processing stuff on

13:31.960 --> 13:35.200
their platforms, I think you will actually see it take off.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.920
See I disagree that it doesn't matter because I don't think the neural processor has made

13:39.920 --> 13:41.320
much of a difference.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.720
They both have the same problem.

13:42.720 --> 13:43.720
New?

13:43.720 --> 13:45.760
No, they're proprietary.

13:45.760 --> 13:49.720
So if I'm selling a customer, and we do it all the time, right?

13:49.720 --> 13:54.680
We have the folks in Canada, we have Raspberry Pis and Surface tablets, but the big problem

13:54.680 --> 13:58.200
with the Surface tablets is that they're Windows.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.200
Same thing with anything Apple-powered, right?

14:00.200 --> 14:05.360
iPads are great, except, oh my God, code signing is a bitch and you have to deal with Apple's

14:05.360 --> 14:11.960
nonsense and somebody might get a new MacBook and, oh, you didn't save the private key and

14:11.960 --> 14:16.280
now you can't code sign, now you got to reinstall the app manually.

14:16.280 --> 14:20.240
I agree, I guess, that neural processing is going to be important, but it's going to be

14:20.240 --> 14:23.840
important on BSD or Linux.

14:23.840 --> 14:28.520
No one's going to be out there selling, except for the super high end, people that don't

14:28.520 --> 14:33.640
care about the licensing and restrictions, Microsoft and Apple devices.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.440
Now I'm going to twist this on you a little.

14:36.440 --> 14:42.520
To me, the real sadness is iPads could dominate the enterprise.

14:42.520 --> 14:49.680
If Apple would just let go of their restrictions on self-published app deployment, it just

14:49.680 --> 14:50.760
needs to be open.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.720
You just need to be able to write an app.

14:53.720 --> 14:57.800
Install it on a bunch of devices and not have to do the code signing, not have to, oh, you

14:57.800 --> 15:02.960
have more than a thousand people, well, now you have to, you know, do, what is it they

15:02.960 --> 15:06.400
required the enterprise certificate, I forgot the name for the certificate, there's like

15:06.400 --> 15:13.960
a certification process and you have to renew it every year and it's just, ugh, you know,

15:13.960 --> 15:19.320
an iPad dies, you get a new iPad, now you have to deregister one, it's a whole manual,

15:19.320 --> 15:20.760
terrible process.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.240
I agree.

15:22.240 --> 15:29.160
I think it's still fascinating from how is it going to compare to the M1 or really, potentially

15:29.160 --> 15:34.520
since WWDC is next week, how is it going to compare to the M2, so that's going to be fascinating.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.720
What's it like because you're going to be able to run desktop applications on this thing,

15:37.720 --> 15:41.200
you're going to be able to run IDEs, you're going to be able to do a comparison of what

15:41.200 --> 15:45.320
it feels like to use these applications on these two different platforms.

15:45.320 --> 15:50.640
I agree with you and, you know, I'm not saying that Microsoft does everything wrong.

15:50.640 --> 15:53.960
How's Mavi going, did we mention Mavi?

15:53.960 --> 15:56.400
No, check that box off.

15:56.400 --> 16:01.360
Also, may I have my $40,000 back for Windows Phone, please?

16:01.360 --> 16:04.000
You know what's funny to me about this, so you're kind of touching on it, doesn't it

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
kind of feel like part of what Build was about and part of what Google IO was about was bringing

16:10.000 --> 16:14.640
back old stuff they've tried before that didn't work because along with this ARM box, right,

16:14.640 --> 16:19.080
they announced, oh and yeah, we're going to get Visual Studio 2022 ported to ARM, we're

16:19.080 --> 16:21.720
going to get Visual Studio Code, we're going to get Windows Terminal.

16:21.720 --> 16:25.160
Wasn't it 2019 that was supposed to work on ARM, am I mistaken?

16:25.160 --> 16:26.640
I feel like that was a promise.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.760
Yep, you're right.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.960
And now they're saying, but now, and Teams, of course, you got to get Teams on ARM, we're

16:30.960 --> 16:32.280
going to get all this and it's...

16:32.280 --> 16:38.760
I went to the mechanic today, they called me, they wanted their $1,000 because they

16:38.760 --> 16:41.120
can't do anything correctly.

16:41.120 --> 16:47.360
But these new Firestone tires I'm buying come with Teams for free and Office 365.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.800
Hey, yeah, comes bundled with a year of Teams.

16:49.800 --> 16:57.400
Teams can run apparently on everything, petrified rubber, my son's butt when he's pooping, Teams

16:57.400 --> 16:58.400
is there.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.400
It's there, man.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.400
You can send an emoji, a poop emoji.

17:00.400 --> 17:04.640
You know, and if you need to store your files, you can do that too.

17:04.640 --> 17:08.280
Let's be honest, don't we all need to be in a team?

17:08.280 --> 17:10.160
I want to be part of a team, you know.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.160
See?

17:11.160 --> 17:12.160
They should have called it tribes.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.160
No.

17:13.160 --> 17:17.480
Also, they mentioned they're doing the move that Apple did where they're going to reach

17:17.480 --> 17:23.040
to different Python projects and LLVM and other large infrastructure projects to try

17:23.040 --> 17:28.000
to get them to port their stuff over to this Windows ARM platform.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.640
Microsoft following Apple since 1982.

17:29.640 --> 17:36.680
Well, if you don't like buying hardware, Microsoft also announced the Microsoft DevBox, a cloud

17:36.680 --> 17:41.080
service that includes applications and services designed for developers to quickly access

17:41.080 --> 17:43.460
pre-configured developer workstations.

17:43.460 --> 17:47.100
It's built on top of the foundations of Windows 365.

17:47.100 --> 17:50.040
The DevBox will work via any modern browser.

17:50.040 --> 17:54.720
It supports integrated IDEs, software development kits, or any other tool that you can run on

17:54.720 --> 18:01.080
top of Windows, and they pitch it to the CTOs out there, to the boss man, as the Microsoft

18:01.080 --> 18:06.520
DevBox lets teams create and maintain DevBox images with all the tools and dependencies

18:06.520 --> 18:10.000
their devs need to build and run their applications.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.840
Devs can include their application source code and nightly built binaries, enabling

18:14.840 --> 18:22.360
devs to immediately start running and understanding the code without having to wait for long rebuilds.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.160
You're going to make your team more efficient now.

18:24.160 --> 18:29.360
Stop buying them Thalios and Macbooks and start just giving them a web browser with

18:29.360 --> 18:30.640
a Microsoft DevBox.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.760
It's not going to happen.

18:32.760 --> 18:33.760
No?

18:33.760 --> 18:36.400
I mean, it could be perfect for a guy like you.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.440
You don't even have to wait now for the hardware to arrive.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.640
Supply chain issues?

18:40.640 --> 18:47.160
It requires them to have a good internet connection, and we live in America.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.160
Of course, because it's Microsoft too, you're going to be able to manage it with things

18:50.160 --> 18:54.880
like Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Manager, so the idea is IT admins could mass provision

18:54.880 --> 18:59.880
these things, and the public preview will be available in the next few months.

18:59.880 --> 19:04.680
This is cool for the enterprise, but for little guys like us, do you know that every employee

19:04.680 --> 19:07.200
you hire in Alabama has a good internet connection?

19:07.200 --> 19:09.480
No, yeah, I agree.

19:09.480 --> 19:13.840
I mean, it is probably more common when you're hiring for a high-tech industry.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.880
It's probably more common that they have a good connection.

19:16.880 --> 19:22.980
I know we have listeners out there that are working on the daily in a cloud-based session.

19:22.980 --> 19:23.980
Maybe it's Citrix.

19:23.980 --> 19:24.980
Maybe it's something else.

19:24.980 --> 19:26.480
Well, we had the cloud nine, right?

19:26.480 --> 19:27.480
We talked about cloud nine.

19:27.480 --> 19:32.600
People would just literally, their IDE is a cloud IDE in Safari or Chrome or whatever.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.400
I want to get some real-world impressions.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.820
Send us an email or send us a boost.

19:36.820 --> 19:41.720
Just in and let us know how is working in the cloud, like in a remote cloud session,

19:41.720 --> 19:42.840
how is it day-to-day?

19:42.840 --> 19:44.200
Have you had issues?

19:44.200 --> 19:46.240
Is this something people are interested in?

19:46.240 --> 19:51.120
Because I'm so disconnected from the Windows world, I don't really know, but to me, I can

19:51.120 --> 19:55.080
only see the value in a scenario where you actually have people coming into the office,

19:55.080 --> 19:59.280
and then they remote into this occasionally from home, and they get the same environment,

19:59.280 --> 20:03.160
but in the office, you could actually ensure that they have the right equipment, they have

20:03.160 --> 20:06.640
the right connection, and then they have a remote session if they need it to work from

20:06.640 --> 20:07.640
home.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.640
Couldn't they just use a laptop then though?

20:08.640 --> 20:13.080
Like they have, they take their laptop home with them and right, it's the same thing.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.080
Yeah.

20:14.080 --> 20:18.800
I think this is maybe the effort to replace the laptop.

20:18.800 --> 20:23.520
You know, I think corporations like it because it keeps all your data behind their wall.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.520
Well, right.

20:24.520 --> 20:28.480
You fire somebody, you just flip a switch, literally a toggle under their name and they're

20:28.480 --> 20:29.480
gone, right?

20:29.480 --> 20:30.480
And they can't touch it.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.920
And that's going to be handy over the summer, right?

20:33.920 --> 20:35.600
Not to be crass about it.

20:35.600 --> 20:39.720
But there is an element of being able to just turn it off and all your data is safe.

20:39.720 --> 20:43.600
All your secrets.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.860
Tailscale.com slash coder.

20:45.860 --> 20:48.680
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.560
And of course you support the show.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.160
Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.160
It installs on any device in minutes.

20:55.160 --> 21:00.040
In fact, if you haven't put it on all your devices yet, go take five minutes and get

21:00.040 --> 21:01.040
it going.

21:01.040 --> 21:04.400
That's legit all you're going to need to get Tailscale up and connected and build your

21:04.400 --> 21:07.160
own flat, decentralized network.

21:07.160 --> 21:11.880
I was building something sneaky this weekend, something I didn't want to put out there publicly

21:11.880 --> 21:15.800
yet, but I wanted to be able to get the DNS right and make sure the web app was resolving.

21:15.800 --> 21:20.240
Actually, I wanted to set everything up, even like email notifications about new accounts,

21:20.240 --> 21:21.240
all of that.

21:21.240 --> 21:24.160
And I was doing it all behind Tailscale this weekend.

21:24.160 --> 21:30.400
It's a WireGuard powered mesh VPN that is absurdly quick and simple to get up and going.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.240
You're really going to be impressed.

21:32.240 --> 21:35.880
When I hear about friends struggling getting WireGuard up and going or getting OpenVPN

21:35.880 --> 21:40.920
up and going, I just tell them about Tailscale.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.520
It's an always on VPN.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.080
They're super clever about the routing.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.760
They'll support DNS if you want to go that direction.

21:46.760 --> 21:51.400
And you can get it up for free for 20 devices when you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.960
I have it running on just about everything I own, really.

21:53.960 --> 21:58.760
From my iOS devices to my Raspberry Pis running Arch and OpenSUSE.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.080
I have it on my VPSs.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.660
I have it on VMware.

22:01.660 --> 22:03.160
I have it on Proxmox.

22:03.160 --> 22:07.300
I've got it on a machine that's just running in boxes, like all of them, right?

22:07.300 --> 22:09.320
It's so, so perfect for my needs.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.440
I didn't even really appreciate it at first.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.720
Initially, I just kind of thought it was, oh, I'll get to my web apps.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.400
Oh, I can do support for my family.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.520
And then I just kept building on top of that.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.840
I think you will too.

22:18.840 --> 22:22.960
And you can use it for free up to 20 devices when you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

22:22.960 --> 22:26.680
They also write on their blog about how they keep that plan sustainable.

22:26.680 --> 22:29.920
So those free plans don't compete with the paid plans.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.400
They have a lot of long-term thinking in their planning, and I like that too.

22:33.400 --> 22:40.280
Go try them out and support the show, tailscale.com slash coder.

22:40.280 --> 22:46.120
Well your dreams may be coming true because Cydia, their creator, may have a little success

22:46.120 --> 22:51.040
with their antitrust lawsuit against Apple because Apple has just lost a bid to dismiss

22:51.040 --> 22:55.320
the antitrust lawsuit filed against it by Jay Freeman, the creator of the alternative

22:55.320 --> 23:00.040
app store known as Cydia Society, I can't remember, for jailbroken iPhones and iPads.

23:00.040 --> 23:05.800
He sued in late 2020 alleging that Apple had an illegal monopoly over iOS app distribution

23:05.800 --> 23:07.160
through the app store.

23:07.160 --> 23:11.760
His complaint also alleged that Apple consistently tried to snuff out alternative app stores

23:11.760 --> 23:17.920
and indicates there was a specific changes that were made between 2018 and 2021 that

23:17.920 --> 23:21.320
were overt acts designed to harm iOS app stores.

23:21.320 --> 23:26.240
And according to the report, the lawsuit seeks to open the market for iOS app distribution

23:26.240 --> 23:31.160
and iOS app payment processing to those who wish to compete fairly with Apple.

23:31.160 --> 23:36.520
And he hopes to recover enormous damages Apple caused by, you know, removing them.

23:36.520 --> 23:39.160
And Apple tried to get this whole thing just tossed out.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.000
Now, this is ridiculous.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.680
Let's get rid of it, Apple said.

23:42.680 --> 23:49.600
They were momentarily successful, but it has been dismissed and the antitrust lawsuit is

23:49.600 --> 23:50.600
back on.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.440
Well, the motion, the motion to dismiss was dismissed, right?

23:53.440 --> 23:54.440
Not yet.

23:54.440 --> 23:55.440
Not not the case.

23:55.440 --> 23:56.440
Yeah.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.560
So the case, I guess the way to put it is the case isn't back on.

23:57.560 --> 23:58.560
The case may proceed.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.560
Right.

23:59.560 --> 24:00.560
Right.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.560
Apple attempted to stop it.

24:01.560 --> 24:02.560
Right.

24:02.560 --> 24:06.840
And anybody who's ever been to court, which I sincerely hope you never have to go, but

24:06.840 --> 24:09.640
the opening move is usually let's try to dismiss this.

24:09.640 --> 24:10.640
Right.

24:10.640 --> 24:11.640
Everybody.

24:11.640 --> 24:12.640
Everybody.

24:12.640 --> 24:13.640
It's like a it's like a two page motion.

24:13.640 --> 24:14.640
They file it.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.640
It's great.

24:15.640 --> 24:16.640
I'm not a lawyer.

24:16.640 --> 24:17.800
Get the hell out of here.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.560
But children, are we ready to we is he is Mr.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.560
Cain here?

24:22.560 --> 24:23.560
Oh, yeah.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.560
You want to tell us a little story?

24:24.560 --> 24:27.200
Stay a while and listen.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.640
City is going to lose.

24:28.640 --> 24:34.640
They're going to lose because all this antitrust crap requires you to define the market.

24:34.640 --> 24:40.680
And as our brother in Christ, Tim Sweeney, learned the hard way, the market isn't iPhone

24:40.680 --> 24:45.260
distribution for apps and the market is software.

24:45.260 --> 24:47.400
So you have alternatives.

24:47.400 --> 24:52.680
You can buy a piece of phone called an Android device that mines your data and treats you

24:52.680 --> 24:53.760
like crap.

24:53.760 --> 25:00.120
You can be like me and hold on to your purple HTC, Windows Phone eight and cry and shake.

25:00.120 --> 25:03.040
Tim, it was so good.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.040
And be sad.

25:04.040 --> 25:09.800
You could be like that guy who now works at Google after leaving the Verge, Dieter and

25:09.800 --> 25:13.080
weep over your WebOS device.

25:13.080 --> 25:19.000
But the reality is the way the laws are written, and I feel pretty confident in saying this,

25:19.000 --> 25:25.600
Apple is going to win because you can't just be like Apple being a bee is not, you know,

25:25.600 --> 25:27.640
the market is software.

25:27.640 --> 25:31.360
I think the game question is interesting, although the city is not going for the games.

25:31.360 --> 25:37.680
But like Epic brought up the well, it's game development, but the consoles have the same

25:37.680 --> 25:40.040
structure in their business deals.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.720
So yes.

25:41.720 --> 25:46.540
So Cydia doesn't have that much money and Apple is I don't know if you've ever heard

25:46.540 --> 25:47.540
of them.

25:47.540 --> 25:49.240
They're a little shop out of California.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.400
I hear they have some coins in the bank.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.400
This is the thing.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.000
This is what I was going to say.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.420
Apple could afford to just bleed them.

25:55.420 --> 25:56.420
They will bleed them.

25:56.420 --> 25:57.420
Right.

25:57.420 --> 25:58.520
They're going to file motion after motion.

25:58.520 --> 26:01.440
So for our younger audience, I believe you to the people all the time.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.440
Right.

26:02.440 --> 26:06.040
They would have these lawsuits that got filed against them and they would just file.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.040
What was it?

26:07.040 --> 26:08.040
What was the guy's name?

26:08.040 --> 26:13.600
He was black in the sky with frivolous motions just to believe it was like they used to they

26:13.600 --> 26:19.160
used to call the IBM lawyers the Nazgul, which for those who don't know are the bad guys

26:19.160 --> 26:23.300
and Lord of the Rings, the dark guys, you know, the hooded folks with the swords that

26:23.300 --> 26:26.120
are running around looking for Frodo.

26:26.120 --> 26:30.560
Like that's the kind of that they're going to do.

26:30.560 --> 26:34.980
Because they've done it before they continue to do it.

26:34.980 --> 26:38.240
Just to your point, though, about Android being a total dumpster fire that spies on

26:38.240 --> 26:39.240
its users.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.240
Nice.

26:40.240 --> 26:43.800
Two days ago, as we record, Microsoft announced that they found several secure bugs in Android

26:43.800 --> 26:49.600
apps, multiple CVEs, one, two, three, four CVEs.

26:49.600 --> 26:53.240
And the best part is, and they write right here, the vulnerable apps have millions of

26:53.240 --> 26:55.500
downloads on Google Play Store.

26:55.500 --> 27:02.560
They come pre-installed as system applications on devices bought by AT&T, Telus, Rogers Communications,

27:02.560 --> 27:05.880
Bell Canada and Freedom Mobile on top of that.

27:05.880 --> 27:09.320
They were straight up available on the Google Play Store and they went through Google plays

27:09.320 --> 27:11.860
protect automatic safety checks.

27:11.860 --> 27:14.500
But the safety checks weren't checking for these issues.

27:14.500 --> 27:18.760
And because the a lot of the apps that were installed by the via the image actually had

27:18.760 --> 27:20.500
system level privileges.

27:20.500 --> 27:25.640
So this actually led to all kinds of problems because the apps had root access and you could

27:25.640 --> 27:27.280
only remove them if you have root access.

27:27.280 --> 27:32.040
And the only way to update them is to ship a new image to the device.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
So you wipe the.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.520
Unless you installed it via the Play Store somehow, then you can update it via the Play

27:35.520 --> 27:36.520
Store.

27:36.520 --> 27:39.880
Yeah, you know, it's it's we talk about it sideways, but we never really hit the heart

27:39.880 --> 27:40.920
of this.

27:40.920 --> 27:45.240
The level of dumpster fire that Android is, especially tablets.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.380
They're going back to tablets.

27:46.380 --> 27:47.380
Are they nuts?

27:47.380 --> 27:52.880
I mean, I would love Android to win just so I don't have to do a code signing for enterprise

27:52.880 --> 27:54.440
deployments.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.840
But God damn, it's so.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.660
Have you used a modern Android tablet?

27:58.660 --> 28:02.600
I've only used recently the fire tablets and they are garbage.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.480
No, you got to you got to use the big ones.

28:05.480 --> 28:10.180
Even the nice ones, the Samsung ones, the apps, they're just no one is programing thinking

28:10.180 --> 28:11.680
of a tablet display.

28:11.680 --> 28:12.680
That's the thing.

28:12.680 --> 28:13.680
There's not a big enough user.

28:13.680 --> 28:14.680
Yeah.

28:14.680 --> 28:15.680
And it's they just it's crap.

28:15.680 --> 28:18.000
I mean, it's it's just terrible.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Who?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Yeah.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.880
And the thing is, is like for people listening to this show, they are savvy enough that they

28:24.880 --> 28:26.200
can navigate this stuff.

28:26.200 --> 28:30.760
They could put their own lineage on there or they can patch it or they get a pixel or

28:30.760 --> 28:32.760
they get a high end Android device.

28:32.760 --> 28:37.640
But we all have family members or friends or acquaintances that are not savvy with this

28:37.640 --> 28:38.640
stuff.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.480
And they end up getting the really crappy Android devices.

28:40.480 --> 28:44.040
And it's and let's be honest, they're playing Angry Birds, too, and they're fine.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.040
All right.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.040
Let's shift gears.

28:46.040 --> 28:48.280
Let's talk about the other monster in the room.

28:48.280 --> 28:58.480
It looks like we are getting some pretty solid pre WWDC leaks and reality OS has been trademarked

28:58.480 --> 28:59.640
by Apple.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.960
They tried to trademark it overseas.

29:01.960 --> 29:08.160
And then they also have a foreign filing date of June 8th, which is right around WWDC.

29:08.160 --> 29:12.080
Two days after WWDC.

29:12.080 --> 29:19.080
And they have another filing on the U.S. Patent Office website with a deadline of June 9th,

29:19.080 --> 29:21.080
2022.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.080
Reality OS.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.080
What do you think?

29:24.080 --> 29:28.400
You think we're going to get a mixed reality device from Apple this year?

29:28.400 --> 29:30.600
No, I think it's an extension of ARKit.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.040
I mean, would they even release a device?

29:33.040 --> 29:34.040
No.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.040
Right.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.360
This would be start building at WWDC.

29:36.360 --> 29:37.360
Yeah.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.600
This is like we've added these APIs.

29:39.600 --> 29:44.320
I mean, I think this could be an opportunity for our listeners, myself included.

29:44.320 --> 29:47.320
But there's going to be no headset, no visor, nothing like that.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.320
Yeah.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.240
I mean, maybe later this year.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.240
Couple of years.

29:51.240 --> 29:56.760
The only thing that gives me pause is they really like to compete with Facebook.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.320
Well, they personally hate each other.

29:59.320 --> 30:00.320
So.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.320
Yes.

30:01.320 --> 30:04.240
And, you know, the Oculus 3 is about to come out.

30:04.240 --> 30:08.160
So if they want to, you know, get a jumpstart, I mean, that's almost like the perfect that's

30:08.160 --> 30:12.480
almost the way Apple does it, right, a couple of years, a couple of revisions of the Android

30:12.480 --> 30:13.480
version.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.960
And then they come out right around the Android versions getting division version three.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.720
They come out with their fully baked product generally.

30:19.720 --> 30:20.720
I just don't see it.

30:20.720 --> 30:26.720
I think it's too soon, given Apple's propensity for, you know, a thin design, one taking forever.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.560
And also, I mean, OK, this is nerdy.

30:29.560 --> 30:33.160
I've been reading a lot about lithium ion batteries because that's what people do when

30:33.160 --> 30:37.760
they are psychologically disturbed.

30:37.760 --> 30:42.960
I just I don't see it like like an actual AR headset that you would want to wear.

30:42.960 --> 30:43.960
Right.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.120
That does things that make sense.

30:46.120 --> 30:50.760
The battery technology isn't there at the at the size you need it to be.

30:50.760 --> 30:51.760
Right.

30:51.760 --> 30:52.760
Yeah.

30:52.760 --> 30:53.760
Not without multiple charging in a day.

30:53.760 --> 30:54.760
Right.

30:54.760 --> 30:55.760
For a device like that.

30:55.760 --> 30:56.760
Right.

30:56.760 --> 30:57.760
Right.

30:57.760 --> 30:58.760
Right.

30:58.760 --> 30:59.760
Yeah.

30:59.760 --> 31:00.760
I see where you're going.

31:00.760 --> 31:01.760
I'm talking about you put your VR glasses on at seven a.m.

31:01.760 --> 31:02.760
You come home from work at six.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.280
You know, you take them off when you have your nightcap.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.320
That's not possible.

31:06.320 --> 31:12.320
I agree, although I could see Apple setting the benchmark for that at like the air pods.

31:12.320 --> 31:15.800
The last as long as your air pods last kind of a thing, which anybody who's been in meetings

31:15.800 --> 31:19.840
all day know it's like, you know, it's like four hours, five hours, maybe if you're lucky.

31:19.840 --> 31:20.840
Right.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.720
The last as long as your air pods, perhaps.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.620
And everybody seems to be fine with that.

31:24.620 --> 31:27.240
So maybe that's what they'll do.

31:27.240 --> 31:34.700
But yeah, I think no device next week, if anything, an expansion on AR and maybe hardware.

31:34.700 --> 31:42.460
The rumor mill is clucking pretty hard about M2 hardware, updated Macs, things like that.

31:42.460 --> 31:45.680
We could see any we could see things like that coming out next week, I suppose.

31:45.680 --> 31:46.680
You know, those kinds of things.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.320
It doesn't really matter until it happens.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.500
You got the keynote June six.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.560
Do you think it's at 10 a.m.?

31:52.560 --> 31:55.240
So it's that's two hours earlier than we normally start.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.520
Should we live stream it?

31:56.520 --> 31:59.260
Should we just get together after it's we probably should just get together after it's

31:59.260 --> 32:00.260
done, huh?

32:00.260 --> 32:01.260
You know what we should do?

32:01.260 --> 32:05.520
We should do it after the keynote when they're doing actual announcements, because the keynote,

32:05.520 --> 32:09.080
you know, they do their touchy feely crap about whatever.

32:09.080 --> 32:14.040
And then you got the State of the Union at 1 p.m., which is usually about an hour after

32:14.040 --> 32:15.040
after we start recording.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.140
I'm super curious about the M2.

32:17.140 --> 32:18.640
Like is it just going to be more cores?

32:18.640 --> 32:21.480
I got to be honest with you, I'm loving my M1 MacBook Air.

32:21.480 --> 32:25.920
I have absolutely no reason other than my sudden eyes ability to destroy things.

32:25.920 --> 32:28.880
Yes, I'm blaming the child.

32:28.880 --> 32:29.880
I kind of want an M2.

32:29.880 --> 32:38.280
I just want to because I'm sitting in front of my iMac Pro and I will admit that I'm frankly

32:38.280 --> 32:40.240
I'm disappointed in it.

32:40.240 --> 32:44.680
It's not as powerful as the MacBook Air, which is the most shameful thing it can be.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.680
I don't know.

32:45.680 --> 32:49.420
I think the next couple of years of this industry are going to be in terms of chips competing

32:49.420 --> 32:51.400
with the M series processors.

32:51.400 --> 32:58.200
I think where Apple is still lagging and the X86 world still has them lapped is the higher

32:58.200 --> 33:03.120
end GPU area and so that's an area where the M2 could really kind of compete, you know?

33:03.120 --> 33:04.120
No, that's fair.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.120
That's fair, right?

33:05.120 --> 33:06.120
Yeah, we'll see.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.120
We'll see.

33:07.120 --> 33:10.600
I don't think there's much they could announce that would get me to crack open the old pocketbook.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.600
Things are tight these days.

33:11.600 --> 33:12.600
Oh, same.

33:12.600 --> 33:13.600
It's going to be a big problem.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.600
Yeah.

33:14.600 --> 33:15.600
Yeah, no, I'm not.

33:15.600 --> 33:22.360
I mean, the M2 would have to like literally make me a martini, be purple and because,

33:22.360 --> 33:23.360
you know, on brand.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.360
Yeah.

33:24.360 --> 33:25.360
I couldn't even imagine.

33:25.360 --> 33:28.280
I actually can't think of the case where I would buy it, to be honest with you.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.280
I can't either.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.560
I mean, we may eat these words.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.840
Apple is particularly good at convincing us that we need the new stuff.

33:34.840 --> 33:40.120
As both of us are hard typing our credit card numbers and live on the air next week.

33:40.120 --> 33:42.840
Yeah, it has happened.

33:42.840 --> 33:48.360
But I'm just thinking with the economy and the overall bear market conditions and how

33:48.360 --> 33:49.360
it's like, you know, cutting back.

33:49.360 --> 33:54.280
Like, I just spent 60 bucks this morning filling up my tiny little golf with gas, right?

33:54.280 --> 33:59.720
I got a little VW Golf and I'm putting 60 bucks, 62 bucks worth of gas in there.

33:59.720 --> 34:00.720
Tell me about it, brother.

34:00.720 --> 34:01.720
Tell me.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.800
Yeah, it's just like things are just tight right now.

34:03.800 --> 34:08.260
But here's what I think I'll do is I think I'll I'll stream it on Jupiter tube, which

34:08.260 --> 34:09.280
is our peer tube instance.

34:09.280 --> 34:14.200
I cannot stream the WWDC stream anywhere else or else I get in serious copyright trouble.

34:14.200 --> 34:15.200
You really?

34:15.200 --> 34:19.160
Yeah, it's so dumb because it's they don't want their own freaking press event to be

34:19.160 --> 34:20.160
covered.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.160
Apple does it.

34:21.160 --> 34:25.360
Apple abuses copyright law to force people to tune into their stream so you get it directly

34:25.360 --> 34:26.360
from them.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.880
But the reality is commentary on a news event is 100 percent fair use.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.240
Yeah, that's fair use.

34:31.240 --> 34:33.020
Yeah, but the bots don't care.

34:33.020 --> 34:34.240
The bots don't care about fair use.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.240
They just shut your.

34:35.240 --> 34:40.320
In fact, the biggest trouble our YouTube channel ever got in and it's still in trouble right

34:40.320 --> 34:41.320
now.

34:41.320 --> 34:46.680
It won't it won't clear until next week is when I streamed WWDC last time and they they

34:46.680 --> 34:48.500
put me in the doghouse forever.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.720
So I'm just going to do it at Jupiter dot tube.

34:50.720 --> 34:55.680
I've got a new instance I've set up and I'll just stream it there and just mostly have

34:55.680 --> 34:56.680
it playing.

34:56.680 --> 35:00.300
So that way I have commentary ready for Coder, you know, and then we'll get connected our

35:00.300 --> 35:01.300
regular time.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.300
We'll do the show.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.300
We'll cover it.

35:03.300 --> 35:06.320
And, you know, if anything relevant happened, we'll talk about it.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.440
Otherwise, we'll just focus on other stuff.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.440
It's I think something cool is going to happen.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.480
I actually am optimistic.

35:12.480 --> 35:20.640
Here's what I'd like to ask is if you're watching WWDC live next week, open up your new podcast

35:20.640 --> 35:22.560
hosting app and send us a boost in with your thoughts.

35:22.560 --> 35:26.240
So that way we can get super fresh boosts about WWDC.

35:26.240 --> 35:30.360
I want your WWDC take in a boost, which means you're going to have to have this week's app

35:30.360 --> 35:32.360
pause it before the music is done at the end.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.800
So that way it's ready in your podcast player.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.120
Open up and send us a boost.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.400
So that way we can get super fresh boosts into the show.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.240
I mean, you can send us a boost anytime, too.

35:39.240 --> 35:40.240
We love your boosts.

35:40.240 --> 35:44.520
But I think that'd be pretty neat to get people's live reaction on that kind of stuff because,

35:44.520 --> 35:47.320
you know, I'd like to know how people take it because Mike and I have our opinions,

35:47.320 --> 35:51.320
but not everybody sees it the same way.

35:51.320 --> 35:57.640
Speaking of boosts, Freak sent in 15,000 sats and he says, here's some sats for your Mexican

35:57.640 --> 35:58.640
dentist.

35:58.640 --> 35:59.640
Thank you.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.640
I am.

36:00.640 --> 36:01.640
I am looking.

36:01.640 --> 36:02.640
I have a hole.

36:02.640 --> 36:05.960
I cracked a tooth and I realize I actually have another tooth that needs a problem as

36:05.960 --> 36:07.000
a problem.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.360
I got all kinds of dental issues.

36:08.360 --> 36:14.400
So right now I'm looking into local dentist clinics because they have like membership

36:14.400 --> 36:17.280
options and they want to like the work with you on payments.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.280
I'm looking into that.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.980
But I am also considering the Mexican dentist.

36:20.980 --> 36:25.320
So I appreciate it for actually I appreciate it more than people probably realize because

36:25.320 --> 36:28.260
I get messages like that when they come in, it's like, you know, we really do have a great

36:28.260 --> 36:29.260
audience.

36:29.260 --> 36:30.260
It never happens.

36:30.260 --> 36:31.260
We have a great audience.

36:31.260 --> 36:35.400
So Cyan Deer boosted in with five thousand sats two days ago.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.200
And he says, I don't know what your problem is, Chris.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.840
Teeth are just luxury bones.

36:38.840 --> 36:44.520
Wow, that's a little rough, but I'll take it.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.520
I know.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.320
The Golden Dragon, a frequent booster.

36:47.320 --> 36:51.280
He comes in with my favorite dragon.

36:51.280 --> 36:52.800
You don't like the yellow dragon, huh?

36:52.800 --> 36:58.440
No, the yellow dragon made a made a poor merge into dev and we're fighting.

36:58.440 --> 37:03.160
Well, the Golden Dragon likes to boost in with a row of ducks.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.840
It's two, two, two, two.

37:04.840 --> 37:08.040
If you type that into a calculator, it looks like a row of ducks.

37:08.040 --> 37:15.960
Damn it, Chris, don't play that if my kids harassed, I will have five hours of goddamn

37:15.960 --> 37:16.960
duck tales.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.360
I know it's it's so great.

37:19.360 --> 37:24.960
He says, I do love me some bacon and that HP acquiring system 76 was crispy.

37:24.960 --> 37:25.960
Thanks for the show.

37:25.960 --> 37:26.960
As usual.

37:26.960 --> 37:27.960
You know what?

37:27.960 --> 37:33.520
My Draconic friend, I believe that I have no inside information, but I that is my bacon

37:33.520 --> 37:35.120
from now until the Ren Faire.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.120
I believe it.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.480
This dev one development is really interesting.

37:38.480 --> 37:42.200
They're going to buy them up like a fat kid buying a Twinkie.

37:42.200 --> 37:47.520
DPG boost in six days ago with five hundred stats says, hey, Chris and Mike, I know you

37:47.520 --> 37:51.880
guys have talked a lot about Heroku in the past, but with the recent crop of Heroku is

37:51.880 --> 37:52.880
dead articles.

37:52.880 --> 37:58.240
Have you guys checked out fly dot i o I just recently spun a go bot up there and it was

37:58.240 --> 37:59.240
actually a breeze.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.240
Thanks.

38:00.240 --> 38:01.240
Love the pod.

38:01.240 --> 38:04.800
So it's fly dot i o deploy app servers close to your users.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.440
Are you familiar with this?

38:06.440 --> 38:07.440
I am.

38:07.440 --> 38:08.440
I don't use it.

38:08.440 --> 38:09.440
I did a look at it.

38:09.440 --> 38:13.520
I ended up just using sticking with Doku and Docker containers, but it looks like a fine

38:13.520 --> 38:15.080
Heroku alternative.

38:15.080 --> 38:17.720
It's definitely a little more modern.

38:17.720 --> 38:18.720
So yeah.

38:18.720 --> 38:19.720
Yeah.

38:19.720 --> 38:20.720
I like it.

38:20.720 --> 38:21.920
I actually I think it looks really great.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.040
It looks like it's super quick to get up and going to.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.040
Yeah.

38:25.040 --> 38:29.280
Well, they have really good guides to if you're using like a stack that's not cray cray.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.000
You know, I don't know.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.880
Like if you have like a rails app or, you know, a flask app, you could deploy that in

38:34.880 --> 38:35.880
seconds.

38:35.880 --> 38:36.880
It's good stuff.

38:36.880 --> 38:40.440
Red greenery factor boosts in with 500 sats five days ago.

38:40.440 --> 38:41.440
Boost.

38:41.440 --> 38:44.360
I'm a longtime listener coming in with my first boost.

38:44.360 --> 38:45.800
Congratulations Red Green.

38:45.800 --> 38:49.480
I enjoy your guys' perspective on the market and current events and would appreciate more

38:49.480 --> 38:51.040
on filter show type content.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.520
I think you both have a unique perspective.

38:53.520 --> 38:57.880
We also got a boost from PL Trent who said he'd also be up for a filter crossover.

38:57.880 --> 38:59.680
So maybe we got to put that on the schedule sometime.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.760
Let our powers combine.

39:01.760 --> 39:02.760
Exactly.

39:02.760 --> 39:08.880
A middle aged dev boosted in with our last one, actually, no second to last one with

39:08.880 --> 39:09.880
500 sats.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.920
He says my two sats worth after hearing the note from Dan last week, who was sick of hearing

39:12.920 --> 39:13.920
about podcasting 2.0.

39:13.920 --> 39:19.040
If you're tired of boosts, I think what you ought to do is correlate the user feedback.

39:19.040 --> 39:22.680
You probably do this and then only mention the boost amounts when they're notably large,

39:22.680 --> 39:25.040
like, you know, 50,000 sats or more.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.840
And he says, you know, you could also mention I only spent 500 sats to say this.

39:27.840 --> 39:32.880
Yeah, I was going to say, hmm, this is also you could mention to Dan that there are chapters

39:32.880 --> 39:37.040
so he could skip past the boost easily, but he may have to get a new podcast app.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.040
That's true.

39:38.040 --> 39:39.040
We do have chapters.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.960
So just I just want to say middle aged dev.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.760
Perhaps there's another way to contribute.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.600
Perhaps you know, it's cold.

39:46.600 --> 39:50.860
Winter is coming in the mornings when you're having your coffee.

39:50.860 --> 39:52.920
And if you're Mike, your first bourbon of the day.

39:52.920 --> 39:53.920
Sure.

39:53.920 --> 39:57.260
You don't want to get dressed yet because you still have to shave and shower.

39:57.260 --> 40:00.120
But like you don't want to walk out in your boxers because your dong will be flapping

40:00.120 --> 40:01.120
about.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.120
Right.

40:02.120 --> 40:03.120
You want to be a gentleman about something.

40:03.120 --> 40:05.200
I don't know, Chris, the thing you could wear.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.200
It's like black, baby.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.880
And it's like really comfy.

40:07.880 --> 40:08.880
Yeah.

40:08.880 --> 40:13.280
So that they could work on a casual day, could work when you're getting out of the shower,

40:13.280 --> 40:14.640
maybe on a workday.

40:14.640 --> 40:18.280
Maybe you're it's your day off and you're smoking a cigar or if you're Chris, you have

40:18.280 --> 40:24.980
a you have a frickin joint that's the size of a baseball bat.

40:24.980 --> 40:26.560
What would you be wearing?

40:26.560 --> 40:30.000
Probably not a dress because we don't we don't do that.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.080
Not a sort of ceremonial garb.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.560
No, not.

40:33.560 --> 40:34.560
Yeah.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.560
Jacket.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.560
I'm not sure.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.560
Maybe you just got out of the back row.

40:39.560 --> 40:42.080
Oh, a row by a row.

40:42.080 --> 40:43.560
Yeah, we got to get those.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.000
You know, we got to get those going again.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.520
The robes are the best thing we've ever sold.

40:46.520 --> 40:47.520
I should say.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.520
I know.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.520
I know.

40:49.520 --> 40:50.520
It's great.

40:50.520 --> 40:51.520
The robes are the reason we do the show.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.440
So we're really just looking for clothing here.

40:53.440 --> 40:54.440
We're poor.

40:54.440 --> 40:58.240
We're still getting some access love, actually, if you can believe it.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.240
Oh, Jesus Christ.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.800
Four score and seven boosters go.

41:02.800 --> 41:07.440
S thumbs X boosted in with a thousand sat saying I love access.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.440
Still use it all the time.

41:08.440 --> 41:09.440
So there you go.

41:09.440 --> 41:11.120
And may God bless your soul.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.440
Yeah, really.

41:12.440 --> 41:16.840
We also got a thank you boost from Freak and from PL Trent again.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.920
So thank you, everybody, very much.

41:18.920 --> 41:22.640
Your direct support is very much appreciated.

41:22.640 --> 41:27.080
You can get a new podcast app at NewPodcastApps.com or if you don't want to switch podcast apps,

41:27.080 --> 41:32.200
but you want a boost, you can get the Breeze app and you can send them in.

41:32.200 --> 41:35.260
Also thank you to our members, CoderQA.co.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.720
You get the Coderly report.

41:36.720 --> 41:40.720
You also get access to a version of the show with no ads.

41:40.720 --> 41:41.720
Very nice.

41:41.720 --> 41:43.080
Plus, you're giving us direct support.

41:43.080 --> 41:46.760
So we get to do things like turn down all of the weekly emails we get offering us to

41:46.760 --> 41:51.020
do random sponsorships or payments to have somebody come on the show and tell you guys

41:51.020 --> 41:54.120
about some great framework they've created or whatever it is they're constantly trying

41:54.120 --> 41:55.400
to shill.

41:55.400 --> 41:58.640
We get to say no to all that stuff and we get to pick sponsors we like to work with

41:58.640 --> 42:02.040
and as a thank you, we give you that ad free version.

42:02.040 --> 42:06.120
CoderQA.co or if you want to support all the shows and get access to all the special editions

42:06.120 --> 42:09.560
for all the shows ad free and all of that, you can go to Jupiter.party.

42:09.560 --> 42:13.440
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send the good people this week?

42:13.440 --> 42:14.440
Yeah, I guess.

42:14.440 --> 42:15.440
Go to DominicM.com.

42:15.440 --> 42:19.840
I might write a blog post on why you shouldn't write in Swift or something.

42:19.840 --> 42:21.160
I don't know, I'll figure it out.

42:21.160 --> 42:22.160
You should.

42:22.160 --> 42:23.160
But first, you should get better.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.160
Yes.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.160
You know, focus on the healing.

42:25.160 --> 42:26.820
I'm sensing more Pepto in my future.

42:26.820 --> 42:28.400
We got a big show next week.

42:28.400 --> 42:29.400
I know.

42:29.400 --> 42:30.400
We got to get game ready.

42:30.400 --> 42:34.640
All right, links to what we talked about today are over there at the coder.show slash the

42:34.640 --> 42:35.640
four sixty eight.

42:35.640 --> 42:36.640
That's the website.

42:36.640 --> 42:39.840
You also find a contact page, that's a big part of the show.

42:39.840 --> 42:40.840
We do like to hear from you.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.840
We got the subscribes over there.

42:42.840 --> 42:43.840
All that's just a coder.show.

42:43.840 --> 42:44.840
It's real simple.

42:44.840 --> 42:45.840
It's a website.

42:45.840 --> 42:49.440
You probably are familiar with those, so I don't got to explain much more.

42:49.440 --> 42:54.400
If we do the show on Mondays, over at jblive.tv, noon pacific, three p.m. eastern, streaming

42:54.400 --> 42:59.320
over at Jupiter.tube next week for the WWDCs, and then we'll just keep the stream rolling

42:59.320 --> 43:00.320
over there.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.960
This week's episode is streamed over there as well.

43:01.960 --> 43:03.600
You can always check it out after the fact.

43:03.600 --> 43:04.600
I don't know.

43:04.600 --> 43:05.600
We'll see.

43:05.600 --> 43:06.600
It's new.

43:06.600 --> 43:07.600
But I like it.

43:07.600 --> 43:08.600
And I like you.

43:08.600 --> 43:09.600
And I want to say thank you for listening.

43:09.600 --> 43:20.520
And I hope you tune in right back here next week.
