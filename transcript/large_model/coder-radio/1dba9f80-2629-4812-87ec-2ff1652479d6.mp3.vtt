This is KOTORadio, episode 377 for August 31st, 2020.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello friends, and welcome to KOTORadio,

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
of software development and the world of technology.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
So many career possibilities in the cloud

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
and so little time.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
ACG's learning paths help you take the right courses

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
to prepare for architect developer security

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
and many other high paying cloud jobs.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Get hired, get certified,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
and get learning with paths tailored just for you.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Acloudguru.com.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
And joining me this week, as always,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
is our host, the delightful and wonderful

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Mr. Michael Dominick.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Hello, Mike.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Hello, Chris.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Hello.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Hello, it's fun to be doing this live again.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
It's got a whole energy to it.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
It's beautiful.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah, also, if I make a mistake, everybody, you know.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Yes, and you can record falsettos again,

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
so I'm sure you're happy.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Yes, I am quite happy.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
There we go.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, we have so much to get into.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Want to say thank you, though, to our audience

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
that is live watching right now,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
because we didn't really know when we'd be back

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
when we recorded the last one,

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
so we just kind of tossed it out there later on,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
and enough people showed up that made it worth it.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
So we have about 200-ish,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
240-ish people watching right now.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Hello to all of you out there on the live streams

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
and in the chat room.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
It's good to be here,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
and if you're wondering what the heck is going on,

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
yeah, it's back.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Your podcatcher isn't lying to you.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
The show is truly back.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Acloudguru and Jupiter Broadcasting

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
have made the mutual decision to separate

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
and restore Jupiter Broadcasting independent media status.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
The demerger will allow for Jupiter Broadcasting

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
and Acloudguru to dedicate their resources

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
to specializing content that they do best,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Jupiter Broadcasting in creating Linux

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
and open source podcast content

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
catered to enthusiasts and industry professionals,

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
and Acloudguru in creating comprehensive

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
and hands-on multi-cloud computing,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Linux and DevOps training for businesses and individuals.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Acloudguru and Jupiter Broadcasting

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
share many commonalities,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
such as the passion we have and respect

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
for each other's missions

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
and the investment we've made in creating

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
accessible, accurate, and engaging content

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
that makes a difference to the audience.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
We also share a belief in the importance

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
of giving back to the open source community.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
As such, Acloudguru will continue

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
its support of Jupiter Broadcasting

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
with a sponsorship arrangement

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
and will continue to explore

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
other content collaboration opportunities

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
in the future.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
So there's a lot to talk about today,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
including tons of going on in the news,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Jupiter Broadcasting's big news.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
So, Mike, I thought something

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
we should start with, because we're still

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
kind of getting the wheels back on the cart here,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
is the announcement that Coder Radio

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
is launching a membership program.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And this one's really by the seat of our pants,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I have to be honest with you, because

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
some planning just

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
hasn't been able to take place because of the state

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
of the agreements that were in place

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
and all of that work being done.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Mike and I started talking about it this morning,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
just a little bit before we started the show.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
And one of the things that we want to do is

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
we want to kind of give you

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
a piece of mind that this show

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
is not going away again.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Because I know that it can kind of

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
make you a little apprehensive

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
if the show went away once, it could happen again.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
And as somebody who is now

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
launching his independent business again,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I'm thinking about it very much from a, well, how do we

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
make it a sustainable production

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
so that way we don't have

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
that issue again? And

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
one of the things that

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
will become more apparent

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
is one of the ways I'll be achieving

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
that is by taking on sponsors.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
But one of the other ways I'm doing that is for a limited

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
set of our shows, we're launching

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
membership programs. And

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
we don't really have some

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
grand offering here.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
We'll have an ad-free feed that

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
has no ads with the exception of ones

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
that are contractually obligated.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And on top of that, we're

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
going to do something kind of fun for our members

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
that we're going to call the Coderly

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Report, Mike? Is it the Coderly

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Report? Is that what we decided to call it?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
That's going to be a fun name. Coderly. Coderly, like quarterly.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Yes. Coderly. Maybe that's the way

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
to do it. Yeah, and this

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
will be a quarterly members show

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
that sort of review of the trends and things that

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
we thought mattered over the last

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
quarter. We'll sort of just, you know, we'll

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
just, Mike and I will know because when it's the end of the business

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
quarter, it's time to do a Coderly.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Oh god.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
That's going to be embarrassing

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
every time.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
This is going to be bad. Every time you mispronounce

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
it fumbling every episode.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
The Coder, the Coda, the Cuda,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Cuda, it's an NVIDIA thing we're doing, right?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
So we're going to make this

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
all available to our members

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
even if I can't say it right.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
And there's a URL you can go to.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
CoderQA.co.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
CoderQA.co where we'll have a link

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
in the show notes. And that membership

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
essentially is

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
our hope. Our goal with it is not to

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
make a bunch of money. It's not to be rich

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
with the show. It's not even to make the

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
revenue of a single sponsor.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
It is our hope to get enough of you

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
and it will take several hundred of you, but it's enough

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
to hopefully get enough that we

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
can make sure an editor can

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
be paid to edit and produce

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
the show. That the fee to host the

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
show can be paid. That Mike and I get

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
something, even if it's just beer money,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
for doing the show. So that way

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
the show doesn't run at a loss.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Say like this week when

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
we have a short ACG sponsor, which you just heard

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
a bit ago, and that's it. No other

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
sponsors. This is the sponsor, essentially

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
the audience. And so we want to make it

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
a production that is sustainable. And I

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
know this isn't the

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
perfect time to be asking this, but that is

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
actually the very reason I am asking. Because

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
the podcast advertising

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
market is going through a

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
massive reduction. A long

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
time coming one, in my opinion, as somebody who's

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
been podcasting for 15 years,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I think we have seen a bubble

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
recently where every single company

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
in the world has a podcast, every individual

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
has a podcast, tons of sponsorships,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
and with

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
the COVID economy,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
that is falling through the floor

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
right now. And I want

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
to make sure that we have something sustainable here.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
When we bring sponsors on,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
those are there because I know some of you

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
either are not interested in a membership

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
or would just prefer to

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
support the show by engaging with

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
our sponsors, which is a 100%

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
perfectly fine way to support the show.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
If a membership is not for you,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I pledge to do my best

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
to do good ad reads that are sponsors

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
that we believe in, so you're not really

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
losing out anything. If you prefer a show

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
that is ad free, that helps

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
support the production and keeps the show going,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
we'll have an option for you. And

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
that'll be at CoderQA.co.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
So you can become part of the Coder Radio

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
QA team. And that's

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
what we're calling our members as our QA team.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I think what we'll do is

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
we'll set the price at $8

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
a month, but I'll do the same thing that

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I did for Unplugged is I'll do a founder's

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
discount. So it'll be promo code

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
founder again, and

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
this time, instead of giving out a 100

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
because they went really quick.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Founder? No, Jar Jar.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
J-R, J-R? Yeah. All right.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Okay. Yeah, no, all right. You gotta keep it on

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
brand, right? Right. So all lowercase,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
all lowercase, J-A-R,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
J-A-R, and that'll drop

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
the membership to $6 a month indefinitely.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
And I will make 200

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
of those available because they went so quick last

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
time. So 200

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
of the Jar Jar promo codes to

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
make it $6 a month.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
If you can't support us, just

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
spread the word about the show. Maybe leave a review from

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
time to time if you appreciate it or

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
engage with one of our sponsors.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
And we are absolutely grateful.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
We are grateful to have you listen, and we are grateful to have you

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
do that. If you are in a position where

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
you can support us and you'd kind of like to invest

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
to make sure that the show continues to go.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I mean, you know, Mike and I, as long as we can make this

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
work, we're going to do it. Because this show

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
had been running since 2013,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
like a clock. And so

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
what we want to do now is just do

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
that again. We just want to repeat that again, but we want

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
to do it in a climate that makes it sustainable.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
So that is at coderqa.co.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Every time you type in Jar Jar,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
we so appreciate it.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
You did

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
just lie to them. We were running

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
since 2012. You are lying.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Really? I muted and I went on

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
to the old Reddit.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Episode 1, June 11,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
2012 is when we made the announcement.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Okay. Wow. Okay.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Yeah, I think I've said 2013

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
before as well. Well, now I know.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I'm glad you caught me. There you go.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Well, let's get to feedback. We're going to do that towards the top

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
of the show for a bit here. So coderradio.show

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
slash contact if you want to

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
send us your feedback or you can hit up either one

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
of us on Twitter. And we got a lot

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
of positive feedback

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
regarding the relaunch of the show. Surprise, surprise.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
We kind of were hoping

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
that would happen, I'd say. But every time it

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
came in, it's still really great to see it because you're like, okay,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
good. It was the right choice. Yes.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
This isn't an embarrassing retraction

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
coming up, right? Good, good, good.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah, we're definitely not in that territory.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I'd say we're very safe

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
and far from that territory.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
What was the general sense you got that

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
people want to see in the show? A lot, actually.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
So I

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
mistakenly threw this on Twitter thinking

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
only a few people would reply. I was

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
wrong.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
There was a lot. Now, some of it's kind of like contradictory,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
like, you know, make it

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
serious, make it funny, have more guests,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
don't have guests, right?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
A surprising amount of people

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
are interested in like

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
DevOps-y stuff.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Another one that really threw me for a loop was

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
a lot of people asked about the macOS

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
ARM transition, which I was genuinely

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
shocked with, considered the

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
amount of trolling I used to get,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
which makes me think, did I corrupt

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
a bunch of you to Mac? Is that what happens?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
So, I mean,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I will probably pick up an ARM Mac at

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
some point because I have to support software

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
that I wrote. The other thing was

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
specific

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
requests for Wes, which of course,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
right, and for Wes to torture

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
me with languages of the week. Yeah.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
So, might have to change that to

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
month. That was rough last time. People

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
like that, you know, they like that, and I could

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
see, I also would be down for a challenge

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
from time to time as well. Ooh,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
party time. I mean, mine probably can't be as grand,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
but maybe that'd be interesting.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Just gotta print hello Jar Jar.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I think I could

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
manage that. Of course, it depends on what you make

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
me print it in, I suppose, or with.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Objective rust.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I wondered if

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
you saw that story.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Four people sent it to me on Twitter, and two

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
people emailed me on Hay. We probably dropped

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
it in some chat thread somewhere too, I would imagine.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah, I think actually West is.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
So yeah, objective rust.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
It is exactly what it sounds like on the tin.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
You can interface rust and objective C.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
What sort of

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
sick masochist would have seen this and

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
decided to try it? I don't know.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I hope someone in our audience

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
and I hope they write in with like a

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
a breathless justification.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Even I'm like, you know, this is probably

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
not what you needed. Yeah, because you take

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
the super wild language of objective C

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
and then marry it to the super strict

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
super safe rust and you

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
get cognitive dissonance.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I don't know. Sadness.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
It's but it's fun. It's a good idea

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
if I guess you have tons

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
of objective C code and you want to now

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
start coding in rust. Yeah.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Yeah, I'd love to hear somebody do that.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I don't think there's I think there's

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
one individual and it's the creator.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Maybe I'm wrong.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I mean, everybody does love rust right now, so

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
maybe I am wrong. It could be.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I think I saw a lot of people that

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
said, you know, they were just happy

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
it's back. It is interesting.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I mean, you must have saw this, too.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
It's like people that somebody will say

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I'd like to hear you more. I'd like to hear more

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
about your work set up. Like somebody specifically asked me about

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
like our desk setups and then somebody else

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
wrote it and said, you know, don't talk so much about the

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
desk or don't actually what they're well, I think

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
what they say is don't talk so much about the work stuff

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
or something. Right. No laptops of the. Yeah.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it was.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah. Got a couple of those.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Yeah, that's what it was. And so you kind of

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
see different. I kind of thought when I saw

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
the desk set up when I was like, actually, that would be kind of fun because

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I just got a new desk because

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
you know, I'm thinking more about the ergonomics

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
these days. So maybe in the future, maybe we'll talk about

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
that. I was surprised by arm transition

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
stuff, and I think maybe it's

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
because people are looking at just from a development

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
workstation standpoint and wondering

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
what's it going to be like to develop for

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
an x86 server running in the cloud on

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
an arm laptop? Yeah, I mean,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
although you have to remember, we used to get a lot of like

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
iOS dev questions, too, right? I

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
think there's like a very quiet, very afraid

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
group of iOS

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
developers in the JV community.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Yeah, they're huddled with the dot net guys

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
kind of, you know, worried

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
about cannibalistic penguins.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
You know, it's just

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
it wasn't that long ago

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
that what OS you ran

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
was super contentious. It just seems

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
like we got really tribalistic

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
with our tools. And then

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I don't know if it's just 2020 in general,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
but I feel like this was happening really

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
even back when I was on the show is

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
something started to change

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
and all these different OSes just

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
sort of looked like different types of tools

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
to me, you know, like ones

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
snap on and one some cheap

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
tool from, you know, Harbor Freight

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
and other ones, some super nice brand tool

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
that does something special but costs a ton of money.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And when I started seeing them like that, I think

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
that everything sort of dialed down. And I think

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
it wasn't just you or I that had that.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I think a lot of people in the community

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
began that kind of reframing

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
of the way they saw this stuff.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
And maybe it was in part the changes

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
of Microsoft. Maybe it's in part Apple's

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
focus on mobile. So I'm

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
going to give some credit to VS Code here,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
right? VS Code, no matter what OS

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
you're running on. And I know people are going to write and say, well, there

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
are subtle differences. Yeah, but they're

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
really subtle, right? A lot of developers

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
regardless of Mac, Windows, PC,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
whatever, Linux, right?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
If you're in VS Code, you're kind of in VS

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Code. You're using the same plugins, using the same

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
tools. Your config files are exactly

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
the same, right? Your build files.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Yep. I don't want to swing the standard

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
hammer and ring the bell here, but

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
it's made it so if

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
you're on VS Code and I'm on VS Code and

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I'm on Linux and you're on Mac or whatever,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
we kind of have the same tool chain

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
now. Yes, I very

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
much had this realization

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
months ago when I was using VS Code, which

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I've used a lot, but I started

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
using it exclusively when I was working on

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Docker compose files and config files

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
because just the way

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
it displays YAML makes

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
it so, so simple for someone

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
like myself who has to edit a

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
YAML file once a quarter.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
And so I don't spend a lot of time with

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
YAML and you know, it's very

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
specific and it's formatting and

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
the way Visual Studio

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Codes YAML plugin renders that

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
just works with my brain.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
And I had this realization as I'm sitting

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
there on my Linux box, SSHed into a

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
server that I'm running Docker on and I'm editing

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
the compose file

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
in VS Code, which

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
in the background is doing an SSH

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
connection to my server and editing

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
this test file on my server in

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
real time as I hit save in the editor.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
And I realized at that moment

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
like this is 100%

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
parity with anything I

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
could do on a commercial platform. And I was on the

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Linux desktop for reasons that are just

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
like maintenance work. I had to boot into

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
the spare Mac I have lying around and

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
it was just easier instead of setting up a new

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
PyCharm tool chain to test this thing in Safari

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
to simply just like, you know, I'm going to

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
pop up in code and run the flask

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
extension, whatever.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
And I was up and running from

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
had it turned on this machine in

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
three months

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
to I found this

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
really, really, really lame bug in

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Safari and was able

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
to document it, throw it into Trello, which is what we're

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
using for bug tracking these days and like

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
move on and get back to my lemur and fix it, right?

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Trello for bug

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
tracking, huh? It's not ideal.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Huh? We can have a whole

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
torturous story about our QA

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
process, but I would be interested in

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
some tools discussion because yeah,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I'm trying to stand up all that stuff right now.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
But yeah, that does seem maybe like another

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
episode. It's a separate show.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Anyways, if you want to give us your feedback

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
coder.show slash contact

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
get it in there.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
So there is some news over on the GitHub

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
land, not necessarily on the features

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
of GitHub, but on what

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
runs GitHub. If you've

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
been following Ruby, maybe you

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
dabble in it yourself like Mike

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
then you may be aware

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
that the upgrade to 2.7 has been

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
a little thorny. It's been

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
the topic of conversation in the GitHub community

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
as well as the Ruby community

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
because it's been something that GitHub

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
is working on to revamp

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
their underlying platform. Now

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Ruby 2.7 came out in December

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
and it looks like GitHub completed the

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
migration to 2.7 in

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
July. If you're not familiar with their

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
stack, they're running on Ruby since the very beginning.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
It was Ruby and Rails, but

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
hasn't been that for a while.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Ruby 2.7 is a unique upgrade

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
because the core team has deprecated

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
how keyword arguments behave.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
So with this release

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
future versions of Ruby will no longer

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
accept passing an options

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
hash when a method expects a keyword

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
argument. So at GitHub, that

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
was a big problem. They had

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
over 100, no

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
11,000 warnings that they had. It was

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
11,000 warnings that they had to fix.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
And they are big

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
they say. We'll have a link in their blog, but

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
they're big and they make the case in here. They're big

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
on sticking to current

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Ruby as much as possible, to stable Ruby

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
as much as possible, and they make quite

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
the argument for doing so as well.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah, so there's a kind of a lot here and

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I don't know that it's worth it because I'm sure

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
at some point we discussed this in the past, the whole

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
GitHub's like, originally it was like a Rails

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
app way back in the day and it has

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
evolved for various reasons and

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
it's still kind of some Rails

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
in there somewhere, but

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
it's, I don't know, they've done

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
a lot, right? If you're

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
GitHub, your needs and your scale

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
are just crazy. Yeah,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I mean, pulling off a project like this

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
must just be monstrous. Yeah, so

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
there's kind of two big things

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
operating here though. One, I had

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
a similar painful experience with a

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
granted much smaller application

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
because not GitHub. 2.7

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
is quite the lift and if you're the kind of

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
person who treats warnings

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
as errors, you're going to be sad,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
really sad. But

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
that led me, and again, thanks

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
to Wes for sharing this, this post

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
from Matz, the creator of Ruby on, not

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Ruby on Rails, of Ruby, right? DHA

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
has created Rails, Matz created the language

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
on how

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
to, you know, maintaining a programming language

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
over time and updating it. You know, the

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
desire to keep it current with whatever

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
the new hotness is in the general

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
software development community while

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
keeping, you know, stability and compatibility

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
for, you know,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
old curmudgeons like me who don't want to have

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
all their stuff broken, right? Right.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
The reason I put this stuff in the notes for

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
this week is Ruby 3 is going

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
to be coming out and

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
there's a lot there. For one,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Ruby 3 is going to add basically

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
a form of static typing,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
which, if you know anything

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
about Ruby, is quite the change.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
It's going to focus a

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
lot on a form of

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
coding currency. They're not doing

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
the whole async thing that

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
many other languages have done, so I

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
don't feel like diving into that too much.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
But there's a lot of change

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
coming to the Ruby world, and we're early

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
days on this. Actually, like,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Square is the one who has the proposal

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
for the new static

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
typing, and Stripe

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
is the company,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
ironically, their direct competitor,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
who makes a static analysis

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
tool called Sorbet,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
which all of this is hilarious to

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
me, because you have this dynamically

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
typed language, and what is one of the most

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
popular tools to use with it?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
A static analyzer.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
And what are they adding in the 3.0?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Static typing. Or a form

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
of static typing. Optional static typing, mostly.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Because we've seen this, right?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Python 3 added optional types,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
or suggested types, whatever they call it.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
You know, I'm struggling with this question,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Chris. Is this a factor of these

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
dynamic languages becoming used

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
for huge projects, and at some point you actually

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
do need some sort of typing?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Or is it Thor being angry

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
that I'm besmirching his beloved Ruby?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I tell you, so here's another question to ask.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Here's another way to phrase the question.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Would they make this change if they thought it would

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
turn off future developers?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I'd argue no. I'd say if they're sitting around going,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
we think this long term will appeal

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
to future Ruby developers.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
That's always the way these projects end up going, is they're always

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
trying to grab the next wave

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
of developers, and trying to make it

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
appealing. I think there's also a competitive

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
nature to this,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
trying to prevent bleeding to other languages.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
So I'm going to put on my old man hat.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I think a dirty thing

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
that is true,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
but only to a point, and is very

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
obnoxious to say,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
is that at some point, static typing

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
or something close to it

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
actually does help when you hit a certain amount

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
of complexity in your code.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
And it's significantly helpful, right?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
But, if you just want to get started

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
with something quickly, you maybe

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
want to be a little loose, or a little more

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
dynamic. I know that's kind of a

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
spicy hot take, that's going to get a lot of

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
crap thrown at it.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
But, if it weren't true,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
then why does every large

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Rails project, or otherwise large

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Ruby project, or many large Python projects

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
for that matter, always end up

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
using some sort of static analysis tool

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
to basically,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
or write unit tests

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
that they're basically doing type checking that a

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
compiler would have done for you. I'm not saying all unit tests

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
are like that, so I'm not

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
anti-test. I'm just saying that

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
it seems like you hit a certain

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
scale, and then you end up

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
recreating the functionality

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
that a static compiler would have given you, or a static

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
type checker, rather, would have given you.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah, I think you're right, and I also think you're anti-test.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
No, I'm just kidding.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
That is not a label I want in 2020,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
alright? I know, right?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I want to get your take on this.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
So, before we get to their final

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
take, this I just thought was a

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
neat little trick

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
that they pulled off to make this upgrade possible

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
while they have a whole team

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
going. They said,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
just like we did with our Rails upgrade,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
we set up our application to be dual bootable

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
in both Ruby 2.6 and

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Ruby 2.7 by using

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
environment variables. This made it easy for

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
us to make backwards compatible changes

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
and merge those to the main branch,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
and avoid maintaining a long-running

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
branch for our upgrade. It also,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
of course, made it easier for the other engineering

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
teams who needed to make changes on the system while

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
they were working on the new version and all of that,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
and this is the system that they follow,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
and they talk a little bit about this

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
process, and it seems to me, Mike, is they've

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
kind of come up with a process

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
to address the rapid development nature

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
of Ruby, and

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
it's kind of clever. No, it's super

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
clever. I mean, I don't know how viable that is for,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
you know, smaller teams.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
It seems like an awful lot of engineering

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
effort to me, but it's,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
yeah, I mean, that's the kind of thing when you're

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
GitHub that you end up doing,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
right? It's

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
something you can do. It's something you have the

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
luxury to do. Right. You have the resources

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
and, you know,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
this is maybe not featured enough,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
but GitHub traditionally has been a major

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
player in the Ruby community,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
so it's kind of, you know,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I don't know where they're going these days, but

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
they're certainly in the

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
conversation, right? Yeah.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Okay, this is what I wanted to get your take on.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
So they write, on the blog,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
falling behind on Ruby upgrades has the

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
drastic negative effects

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
on stability of your code base.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Upgrading Ruby supports your application health,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
improves performance, fixes

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
language and framework bugs,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
and guides the future of the language.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
So they really kind of make a hard

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
sell for staying really current with Ruby.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Yeah, the Ruby ecosystem is super

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
unforgiving for people who just want to

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
pin to an old version and stay back.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I think they're trying to be the model

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Ruby citizen, in a way, right here.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Yeah, I think so, right? I mean,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
great old example from a couple years ago.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Was it Heartbleed, the one that

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
screwed up the OpenSSL libraries, or was that

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Spectre? I always get them. Oh no, Heartbleed, yeah.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Heartbleed. You know, let's just take your standard

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Ruby project. Let's just say you have a Rails app, right?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
You have

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Bundler, you're installing gems,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
you have a gem file, you're happy.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
You pinned your versions, you pinned your gems,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
you're chilling for like two years, everything's

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
great. Uh oh, the

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
OpenSSL version's bad, and like,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
you have to, you know, as a security

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
requirement, change the SSL library

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
that you're using, right?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Uh oh, the OpenSSL

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
gem no longer,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
the old gem cannot work with the new

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
OpenSSL library. Now you have

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
to update that SSL gem, but

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
your other gems for things like, I don't

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
know, Bootstrap or whatever other,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
you know, literally gems are the

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Ruby equivalent of packages, right? That's what they are.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
So rely on the old

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
OpenSSL gem. Now you have to

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
update almost your entire application,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
and you have to do it in basically an

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
emergency situation. Where

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
if you had been doing incremental updates,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
you would have avoided that problem.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
And I know this isn't unique to Ruby

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
or Rails, but this is the kind of thing that

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
in general, gem authors tend to

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
be pretty aggressive on deprecating

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
old versions of their gem.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
So yeah, I mean I

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
made this mistake once, it was

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
bad, it was a rough week and a half

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
of work, and now I do

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
quarterly updates, or I'm sorry, coderly

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
updates. Hey!

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
You're way better at it than I am.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
It's the new Jersey accent.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
We're used to mumbling our way through R's and L's.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah, so I do

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
coderly updates on Rails

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
projects, assuming people actually have maintenance

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
contracts. Well, very good. You know, this

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
would be normally the spot we'd have an ad break

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
right here. You know, like this would be

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
the spot, but we don't have an ad, so...

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I can plug something. Are you? Yeah, yeah.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Plug something. I had J. LaCroix

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
of LearnLinux.tv on the Mike Dominic show.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Go check it out.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Nice. URL for that?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
That's a good point.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Automator.show. I forgot

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
the URL.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
That's why I don't do the ad reads people, because I'd be like,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
go buy a Linux server from...

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Eh, you'll find it.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Just do a Google.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Are you in the Storm area at all down there?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Any of that hitting you? I'm in Florida.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
You know, one day

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
we're going to be doing the show and Florida's just going to sink.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I know. Hopefully it'll be while we're live

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
just for historical purposes, not for you.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Well, you had that with Sandy.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Yeah. Back in New Jersey.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Yeah, that was good.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Well, almost seeming like

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
it was

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Epic and Apple doing Coderadio

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Solid. What we have

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
foretold, and specifically you,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
and what I have warned with Apple's

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
ever increasing appetite for services,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
what we have talked about on this show

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
seems to have become the number one

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
tech news story right now.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
And that is Apple versus

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Epic, which is just

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
continuing to develop. And you know what, Mike?

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Do you know there's a bit of an irony with this?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
At least in my opinion,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
this last couple of weeks, like

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
last week, was the 25th

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
anniversary of Windows 95.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
That's perfect.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Isn't it? Because you can point at Windows

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
95 as kind of the time when

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Microsoft started to really have the tech

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
community resent them. And that resentment

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
really started to build with Win 98

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
and then when they bundled IE,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
and then it really developed all the way

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
to an antitrust that the government

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
was actually successfully prosecuted.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
And then there were people that were monitoring

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Microsoft for years, and it changed

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
the game in a lot of ways. And

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I think Windows 95,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
you could really kind of mark as the

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
beginning of the general tech community's awareness

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
of this.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
It was 25 years ago. Now here we are,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
and it's happening to Apple all over

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
again. People have known for a while,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
but it's been kind of in the tighter tech circles,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
the more tech literate.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
But now this is busting out into the

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
general audience, just people

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
who buy Apple products and people who

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
play video games.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
And I don't know if this is too bold of a statement, but this

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
feels like this is the worst

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
pushback. This is the broadest

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
recognition of this problem we've ever seen.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Oh, for sure. I mean,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
yeah, it's one thing for two

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
guys to be, you know, kvetching on

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
a podcast, but when

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Epic is suing you in every jurisdiction

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
they can find, Spotify's going after

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
you in Europe, oh, and you're getting summoned to

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Congress, which, by the way, can we just stop?

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Tim Cook claimed in front of

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Congress that they treat all developers the same

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
and charge 30% the same

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
when they've admitted

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
they don't? Yeah. That seems

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
bad. Yeah, I don't get that,

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
and maybe Apple's justification for that

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
is they classify the

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
businesses they've cut custom deals with as

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
something different, but, yeah,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
they've clearly made deals in the past with

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Amazon, I think Netflix they've made a pretty public

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
deal with, and others.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Microsoft for Office, they

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
did one for Adobe. Right.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
There must be some lawyerly way that

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
he's safe.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
So there is some nuance to this.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
What Epic essentially wants here is

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
their own currency and their own app store

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
inside

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
the Fortnite video game, and that

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
may be where it's far above and beyond

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
with anything that Amazon or Netflix

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
or Microsoft have asked for.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
They released an update that tried to bundle

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
some of this into the app. It was sort of

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
the beginning of this process, and Apple rejected

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
it. This has

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
de-escalated, or this has escalated, I should

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
say. Yeah, there's no de-escalation happening.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Yeah, no, it's continued to escalate.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
In fact, at this point, pretty badly

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
I'd say, and now Apple really looks to me like

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
a bully. So Epic

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
was ready when Apple

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
started to say no

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
and reject the app.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Epic went all in with a sort of

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
killer time, 1984-esque

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
inspired ad that

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
was well executed. Incredible.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
They had a lawsuit ready to go,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
they had talking points ready to go,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
and they continued to push it.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
It has so far

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
not seen any resolution,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
and to this point now,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Apple has confirmed that

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
they have pulled

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
the authorization, I

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
believe, for Epic's

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
developer account. When you become a

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
developer, you have to pay a $99 a year

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
subscription, and there's also keys that

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
have to be signed. All of that's been deactivated.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
So there's some nuance

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
with that, though.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Epic, like many big corporations,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
is not in fact one company,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
which I did not know. Yeah, sure.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
So there is a developer

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
account for Fortnite, and I guess

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
they made some game called Infinity Blade that

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I know nothing about, but sure.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
That is the account that got

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
deactivated. Apple wanted to

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
deactivate the one for the Unreal engine,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
which would have screwed about

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
50% of the indie game developers

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
because they would have

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
just, that would have been devastating.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
For those who don't know, Unreal is,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
if you've heard of Unity, Unreal

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
is the Pepsi to their Coke, right?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Or the Coke to their Pepsi, whatever.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Is that fair, though? Oh, the market share.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Yeah, but I mean, Unreal is a hell of an

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
engine with a very interesting... That's true.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
For Unreal, it's more of a high-end engine.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Yeah, with an interesting

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
monetization strategy on that one. But anyways,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
all of this is just in service of the conversation.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
We'll have details linked in the

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
show notes. And I think a lot of people

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
when they talk about this, they talk about it in the cut,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
like 30% cut from

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Apple. They talk about it in those terms. They talk about

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
the subscription prices here.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I think if you zoom out,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
though, this is really about,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
if you buy a thousand dollar

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
device, should you be the one that ultimately

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
decides what gets installed on it? In my

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
opinion, that's the bigger conversation here.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
It's telling to me that that is not an argument

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
that anybody who matters in this conversation,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
i.e. Apple or Epic, are making.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Right? Apple's taking a paternalistic view

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
of we are protecting the user.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Epic's saying Apple is, like, you know,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
limiting us. No one's saying, well, what about

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
the user? Except for you. That's good.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Well, and why is no one really bringing up

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Google in this? Because they were also removed

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
from the Play Store. I believe there's also

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
a lawsuit with Google and Epic,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
but no one's discussing that.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Well, there's two obvious reasons, right?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
One, Epic did not make an amazing

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
parody commercial for Google.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Yeah, okay. And Google does not

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
claim to be, like, the underdog

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
who's treating developers fairly. In fact,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
oh, also, Google didn't go nuclear on them.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Right? Like...

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
True. Apple did not, like, even

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
blink on this. They didn't, like, say,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
take a breath, SimSweeney, calm, sit down,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
let's talk about it. Apple just went, no, you're

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
not doing this.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
You know, man, recently they've really kind of been over the top.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
It really seems like this year they cranked it up.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Did you hear that they also were screwing around

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
WordPress trying to get a cut of the...

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I saw that. Yeah. Yeah. And that's just

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
one of many recently that they've

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
done this to. If you listen to

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
or read Ben

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Thompson's Daily Update,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
he apparently,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
according to him, heard from

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
many, many, many

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Apple developers who have had this happen

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
to them, but they are afraid about

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
breaking non-disclosures if they...

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Retaliation. Yeah. Yes. Exactly.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
So, retaliation

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
would be a concern, so they're just not saying anything

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
and instead they're trying to figure out how to make a way

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
to give Apple their cut. And Apple seems

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
to be of the opinion that they deserve it.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
When you read their internal emails that get leaked,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
they talk about

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
developers essentially as freeloaders

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
that should be grateful.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I would say the word is sharecroppers.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Yeah.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
When in reality, it's the App Store that brings

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
nearly all the value to the

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
iPhone. Nearly all of it.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
And so, Apple should be

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
doing everything in their power to make

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
developers happy. I mean, there's

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
two simple solutions here as far as I

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
see it. Number one, allow

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
separate pay systems. You know, the developer

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
chooses. And number two, allow for side

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
loading. And I'm not saying that's a good

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
solution, but it just seems like

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
if Apple does those two things, they can do anything they want

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
with the subscriptions that they run, they can do anything

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
they want with the App Store. I almost don't think

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I mean, I would like them to do side loading,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
but I don't even know that this

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
I don't even know that that's necessary, right?

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
So there's I think

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
a mistake is that a lot

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
of people are focusing

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
on the 30 percent. Yeah.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Which is onerous, sure,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
but it's, you know,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
it is what it is, what it is, right?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
It's their store front. Right. But the

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
the restrictions on

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
what you can do. See, and I tweeted

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
about this. It's like like

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
we were doing a show. What was

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
it last year or year and a half ago where Lana

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Del Rey? I was very happy about this. Lana Del

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Rey was the singer at some iPad event

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
that released the iPad Pro. I

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
bought one that day, right? I was like all

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
in. Then I went to research

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
doing an app using the Thunderbolt port

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
on the on the iPad

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
or I'm sorry, the USB port on the iPad

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
and it was completely technically

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
possible to do what I wanted to do, Chris.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Like a lot of work

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
but possible. Can't do it

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
because Apple doesn't want you to.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And to me, that's like, whoa,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
whoa, whoa. Hang on. If I want to sell somebody

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
an app, which granted in today's

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
business model, you would never like

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
outright sell them an app. But, you know,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
if I want to license somebody an app and

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
they want to buy it,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
why are you getting in? Like, obviously

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
protect from malware. Do your thing.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
But why are you standing between us telling me

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
yes, we have this technical functionality,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
but only we can use it?

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
That seems kind

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
of bad. Yeah,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I'm not saying I agree with this statement,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
but I think Apple sees

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
their devices more like consoles

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
than they see them as portable computers.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Clearly wrong. That's not true. The iPad

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Pro is like one of the best laptops on the market,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
which I know is a hot take. But

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
well, no, actually,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I tell you what I went on. I want to

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Texas trip and

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I took two devices with me, the

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Pine Book Pro and the iPad Pro

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
with the keyboard, you know, the overpriced

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
expensive but super great keyboard.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
The Pine Book just couldn't really

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
keep up much beyond a single

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
application at a time. And it came

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
to the point where when it was time for me to go into

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
an office and do a little bit of work, I was taking

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
the iPad with me. And then when you combine that

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
and this would be true for any device like this in

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
this category, when you combine that with a good

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
keyboard and an LTE connection,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
the ability to just sit down

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
and say like a new office space where

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
nobody's given you the Wi-Fi information yet

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
and you just need to get some stuff done

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
and just have a connection and have

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
everything work and have that performance

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
be absolutely 100%

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
consistent.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
It does make it a really great

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
portable laptop.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
It is not a tablet anymore, but I

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
still think the way they see the distribution model

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
and the security model is much more

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
in the console frame of mind than it is

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
in the portable computer frame of mind. And

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I think that's one of the clear divisions as they see

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
it between the Mac and the iOS

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
platform. I mean, I use my iPad

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
very much in the way you described. Well, I should say used

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
back when I could leave the house, but anyway.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Sorry, let's

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
forget about what people believe in ideals

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
here. Let's just get down to brass tacks.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
If you're Apple and you have

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
three weeks in a row of John Syracuse,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Marco Arment, and Casey Liss,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
and I feel like that first one really scares you

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
a little bit, just like beating on you

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
for being a bully and being greedy and

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
doing all these bad things because

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
they're not just hurting big developers.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
In fact, they're usually nicer to

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
developers. Don't

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
you just wake up and say our dedicated

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
fans are literally John Syracuse

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
was writing Mac OS reviews or

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
OS 10 when it was called that for

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
a decade

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
or more, definitely more

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
and they're beating

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
up on you. Doesn't

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
that kind of

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I don't know. Doesn't that hit some cord or

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
is it just too much money? We can't

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
overcome the money.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
You know, this is so this goes back to

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
sort of by grave prediction

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
when I was on the show

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
and I kind of came on here and I said I have a warning

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
and I think this is going to make Apple

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
a less appealing platform for developers.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
And I said their drive for

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
services is going to change the

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
company in so many ways.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
And this is one of those ways

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
when you have revenue

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
stagnating, or I guess the other way to put this

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
is growth stagnating in

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
a lot of your key categories

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
like iPhone.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
You need to show that you're really

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
hustling on those services. That's what

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
all this Apple TV plus stuff is.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
That's what all these huge announcements with

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
celebrities like

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Steve Carell who did Space Force. Now he's doing

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
the morning show

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
like these big names that are just

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
famous out there. They're doing that because

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
they're trying to show the market

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
in part. They want successful content

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
obviously and they want to recoup an investment.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
It's also a signal. It's a signal

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
to Wall Street. It's a signal to that stock

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
price that we are investing

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
in the long term in a big way

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
in services. And they are

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
determined on those quarterly reports

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
to show that services revenue

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
increasing because this

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
is a narrative that we've seen play out with every

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
major tech company. Wall Street wants to see

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
growth somewhere. And if

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
you can show growth in a category

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
even if it's only a small fraction of your

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
business. If you can show growth in that

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
category then you show Wall Street

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
there's something worth investing. The news continues

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
to be positive. People continue to buy

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
your stock. Your stock price goes up.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
You have now fulfilled your duty as the CEO

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
and the people that are in the administrative level

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
of Apple and the board's happy.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
It's a really complex dynamic situation

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
that is forcing this. And I think also

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Apple has

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
two underlying factors about them

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
that come from that jobs DNA.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Number one is

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
and I'm going to come back to this. They don't run to the

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
press and chew someone out. They don't go

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
this guy is a real jerk.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
You're not getting the full story. They don't do that.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
They generally allow for the

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
passage of time and the court documents to come

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
out. And then several months later you realize

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
oh Tim Sweeney came along

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
he made this ridiculous request

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
to Apple. They were completely dicks

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
about it. And now that's why Apple's responding

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
this way. That kind of stuff generally

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
comes out with time. But right now it looks

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
really bad because only one primary

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
side has spoken on this issue.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
So you have that. Number two is I think Apple

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
is really just internally

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
jerks about this kind of stuff.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
They think they are the gods

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
gift to developers and end users

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
and you should be grateful for being

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
on their blessed platform.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
And how dare you just hang

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
out in their store with free rent and

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
not cut them in on the deal. If you

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
came in our store and you're selling

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
those baskets we want to cut

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
those baskets. We deserve a cut of those

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
baskets because it's our storefront that

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
got the customers buying those baskets in the first

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
place. And that's how they see it.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I mean there's so much there. One

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
the Tim Sweeney emails did already come

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
out. And if you haven't read them Chris. Oh my god

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
they're great. Oh really. I know I have

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
not seen those. He and I share a few

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
character flaws. Oh my god.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
He's like you said this to Tim Cook.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
What did you think he was going to say.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Oh you're right. I'm evil. I'm so sorry. Let me stop.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
What. Yeah. He just ignored you and said

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
no. Yeah. Like

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
so your basket

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
analogy is interesting because

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
they're not just saying we want to cut your basket.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
They're saying oh and we're going to pick which baskets we have

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
which they're operating

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
like a retail store. But they're in fact not

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
a retail store. Right. Right.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
They're saying you can have these baskets

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
of these types and we get this

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
much money from those baskets from these like

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
basket weavers I guess. I don't know.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Okay.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Maybe too far with the baskets. But like

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
why. At

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
some point and I granted this will take like

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
five years but doesn't

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
they just undercurrent

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
frustration among developers

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
like

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
I can't stress this enough. It's

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Marco Armit and John Syracuse who

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
are now criticizing them. That's

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
you know that's like the pope losing the

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
nuns. Yes I agree.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
But for the people that don't attend the church

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
sort of business as usual.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
This is I think because it's

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Fortnite a different case it is

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
it's a wider known issue and it's bringing it

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
to more general public awareness.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
But otherwise you really just have

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
some priests who have been taking

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
this stance for a few months and the people

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
that attend the church are aware of the issue but outside of that

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I think it's I think it falls

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
mostly on uninformed ears.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
You're probably right then. So you think that the average

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
person who buys an iPhone or an iPad

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
doesn't understand that they

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
are fundamentally not getting the best

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
applications the best experience they could.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Correct. And although

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
maybe put a different way they just

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
fundamentally value different things. They

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
fundamentally value Apple

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
doing this police work

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
at the front doors to make sure

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
that apps are safe. True.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
There is something to that

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
because I don't really hesitate

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
installing anything on my iPhone. You know there

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
could be something that's like copying clipboard contents

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
or something that's spying on my use but

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
in terms of like something taking over my device

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
and loading up with ads or taking

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
over my DNS or anything that's

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
actually going to permanently change my OS

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
that would cause me to have to reload. I am not

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
concerned in the least and in

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
part it's because of the OS design

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
but in part I also

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
think it's knowing in the back of my mind that

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
app review exists and it's doing

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
some of that work up front and it has

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
created a

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
low risk

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
environment to try apps and that

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I think is good for developers because it means people

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
are more likely to tap that install button

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
and I think consumers

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
perhaps like that

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
a lot more than they would like being able to

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
sideload an app or have an app

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
store in Fortnite. Well I don't think

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
anybody but Epic wants

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
an app store in Fortnite. I mean yeah.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
No kidding. There's no

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
angels here right. We're very Catholic today

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
by the way. Yeah.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
So okay.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Do we want to dance with the devil

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
here and make a prediction. Oh

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
yeah I'm curious to see what you think. I think

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
and this is based on just

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
an obsessive amount of reading from lawyers

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
on this. Fortnite is up for an

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
epic loss here because all

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Apple is going to do is say what

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
monopoly. Ever hear of Android.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Yeah. And game over.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I agree. That's the thing is Apple

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
doesn't even have a majority market share.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
No. And it's

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
it. I hate going

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
back to ATP but like John Sercuser tried to make

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
an argument about well Apple has a majority

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
of the people who spend money on their phones

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
but that that's not going to hold up. I mean that come on.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Yeah. Yeah. It seems

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
weird to me that a billion dollar company is

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
going so like it's one thing when like

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
you know Basecamp goes nuts

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
and like starts yelling at Apple right

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
or like a small developer writes a nasty blog

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
post whatever whatever because you

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
know when you're small sometimes you

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
you're like a badger right. You have to be a little

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
vicious or else you'll just get crushed

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
but that picks a billion dollar company

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
like they must think they

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
have a case. So

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
it seems that there's possibly over

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
100 million Fortnite players

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
on iOS and perhaps somewhere around

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
20 30 million on Android.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
There's not really super current numbers

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
in Epic's case. You could you could

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
argue that Apple has a more direct impact

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
over them because they maybe have more users there but

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I think you're right. That's such a nuance

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
there. And the truth is there's more Android devices

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
and it's the same problem over there just slightly

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
slightly less egregious

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
and then there is coming

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
back to this the end user aspect

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
of it. I 100 percent

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
every single time if I can subscribe

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
to something on my iPhone versus doing

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
it on the web every time without

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
question every single time every time

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
it's so much easier to go into my iPhone

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and just cancel a subscription. I don't have to call

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
anybody. I don't have to go to some website remember

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
a log in. I just one unified

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
place I can see all my subscriptions

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
and I do this for things like

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
streaming when I don't need to stream

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
like a CBS All Access when they're not running Star

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Trek. I just pause it as

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
you should. That's why they're creating so many Star

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Treks. But my point is there is

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
a user experience

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
aspect to what Apple enforces

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
that I think they could argue

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
is more valuable.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I think to us it's

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
not. And that's you know ironically

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
why we should be Android users

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
because you can already sideload on Android right.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I mean this is really is a non-issue

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
although Epic did try to do that

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
for a while right. They tried for 15 months.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Yeah and it did. It didn't work

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
because that's crazy right.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Yeah. And by the way we shouldn't be Android

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
users because we have done years of episodes

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
on Android's failure on tablets.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So that's true. It's true.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I have a Fire tablet and

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
it is so bad.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I'm pretty sure I ordered the ad

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
free one and it still shows ads

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
on the lock screen. It fires

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
the Amazon like don't call me a Kindle

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
right. Yeah I they're just

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
so cheap there sometimes you can get them. I'm

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
not kidding you for 60 bucks. Oh it's like

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
a Google Home.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
And I yeah they actually will also act

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
as echoes. But what I do

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
is I wall mount them and I use them to interface

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
with my home automation system. So

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
they're they're consoles with just screens up

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
all the time. But they work for that. They're single

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
purpose tablets. Yeah well for 60

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
bucks and they last. I mean I've got

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I've had it going now for well over a year. They

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
just great. Yeah I just have

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
the screen scheduled on and off and

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
oh my lord it rocks.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
It's pretty high tech. So what's your

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
prediction. Is it is a straight defeat

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
as I'm thinking or what do you think.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I mean Epic has really

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
put themselves out here as fighting

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
the people's fight to take

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
down Apple's restrictive practices.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
It's a pretty big walk back the

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
people's fight to get more money

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
from iOS users and have the Epic Games

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
App Store on iPad. I know

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I know you're right. You're right. You're right.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
No but I would prefer

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
they win. I'm being a little snarky but I would

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
prefer they win. I just don't know. I would too.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
I would prefer they win as well here

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
even though I don't as you say I

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
don't think there is any heroes or any angels in this

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
particular fight.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
But Epic is just the right

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
size where they're not so big

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
like a Facebook or an Amazon where Apple

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
is just going to automatically do a deal.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
But they're not so small that they can't

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
afford this fight. So they're kind of the

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
perfect fighter for this

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
and they've obviously got their game

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
and like I was saying

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
before it's one of those

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
issues Fortnite that reaches the people

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
it goes beyond the church of tech

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
and I think that

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
combined makes them a very

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
unique fighter. I'm going to say

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
their developer account gets

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
reinstated

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
for the next

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I was going to say the next coder but that's probably too soon

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
I think that's too soon. Well Apple

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
has already offered to forgive

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
them if they just put the old version back in.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
All right I'll take a risky bet. I'm going to say by

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
next episode they've

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
they've come to a resolution on that

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
so on just the developer

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
account aspect

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I may wait till that episode to make my

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
prediction on what happens. The only reason

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I think you could be right there

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
is because you know I am not a

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Fortnite player. Neither am I.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
But in reading up on this I've had to like learn what the

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
hell Fortnite is. And apparently

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
they have some deal with Marvel

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
and it just came out. Oh yeah

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
cool. So there's got to be a lot of kids

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
who like want to play on their iPad

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I know they have a new season release they're doing

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
and it's not available on iOS.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
I don't know maybe everybody's home because of COVID

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
so that maybe they're on like Xbox.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Yeah. Yeah. This is

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
the weirdest situation where don't you kind of

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
just want to send them to marriage counseling. Yeah

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
you really feel like this should be

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
like two reasonable businesses that

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
both want to serve customers and make money should be able to

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
work this out. Well even like even like just

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Apple right. It's an Apple therapy like

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
we understand that

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
you want this thing. You would like to

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
get 30 percent everything that touches

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
the iPhone but you can't

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
have that. So is there

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
some accommodation we could reach here

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
to like make you happy and

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
have you not you know

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
act like Kronos eating all the

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
this got weird but

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
you know what I mean. Yeah

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I do know what you mean. You look at it iOS

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
has been around what 10 11

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
years now and you

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
could see it maybe being justifiable for the first

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
few years but it would have sort of been like

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
when the Web came to the Mac

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
and Apple would have tried to try to

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
take a cut of every transaction on the Web. It's just

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
at a certain point the scales too ridiculous

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
the platforms become too common.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Oh my God you're right.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I mean I'm right. They're going to get

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
killed. Apple had this fight once before

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
with Adobe Flash and they crushed them

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
yeah right out the gate. They

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
destroyed the entire flash market and

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
they were a lot weaker back then as a company

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
too. And Adobe was an important

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
partner. They in reality could go a

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
lot harder at Epic than they can at Adobe

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
right. It doesn't seem like Apple has

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
them because Epic agreed

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
to the terms of service. So they're violating

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
a contract they agreed to if

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
the contract's legal. Right. That's Epic's whole argument

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
that it's not. Yes. Right. Right.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
But Apple I think it's a pretty good case.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
It's our store front and it's not even the

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
biggest one. I mean that's a good that's a

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
good I don't see what a hell of a fight

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
and it what it really is about

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
though I think again like I started with is about

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
the freedom of what you can do with these devices.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
And this is just the beginning of

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
that question. Oh yeah absolutely.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
This is like the first big part of that conversation.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Then once this gets settled

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
the next question becomes well what about

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
users because right now this is about why I'm a company

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
and I want to make more money to my

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
and I have I don't have a direct relationship with my

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
customers that use these general computing devices.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
That's essentially an abstract version of what

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Epic's argument is. But what about the end

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
users. When does that conversation happen and

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
what precipitates that conversation

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
where I don't know if we'll have one or if

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
we'll we'll see Mr. Dominic

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
you know before we go

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
I was chatting with

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
the team and I think

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
the way this episode will these episodes

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
will land will be Wednesday evenings

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
at coder dot show Wednesday probably

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
being you know generally

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
the Pacific time or somewhere in there but

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
so go subscribe just so you get it automatically

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
when it comes out at coder dot show

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
slash subscribe and then you

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
just get it when we release it or

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
you can tune in live. We're back

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
if you want a quick fix just

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
get the live version right over there. Then

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
we will have when the main show

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
releases for our members will have the

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
launching literally right after I get off the

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
air and go set it all up.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
It's going to be one of those. So go

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
over there and sign up. It's a it's a

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
coder QA dot co coder QA

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
dot co. And if you use

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
the promo code Jar Jar

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
it'll be a six dollar indefinite

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
membership for the first 200.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
That's a pretty good deal right there.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
And it really it means a lot to us.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
We're excited to do this show and

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
as both of us being small businessmen we

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
know we got to do it in a way that is

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
sustainable and also in a way that

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
justifies it being on the calendar

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
every week you know for the first few weeks of course

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
of course it's super exciting. But what about a year

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
what about two years from now. How do we continue

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
to justify to ourselves and we think even

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
if there's not a sponsorship that membership will help us do it.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Thank you very much. Coder QA

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
dot co. Mr. Dominic give

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
us a plug for the Twitter feed or somewhere for people

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
to get a hold of you. Yeah go to at

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Dumanuco on Twitter. I am finishing up a

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
project and you can watch me cry

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
because goddamn that last 10

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
percent. Yeah

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
right. I know isn't it always the way it is.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I feel you. It's always the way it is.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Plus like right now I've got like a dozen

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
projects going just to get the business back up.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Oh it must be crazy for you. Yeah I

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
am very fortunate I was able to sneak out

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
and I spent a night in the woods last night

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
and then I drove into the studio so I could do the show

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
and that I find to be

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
recharging. There's things that keep cropping

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
up tube just because you know when

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
you're a business there's things you never

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
expected you'd have to deal with

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
to actually operate the business. So the

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
one that was solved last

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
week is the furnace

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
in the studio is really really

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
old. It's like 20 years old right.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
It's really need to be replaced

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
and the venting that

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
goes from the water heater to the furnace

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
that runs in the garage

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
collapsed when we had a new

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
roof installed over the summer.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Well the server for JB

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
is out in that space and all of a sudden

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
the garage started getting really really

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
moist because the water heater was venting

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
directly into the garage the server

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
garage. Oh no.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Why is it so moist. My server is

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
going to have mildew. What's going on here.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
And then we started looking around and realized that the venting

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
collapsed. So we had the roof fixed

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
which made the venting collapse and so

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
now we've had the furnace replaced and new

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
venting put in. And so now the

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
server garage is not

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
mildewy.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
That's what it's like to run a small business right there

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
in a nutshell. And that was just one of the many

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
projects. That sounds right. Well thanks
