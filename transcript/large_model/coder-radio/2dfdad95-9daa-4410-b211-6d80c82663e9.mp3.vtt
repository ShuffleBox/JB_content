This is KOTOR Radio, episode 451 for January 31st, 2022.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.880
Hello friends and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.880 --> 00:24.940
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.940 --> 00:29.500
My name is Chris and joining us every single week, perhaps right next to the barbecue,

00:29.500 --> 00:30.500
it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.500
Hello, Mike.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.560
Hi, I'm cooking up some shrimp on the bobbin tonight.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.880
Ooh, that was bad.

00:36.880 --> 00:37.880
It was bad.

00:37.880 --> 00:38.880
It was real bad.

00:38.880 --> 00:44.000
You know, when you try to go Australian, it's like, ooh, I'm going to get a boomerang in

00:44.000 --> 00:46.560
the mail, a dead fish with wrapped around a boomerang.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.760
I'm like 10% hung over this morning, but I think that was pretty bad.

00:50.760 --> 00:51.760
Only 10%?

00:51.760 --> 00:52.760
Yeah, I did pretty good.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.480
You know, we had the meetup at the studio last night.

00:55.480 --> 00:56.480
That's right.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.600
Folks came in before we started Linux Unplugged.

00:58.600 --> 01:04.200
We did a little meet and greet, did the show, and then did a big cookout.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
People stayed till about 8pm.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.760
It was a good group.

01:06.760 --> 01:10.720
You know what's super common is there's usually always a good portion of Coder fans at these

01:10.720 --> 01:11.720
meetups.

01:11.720 --> 01:12.960
With their M1 Macs, yes.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.160
That did happen, yeah.

01:14.160 --> 01:19.480
Jose came in from Puerto Rico, which is incredible.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.320
He's visually impaired, too, so it's even more impressive that he manages to make it

01:22.320 --> 01:24.640
all the way up here in the Pacific Northwest.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.080
He's a brave man, and I'm going to visit one day.

01:27.080 --> 01:30.320
He came up from Puerto Rico, so he's probably the furthest away.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.320
He's like, yeah, okay, all right.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.520
I've got to get going because I've got a project I'm working on, and he's going to use the

01:33.520 --> 01:38.400
whole flight home to work on his project.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.400
That's pretty great.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.880
It sounds like he's working a lot in Python these days, but yeah, just a lot of people

01:42.880 --> 01:43.880
came in.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.320
They wanted to see the space.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.080
I showed them my photo album of you.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.680
We talked about you a little bit.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.160
I'm sorry, photo album?

01:50.160 --> 01:55.320
Yeah, you know, I like to print them out because I used to have them just on an iPad, but it

01:55.320 --> 01:59.800
just feels more special when we can sit there and flip through them together.

01:59.800 --> 02:04.400
Some of them I just made up, so I just Photoshopped you into a couple of them.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.840
How many of these are of the Phantom Menace?

02:06.840 --> 02:11.760
The bulk of them I did back then, but I updated it recently before the meetup just because

02:11.760 --> 02:13.280
people want to see that.

02:13.280 --> 02:18.480
People were disappointed that I didn't have Lady Joops parked here at the studio because

02:18.480 --> 02:20.760
nobody knows what to expect.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.480
When you say you have a podcasting studio, that could be a closet, right?

02:24.480 --> 02:30.920
It could be something like the MKBHD massive warehouse that he has that is totally too

02:30.920 --> 02:31.920
big.

02:31.920 --> 02:37.240
But what we have is it's a townhouse that I used to own, then well, I still own it,

02:37.240 --> 02:43.480
but I used to rent it out and my renters moved out and JB moved in years ago.

02:43.480 --> 02:48.480
And so it's a house that has spots that are dedicated for recording, right?

02:48.480 --> 02:52.920
But it's just a house, so nobody knows what to expect when they get here, which is great

02:52.920 --> 02:55.320
because they're just completely unaware.

02:55.320 --> 02:59.920
So they thought like Lady Joops would be parked here and I'd be giving tours of the RV.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.760
But no, we weren't able to do that.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.320
Maybe at a future meetup, but it was a lot of fun.

03:04.320 --> 03:07.640
People brought a ton of food, so now I don't have to grocery shop for like the week because

03:07.640 --> 03:11.960
people left what they brought, so there's like basically an army's worth of cookies

03:11.960 --> 03:12.960
here still.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.960
That sounds like a party.

03:13.960 --> 03:17.060
See, one day I will make it up to the Pacific Northwest.

03:17.060 --> 03:21.700
One day when we are, not only are we like traveling again, but maybe Linux Fest is back.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.480
That'd be when I would head up here.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.480
One day.

03:24.480 --> 03:28.640
Just as it's getting nice at the end of April.

03:28.640 --> 03:33.160
First of all, we got a couple of emails, but you know what, audience, you got to be sending

03:33.160 --> 03:34.160
us more emails.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.840
That's a big part of this show.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.840
If you don't send us emails-

03:36.840 --> 03:38.120
Get out of here.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.120
Then there's no show.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.720
The show, we just pack it up.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.920
We come on, we say thank you to our sponsors and we put it out in the feeds.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.040
And so if you don't send us emails, that could happen.

03:46.040 --> 03:49.260
So you got to go to coder.show slash contact.

03:49.260 --> 03:51.320
If you've been thinking about it, because now's the time.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.320
That's inappropriate.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.640
It is not.

03:53.640 --> 03:56.960
But we did get an email in from listener, Chris.

03:56.960 --> 04:00.160
And he writes a little while ago, I think maybe it's actually quite a while ago, Mike

04:00.160 --> 04:04.720
mentioned that he rewrote a Ruby service in C++ for performance.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.840
Oh, blessed performance, he says, I'm curious to know what prompted Mike to do so.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.540
Was it an observation by Mike and his team?

04:11.540 --> 04:13.280
Was it a client complaint?

04:13.280 --> 04:16.280
Was there something that was just taking way too long?

04:16.280 --> 04:21.640
He goes on to say, I don't want to say that I have a similar problem at work, but I have

04:21.640 --> 04:22.640
a similar problem at work.

04:22.640 --> 04:26.280
And I'm curious to know what the thought process was and the steps taken in order to implement

04:26.280 --> 04:27.640
such a change.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.400
Thanks so much.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.400
Great question.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.840
Yeah, so both, right?

04:32.840 --> 04:38.120
So the version of it that was written in Ruby was kind of, we've got to get this to market,

04:38.120 --> 04:40.900
get it to ship for the customer.

04:40.900 --> 04:42.900
And we knew it would be slow.

04:42.900 --> 04:46.960
We did a little bit of monkeying around with the optimizations.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.800
But at some point, the level of voodoo we were doing to try to speed it up in Ruby was

04:50.800 --> 04:55.320
silly when doing it, quote unquote, the naive way in C++, and just compiling it as like

04:55.320 --> 05:00.240
a native, you know, like a.o file that we just called was significantly faster.

05:00.240 --> 05:06.240
Now, when I say significantly, I mean, fast enough for us, which was pretty fast.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.840
And it didn't require like the craziest Ruby code you've ever seen, right?

05:09.840 --> 05:14.480
It was pretty straightforward, because we could do all kinds of, thank you, the compiler

05:14.480 --> 05:17.000
for yield optimizations.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.220
I don't think this is that big of a crisis type war story, because it's something we

05:22.220 --> 05:24.140
knew was going to be slow.

05:24.140 --> 05:30.240
We just shipped the slow Ruby version, because we had to, we had a deadline.

05:30.240 --> 05:33.640
And when it came down to optimizing it, we tried for like a week to try to optimize it

05:33.640 --> 05:34.720
in Ruby.

05:34.720 --> 05:39.440
But it was actually me, I did a quick, simple, like just command line app in C++.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.360
And literally just put it in the slash bin of the Rails app.

05:42.360 --> 05:46.860
It was like, look how much faster this very, very bad version of the C++ is.

05:46.860 --> 05:52.040
If we even wrote some like halfway decent C++ application that could do this, that our

05:52.040 --> 05:58.640
Rails app can call, that solves all our problems, and we don't have to, you know, sacrifice

05:58.640 --> 06:01.880
a few puppies to Cthulhu to get this to work.

06:01.880 --> 06:02.880
The Ruby one worked, right?

06:02.880 --> 06:05.760
It was just slow to get it to work performantly.

06:05.760 --> 06:06.760
That's what happened.

06:06.760 --> 06:10.720
Maybe like a thousand lines of C++ later.

06:10.720 --> 06:16.520
We haven't had to touch it, I don't know, it's been like maybe eight months, nine months.

06:16.520 --> 06:21.360
What I think I just heard in there is it kind of sounds like when you originally created

06:21.360 --> 06:25.540
the Ruby version, you kind of knew in the back of your minds, we should probably come

06:25.540 --> 06:27.000
back and readdress this.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
And so when it came time to look for low hanging fruit, that was one of the first place you

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
looked.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.440
So this was a specific use case for this Rails app that had to do like this one weird thing

06:36.440 --> 06:41.120
with this weird pseudo-proprietary mapping file format.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.680
You know, the whole time going in, it was eyes wide open, right?

06:43.680 --> 06:47.760
We knew it was bad, we had but we did it, the customer was okay with it, then we came

06:47.760 --> 06:52.800
back and fixed it, we quote unquote fixed it, right, we just, you know, made it faster.

06:52.800 --> 06:58.520
I don't know, the more I work in Ruby and Python, specifically Python, the more I'm

06:58.520 --> 07:03.240
struck like these are all just like, all these libraries, these gems, these pip packages,

07:03.240 --> 07:07.440
not all, but many of them are just wrappers over C or C++.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.040
And this might just be like old curmudgeonly Mike here.

07:10.040 --> 07:15.160
But I just don't think it's a huge deal to call into a lower level language for performance

07:15.160 --> 07:17.880
reasons from one of these high level languages.

07:17.880 --> 07:21.440
When the majority of the time, I'm thinking particularly now with the new thing with the

07:21.440 --> 07:25.560
new version of Alice, the challenge is like figuring out like what the weird hitches in

07:25.560 --> 07:29.520
her reading the data structures, not necessarily performance.

07:29.520 --> 07:33.600
But certainly when performance is an issue, there's just obvious benefits.

07:33.600 --> 07:39.440
There's a million Python, kind of call them compilers, but million Python interpreters

07:39.440 --> 07:43.280
that are like, super fast, all right, there's one that runs on dotnet that we covered a

07:43.280 --> 07:45.160
couple months ago.

07:45.160 --> 07:51.040
There's ways to compile, transpile Python into C, C++, I don't use any of that stuff

07:51.040 --> 07:53.440
because I think that's a little too magical for me.

07:53.440 --> 07:57.720
I guess Chris, my thing is I don't think this is that crazy of a use case.

07:57.720 --> 08:03.540
So yeah, I mean, if for Chris who's writing, consider it, I seriously would consider it.

08:03.540 --> 08:08.500
Now it's got to be like regular vanilla C++, right?

08:08.500 --> 08:09.960
But yeah, it works.

08:09.960 --> 08:10.960
It's good.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.680
I think it's a smart thing to do if you need it.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.120
I mean, other things can be hindering your performance though, right?

08:17.120 --> 08:21.600
So if I'm looking at, let's say a Rails app, or even like a Flask or Django app, the first

08:21.600 --> 08:24.000
thing I look at is not this type of performance thing.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.840
This was just because we were dealing with graphical mapping files.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.180
Obviously like the first thing you look at is database, right?

08:30.180 --> 08:32.820
You look at Active Record or SQL Alchemy.

08:32.820 --> 08:35.900
That's almost certainly where you're going to hit most of your bottleneck in those type

08:35.900 --> 08:37.460
of applications.

08:37.460 --> 08:42.320
And that is not solved by just rewriting something in a new performance language.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.560
That's a good, well-rounded answer.

08:43.560 --> 08:44.560
I like that.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.000
That's a good question too.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.200
If you're listening to the show and you hear us discussing something and you want to know

08:49.200 --> 08:53.000
the thinking behind it, that's a great kind of email to send in, coder.show.com.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.200
I'm going to mention it again because we need them.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.160
We did get a comment via Matrix.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.440
Alex wrote on free software funding.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.280
He said, I was thinking about the funding issue over the weekend.

09:04.280 --> 09:08.940
One of the aspects of funding I'd like to see is trying to get funding targeting open

09:08.940 --> 09:12.160
source software for end users.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.960
I think getting corporations to help pay is great, but I often think the type of corporate

09:15.960 --> 09:19.440
common software that is useful for huge companies and the types of software that's good for

09:19.440 --> 09:22.720
us users is quite different.

09:22.720 --> 09:27.200
If funding came from users or end user distros, I think you'd see different kinds of open

09:27.200 --> 09:29.200
source software get built.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.840
I kind of liked the general premise here.

09:30.840 --> 09:34.360
It's something I've been thinking about too, and I feel like you could kind of talk me

09:34.360 --> 09:36.160
down a little bit probably.

09:36.160 --> 09:42.440
I think what we need in order to get even the fraction of the healthy desktop software

09:42.440 --> 09:48.740
ecosystem that Mac OS has, and if you think about it, Mike, like how big of a market could

09:48.740 --> 09:54.560
the pro Mac user who's willing to spend money on things like rogue Amoeba software or Bartender,

09:54.560 --> 09:58.900
could that market really be that much larger than the enthusiast desktop Linux market?

09:58.900 --> 10:03.040
It just seems to me that there is a lot of software on Linux that doesn't have a cloud

10:03.040 --> 10:06.980
angle that a vendor isn't going to be able to sell their server product by investing

10:06.980 --> 10:11.580
in, so it never really gets a lot of long-term investment on the Linux side.

10:11.580 --> 10:17.060
If there was a way for users to directly fund, and this would have to be a way that allows

10:17.060 --> 10:22.880
practically anyone in any country to fund because you'd need the net to be so freaking

10:22.880 --> 10:23.880
wide.

10:23.880 --> 10:28.880
It couldn't just be like US users or Western users because you're only going to get a tiny

10:28.880 --> 10:32.980
fraction of people that actually participate, so it's got to essentially be a net that includes

10:32.980 --> 10:37.840
the entire world, but if you could do it, you might be able to get a few decent long-term

10:37.840 --> 10:41.500
desktop Linux applications if you could crack that nut.

10:41.500 --> 10:47.100
I grant you there are millions of more Mac users than desktop Linux users, but I wonder

10:47.100 --> 10:51.820
how many Mac users there are that are savvy enough to go buy these third-party apps to

10:51.820 --> 10:55.100
modify their Mac experience or have a special note-taking app.

10:55.100 --> 10:59.260
That's got to be, what, a 10% of the Mac user base?

10:59.260 --> 11:03.740
Maybe even less, maybe 5% of the Mac user base, which has got to be somewhere in the

11:03.740 --> 11:10.260
spitting distance of the desktop Linux enthusiast user base, but these could be way off.

11:10.260 --> 11:12.780
Yeah, so I think there's a couple questions.

11:12.780 --> 11:18.320
The general size of desktop Linux users versus Mac users, I don't have any data on that.

11:18.320 --> 11:24.540
I know we always laud that Linux has been gaining, but I think it's gaining not at a

11:24.540 --> 11:25.540
huge pace.

11:25.540 --> 11:29.860
The other thing is I think there's just a cultural difference.

11:29.860 --> 11:33.600
Folks on the Mac kind of expect to pay for things.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.260
Folks on Linux, and I know this is like broad generalizations will get me hammered a little

11:37.260 --> 11:42.080
bit here, but in terms of desktop, you know what, folks on the Macs will pay 10 bucks

11:42.080 --> 11:45.140
for a little cute utility app.

11:45.140 --> 11:48.020
That just doesn't happen on Linux very much, right?

11:48.020 --> 11:54.460
I once purchased from the developer a piece of Linux desktop software and tried to repackage

11:54.460 --> 12:00.060
it up, clean it up a little bit, and resell it, and yeah, that dude only made enough to

12:00.060 --> 12:05.740
buy a cheeseburger, and that's why he sold it to me for not that much money, and it's

12:05.740 --> 12:07.420
a hassle.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.660
I just don't, I think it's a cultural thing.

12:09.660 --> 12:13.580
Now I think there's money to be made in the Linux world, and I think all that money is

12:13.580 --> 12:14.580
on the server.

12:14.580 --> 12:18.260
I do agree that right now that is true.

12:18.260 --> 12:26.100
I do agree, and the only like crack in this what has been a wall of truth for a decade

12:26.100 --> 12:31.620
now that I see is Steam, and things like good old games, GOG.

12:31.620 --> 12:37.740
Like you have a growing demographic of Linux users who are willing to pay like $60 for

12:37.740 --> 12:39.140
a video game.

12:39.140 --> 12:44.420
I wonder if that user base grows and just general Linux grows, perhaps we are going

12:44.420 --> 12:50.680
to see ex-Mac users, ex-Windows users who are more comfortable paying for software,

12:50.680 --> 12:55.160
or people like myself who I run a business, so if a piece of software helps me do my business,

12:55.160 --> 12:56.540
I'm willing to pay for it.

12:56.540 --> 13:01.020
Like that user base has to be growing, but there's no mechanism to monetize it.

13:01.020 --> 13:03.220
Well, okay, hang on.

13:03.220 --> 13:07.900
There's a big, so if you want to compare like people who buy stuff from Rogo Amoeba, you

13:07.900 --> 13:13.020
need to compare them to people who buy that type of utility software, not to gamers, right?

13:13.020 --> 13:16.860
There's a lot of Mac gamers who have PS5s and Xboxes and play games on Mac.

13:16.860 --> 13:18.180
Yeah, I suppose that makes sense.

13:18.180 --> 13:23.060
Yeah, I suppose because that's one's gaming, it's leisure, it's entertainment, and the

13:23.060 --> 13:24.860
other is like utilities and working.

13:24.860 --> 13:25.860
Right.

13:25.860 --> 13:29.300
I mean, is there, I mean, I guess the question we end up really wanting to ask, but it's

13:29.300 --> 13:35.220
a bit awkward, is why isn't there the Ubuntu, you know, or whatever Linux version of a Panic

13:35.220 --> 13:37.460
software or Rogo Amoeba?

13:37.460 --> 13:39.260
Why is that not a thing?

13:39.260 --> 13:41.240
That's got to be a hundred different things, right?

13:41.240 --> 13:47.520
It's got to be shifting SANS, GTK, X11, Wayland.

13:47.520 --> 13:51.780
It's got to be, you know, different changes in a young ecosystem.

13:51.780 --> 13:56.620
And then I think, I'm trying to argue against your cultural assertion, but I think that

13:56.620 --> 13:58.580
could be part of it.

13:58.580 --> 14:00.380
That definitely seems like part of it.

14:00.380 --> 14:05.300
I struggle with it because I really do believe that if you make it, like it's like the iTunes

14:05.300 --> 14:06.300
model, right?

14:06.300 --> 14:11.900
Like what Steve Jobs recognized is if we made buying music easier than pirating it, on average,

14:11.900 --> 14:13.140
people will just buy the music.

14:13.140 --> 14:14.140
Yeah.

14:14.140 --> 14:15.940
I don't think people are pirating the software for Linux.

14:15.940 --> 14:18.500
I think what it is, is it's always, right?

14:18.500 --> 14:23.740
One of the big benefits of Linux, in fact, is that for much commercial software that

14:23.740 --> 14:29.820
you might buy on Mac OS, Windows, there is an open source alternative on Linux.

14:29.820 --> 14:36.380
Now this is less and less true as things crossover where stuff is also free on Mac OS and Windows.

14:36.380 --> 14:42.260
But I remember back in the day, we're talking Ubuntu like 904, 910 days, what was it called?

14:42.260 --> 14:43.420
Everybody uses it now.

14:43.420 --> 14:44.420
Oh my God.

14:44.420 --> 14:45.420
The graphics tool.

14:45.420 --> 14:46.420
Was it Blender?

14:46.420 --> 14:47.420
Oh, Blender.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.420
Yeah, sure.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.420
That's huge.

14:49.420 --> 14:50.420
Right.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.020
And that was just like such an OBS, right?

14:52.020 --> 14:53.020
Open source.

14:53.020 --> 14:54.020
I don't know.

14:54.020 --> 14:57.220
When I say it's culture, I don't mean I'm not trying to denigrate folks.

14:57.220 --> 14:58.940
It does seem kind of true.

14:58.940 --> 15:02.580
And I do think in a way, it's really super beneficial for so many parts of the world

15:02.580 --> 15:04.620
that this software is available and free to them.

15:04.620 --> 15:06.220
They couldn't afford to pay for it.

15:06.220 --> 15:08.140
And I don't feel like using it as piracy.

15:08.140 --> 15:13.020
But when you said that, part of me feels like, no, but I do kind of consider it piracy of

15:13.020 --> 15:14.820
the developer's time.

15:14.820 --> 15:20.460
Never ever giving them anything in exchange for years of work just isn't sustainable.

15:20.460 --> 15:25.060
It's so funny, though, because there is no Mac server software to speak of, right?

15:25.060 --> 15:28.140
I mean, there is Mac OS server, but it's kind of a joke.

15:28.140 --> 15:33.020
No, mostly you install Docker, and then you run it that way.

15:33.020 --> 15:36.540
So it's kind of like, I don't know, I see lots of healthy businesses, especially like

15:36.540 --> 15:40.060
enterprise software tools that people are licensing and selling that are effectively

15:40.060 --> 15:42.700
built on top of Linux and work, and it's great.

15:42.700 --> 15:47.480
I just don't see your boutique.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.780
The other problem would be with, and I know this is where you're definitely in trouble,

15:50.780 --> 15:53.020
with the kind of fragmentation of the desktops.

15:53.020 --> 15:57.540
One of the things that Mac users who buy, because remember, we're talking about a small

15:57.540 --> 15:59.820
percentage of Mac users here, too.

15:59.820 --> 16:03.060
Most people who have Macs don't know anything about Panic, don't know anything about Rogue

16:03.060 --> 16:04.060
Amoeba.

16:04.060 --> 16:08.580
And they would be damned if they ever paid those kind of prices for a small, not little,

16:08.580 --> 16:11.340
but independent software.

16:11.340 --> 16:16.060
But the reason people do buy them is because those two developers in particular and many

16:16.060 --> 16:23.260
of your classic Mac OS software vendors are committed to doing things, quote, the Apple

16:23.260 --> 16:24.260
Mac way, right?

16:24.260 --> 16:29.420
They quickly update when the user design language, user UX language changes.

16:29.420 --> 16:30.820
They follow the trends, right?

16:30.820 --> 16:34.540
Monterey comes out, they make things look more like Monterey, they clean it up.

16:34.540 --> 16:40.020
I think you'd be hard pressed to do that on desktop Linux, unless you just said, I only

16:40.020 --> 16:44.780
do like KDE and only do KDE Plasma, and if you customize it, my app's going to look weird.

16:44.780 --> 16:49.300
I have to say, even kind of then, like we're seeing this on the GNOME side, some apps that

16:49.300 --> 16:54.660
really try to stick with where GNOME's going, but what seems to be happening over the years

16:54.660 --> 17:01.380
is that an app stays strong for a while, then it kind of fades, and just a replacement eventually

17:01.380 --> 17:06.500
comes along, and it's kind of like a reset of the whole application, sort of re-back

17:06.500 --> 17:10.340
to basics, kind of like when Apple like threw out an app and just restarts it over again

17:10.340 --> 17:12.260
and has very limited functionality.

17:12.260 --> 17:15.380
That seems, we kind of seem to be in a cycle of that on the GNOME side, in my personal

17:15.380 --> 17:19.740
opinion, and not completely, but there are definitely some apps that just seem like we've

17:19.740 --> 17:26.180
done this before, but now they're reimagined in the new design paradigm.

17:26.180 --> 17:33.580
I find it to be a problem that I think you would hate this answer, but all of your buddies

17:33.580 --> 17:37.860
over in the Web3 camp are solving this with their tokens.

17:37.860 --> 17:38.860
This is what these tokens do.

17:38.860 --> 17:44.380
They have governance tokens, and these tokens allow you to have special status, or essentially

17:44.380 --> 17:50.500
they fundraise projects by selling these tokens, which is a total securities nightmare and

17:50.500 --> 17:54.180
could potentially be abused on a Ponzi scheme, but that's where they're trying to go with

17:54.180 --> 17:59.980
some of these coins and tokens is a revenue model that doesn't involve selling something

17:59.980 --> 18:07.040
like a product, but selling a token, almost like a stake in it, like a stock in the project.

18:07.040 --> 18:12.700
Some of them have potential and some of them don't, but that's, I think, why some of this

18:12.700 --> 18:13.700
is gaining traction.

18:13.700 --> 18:19.120
There's so much hype in that Web3 camp right now is because the one thing they have solved

18:19.120 --> 18:20.120
is money.

18:20.120 --> 18:25.100
There's a lot of money over there, and they're not asking how the hell do we fund these projects

18:25.100 --> 18:26.100
over there.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.260
That's not the problem they have.

18:28.260 --> 18:33.700
I can't say it's a better way to go, but they solved the funding problem.

18:33.700 --> 18:37.700
Speaking of funding, did you see that Sony announced that they're buying Bungie?

18:37.700 --> 18:41.140
I did, because you have to clap back, right?

18:41.140 --> 18:42.140
Wow.

18:42.140 --> 18:43.140
That was quick.

18:43.140 --> 18:44.140
Yep.

18:44.140 --> 18:45.140
That was...

18:45.140 --> 18:48.700
Destiny is a good game, so now they've got Destiny.

18:48.700 --> 18:54.420
Well, and ironically, Bungie was the original developer of Halo, which was originally supposed

18:54.420 --> 18:56.940
to be a Mac OS game, so we're full circle here.

18:56.940 --> 18:58.140
It's pretty wild.

18:58.140 --> 19:02.200
Sony says that Bungie will remain an independent subsidiary.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.200
This is crazy.

19:03.200 --> 19:08.060
Only, they only paid $3.6 billion, so they paid like nearly $60 billion less.

19:08.060 --> 19:10.300
Well, Bungie is not Activision.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.300
Yeah, for sure.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.300
For sure.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.300
For sure.

19:13.300 --> 19:14.460
And Sony's already in a pretty good position.

19:14.460 --> 19:21.860
Destiny is a great game series, so snapping that up is actually pretty brilliant.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.420
lino.com slash coder.

19:23.420 --> 19:27.420
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support

19:27.420 --> 19:28.420
the show.

19:28.420 --> 19:29.660
It's lino.com slash coder.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.300
Just remember that URL.

19:31.300 --> 19:35.980
I was just talking to my friends over at Linode, and I got a little inside scoop on what's

19:35.980 --> 19:39.300
coming next, and you guys are going to absolutely love it.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.660
I can't tell you about it yet, but you know I will.

19:41.660 --> 19:42.660
You know I will.

19:42.660 --> 19:44.540
I absolutely love this company.

19:44.540 --> 19:48.580
I mean, I'm just so damn impressed as a customer, but when I talk to them, and I hear about

19:48.580 --> 19:52.360
what they're working on, I'm super excited about the future of Linode.

19:52.360 --> 19:56.760
You know, they started in 2003 because they just love the technology stack.

19:56.760 --> 20:00.420
They saw what they think they could do with this, you know, who knew back then, right?

20:00.420 --> 20:03.380
And now, over 18 years later, they're the largest independent cloud provider in the

20:03.380 --> 20:07.020
world with 11 data centers around the world.

20:07.020 --> 20:11.860
But they really have just kept focused on building the best cloud computing platform

20:11.860 --> 20:15.180
to make it simple, affordable, and accessible to all.

20:15.180 --> 20:18.740
Maybe you've been doing this for 20 years, or maybe this is your first project.

20:18.740 --> 20:20.160
Go try out Linode.

20:20.160 --> 20:25.420
They've got great documentation, the best customer service, the performance is excellent,

20:25.420 --> 20:27.660
their dashboards are easy to understand.

20:27.660 --> 20:32.740
I'm used to like working through those kinds of things, but what impressed me was how the

20:32.740 --> 20:35.940
team has just wrapped their heads around it.

20:35.940 --> 20:38.800
Anyone who's wanted to get into it, even people who've never really set up a server can understand

20:38.800 --> 20:40.060
that interface.

20:40.060 --> 20:41.060
It really is pretty great.

20:41.060 --> 20:46.020
And they got one click deployments for some of the best open source applications out there.

20:46.020 --> 20:49.140
Maybe you're ready to move to your own GitLab instance.

20:49.140 --> 20:51.160
Linode can make that really straightforward.

20:51.160 --> 20:54.880
And their pricing is 30 to 50% cheaper than those huge duopolies that want to lock you

20:54.880 --> 21:00.900
into their crazy interfaces with their crazy terminology and processes that are only applicable

21:00.900 --> 21:03.060
to that platform.

21:03.060 --> 21:05.460
It's just kind of gross, really.

21:05.460 --> 21:09.140
And then Linode backs it with tons of great features and services, stuff that makes the

21:09.140 --> 21:11.820
computing experience even better.

21:11.820 --> 21:15.620
Bulletproof backups that are easy to understand exactly where you're at or kick off another

21:15.620 --> 21:18.500
one with status updates on where it's at.

21:18.500 --> 21:24.380
Cloud firewalls, S3 compatible object storage, VLAN support, DDoS protection, a powerful

21:24.380 --> 21:26.620
DNS manager, and much, much more.

21:26.620 --> 21:27.620
So go check it out.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.860
I can tell you about it all day long, but you got to experience it.

21:30.860 --> 21:34.100
And that $100 really does let you try it out.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.180
So go to linode.com slash coder.

21:36.180 --> 21:45.060
Get $100 for 60 days on a new account, and you support the show, linode.com slash coder.

21:45.060 --> 21:48.900
During the Epic versus Apple lawsuit, I don't know if this made it on the air.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.540
I think it did, but maybe it didn't.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.020
But we definitely discussed it off air.

21:52.020 --> 22:02.140
It looked like Apple was implying that Microsoft was behind the scenes giving Epic lawyer time,

22:02.140 --> 22:06.900
emails, information to help Epic win their fight against Apple.

22:06.900 --> 22:10.540
And Mike and I remember we both saw this and we're like, this is a weird thing for Apple

22:10.540 --> 22:11.540
to claim.

22:11.540 --> 22:12.540
You remember that little exchange?

22:12.540 --> 22:13.540
Yeah.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.540
Yeah.

22:14.540 --> 22:15.540
It seemed a little odd.

22:15.540 --> 22:19.240
Well, it turns out it was true.

22:19.240 --> 22:28.780
Now we know because 35 US states led by Utah and Microsoft have officially thrown their

22:28.780 --> 22:31.900
weight behind Epic's appeal.

22:31.900 --> 22:36.300
And in addition to that, get ready for this.

22:36.300 --> 22:43.220
The Biden administration is also joining this pack in the appeal against the Apple versus

22:43.220 --> 22:44.220
Epic decision.

22:44.220 --> 22:48.180
That's an allegedly neutral party, though, right?

22:48.180 --> 22:53.980
Where the federal government and White House leads, Microsoft always follows.

22:53.980 --> 22:56.660
This has been a very common thing, if you notice, like with the whole tick tock thing

22:56.660 --> 23:02.000
with Trump, when it comes to the Pentagon stuff, there is a real tight connection between

23:02.000 --> 23:06.060
what the White House wants and what Microsoft is willing to do.

23:06.060 --> 23:07.860
And I've noticed that for a while.

23:07.860 --> 23:10.380
So it's no accident, I think, that this has been going on.

23:10.380 --> 23:12.420
This is fascinating.

23:12.420 --> 23:20.380
Because you've got these 35 states, Utah at the top, you got Microsoft and the Biden administration,

23:20.380 --> 23:25.060
supposedly being neutral, that are all now gunning, along with Epic, that are all now

23:25.060 --> 23:27.180
gunning for this appeal.

23:27.180 --> 23:32.800
I'm just kind of taking all of this in, trying to figure out like, what's the end game here?

23:32.800 --> 23:34.620
Because they're not going to stop with Apple, right?

23:34.620 --> 23:36.260
They're going after Google.

23:36.260 --> 23:44.780
So Microsoft is kind of using the very system that came after them around Internet Explorer,

23:44.780 --> 23:48.940
hobbled them for a decade plus, and now has made them a compliant lapdog of the federal

23:48.940 --> 23:49.940
government.

23:49.940 --> 23:55.780
Microsoft is now using that very tool, that was probably an awful experience for them,

23:55.780 --> 24:00.100
to go after their two biggest competitors, Apple and Google.

24:00.100 --> 24:05.720
They're taking the machine that chewed them up, and now they're turning it against their

24:05.720 --> 24:10.260
competitors in what is an absolute killer move.

24:10.260 --> 24:16.580
I think this is, right here, showing us that Microsoft has not lost its teeth, it's just

24:16.580 --> 24:19.380
been doing more kind of behind the scenes stuff.

24:19.380 --> 24:23.780
But now with everyone's cards on the table, they had to put their name out there because

24:23.780 --> 24:26.780
they had to go in on this appeal.

24:26.780 --> 24:32.920
They were perfectly happy remaining a silent player in this, even though Apple's lawyers

24:32.920 --> 24:36.140
did try to out them, it just never got any traction.

24:36.140 --> 24:42.100
And still no one's really talking about it, but it's right here, Fosspatent has the filings,

24:42.100 --> 24:46.580
and it all started because they wanted to slip an app store into Fortnite, Epic did.

24:46.580 --> 24:48.740
Now what, Microsoft wants Game Pass.

24:48.740 --> 24:51.260
I think that's what pissed off Microsoft and got them involved.

24:51.260 --> 24:53.580
You sound like very excited about this.

24:53.580 --> 24:55.740
I think it's going to be a hell of a fight.

24:55.740 --> 25:01.500
Has Apple raised the cost of software to the end consumer?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.940
Or cost to be raised?

25:02.940 --> 25:06.460
I would say it's caused the cost of software to be lowered.

25:06.460 --> 25:07.460
Then you're beat.

25:07.460 --> 25:08.460
You're beat.

25:08.460 --> 25:09.460
That's it.

25:09.460 --> 25:10.460
You got nothing.

25:10.460 --> 25:11.460
Right?

25:11.460 --> 25:15.620
In the EU, you've got something, but you know how we feel about the EU.

25:15.620 --> 25:17.140
You got nothing in the United States.

25:17.140 --> 25:21.620
Antitrust is, did they raise, did it cause prices to go up for the consumer?

25:21.620 --> 25:22.620
Yes or no?

25:22.620 --> 25:28.020
The answer is no, because they've basically destroyed small development jobs.

25:28.020 --> 25:29.020
You're done.

25:29.020 --> 25:30.020
Right?

25:30.020 --> 25:33.020
So all they've done is taken value from independent developers.

25:33.020 --> 25:37.060
Now if a law were to be changed, that would be different, right?

25:37.060 --> 25:43.440
If Congress got out of what I can only consider its 30 year bender, maybe they could do something

25:43.440 --> 25:45.620
and sober up for a day or two.

25:45.620 --> 25:49.740
It's funny because I keep reading these stories about Apple and I am very much on the side

25:49.740 --> 25:52.880
of this is horrible, this shouldn't exist.

25:52.880 --> 25:57.900
If I understand what I'm reading about the law and what kind of very, very smart legal

25:57.900 --> 26:03.780
analysts are writing, Apple's mean, but being a dick is not illegal.

26:03.780 --> 26:04.780
It's just not.

26:04.780 --> 26:05.780
Right?

26:05.780 --> 26:07.280
Being super powerful is not illegal.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.440
I can see that.

26:08.440 --> 26:15.360
And I think what the hope is, is that new precedent or new law gets created as a result.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.780
You know, some Congress critter wakes up, but-

26:17.780 --> 26:20.260
So Tim Cook calls Nancy Pelosi a few more times.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.260
Yeah.

26:21.260 --> 26:27.140
So I also struggle to actually understand what Apple did wrong here.

26:27.140 --> 26:30.980
I wish there wasn't a green versus blue bubble thing that they had iMessages for Android.

26:30.980 --> 26:34.900
I wish they had third party payment options for the app store.

26:34.900 --> 26:37.540
I wish they didn't take such a commission, right?

26:37.540 --> 26:42.660
But I also wish that Walmart let me buy music that has swearing in it.

26:42.660 --> 26:43.760
It's their store.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.220
They make the rules.

26:45.220 --> 26:47.160
That's always been the case.

26:47.160 --> 26:51.980
And even just this quarter, they weren't the top phone maker.

26:51.980 --> 26:55.580
Samsung took the top spot for smartphones in 2021.

26:55.580 --> 26:56.580
For 2021.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.820
Samsung has 20% of the market.

26:58.820 --> 27:01.180
They sold 272 million phones.

27:01.180 --> 27:04.060
There are more Samsung phones than there are iPhones.

27:04.060 --> 27:06.760
And Samsung is just one brand of Android.

27:06.760 --> 27:09.460
So I don't buy the monopoly argument here.

27:09.460 --> 27:11.100
I just don't buy that.

27:11.100 --> 27:13.060
And I also don't buy that Epic's the victim.

27:13.060 --> 27:14.460
They knew the rules of the store.

27:14.460 --> 27:18.260
I don't like the rules, but they knew the rules of the store and they shipped an app

27:18.260 --> 27:21.180
store in their crappy gaming app.

27:21.180 --> 27:26.700
So I feel like what's happened here, and I really hate to say this because it makes me

27:26.700 --> 27:30.820
sound like I'm defending Apple, but I'm just telling you like I see it.

27:30.820 --> 27:34.060
I think Apple built the best product.

27:34.060 --> 27:36.020
They brought a lot of customers.

27:36.020 --> 27:40.340
And now the losers are trying to use the legal system to punish Apple.

27:40.340 --> 27:44.460
But Apple didn't do it by like how Microsoft did it back in the day where they bullied

27:44.460 --> 27:49.520
OEMs into shipping Windows and Internet Explorer and threatened to break them if they didn't

27:49.520 --> 27:50.780
do it, right?

27:50.780 --> 27:52.700
Apple didn't pull those kind of moves.

27:52.700 --> 27:57.980
They just built a good product with really strict, clear rules that everybody understood

27:57.980 --> 27:58.980
up front.

27:58.980 --> 28:01.260
These are the rules of the land.

28:01.260 --> 28:03.420
And consumers responded to that.

28:03.420 --> 28:07.180
And for some consumers, it meant they can now install apps on their phone without worrying

28:07.180 --> 28:08.180
about it being malware.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.820
Like that's a huge game changer, right?

28:09.820 --> 28:11.260
Yeah, I absolutely agree.

28:11.260 --> 28:14.020
So my thinking on all this Apple stuff has evolved.

28:14.020 --> 28:17.700
There's two types of Apple, let's call it dickery.

28:17.700 --> 28:22.140
There's kind of accidental dickery or like kind of petulant dickery.

28:22.140 --> 28:26.820
So for instance, I consider all the stuff we're like, oh my God, a formal Apple engineers

28:26.820 --> 28:27.820
app is on the App Store.

28:27.820 --> 28:29.460
But you know who really cares about that?

28:29.460 --> 28:30.780
Indies, people like me, right?

28:30.780 --> 28:34.180
That doesn't matter for the mass market because, okay, they did their friend a favor.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.520
They featured their stuff, whatever.

28:36.520 --> 28:37.620
And there's accidents, right?

28:37.620 --> 28:41.180
Where the rules are a little vague and like one reviewer sees it this way and another

28:41.180 --> 28:42.180
sees it that way.

28:42.180 --> 28:46.140
And sometimes things get approved and then not approved or you can, you know, I've had

28:46.140 --> 28:48.540
those awkward back and forths.

28:48.540 --> 28:51.440
That's like just incidental in a way.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.880
That's kind of, well, it's a huge App Store.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.780
There's always going to be some failure rate.

28:55.780 --> 28:57.580
Think about, think about our own code, right?

28:57.580 --> 29:01.260
There's always some percentage of functions that are buggy.

29:01.260 --> 29:04.660
The other kind is they're not making a mistake.

29:04.660 --> 29:08.020
They're doing it on purpose because it's their business model.

29:08.020 --> 29:10.860
I would just call it, you know, looking out for themselves.

29:10.860 --> 29:14.540
I mean, they just got another pissing context with, what was it?

29:14.540 --> 29:15.540
Is it Denmark or?

29:15.540 --> 29:16.540
Yeah.

29:16.540 --> 29:17.540
The Netherlands.

29:17.540 --> 29:18.540
Yeah.

29:18.540 --> 29:19.540
Yeah.

29:19.540 --> 29:20.540
And they don't care, right?

29:20.540 --> 29:23.780
Because they're in the business of the App Store in the eighties.

29:23.780 --> 29:25.660
We decided to change the standard, right?

29:25.660 --> 29:30.060
Robert Bork, you should listen to the verge if you don't, you learn a lot.

29:30.060 --> 29:36.540
And a standard has changed and on the existing standard of what a monopoly is.

29:36.540 --> 29:40.540
They are certainly not a monopoly in any way, shape or form.

29:40.540 --> 29:46.820
And they have not caused prices for consumers of software to rise.

29:46.820 --> 29:47.900
This is my thing.

29:47.900 --> 29:53.100
And while I wish it had to be an open App Store, I wish I had this, I could sideload.

29:53.100 --> 29:57.100
I wish that iMessage wasn't a siloed platform.

29:57.100 --> 30:00.460
I failed to actually understand what law they broke.

30:00.460 --> 30:05.420
And so where I kind of begin to backslide into, and I'd love the audience's thoughts

30:05.420 --> 30:09.020
on this is maybe, maybe I'm missing, maybe they did break some law here.

30:09.020 --> 30:15.380
But it seems to me like what we're saying is if you just do a really good job, become

30:15.380 --> 30:20.640
super successful, ultimately corporations will work with the government to come after

30:20.640 --> 30:23.460
you to take some of that success away.

30:23.460 --> 30:27.460
And so you kind of get punished if you break the law and you kind of get punished if you

30:27.460 --> 30:28.660
don't break the law.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.420
There really seems to be no difference.

30:30.420 --> 30:34.500
In fact, often it seems like people that break the law get away with things for longer.

30:34.500 --> 30:38.420
All they've done here is build a platform that has a lot of users, but they don't even

30:38.420 --> 30:40.580
have the majority of users.

30:40.580 --> 30:45.660
What they did was they did what Apple always does and what every luxury brand does.

30:45.660 --> 30:48.340
They targeted the whales, right?

30:48.340 --> 30:50.900
They targeted the people who are actually willing to spend money, frankly, it almost

30:50.900 --> 30:53.260
goes back to our Linux desktop conversation.

30:53.260 --> 30:58.140
But also Apple also has like been screwed in cases like this, not legal cases, but they

30:58.140 --> 31:04.020
had a lawsuit with Qualcomm about the antenna, LTE antenna licensing.

31:04.020 --> 31:05.020
I recall, yeah.

31:05.020 --> 31:11.220
Because Intel was so this is not a, this is a true story, so at making the parts that

31:11.220 --> 31:15.220
Apple needed, they ended up having to settle with Qualcomm, right?

31:15.220 --> 31:20.460
They bought into, they bought this division of Intel's modem business settled with Qualcomm

31:20.460 --> 31:28.000
because this is a problem I think I in the past and many of our listeners have at their

31:28.000 --> 31:33.100
scale, it is not about like their feelings or emotions.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.100
It's a business.

31:34.100 --> 31:37.460
So did Apple want to pay Qualcomm stupid percentage of the phone?

31:37.460 --> 31:39.340
No, that's why they sued them.

31:39.340 --> 31:40.820
But when Intel couldn't deliver, guess what?

31:40.820 --> 31:41.820
They sucked it up.

31:41.820 --> 31:46.140
Sally, they paid Qualcomm and they bought the people from Intel kind of as a hedge.

31:46.140 --> 31:47.260
Intel continued.

31:47.260 --> 31:49.780
Why are there no Nvidia MacBooks anymore?

31:49.780 --> 31:55.740
Well, the story is that in two, I might get the year wrong so we can correct it next week.

31:55.740 --> 31:57.740
I think it was like 12 or 13 was it?

31:57.740 --> 32:00.580
Yeah, there was 12 or 13, one of the first aluminum MacBook Pros.

32:00.580 --> 32:02.060
Might've been a little earlier.

32:02.060 --> 32:03.700
The Nvidia chips overheated.

32:03.700 --> 32:08.540
I had one of these all the time and Nvidia would not pony up for the repairs.

32:08.540 --> 32:12.380
Though Apple got pissed and decided they didn't want to deal with Nvidia.

32:12.380 --> 32:13.380
But guess what?

32:13.380 --> 32:14.380
They did that because it cost them money.

32:14.380 --> 32:15.380
Right?

32:15.380 --> 32:16.380
They didn't do it because they were...

32:16.380 --> 32:17.380
Right.

32:17.380 --> 32:18.380
They paid for the repairs.

32:18.380 --> 32:19.740
They wanted Nvidia to help out and Nvidia refused.

32:19.740 --> 32:20.740
Right.

32:20.740 --> 32:22.860
They took care of the end customer, myself included.

32:22.860 --> 32:24.860
And you know, so I don't know.

32:24.860 --> 32:29.900
I mean, I also like as much as I would like to see the apps to open up, it is real unfair

32:29.900 --> 32:34.620
if we can go back and retroactively change laws and say that, well, this thing that was

32:34.620 --> 32:39.940
okay, even though it's kind of of you is now not okay.

32:39.940 --> 32:42.640
And we're going to go back and punish you for what you did before, even though we said

32:42.640 --> 32:43.640
it was okay.

32:43.640 --> 32:44.780
I mean, how can you do that?

32:44.780 --> 32:45.780
You can't...

32:45.780 --> 32:51.820
I feel like you just can't unring the spell in a way that isn't like pure straight up,

32:51.820 --> 32:55.220
you know, big brother comes in and literally says, or we'll throw you in jail.

32:55.220 --> 33:00.540
It does go back to our discussion about Linux desktop users being willing to pay.

33:00.540 --> 33:05.220
Because when you're a business and you're looking at markets to address for your product,

33:05.220 --> 33:06.620
you consider those kinds of things.

33:06.620 --> 33:11.260
And Apple has decided, and they figured this out a while ago, we're going after a percentage

33:11.260 --> 33:18.280
of the market that is willing to have a credit card on file with us all the time.

33:18.280 --> 33:20.340
That's like a baseline for an Apple customer.

33:20.340 --> 33:21.580
You got to have an Apple account.

33:21.580 --> 33:24.340
You need to get a form of payment on file.

33:24.340 --> 33:27.620
That eliminates a good percentage of Linux users right there, right?

33:27.620 --> 33:29.500
But they know what their demographic is.

33:29.500 --> 33:33.460
So they build a product that will sell to that demographic.

33:33.460 --> 33:38.820
And they realized that the App Store could address an issue that has traditionally plagued

33:38.820 --> 33:41.740
large platforms like Windows.

33:41.740 --> 33:45.040
And thank God they did because it would have been a nightmare if they hadn't.

33:45.040 --> 33:50.860
And so they built a product with the App Store that involved that crappy review process that

33:50.860 --> 33:56.460
involved sandboxing, but at the end it meant you could pop on an app on your phone like

33:56.460 --> 33:57.880
it's candy and try it out.

33:57.880 --> 34:01.940
They trusted these things, so they'd be willing to try out some app called Candy Crush and

34:01.940 --> 34:02.940
install it on their phone.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.940
And that changed the market.

34:04.940 --> 34:08.460
They truly did innovate in that regard.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.980
And the market rewarded them for it.

34:10.980 --> 34:15.860
Yeah, I keep like, and I know I rail against the App Store all the time, I struggle to

34:15.860 --> 34:20.740
see what a better system would be like for people who are effectively like our non-technical

34:20.740 --> 34:22.940
family members, and I'm sure we all have them.

34:22.940 --> 34:28.020
Because for us, fine, yes, I know how to go into my Discover Card app and create a one-time

34:28.020 --> 34:31.300
use credit card number if I'm on Joe Blow's website, right?

34:31.300 --> 34:32.300
Fine.

34:32.300 --> 34:36.100
Honestly, I don't want my mom to be able to input a random credit card into an iPhone

34:36.100 --> 34:37.100
app.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.100
I just don't.

34:38.100 --> 34:39.100
I think it's bad.

34:39.100 --> 34:45.380
And she's a pretty technical person, but I don't want my dad in his late 70s doing it.

34:45.380 --> 34:50.020
There's a reason that you're not seeing independent developers blogging about the glory that

34:50.020 --> 34:53.500
is the Amazon Fire app store, because it's a piece of shit.

34:53.500 --> 34:58.060
Windows Phone, my beloved, my beloved, failed.

34:58.060 --> 35:01.460
Because you know why Microsoft failed?

35:01.460 --> 35:06.320
Microsoft is really good to developers, really bad to customers, right?

35:06.320 --> 35:09.740
Microsoft worked with the carriers as partners because they're also their customers.

35:09.740 --> 35:14.100
Where Apple, Apple's big innovation, I would argue, forget the APIs, they always say it's

35:14.100 --> 35:16.140
the APIs, screw the APIs.

35:16.140 --> 35:19.540
The security stuff, you can make arguments against it.

35:19.540 --> 35:23.500
It was getting the carriers out of that transaction with the end customer.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.100
Yeah, it was saying no to Verizon.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.360
Java ME was a nightmare.

35:28.360 --> 35:33.660
You might get, what, 5%, 10% of your app, and that's if the carrier and the phone manufacturer

35:33.660 --> 35:36.900
were doing what it was really to have your phone pre-installed, unless we want to talk

35:36.900 --> 35:42.740
about POM, and if you want to talk about POM, we'll cry about WebOS together.

35:42.740 --> 35:43.740
It's fine.

35:43.740 --> 35:48.500
But I don't know, should they have this, quote, control?

35:48.500 --> 35:49.500
It made the difference, right?

35:49.500 --> 35:55.340
I had a Sprint Android phone that would get push notifications about football team wins.

35:55.340 --> 35:56.780
There's nothing I could do to remove the app.

35:56.780 --> 36:02.100
Oh, I had that on my first smartphone, was a Verizon Droid, and it really, really thought

36:02.100 --> 36:03.100
I liked football.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.100
Yeah, same thing.

36:04.100 --> 36:08.380
Yeah, and I did not care at all, and I kept getting push notifications about it, and that's

36:08.380 --> 36:10.540
when I realized this really matters.

36:10.540 --> 36:11.820
This really matters.

36:11.820 --> 36:16.300
And that was an innovation, and it did change the market, and it did get them a lot of customers.

36:16.300 --> 36:21.180
We're never going to be able to educate the average Joe user, Joe or Jane user.

36:21.180 --> 36:25.780
I think one of the mistakes a lot of us in our community make is a lot of the things

36:25.780 --> 36:31.340
we just take for granted as like, oh, of course, you have 2FA on, right, naturally.

36:31.340 --> 36:34.820
That's a big hurdle for a lot of people, and that's just one instance.

36:34.820 --> 36:35.820
I don't know.

36:35.820 --> 36:36.820
If not them, then who?

36:36.820 --> 36:42.540
I certainly don't want, again, my dad or mom or whoever is cell phone to be as open

36:42.540 --> 36:43.540
as a Windows PC.

36:43.540 --> 36:45.260
How many times have I had to reinstall Windows?

36:45.260 --> 36:46.540
Or Android, to be honest.

36:46.540 --> 36:47.540
They don't get Androids.

36:47.540 --> 36:48.540
Android doesn't exist.

36:48.540 --> 36:53.860
I legitimately bought my mom an iPhone and just said, here, mom, take this.

36:53.860 --> 36:55.820
I cannot handle this.

36:55.820 --> 36:59.940
She lost all of her pictures twice on Android.

36:59.940 --> 37:03.340
She had years of issues, and she just kept going in, and the carrier would just like

37:03.340 --> 37:08.020
sell her on a phone, and it was always the Android phone, and it was an absolute disaster.

37:08.020 --> 37:12.500
They give her just an unbelievably cheap phone that had maybe 16 gigs of storage.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.140
It's just painful.

37:14.140 --> 37:18.460
So I eventually just bought her an iPhone and said, here, mom, just use this.

37:18.460 --> 37:19.540
And it's been great.

37:19.540 --> 37:22.660
Your mom could drive to an Apple store if there's one by her and be like, hey, my phone's

37:22.660 --> 37:23.660
not working.

37:23.660 --> 37:30.540
And most of the time, they'll just fix it with very little questioning.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.180

38:50.900 --> 38:53.380
The iPad, however, not doing so well.

38:53.380 --> 38:57.580
iPad sales are down, Mac sales are up, iPad sales down.

38:57.580 --> 39:00.380
So Google feels like tablets are the future.

39:00.380 --> 39:05.100
Google says that they're focusing on tablets, they've staffed up a new division.

39:05.100 --> 39:09.140
We believe they say the future of computing is shifting towards a more powerful and capable

39:09.140 --> 39:10.140
tablet.

39:10.140 --> 39:14.140
We're working to deliver the next chapter of computing and input by launching seamless

39:14.140 --> 39:19.180
support across our platform and hero experiences that unlock new and better ways of being productive

39:19.180 --> 39:20.420
and creative.

39:20.420 --> 39:21.420
This is great.

39:21.420 --> 39:22.740
It's 2011 again.

39:22.740 --> 39:23.740
Everything's awesome.

39:23.740 --> 39:25.020
I mean, I love this.

39:25.020 --> 39:26.860
This is how I knew this was going to be awful.

39:26.860 --> 39:30.500
They are doing the thing that they did originally, where they're going to take the current version

39:30.500 --> 39:33.180
of Android and fork it for tablets.

39:33.180 --> 39:34.540
It's Honeycomb part two.

39:34.540 --> 39:35.540
They're doing the same thing.

39:35.540 --> 39:36.540
Yeah.

39:36.540 --> 39:42.780
So they're going to have Android 12L, a mid-cycle release of Android that's dedicated to tablet

39:42.780 --> 39:43.780
functionality.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.780
Oh, they won't learn.

39:45.780 --> 39:46.780
No.

39:46.780 --> 39:48.420
Why won't they learn?

39:48.420 --> 39:50.740
I can't believe they're going to try this again.

39:50.740 --> 39:56.700
They have job openings for it and they also want to develop relationships with developers

39:56.700 --> 40:01.900
to create ink first hero apps, is their quote.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.620
Oh, sweet mother of pearl.

40:04.620 --> 40:07.540
Ink first, which probably just means, you know, they're going to have a big focus on

40:07.540 --> 40:08.540
pen input.

40:08.540 --> 40:09.540
So all these things are coming with.

40:09.540 --> 40:10.660
Oh, that sounds fun.

40:10.660 --> 40:14.380
So when people buy the cheapest possible stylus and the cheapest possible tablet and your

40:14.380 --> 40:16.140
app doesn't work right and you have to.

40:16.140 --> 40:18.820
Because it will be a race to the bottom, like it always is with these things.

40:18.820 --> 40:19.820
Absolutely.

40:19.820 --> 40:22.740
It'll be, well, the carriers need something to give away to get you to sign that extra

40:22.740 --> 40:23.740
data plan.

40:23.740 --> 40:27.600
Oh man, I wonder how bad this is going to go.

40:27.600 --> 40:31.260
In some ways, I've always felt Android is actually a better tablet platform.

40:31.260 --> 40:32.260
I agree with that.

40:32.260 --> 40:35.860
I've liked iPhone with iOS and I've liked Android on a tablet.

40:35.860 --> 40:36.860
I always thought that was nice.

40:36.860 --> 40:41.740
Well, I see for me, Android would be great on the tablet as a, like an internal enterprise

40:41.740 --> 40:43.300
tool for customers, right?

40:43.300 --> 40:47.020
Developed Android is what I do a lot with the surface right now.

40:47.020 --> 40:52.940
The problem is that the minute you give them the Android option, everybody's looking at

40:52.940 --> 40:57.860
the cheapest tablets they can find and your, your code ends up having to apologize for

40:57.860 --> 40:59.860
whatever crap they bought on AliExpress.

40:59.860 --> 41:03.780
So yeah, absolutely, I've had some great apps that just run absolutely horrible on cheap

41:03.780 --> 41:04.780
Android tablets.

41:04.780 --> 41:10.140
You know, I was chatting actually with some folks last night at the meetup and how kind

41:10.140 --> 41:12.580
of funny it is cheaper these days.

41:12.580 --> 41:19.940
If you want to get, say the magic keyboard with an iPad, you just better off getting

41:19.940 --> 41:22.620
a MacBook Air, a low end MacBook Air.

41:22.620 --> 41:28.700
It's cheaper to get a Mac than it is to get a fully decked out iPad tablet these days.

41:28.700 --> 41:31.220
That's got to be why Apple's iPad sales are down.

41:31.220 --> 41:35.540
And I'd like to know how Google is going to solve that problem because Chromebooks are

41:35.540 --> 41:40.740
essentially sort of offering the same kind of value story.

41:40.740 --> 41:46.020
So the only real way I could see them offering something competitive there is if they tried

41:46.020 --> 41:47.020
to make them cheap.

41:47.020 --> 41:50.700
They're either going to go the pro route and make them way too expensive or they're going

41:50.700 --> 41:52.180
to have to do the race to the bottom.

41:52.180 --> 41:53.460
They're going to make them cheap.

41:53.460 --> 41:54.460
There's no way they're not.

41:54.460 --> 41:55.460
Yeah.

41:55.460 --> 41:56.460
When they say they're working with OEMs.

41:56.460 --> 41:57.460
Yeah.

41:57.460 --> 41:59.980
Google are bad people doing bad things for bad reasons.

41:59.980 --> 42:01.340
Google doesn't work well, do they?

42:01.340 --> 42:02.980
They just are broken.

42:02.980 --> 42:04.900
Google is not good at making hardware.

42:04.900 --> 42:05.900
You know what they were good at making?

42:05.900 --> 42:06.900
Wave.

42:06.900 --> 42:07.900
And they killed it.

42:07.900 --> 42:08.900
God damn it.

42:08.900 --> 42:09.900
Wow.

42:09.900 --> 42:10.900
Nice.

42:10.900 --> 42:11.900
Another one every week.

42:11.900 --> 42:12.900
You're on a streak.

42:12.900 --> 42:13.900
I love it, dude.

42:13.900 --> 42:14.900
That's fantastic.

42:14.900 --> 42:15.900
I have to say.

42:15.900 --> 42:20.300
Yeah, I'm just surprised that there's no mechanism internally that sort of checks this stuff.

42:20.300 --> 42:22.220
At least it seems outwardly there is.

42:22.220 --> 42:25.260
They bought Motorola at one point and they were like, oh no, what are we doing?

42:25.260 --> 42:26.420
This is crazy.

42:26.420 --> 42:28.220
You would hope internally, right?

42:28.220 --> 42:31.980
They've looked and said, okay, when we did Honeycomb, which right, these are back like

42:31.980 --> 42:34.020
Android three, Android four days.

42:34.020 --> 42:35.020
It's three.

42:35.020 --> 42:36.020
Honeycomb is three.

42:36.020 --> 42:37.020
They just had a bump, right?

42:37.020 --> 42:41.660
Honeycomb is three point X, which is important because it ended up diverging quite a bit

42:41.660 --> 42:43.380
from from main, right?

42:43.380 --> 42:45.660
So that's that's why this is bad.

42:45.660 --> 42:46.660
Right.

42:46.660 --> 42:48.980
There's like a whole UI change right around then.

42:48.980 --> 42:49.980
It's it's a big divergence.

42:49.980 --> 42:50.980
Yeah.

42:50.980 --> 42:51.980
I see that way.

42:51.980 --> 42:52.980
Yeah.

42:52.980 --> 42:53.980
You got to hope internally.

42:53.980 --> 42:58.220
Okay, team, what did we do wrong back then?

42:58.220 --> 42:59.220
You forked it.

42:59.220 --> 43:00.220
Yeah.

43:00.220 --> 43:01.220
And then they just repeated that mistake, though.

43:01.220 --> 43:02.220
Yeah.

43:02.220 --> 43:06.900
I mean, and but in all fairness, obviously, iPad OS is a fork, right?

43:06.900 --> 43:12.460
But they did that at a time when they were developing the OS and when they announced

43:12.460 --> 43:16.580
the next version, they announced that they were separating the OS is right.

43:16.580 --> 43:19.900
They did it at release time where this is mid cycle.

43:19.900 --> 43:24.500
They are forking mid cycle, which means Android 13 will be a totally different thing and there

43:24.500 --> 43:27.100
will still be Android 12 L users out there.

43:27.100 --> 43:28.100
Yes.

43:28.100 --> 43:29.100
Okay.

43:29.100 --> 43:34.460
So iPad OS is a fork, but that often remerges with the main, right?

43:34.460 --> 43:37.760
I would say iPad OS is a fork on layers, Android.

43:37.760 --> 43:42.800
The way they seem to have done it is Honeycomb, for lack of a better word, or Android tablet

43:42.800 --> 43:46.900
is effectively its only it's like the Huawei derivative of Android, right?

43:46.900 --> 43:49.100
It's like its own thing.

43:49.100 --> 43:55.560
And so far, I mean, iPad OS 15 point whatever and iPhone OS 15 point whatever are are super

43:55.560 --> 43:56.740
close to each other.

43:56.740 --> 44:01.100
You know, there's a bunch of get merges there that have happened over and over again, right?

44:01.100 --> 44:02.100
Yeah.

44:02.100 --> 44:03.100
Oh, man.

44:03.100 --> 44:04.100
What an embarrassment.

44:04.100 --> 44:06.340
I kind of I'd be curious, though.

44:06.340 --> 44:11.020
You know, I'll watch I'm going to keep an open mind if they could come out with an iPad

44:11.020 --> 44:17.140
pro like tablet that had a good quality keyboard, some decent apps.

44:17.140 --> 44:20.740
You know, I'd consider it.

44:20.740 --> 44:21.740
I would love it.

44:21.740 --> 44:27.180
I mean, for these enterprise cases, I would much rather be doing Android than Windows

44:27.180 --> 44:30.260
for reasons of, you know, good Windows tablets.

44:30.260 --> 44:31.260
There's like three.

44:31.260 --> 44:32.260
They're all made by Microsoft.

44:32.260 --> 44:33.740
There you go.

44:33.740 --> 44:37.660
I think these iPad sales are cyclical.

44:37.660 --> 44:42.300
Last night, my wife was kind of giving me a hard time because she would like an iPad

44:42.300 --> 44:47.900
with an LTE connection because she's doing mobile care now after the covid shutdown.

44:47.900 --> 44:50.620
So she's now doing where she's going out to see clients.

44:50.620 --> 44:55.980
And so she'd love to have an iPad for her chart notes instead of having to take a tablet.

44:55.980 --> 44:57.940
And she's like, you know, I have expected you.

44:57.940 --> 45:02.020
I expected by now you would have upgraded your iPad because I've had this thing since

45:02.020 --> 45:03.020
2018.

45:03.020 --> 45:09.740
I got the 2018 iPad pro and it's just been such a solid little tablet that I haven't

45:09.740 --> 45:10.740
needed to buy it.

45:10.740 --> 45:11.740
I know you're in a similar situation.

45:11.740 --> 45:15.760
I think a lot of people out there bought in 2018 because that's when they kind of redid

45:15.760 --> 45:17.660
the design too.

45:17.660 --> 45:23.260
And I think the sales drop off until Apple really releases a pretty substantial upgrade

45:23.260 --> 45:27.340
and that last one was close, but it's still not quite enough.

45:27.340 --> 45:32.020
I get more and more years out of these iPads than I do out of a laptop.

45:32.020 --> 45:34.300
And that's got to affect the sales as well.

45:34.300 --> 45:39.220
And so I am looking for a tablet because my wife would like one for what she does.

45:39.220 --> 45:40.220
So we'll see.

45:40.220 --> 45:43.340
Either I'll end up getting one and she'll take mine or maybe one of these Android ones

45:43.340 --> 45:45.260
will come out and she'll like that.

45:45.260 --> 45:46.260
Keep my eye out.

45:46.260 --> 45:49.040
I do think there is a long term use case for them.

45:49.040 --> 45:52.500
They're not updated as frequently because it's just a slower market.

45:52.500 --> 45:55.420
And for people that are using it, it's like more low key usage.

45:55.420 --> 45:58.940
I want to say thank you to our Coder QA members.

45:58.940 --> 46:02.880
The new Coderly has been put together by Drew and will be out later this week.

46:02.880 --> 46:07.860
So if you would like to sign up, you get access to that and all previous Coderly reports.

46:07.860 --> 46:13.460
Go to CoderQA.co or you can become a network member and support all the shows.

46:13.460 --> 46:16.180
It's a great way to help us stay independent.

46:16.180 --> 46:21.860
And anytime we can diversify the income of the network and make sure that a as large

46:21.860 --> 46:27.340
as possible percentage comes from the audience, that is a financial incentive to always just

46:27.340 --> 46:31.860
remain absolutely focused on making our audience happy because they're the ones paying the

46:31.860 --> 46:32.860
bills.

46:32.860 --> 46:36.420
I think it's the best way to fund media personally.

46:36.420 --> 46:40.300
If I could, it'd be the only way media was funded, but we're not there yet.

46:40.300 --> 46:45.260
But you can help us get a little bit closer at CoderQA.co or Jupiter.party for the whole

46:45.260 --> 46:46.260
network.

46:46.260 --> 46:51.140
Well, Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send people before we wrap up this

46:51.140 --> 46:52.140
week?

46:52.140 --> 46:53.940
Follow me on Twitter at Dumanuco.

46:53.940 --> 46:58.980
And if you are in Florida and want to be a Python developer, you should let me know.

46:58.980 --> 46:59.980
Hmm.

46:59.980 --> 47:00.980
Hmm.

47:00.980 --> 47:01.980
Very nice.

47:01.980 --> 47:04.660
Contact the show at Coder.show slash contact.

47:04.660 --> 47:06.700
You can subscribe at Coder.show slash subscribe.

47:06.700 --> 47:09.620
If there's an episode you liked, send it to a friend.

47:09.620 --> 47:12.900
Word of mouth is the best way to help a podcast grow.

47:12.900 --> 47:14.180
We're always appreciative of that, too.

47:14.180 --> 47:16.700
It's a great way to support the show without spending a dime.

47:16.700 --> 47:19.740
But of course, we're just grateful you listen and download as well.

47:19.740 --> 47:20.940
And we'd love to have you join us live.

47:20.940 --> 47:24.500
We do it on Mondays at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern at jblive.tv.

47:24.500 --> 47:28.980
You can hang out in our chat room, help us title it, do a little pre-show.

47:28.980 --> 47:33.540
Sometimes we get on some topics like we did this week and we get a good discussion going.

47:33.540 --> 47:34.860
Anyways, we'll wrap it up there.

47:34.860 --> 47:37.420
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio Program.

47:37.420 --> 48:04.060
And we'll see you right back here next week.
