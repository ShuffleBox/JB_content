00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 481 for August 29th, 2022.

00:15.000 --> 00:24.000
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
My name is Chris, and our con-surviving hero, it's our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike!

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, I am plane-shifted back from what used to be called Dominaria.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Okay, how you feeling? Do you have any weird symptoms?

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
Nope, I'm feeling okay. I have to say, I had a great time.

00:46.000 --> 00:59.000
For those who don't, and you should religiously follow my Twitter, but for those who are blasphemers, I was at the Tampa TGC Con, and it was glorious. It was quite packed.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Was it?

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, for something of a, I know people hate when I say this, but second city to Miami in the state of Florida.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Are you rocking a Starry Night shirt?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
It is a Mario Starry Night shirt, yes.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Wait, you're saying it's Mario art on there in the Starry Night theme?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Yes, I have a bunch of them. I wear them to...

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Oh, you weren't lying. You went full geek.

01:22.000 --> 01:33.000
Oh, I do. I'm going to the prerelease this weekend for Magic, and I have a couple options. I have a Brutalist painted Sonic shirt.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
I have a similar Starry Night themed Wind Waker shirt. Actually, that's more like the Japanese watercolor style painting.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Oh my goodness.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
I have a shirt that is just the original Zelda NES map printed on one of them. They're all like Hawaiian style shirts, right?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Nice.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
Yeah, and I have a bunch of coding nerd shirts that I bought for non-gaming stuff, conventions.

01:54.000 --> 02:06.000
Good for you. One time I went on Amazon, and I looked for a bunch of shirts that I could find that were like $14, and that was my price target, and then I just added like a dozen of them, and now I just rotate through them.

02:06.000 --> 02:14.000
My wife wants me to do it too. I have seriously, seriously, seriously been thinking about doing the uniform lifestyle.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Really, Steve Jobs?

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah. I think part of the reason I haven't done it is because I don't want to get called Steve Jobs.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
But no, it's like I wake up sometimes in the morning, like today is a perfect example.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
I was woken up at 5, and so I just got up, and it was still dark. I didn't want to wake anybody else up.

02:34.000 --> 02:45.000
And so I got dressed in the dark. I combed my hair in the dark, and then I get to work, and I'm like, oh, you can really tell I got dressed in the dark. I really did. It just wasn't great.

02:45.000 --> 02:58.000
And so if I had just the same thing I wore every single day, the other thing is, because I got a belly, I'm dropping food on my shirts all the time, depending on where I'm sitting.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
The casualty rate on the shirts, it's way damn high. It's too damn high. It's too damn high. I don't have a great success rate at recovering them either.

03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
And so I have a lot of fallen soldiers in that regard. And so a uniform would just allow me to batch buy.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
I could buy five shirts at a time, five whatever at a time, and I just can't find anything that I think would look okay enough to do that.

03:22.000 --> 03:35.000
Honestly, if anybody has any suggestions, boost it in or go to the contact page. Seriously, let me know what's worked for you. I just can't even anymore.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
I like it. Yeah, I also have the same everything. You can tell what I had for lunch by two o'clock issue.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
I'm worried that my wife wants me to do it because she's sick of me complaining I have nothing to wear.

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
But at the same time, I think she'd get bored. So I'd have to honestly couldn't do it all the time, but at least for work or something.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
I mean, as long as it's a black, you know, turtleneck and blue jeans, I think you're well on your way.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
Like some white sneakers, maybe. You know, so recently I raised concerns about the Coder Radio mascot and the union.

04:06.000 --> 04:16.000
Those things have mostly settled in favor of the union for now. But the Coder Radio mascot hit me up on Twitter and wanted to remind me there's some big advantages to having a podcast mascot.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
And I just thought, you know what, this is new. We should probably get this settled because the shows, you know, we've reached a new era where we have a mascot.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
He says, imagine the next podcast convention you're at. So there was just one podcast movement in Dallas last week.

04:29.000 --> 04:37.000
You walk up to a fellow podcaster, maybe you don't particularly like them, and you just casually ask them, how's your podcast mascot doing?

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
When he admits he doesn't have a podcast mascot. Well, you could turn around and discussed.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
And a sorrow face and just walk away and shake in your head. What has the world come to?

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
He doesn't even have a podcast mascot. That's a great point. It's something we can lord over all other podcasts.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Those jerks at Linux Unplugged don't have a podcast mascot.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
It's true. My inner union buster is still kind of...

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
There's some advantages, though, I feel like, you know.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
There are advantages, yeah.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
It's like only big time podcasts have mascots.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
That's true.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Well, I feel like the mascot could be like, you know, like our vice president, the attack dog.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Like could lead the fight if somebody's coming at us, you know, trolls on Twitter. Sure.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
Like, I think we all need a little dick in our life. And by that, I mean Dick Cheney.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Snuck at Wilde.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
No, I knew what you meant.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I mean, who doesn't need a Dick Cheney?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I mean, Liz Cheney did.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Apparently Liz didn't.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Oh, right there.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Didn't help at all.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Poor Liz.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
What a way to go.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Oh, man. Embarrassing. I don't think we've seen the last of her.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah. So, notes on the con, though, real quick, right?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Oh, yeah.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
The level of... I've been to a few of these things in my life. Just a few.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
And the level of enthusiasm, the general friendliness, although I will say if you wear a super nerdy shirt,

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
people automatically talk to you because they're like, where the hell did you get that?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Sure.

06:00.000 --> 06:10.000
I have not seen a con quite this for like a small... This was the first one ever, too, for TCG Con in Tampa.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
So, I've not seen something blow up like this in a while. And I think that's just that pent-up COVID.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Like people just want to get the hell out.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
Hungry for it. And if you're an event that is willing to take a little risk, you can take advantage of that right now.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
I've heard that about a lot of the recent events is that, man, it was like the first time again for a lot of people.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
I get that. I think, unfortunately, my beloved Linux fest, Northwest, is going to miss out on a lot of that hype.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
We'll see.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
So, you know, we got an email in from a listener who I guess I did not grab their name, so I apologize about that.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
But they had a great point. They say, you know, here's the thing about the remote work is it really comes down to the worker

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
and the type of work they're doing.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
So, he says, I'd like to make a distinction.

06:51.000 --> 06:59.000
If you're an SME, say like a system matter expert, then working remotely is great because everyone comes to you.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
But if you're not a matter or a topic expert, then you have to make the greater effort to maintain a connection with others.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
I've been working remotely since 2017, and I hate it because I am a jack of all trades, master of none type.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Little things I used to do every day at work to help others get their stuff done are no longer part of my shtick.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
As a result, I have to work harder when I'm remote in order to accomplish the same tasks.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
That's interesting.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
He says he has a little bit of formula down here in the email.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
I feel like there should be an A percent B percent balance between at work and at home where A and B differs for different people and types of work.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Hybrid.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Although I hate the name hybrid for some reason, I don't know about you.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I can't stand hybrid work.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
It feels weird.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
It's like it's trying to be, I don't know, like techie, like hybrid cars or hybrid development.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Like, why do we got to label it, man?

07:47.000 --> 07:56.000
Why can't it be like, you know, you just come in on the days you need to come in and you just work at home on the days that you feel like you do more and better work at home.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
And as long as the work gets done, that's all that matters.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Like, why can't they get there?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
I mean, I know.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
I know why.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
But I'm just expressing my frustration as it just seems like that's all it would take.

08:06.000 --> 08:15.000
It's also super weird because like, particularly from a small business perspective, office space that isn't like super, you know, awful is really expensive.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
And those leases are very tough to get out of if the landlord chooses to make it so.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah, that could be multi-year.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Yeah.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I don't know why you would ever take, you know what I mean?

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
I don't know why you would ever take the halfway route when there are so many better options.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
Let's say if you guys do need to meet up like once a week or twice a month, just sign up for WeWork, do some kombucha.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
You'll be fine.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Like, it's cool.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah, get together somewhere.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
You know, if this was during the pandemic, the metaverse would come up right now.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
That's where we'd mention the metaverse.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
But now that we've sobered up a little bit, people don't seem to be talking about it too much.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Okay, moving on.

08:51.000 --> 08:59.000
D writes in, when I was young, I thought it was so leet to live in my key bindings for Tmux and Vim and never touch the mouse.

08:59.000 --> 09:07.000
But now, as I get older, using the mouse is just simply the least painful way to use a computer and make a living.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
I was curious how your RSI is doing.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I don't think we've had an RSI update on the show.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
We haven't.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
It's been better.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
A lot of it is I'm aggressively like, I have one of those autonomous standing desks.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
So I kind of have, you know, I went through the whole period where I basically optimized the crap out of everything.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
I will say using the keyboard that's sitting up a little higher.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I'm using the big launch has helped.

09:33.000 --> 09:41.000
Not using the same keyboard every day helps because I switch between, you know, this and the MacBook and the dev one.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah, pretty good.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I mean, how about you?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Better.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I mean, I've done a couple of things like you.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I've focused on better keyboards.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
And I think since I started doing that, it's been a lot better as a baseline.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
I also got a standing desk, so I kind of rotate through that.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And then I started taking magnesium every single night.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I think that's helped a little bit.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
The other thing that I did, this is going to get us kicked off of YouTube and canceled, but I'll take a few kratom red when I'm hurting.

10:08.000 --> 10:16.000
And it helps in a way that ibuprofen and other pain medicines do not seem to help because it seems to like actually keep the inflation down at bay.

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
So if I like take three a night for a few nights, it pretty much clears it up for a while for me.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
And that's been a really nice kind of alternative.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
And, you know, finding stuff that is decent.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
And I know that's one of those things that people can get go get crazy with and all of that.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
So you have to kind of, you know, know yourself.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
But the combination of all of that stuff.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
And I think, you know, also staying trying to stay more hydrated and trying to get sleep has helped.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
I can still have a bad RSI flare up if I'm editing a lot because that just I stay really super tense.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
But if I remind myself and I mean, it's easier to do this when I'm just doing my regular work to just kind of loosen up stretch and that kind of stuff.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
It helps as well.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
So, yeah, if everybody else has some great tips or tricks, let us know or is always happy to pass that wisdom on.

11:05.000 --> 11:13.000
And then I wanted to cover some of the Google feedback that we got kind of all in one batch because we talked last week about Google's 1984 moment.

11:13.000 --> 11:21.000
We all kind of remember, truly, truly chilling when Google flagged that dad's account for taking pictures of his son's medical issue.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
They auto batched up his Google history, which he had in it since the early aughts, about 15 years worth.

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
They automatically sent that to the cops and then they banned him permanently from the Google platform, including shutting down his cell service.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Not to mention just kind of labeling him as a child predator.

11:38.000 --> 11:46.000
And he's not the only one. The New York Times also highlighted another case that recently happened and it ended up interrupting the guy's mortgage negotiation process.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
So we did get some reactions from that in the boost.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
We got three thousand sats from he he told me how to say this.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
I say wooden, but it's like wooden wooden 501 boosted with three thousand sats.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
Google's actions will have serious life altering effects for people.

12:05.000 --> 12:12.000
Teachers, daycare workers, anyone who works with children's folks with federal security clearances that would probably be revoked in the short term.

12:12.000 --> 12:20.000
While the investigation proceeds, those types of people, all those people could lose their jobs as a result, even if they're completely innocent of any wrongdoing.

12:20.000 --> 12:28.000
I feel this seeking out new photos instead of just matching known photos is a step too far, causing more harm than good.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
I'm curious if that's the line for you.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
You know, the CSAM database is known photos. This is based on new stuff.

12:36.000 --> 12:43.000
The idea being that and the reason why they auto batch and send stuff to the police, the rationale is.

12:43.000 --> 12:50.000
There's still an opportunity to intervene and save a child and catch a predator in the act.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
If we identify new stuff, if we're just going off of old stuff, it's probably too late.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah, I mean, it's too late, but not for everything.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
Well, is it too late? I don't know that. Let's see.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
There's so many strong, strong assumptions either way, right?

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
Because you could argue if they have even the old stuff, then that's probably somebody who should be flagged and investigated.

13:12.000 --> 13:21.000
And I mean, if you have the system, I would imagine these guys don't they don't, you know, just wake up on a Tuesday and be like, I'm going to do this right.

13:21.000 --> 13:31.000
Yeah. But that said, though, I am I know, you know, we've had discussions in the past that I am more open to the Save the Children argument than you are.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
But this just is wild. I mean, the.

13:36.000 --> 13:44.000
You know, I feel like with the harder the response by the authorities, the more the Save the Children argument.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
You have to kind of measure it on a curve. I see what you're saying.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
Because this was. Yeah, I mean, there's two separate things. Can a private company cut you off from their service?

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah, they can. I mean, should they?

13:59.000 --> 14:11.000
I guess they can do whatever they want. Right. And I totally understand the perspective we got from other people that, well, Google's got to like limit their liability, which, yes.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Right. Of course.

14:13.000 --> 14:28.000
But she's the fact that this guy with with no knowledge until the police decided to investigate, tell him that they were investigating him, just got his life turned upside down for actually trying to be a good parent.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah. And just taking advantage of telemedicine, which a ton of people have been pushed into.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
Well, that's the part that kind of chaps my ass, because, you know, during Covid, I've used Teladoc.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
It's a telemedicine app a couple of times. I use it for my son.

14:42.000 --> 14:54.000
It's a big industry now. And frankly, I'm, you know, for practical reasons, medical reasons, I don't like to go to like hospitals right now because, you know, where am I going to more likely pick up Covid?

14:54.000 --> 15:10.000
Right. People who are like really, really sick. I just I just can't imagine that like if the doctor says to my to my boy, all right, buddy, I got to see like if you have a rash or something that I should, you know, lose all my digital stuff and prepare myself for the FBI.

15:10.000 --> 15:22.000
The local police to show up that that seems wild. There should be some sort of like like there's a reason no one's arresting pediatricians for for like touching children because it's their damn job.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
Right. It's a medical procedure. And this is just getting an opinion for tens of thousands of years.

15:27.000 --> 15:37.000
Right. And every parent knows that like you get a doctor you trust and you basically trust that doctor implicitly with your kid's life and everything and you assume nothing's going to happen.

15:37.000 --> 15:46.000
And we trust our phones, for better or for worse, that we we I think people maybe they don't even realize it, but kind of like at a low level, it's an extension of their brain more so than they want to admit.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
The problem, actually, now that I think about it, the problem is we have an exception really for anything.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
Right. You could tell like your doctor can't testify, you know, about your medical conditions or anything.

15:58.000 --> 16:13.000
And that's completely privileged, completely secret here in the States. But the minute it goes into the minute it's on your digital systems, I guess you waive doctor patient privilege effectively or it seems it seems like there should be.

16:13.000 --> 16:20.000
And maybe there is interesting if you're working on this listener to write in some sort of.

16:20.000 --> 16:29.000
App, I mean, maybe Teladoc is that app and maybe. But still, he just put it and it automatically saved to his photos and sync to Google Photos. And that's like.

16:29.000 --> 16:36.000
It just seems so hard core. It just seems so. Kind of zero to one hundred.

16:36.000 --> 16:50.000
And like, like, goddamn, no time automatic. This dude. And, you know, we've all we've all been there. Those of us who have kids where your kid is acting ill. Something's weird. You kind of go into a.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
And especially in the age of pandemics, you go into a bit of a panic and you're not thinking four steps ahead.

16:56.000 --> 17:10.000
You know, is is some some, you know, probably offshore or probably low paid contract contractor who just looks at tens of thousands of images a day going to just kind of wrote spam this and the cops are going to show up.

17:10.000 --> 17:23.000
Yeah, it's going to be a low effort thing. And I hate the fact that, you know, Google's automatically displaying it to some person somewhere, probably some offshore place, which even if they don't flag it is just a horrible violation of your and your child's privacy in this case.

17:23.000 --> 17:33.000
You can also be forgiven for just a cute moment. You know, the mother of my kids and I are separated. And so we've you know, for years we've shared pictures back and forth of moments at the pool or whatever.

17:33.000 --> 17:40.000
Like there's just you know, it's just we share a lot of photos back and forth because, you know, one of us isn't there for some moment very frequently.

17:40.000 --> 17:48.000
And so, you know, we're just totally in a trap now. And I think Trevdev boosted with two thousand stats sort of feeling the same.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
He says, thanks for the Google PSA. My wife and I adopted Google Photos when our daughter was born.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
Our whole family enjoys a shared album and it has a bunch of great features for that.

17:57.000 --> 18:04.000
Now I have to go on all of them about them or maybe my daughter when they handle their devices, because you're right.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
These accusations are enough to destroy lives.

18:08.000 --> 18:18.000
And that's just it. And also, the more publicity this stuff gets, the more the messages sent out to the offenders, you know, don't use Google Photos.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
So the only people that don't really hear it are people who don't think they have anything to hide and they end up getting sucked into this.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
And Marcel boosted with two thousand stats. I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
But here's what I'm curious about. How did Google train this model?

18:31.000 --> 18:41.000
You can train with hashes, but somebody eventually had to train this thing to identify new body parts and new aspects.

18:41.000 --> 18:50.000
And you think about the work that Google paid people to do or hired from some some company where they paid people to do.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
I don't like where that goes quick. Like that's the other element of this.

18:54.000 --> 19:05.000
Maybe the tech company should just stay out of all this, because if you think about how dark this gets for them to actually be able to have this ability, the kind of things that they had to do and the things that people had to look at.

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
Maybe they should have just stayed out of all of this. Maybe they could have built these systems so they just never routed through their servers to begin with or something.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
I don't know. Right. But that would defeat many of their commercial goals.

19:16.000 --> 19:24.000
Google photos. I know. But when you think about how they train this model, doesn't it just disgust you when you start to think of the likely ways they accomplish that task?

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
Yeah, I mean, well, they've admitted this, right?

19:28.000 --> 19:35.000
Like years ago, there used to be a team at Google that basically their job was to delist some of the more horrific stuff.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
I think that's definitely...

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
It's an element of it I just don't like. So I have something to kind of pick up the mood.

19:42.000 --> 19:49.000
Listener Jacob tweeted at you and I suggesting that maybe it was time to look at iOS 16 on the iPad now that the latest beta is here.

19:49.000 --> 20:00.000
And so I gave it a really quick look. I have a 2018 iPad Pro, and I guess that doesn't get to have the new fancy stage manager stuff or whatever it's called.

20:00.000 --> 20:07.000
So I'm a little disappointed in that. But there is one feature in iOS 16 that I really like.

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
I think the new lock screen looks good, too. But have you had an opportunity to play around with the new beta that came out?

20:12.000 --> 20:21.000
I have not on an iPad for the very, very lame reason that I'm currently doing a production iPad project and don't want to update it.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Oh, sure. Yeah, that makes sense.

20:23.000 --> 20:31.000
Yeah, I have an iPad. And the kind of most production thing that I use it for is when I'm driving my RV.

20:31.000 --> 20:41.000
I have an ODB to plug that plugs into the diagnostic port for the truck engine and over Wi-Fi that streams all kinds of data to my iPad that I log and display.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
And so I find that to actually be useful and valuable, but it generally doesn't break between upgrades.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
So I went ahead and took the plunge and I put iOS 16 on the iPad, which sounds like Apple is going to delay the final release.

20:54.000 --> 21:04.000
So I wouldn't expect a lot of changes. I don't know. I think they're they're focusing on the phone release for a bit and then they're going to come back to iPad OS.

21:04.000 --> 21:11.000
But there's an aspect in iPad OS and in iOS that I am so happy to see.

21:11.000 --> 21:18.000
So I am the family manager in my iCloud shared family setup with the kids and my wife.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
I'm the person that set that up. And so I don't know if this is available for all of them,

21:22.000 --> 21:30.000
but it's available for me now is I can now in the family area see the subscriptions for everyone's iCloud accounts.

21:30.000 --> 21:37.000
This is a big deal because I understand previously you had to go to each effing device or account,

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
look on their device and see what their subscriptions were.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
I had no way of reviewing all of their subscriptions, even though I'm the one paying for them.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
It was charging my flipping account, but I couldn't even tell you by email.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
I couldn't I'd look at the receipts. There was no metadata to tell me whose subscription was what.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
And of course, some of these things are atrocious scams.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
And so you want to track it down as fast as possible.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
And I just like keeping an eye on all these subscriptions as we talked about last episode.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
You got to, you know, you got to make sure you're keeping tabs on these things.

22:06.000 --> 22:15.000
And sure enough, now all your accounts in the family plan can be reviewed in one spot in iOS.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
Whoo. Praise Jobs. That right there, in my opinion, is worth the upgrade.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
Well, you're about to put on the the uniform. So praise Jobs indeed.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah, right. I'm slipping into a hole, man. Save me.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
I just want to say you remember that it's a cult, right? Just just a friendly reminder.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
Yeah. And we do have our indoctrination tour coming up along the West Coast.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting. We now have the venues locked in.

22:45.000 --> 22:55.000
And thanks to our West Coast crew in our matrix chat room, we managed to find awesome breweries for every city we're stopping in.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
So it's a brewery tour. We didn't even plan for that, but it just makes so much sense in retrospect.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
So the details are there now at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
And we have selected the names. I announced them in Linux Unplugged.

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
But I'm also going to write out send out emails today as I record, which is Monday, the twenty ninth.

23:16.000 --> 23:24.000
I will send out emails to folks who've had their name selected to join us at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory tour on September twenty ninth.

23:24.000 --> 23:30.000
So we have southern Oregon. We're going to have a meetup, northern California, southern California.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
And then on our way back up the coast, we're going to do a meetup in Portland.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
So all of those are at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
Get your names in now if you're going because we want to let the venues know about how many people to expect.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
I don't know if it's going to be huge, too. So if you're not a big crowd person, I wouldn't worry about it.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
I don't think these are going to be like two hundred people meetups.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
I think these are going to be like ten, twenty, thirty people meetups, maybe smaller depending on the venue.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
So let us know. Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

23:57.000 --> 24:07.000
And then we have that West Coast crew at BIT.LY slash West Coast Crew.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
Linode.com slash Coder. Go there to get a hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
And it's just a great way to support the show while you're checking something out.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting. You got to try it for your next project.

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
It's what we're using for our new website. It's what we use for any of the infrastructure we've built in nearly the last three years.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
And now that Linode has been rolling out MVME storage, I feel like my rigs just got a silent upgrade.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
I didn't even realize it'd be available on some of the systems I already had deployed.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
That's one of the things I love about Linode is when I come on here and I tell you about new features.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
A lot of times they just give you that upgrade. They'll just work it in.

24:41.000 --> 24:49.000
You know, just this half year alone, they've rolled out multiple databases of service platforms, MVME storage, the new AMD EPYC CPUs.

24:49.000 --> 24:56.000
And of course, there are 11 data centers around the world have the best Internet connection possible because Linode is their own ISP.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
That's it. And they've been doing this for nearly 19 years.

24:58.000 --> 25:05.000
And they really know how to dial it in because that 19 years has been made possible by the quality of their product,

25:05.000 --> 25:12.000
not by VC money injections that are just throwing money into a hole, but by the quality of their product selling.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
And that's what's kept them going for nearly 19 years.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
And so they, as just a matter of market forces, they've refined this thing into something that's compelling.

25:20.000 --> 25:26.000
And any skill level, a new user or an experienced developer, you're going to be able to use their dashboard,

25:26.000 --> 25:32.000
their API and all of the libraries they make available to integrate it in with your existing software

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
or maybe infrastructure management tools as well.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
It's a great way to go if you're an Ansible fan.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
There's so many things you can try and learn over at Linode.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
So I think that $100, I think that's probably the thing that we should come back to.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
And I just got to say, that's a real opportunity to try it.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Not like it's 15 bucks for a month, right?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
We're talking $100 for 60 days.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
You can really deploy some serious infrastructure.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
You could put something into testing.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Maybe there's a project you wanted to try and you just haven't had the right machine forever.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
This is your opportunity.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
And it's a great way to support the show too.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
So head over to linode.com slash coder for that.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
Get that $100 for 60 days on a new account and you support the show.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
We really do appreciate that.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
So again, linode.com slash coder.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
We call them dark matter developers, but this author calls them the silent majority.

26:21.000 --> 26:28.000
But either way, they represent a big swath of developers who probably feel a little underrepresented

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
when they go on places like Hacker News and they see everyone talking about the latest Web3 app

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
that they're working on or something written in Rust.

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
Meanwhile, the bulk of them are just out there doing Perl, PHP, maybe even a little COBOL

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
and just chipping away at it every single day.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
I thought this was a pretty decent article though.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
And it reminded me of a couple of topics we've touched on with sort of a fresh take.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Yeah, I liked it.

26:53.000 --> 27:00.000
I mean, I have to say that, you know, having done this forever, it feels like forever now,

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
especially the show part.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
I love the show.

27:02.000 --> 27:09.000
But having to read all the crap on like Reddit and Hacker News, it's like, oh, look,

27:09.000 --> 27:15.000
five people use JavaScript to reinvent something that was better before for no reason.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
Oh, look, the JavaScript framework that everybody had apparently learned last year

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
because of the new hotness is now the old crappy thing.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Great.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
And I don't mean to exclusively dunk on the web dev community.

27:27.000 --> 27:33.000
It's just it's a lot of I mean, seriously, spend some time on Reddit and Hacker News.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Just just don't go to rslash the next.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
It's a bad place.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Stay a while and listen.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
You sound like old man over there.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Yeah, it's like, OK, like I remember.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Do you remember two years ago or three?

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
Oh, God, like four years ago, it was like WebAssembly.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
It's coming for you.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
It's coming for your children.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
All the things will be WASM.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I was going to bring that up, actually.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
Yeah. Remember how that was like the big thing for like 10 minutes?

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
And well, you know, not so much.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Right. It certainly has its uses.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
It's certainly being used, but it has not conquered the world, shall we say.

28:08.000 --> 28:14.000
Now I'm seeing this Web3 crap, although I have to say the Web3 stuff isn't picking up quite as well.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
But there's a lot of it, you know.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
Yeah. Well, there's a lot of VC money sloshing around and they got nothing better to do.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
So they're just going to keep throwing money at it.

28:20.000 --> 28:30.000
And recent micro services are my favorite to dunk on because let's make our application even more complicated.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Right. Although they do have a place sometimes.

28:32.000 --> 28:38.000
But if you are not 100 percent sure it should be a micro service, then it shouldn't.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
The bit that I thought was a couple of bits, but one of the bits that stood out to me.

28:41.000 --> 28:49.000
They write while browsing Hacker News, I sometimes get the feeling that every developer out there is working on a fang app.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
There's always somebody who's doing some sort of hype stuff.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
You might think PHP is never used nowadays because it's never mentioned and everyone's always hating on it.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
But the other thing he points out, which is the element of this, I'm not really sure we've touched on before.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
We've talked about the dark matter developer, which he calls the silent majority.

29:06.000 --> 29:18.000
There's also the dark matter user, the silent user who never gives feedback, either because they're happy with the product as it is or because they don't bother to take the time to fill out surveys and submit bug reports because it's working.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
The silent majority are the are your customers.

29:21.000 --> 29:30.000
As a result, companies often have a skewed view of their user base and improve the wrong things.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
Yep. I've watched this happen to multiple companies from the inside.

29:35.000 --> 29:45.000
You can have fundamental systemic problems with the product that overall are going to hurt retention.

29:45.000 --> 29:52.000
And I have seen one person complain on Twitter that tweet makes it into a leadership meeting.

29:52.000 --> 29:59.000
And then it defines the priorities for the entire leadership team for that week, which then, of course, trickles down to all of their staff.

29:59.000 --> 30:06.000
And everybody jumps into action because someone on the leadership team got tweeted at by one person.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
Meanwhile, there's like, you know, the boat is like taking on water.

30:10.000 --> 30:18.000
And I just yeah. So, boy, does this resonate and the silent users who are just sort of like peacing out and like not leaving a complaint.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
They're just like, I'm out of here. You know that they're not they're not registering as a data point.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
So they can say they're data driven and feedback driven, but it just doesn't work.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
So he continues. Users who are happy with the product almost never fill out the surveys.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
It's a waste of time. If they're using a service and they're satisfied with it, they'll just keep using it.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
If they're not, they just jump to another one.

30:37.000 --> 30:44.000
And then this guy proposes that the solution is that dark matter developers should be more vocal, as he puts it.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
When it comes to the software community, there are two schools of thought.

30:47.000 --> 30:56.000
Some people believe it's important to be vocal and share your opinions, while others believe it's better to stay quiet and let the quality of your work speak for itself.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
Personally, I believe that being more vocal can only be a good thing.

31:00.000 --> 31:10.000
He also argues that a lot of developers these days are constrained by NDAs so they can get, you know, well down into their career, but they can't talk about most of what they've done because it's NDA.

31:10.000 --> 31:17.000
So he's like, you know, letting your quality of your work stand for itself isn't speak for itself, isn't going to work if it's all NDA.

31:17.000 --> 31:25.000
What he's proposing is that developers, you know, the vast majority out there that are just working at a job, getting things done as it's assigned to them.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
His proposal is that they should start up blogs, podcasts and YouTube channels.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
And vocalize more.

31:32.000 --> 31:40.000
It just seems like never like it's that just I don't that isn't seems like a horrible suggestion to me, actually.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
So that's not how I took it. But I would say that's a lot to ask.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
The way I took it was more like be active on the subreddits and Hacker News.

31:48.000 --> 31:55.000
And I would argue that that is not a mentally sound thing to do for any buddy.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
Yeah, I could see I could see that point. And I would agree. That's horrible.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
I mean, I'm not going to just dunk on R slash Linux, but why not?

32:01.000 --> 32:07.000
You know, the people who are going to engage in Reddit flame wars really just like love it.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
Right. They're not there necessarily to be constructive.

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
Now, some are right. Some are, you know, like we'll answer questions in particular.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
I know I'm going back, but the old Ubuntu forms used to be really good for that.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
Yeah. That's a classic callback, but they sure were.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
Right. But what happened to people? So the so the, you know, the alpha nerds started dunking on Ubuntu

32:29.000 --> 32:34.000
because God forbid you have a gooey and sound that kind of works too much fun.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
Right. If it's not arch, you know, if you didn't compile it from source, you suck.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
I don't know. I you know, I mean, I'm sure people have noticed I don't engage on the Reddit anymore

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
because it's really just a cesspool. I lurk Reddit.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
And I sometimes we find good stories for the show there. Hacker News.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
You got to understand Hacker News is not exactly an open board either.

32:58.000 --> 33:05.000
It's funded and hosted by Y Combinator and both, you know, accidentally because of where it is.

33:05.000 --> 33:13.000
It has a and I'm pretty sure intentionally it has a pretty heavy startup kind of lean to it.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
When you're a startup and you're raising money, you always have to say that like everything we're doing is the newest, hottest, sexiest.

33:18.000 --> 33:25.000
Right. Right. This might be me being elitist, but I have to wonder if there isn't some truth to this.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
I acknowledge upfront I'm going to couch a little bit that this is not a universal truth.

33:29.000 --> 33:38.000
Generally, people who are busy creating and making things don't spend their time taking a crap in the comments somewhere

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
or crapping on somebody else's work. They generally are just heads down working.

33:42.000 --> 33:50.000
And so as a result, I think not again, not majority, but I think a good chunk of the people generally participating in the discussion,

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
especially as you scroll down in ranking, they don't have anything better to do.

33:54.000 --> 34:02.000
That might mean that, you know, while their opinion doesn't shouldn't be disregarded, maybe it just shouldn't be fully weighted either.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
You know what I'm saying? Like people who are busy making things aren't busy crapping in comment sections.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
It's just sort of, I think, a universal truth.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
Yeah, I'd even take it a step further, right? If you're really focused on making a product or a service,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
you're probably not going to pick the new hotness technology.

34:18.000 --> 34:25.000
You're probably not going to be doing something you haven't done before because your goal is to get it out, get product market fit and be done.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Years ago, I think we're going back a decade now.

34:27.000 --> 34:35.000
Rob Connery had a when he had his tech pub company, which is long since acquired by Pluralsight.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
Pluralsight, is that the guys who ate Linux Academy, eventually?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Yeah, I think ultimately.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
Yeah, so he was acquired by Pluralsight with that venture.

34:44.000 --> 34:51.000
And he had this great post about why he built his tech pub stuff in dot net.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
And I think it was dot net.

34:53.000 --> 35:02.000
Yeah. And the answer was because I know dot net and I could get it out there the quickest with the least hassle and see if anybody subscribed.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
Your business is to sell the product and not to play with technology.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
Unless Westpain challenges you, then that's different.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
You never know. Sometimes he just drops it.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
You never know. He's always there waiting to strike.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
Always lurking. You don't know he's there. He's very good at hiding it.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
But he's there. He's there. He's there every single time.

35:24.000 --> 35:31.000
Tailscale, y'all. Go over to tailscale.com slash coder and get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and you support the show.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
Tailscale is a zero config VPN that is changing the industry.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
I see more people talking about tail scale now than ever.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
It's clearly because of these spots here on coder. I mean, obviously.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
What's that? It's because of the quality of the product you say? What was that?

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
I'm sorry. I just got my imaginary producer.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
They have a really good product based on WireGuard's noise protocol.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
Yeah. What's that? Builds a flat mesh network.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Okay. Really handy. Right.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Yeah. No, I will tell them that. Yeah.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
My fake producer tells me that I should tell you that since we started using tail scale,

36:03.000 --> 36:10.000
I no longer have any inbound ports on my firewall and I'm no longer screwing around with SSH jump hosts like I used to either.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
That used to be a thing that I like did all the time.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
It was like a standard maneuver.

36:14.000 --> 36:23.000
So I really feel like the way I remote compute has shifted and it's shifted for the better in a way that's never going back.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
And just recently, tail scale launched tail scale SSH.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
Say goodbye to managing your SSH keys.

36:30.000 --> 36:37.000
No more jump boxes, no more like setting up inbound ports like an SSH in.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
It's so awesome.

36:39.000 --> 36:45.000
Easily manage your SSH connections in tail scale and tail scale has a whole set of ACL support.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
Of course, they also let you put DNS in there so you can just resolve machines by their name if you'd like.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
They'll bust through your double net. I can attest to that.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
It'll work with your existing firewall and it's super smart about how it routes traffic.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
So it's not just sending everything over the tail scale connection.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
You know, some VPNs do that. No, it's not going to do that.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
And tail scale will snap right in with your existing authentication infrastructure.

37:08.000 --> 37:15.000
So if you want to enforce multifactor authentication, the authorized employees who move on a few years into the workplace, you can do all that.

37:15.000 --> 37:23.000
And you can also just share a single machine and a single port on that machine if you want, which has been so handy when we're doing just different experiments for the shows and whatnot.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
So go try it for yourself.

37:25.000 --> 37:34.000
Support the whole dang network and the show and get it for free up to 20 devices when you go to tailscale.com slash coder one more time.

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
That's tailscale.com slash coder.

37:39.000 --> 37:48.000
So, of course, Apple's screwing the show once again next week, they're holding their live event on the day our show gets released.

37:48.000 --> 37:55.000
So we'll be recording on Monday and then as Apple is doing their event, our show comes out screwing our downloads.

37:55.000 --> 38:03.000
But also. We won't know whether we won't be able to cover it like they're just they do this to us all the time now.

38:03.000 --> 38:09.000
I think it's ever since we started criticizing Tim Cook, but Apple is holding a live event September 7th at 10 a.m.

38:09.000 --> 38:19.000
next week, and it's the iPhone 14 event, no doubt, and the teaser is far out. It looks like maybe there'll be some night photography capabilities or something like that.

38:19.000 --> 38:25.000
I don't think you're very hyped about this one. In fact, I think you have predicted this might be the most boring iPhone release ever.

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
I am more excited about the release of Dominar United for MTG. I couldn't care less about this Apple event.

38:31.000 --> 38:40.000
Now, why is that? Because I have an iPhone right next to me. It's great. Yeah, it works fine. My iPad is great. It works fine.

38:40.000 --> 38:49.000
Can I tell you something? I think sales are going to be unless unless they do a design change caveat design change always sells.

38:49.000 --> 38:59.000
If it's if it's not a design change or if it's a very minor design change, perhaps I think this could be one of their worst iPhone sales since the iPhone launch because we'll see.

38:59.000 --> 39:07.000
Maybe not. But I think everybody's really feeling the pinch right now. Consumer demand and consumer sentiment is way down.

39:07.000 --> 39:12.000
In fact, consumer sentiment is like it levels during the 2008 crash. It is bad right now.

39:12.000 --> 39:17.000
And I think people are just feeling the pinch of inflation, the pinch of energy prices.

39:17.000 --> 39:24.000
And I think the luxury of a twelve hundred dollar cell phone just seems a little frivolous, especially when it's working just fine.

39:24.000 --> 39:32.000
You know, my wife has the iPhone like eleven. It's still perfectly fine. It doesn't. I was thinking about it's like she's fine.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
I don't need to replace it when it comes up and I don't really need to replace mine.

39:35.000 --> 39:40.000
I I likely will because I just have their stupid subscription program.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
And so it's like a fifty dollars change and I have another phone. Right.

39:44.000 --> 39:51.000
So I likely will, although probably won't be for a while because I'll be on my road trip and it's just not a priority unless they really blow our socks off.

39:51.000 --> 39:57.000
I mean, from a dev perspective, there's really nothing that's coming out that you would need this new phone for.

39:57.000 --> 40:03.000
There's almost certainly I mean, there's been leaks. Right. There's not going to be a new screen resolution that you need to worry about.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
Yeah. If they had like some new sensor, perhaps. But that's not going to be for most developers.

40:08.000 --> 40:14.000
No. And the problem with the new sensor is are you going you can't really exclusively developed for one device.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
So you still need ways to handle not having that sensor. And I don't think there is a new sensor.

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
Right. Isn't the leaks aren't suggesting that to be true.

40:24.000 --> 40:30.000
What I've seen leaked is that we might see a slight tweak of the face ID.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
That's what I saw. Notch. Yeah. So what? I mean, I don't mean to be a Debbie Downer.

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
If if, you know, listener, you're excited about a new iPhone, by all means, enjoy yourself.

40:40.000 --> 40:47.000
We all have hobbies. I just you know, I've been a little bored with the Apple stuff recently.

40:47.000 --> 40:54.000
I don't know if it's just because I to me, the most interesting thing they've come out with in a while is Swift UI.

40:54.000 --> 41:01.000
And a lot of those ideas are straight out of things like React. Right. I don't think they're going to get it with iOS.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
You know, they filed that trademark for reality. I also don't know that.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
I mean, I can't even imagine what an Apple headset would cost.

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
So I'm feeling like where I was hoping that things would be really hot is the iPad.

41:15.000 --> 41:23.000
But by all reports, all rumors, iOS 16 is just a show on iPad right now.

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
And it's still still they have not changed their policies.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
There was like a glimmer of hope that they were going to at one level at WWDC.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
But they have not opened that up to be the true tablet computer that it can be.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
You know, I think Apple has made a lot of savvy moves in the last few years.

41:41.000 --> 41:50.000
But I'm wondering if on some levels, metal wasn't just a huge mistake in terms of platform adoption.

41:50.000 --> 41:56.000
I wonder if they couldn't have gone just all in on Vulkan, just fully gone in on Vulkan, because I know they are involved in the standards body.

41:56.000 --> 42:06.000
It seems to me if Apple comes out with a AR VR headset, which Mark Gurman seems to suggest they're at least getting the trademarks filed for getting ready.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
I could see them. You know, they could do the displays really well.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
I think they could have decent battery life. I think there would be an app store for it.

42:13.000 --> 42:19.000
All that would be there. But what would be missing is really good games, like big industry games.

42:19.000 --> 42:26.000
Or what would be missing is really immersive things that creators could throw together using the standard tools that they can use for all of the other platforms.

42:26.000 --> 42:34.000
And imagine if every MacBook had just incredible Vulkan support.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
If the games ran on Vulkan, then you could use something like Proton.

42:37.000 --> 42:45.000
Instead, what we have now is like you have at best stuff that kind of is like shims that converts Vulkan and OpenGL into metal.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
And it's just not ideal. And it requires the developers to build those shims.

42:49.000 --> 42:59.000
And it just seems like the limiting factor on why I haven't just gone hog wild on the M hardware is because, well, I want to play video games sometimes.

42:59.000 --> 43:09.000
I'm still forced to own PCs and PCs that are portable, that can play video games and don't suck are hard to come by.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I was going to say no such animal. Yeah.

43:11.000 --> 43:17.000
Yeah, it'd be so nice if the world had just full, beautiful Vulkan support on Apple's devices.

43:17.000 --> 43:27.000
And then when they start talking about a two thousand dollar headset, I'm maybe a little more interested because I know there would be an entire ecosystem of applications that I could run on there.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
But if it's just metal, then it's just the App Store stuff.

43:32.000 --> 43:39.000
And that's too restrictive for a real computing device for an appliance that I make phone calls on.

43:39.000 --> 43:45.000
OK, I don't mind it being locked down. But my tablet, it needs to be more like my laptop.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
It needs to be like they've made the Mac a lot more like iPads.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Now they need to make the iPad a little more like the Mac.

43:50.000 --> 43:57.000
They need to open up and a headset. I know this sounds silly, but I'm going to buy a two thousand dollar headset that's a computing environment.

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
I'm probably going to eventually find it to be really constricted if I can only get App Store stuff and only metal apps.

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
It's going to be like Apple's bestest partners at the time. It's just not sufficient for a device like that.

44:08.000 --> 44:18.000
And so while I'm sure overall metal is a great strategy and it makes a lot of sense and it's given them tons of flexibility and it's a really great API overall, I think there has been a strategy tax here.

44:18.000 --> 44:26.000
For your average dev going forward with the headset, you're probably not even going to know it's metal because you're just going to be using Unity or Unreal.

44:26.000 --> 44:38.000
But I do think you have a point in that the even the Macs are less capable compared to, say, a Linux machine because they went this crazy other way.

44:38.000 --> 44:45.000
Right. And it's not not that you couldn't get Proton running on Mac, not that there are. It is. It does run on Mac, just not super well.

44:45.000 --> 44:53.000
Yeah. I mean, I just think they don't care. Right. For them, it's about generating more services, revenue and lock in is a part of that.

44:53.000 --> 45:02.000
Yeah. And it's a comprehensive platform. And it's it's just an Apple's DNA to control all that kind of stuff.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
And I would I would accept the argument because what the hell do I know?

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
I'd accept the argument that metal has given Apple's platform more pros than it has cons.

45:11.000 --> 45:22.000
That that seems that seems possible to me. But a lot of times when we look at Apple's ecosystem and their closed nature, we sometimes don't see the cost of some of these things.

45:22.000 --> 45:36.000
And I'm not very excited about this stuff because I know ultimately it's just going to be so limited and it's it's still possible for Apple to create such a great experience in that limited range of stuff that it's valuable.

45:36.000 --> 45:43.000
But I'm skeptical. I think at the end of the day, what we're going to get is a nicer Oculus, which is fine.

45:43.000 --> 45:49.000
I mean, I mean, the mobile Oculus, too, not the not the big Oculus. We'll see. I don't think we'll see it at this event.

45:49.000 --> 45:58.000
What we'll do is we'll we'll you know, we'll monitor the event. And if there's anything notable, especially impactful to developers or something like that, we can always follow up with the next week.

45:58.000 --> 46:08.000
I suppose it would be nice if Apple would just plan their events around the show like they used to. But alas, somebody had to go and get Tim mad.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
All right. We got a few more boosts to round out the show.

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
Oh, a guy one boosted in with two thousand two hundred and twenty two sats.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
But honest and truly, I am Robin Hood.

46:21.000 --> 46:28.000
He said, Have you considered Twitch as a platform for continued monetization? It has a culture of cheering streamers on with monetary rewards.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
While it isn't open source and it is a single platform, it might be a good place to diversify your income.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
People stream all kinds of things like tweaking their files, maybe stream some of your server maintenance.

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
Mike could live stream his personal development. If peer to had boosts and emotes built in, that'd be a different thing.

46:44.000 --> 46:49.000
What do you think, Mike? I know you've toyed with the idea of doing live stream development sessions.

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
Although you probably didn't look at it as like a monetization strategy.

46:54.000 --> 47:03.000
Yeah, I mean, I think I've talked about this on the air, right? I keep wanting to do like a very kind of loose learn to code for kids thing.

47:03.000 --> 47:11.000
Yeah. You know, using completely free stuff, VS code, stuff like that themed off of like, you know, classic fairy tales or stories or whatever.

47:11.000 --> 47:19.000
Basically, you know, help the sheep cross the bridge so the wolf doesn't eat them kind of thing with Python or whatever, Ruby.

47:19.000 --> 47:25.000
Just the setup to get all that running, like I got to give it to those Twitch people.

47:25.000 --> 47:32.000
One, I have logged into Twitch twice in my life. I still don't get it.

47:32.000 --> 47:38.000
For instance, can I watch a video that's already aired? I think it depends on the creator. I think they can turn that on.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
That's dumb. You're just recreating the worst of broadcast TV.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Yeah, yeah.

47:44.000 --> 47:51.000
I just yeah, I don't I don't get it. Although I am, again, all roads lead to the Magic the Gathering, apparently.

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
I am watching a lot of EDH slash Commander on YouTube.

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
And that's because YouTube is a paradigm that I understand.

48:01.000 --> 48:11.000
Even then, the I mean, I used to make short little instructional videos and just the level of effort to get any content up that was even halfway decent was like what?

48:11.000 --> 48:17.000
Three to one. Yeah. I mean, I know you used to do the old Linux action show at your big reporter desk.

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
Remember the good old days? What was the production like for that?

48:22.000 --> 48:30.000
I mean, it is a thing, you know, for sure. And I think the other thing about Twitch is it kind of gives you a skewed perspective because all you see is the success.

48:30.000 --> 48:41.000
Just below the surface, there are tens of thousands of streamers with like two viewers grinding it out for a decade and just getting emotionally wrecked over it.

48:41.000 --> 48:51.000
It I've seen it chew people up on the inside. I'll just say quickly, you know, me being an old man now, I'm not really too inclined to want to join somebody else's platform.

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
And they dictate what I can and can't do. They dictate when I get paid. They dictate with the circumstance.

48:55.000 --> 49:07.000
It's like I've just done that game so much. I'd rather use PeerTube and just wait for the community to build in boost support and things like that and build the audience over there, even though it would be much slower.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
You know, like I look at JupiterTube, the views, you know, a couple hundred views, 300 views.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
Of course, the view counts are not accurate either. But in another year, they might be getting what the YouTube videos are getting.

49:15.000 --> 49:22.000
And beyond that, you know, that's all I care about. I just want people to have another option besides the commercial platforms.

49:22.000 --> 49:31.000
I wonder if Noob Steve had a theme. So let us know, Noob Steve, if 4,444 sets represent something. But I say it's a hot boost.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Coming in hot with the boost.

49:33.000 --> 49:38.000
He says, I agree with all of Mike's points on subscriptions. I'm also burnt out.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
I have three that I don't dread paying for. Apple One, LastPass and Jupiter Party. Hey-o!

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Thanks, Noob Steve.

49:44.000 --> 49:57.000
He says, I'm at the point where I'm going to use an app more than once. I just gladly pay one time 50 or lifetime 100. You know, if I had even paid 100 bucks for a lifetime, I would do that over paying $5 a month.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
I just hate having to track all these. Adobe kills me with this specifically.

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
I have to often convert a PDF to Word documents, you know, maybe eight times a year.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Well, he continues with another 4,444 sets.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Coming in hot with the boost.

50:11.000 --> 50:17.000
I can't just spend 50 bucks on Adobe Pro and call it a day. I have to subscribe for $14.99 a month.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Then I end up forgetting to cancel it, so I end up paying more money.

50:20.000 --> 50:27.000
Or if I remember to cancel it, I just effectively have to pay it again next time I need to convert something. I absolutely hate it.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
The Adobe One grinds my gears too.

50:30.000 --> 50:35.000
I hate the Adobe One. I used to get it for free. I mean, uh...

50:35.000 --> 50:41.000
Oh, did you see that in Canada right now, they have a Photoshop web trial that they're doing?

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Really?

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Yeah, you can use it from America.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
I wonder if that does a web assembly. Actually, I'm really curious if it does.

50:48.000 --> 50:57.000
I wonder. I forgot how you find it, but I think if you search for Photoshop web Canada beta or something like that, it may, in fact...

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Canadians, this is your moment.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
I know.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Get us the Canada link.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
They got something first. Isn't that nice? Good for them. I'm not even mad.

51:05.000 --> 51:11.000
Well, you know why? They're afraid of the feedback, and they know those salty Americans would just be like, get the hell out of here.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
Right. Might as well get the feedback from the nice folks.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
WM Boosted with 2000 sats.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
I have a serious question. I am a high-functioning autistic.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
I've always had a hard time understanding or noticing things others find obvious.

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
Social interaction is a big category of stuff I struggle with.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
I never thought I would land an IT job, but I did.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
I thought I would fit in with my new peers, but I don't.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
It was like joining a small frat of anime dude bros.

51:37.000 --> 51:44.000
I was really excited and happy at first, but soon realized I don't quite fit in, and they don't seem to try to hide it.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
Anyone have an experience to share?

51:47.000 --> 51:53.000
Trying to fit in. Another issue with going to the office is sometimes trying to fit in with the group.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
WM, I wonder if... I'm not a big anime person myself, so I would struggle with this as well.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
If they literally are a group of anime fans and you're not, that can be tricky.

52:01.000 --> 52:07.000
One thing that you can always do, if you can put up with it, is get people talking about the things they like.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
They love talking about the stuff they enjoy.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
You can start asking questions.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
I would approach them with, hey, how would you recommend a newbie get started?

52:15.000 --> 52:20.000
Here's what I don't really want. Here's what I'm into. Where would you recommend I start?

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
You could probably get them talking to you for days.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
You could probably get them creating lists for you.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
That may be one suggestion.

52:26.000 --> 52:33.000
Yeah, it's a tough one, because interpersonal stuff can be hard.

52:33.000 --> 52:41.000
I guess I like Chris's advice, but even on top of that, just focus on what you're supposed to be doing for the job.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
Don't let it get to you. Don't let it become a distraction.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
Just do what you have to do.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
I know it's horrible advice.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
If these guys decide to be jerks, they decide to be jerks.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
I don't think they...

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
It's important to know, is this something that's really happening?

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
If so, is it intentional?

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Or are they just kind of...

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Insensitive, perhaps?

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Insensitive, right.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
It sounds very high school-ish, right?

53:11.000 --> 53:16.000
There are these clique of dudes who are just all into...

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
I don't know much about anime, either.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
Sailor Moon, I guess.

53:22.000 --> 53:26.000
And just because you don't know about it, it's hard to get in the conversation.

53:26.000 --> 53:31.000
Maybe. I will say, again, all the roads lead to Magic the Gathering.

53:31.000 --> 53:36.000
There definitely was a corner of anime people at this thing.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Oh, I bet.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
Oh, yes. A lot of large plastic swords.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
I have no idea what the hell that's all about.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
Although one guy seemed to be dressed up like the dude from Final Fantasy VII.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
That's kind of cool, I guess.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
I'm like, I got that one. I got one. Yes!

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
It's like being Captain America when you finally get a reference.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Like, ha-ha! I got one.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
I know it's hard to not sweat it, but just do your job.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Try to be friendly when you can.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Try to ask them what else they're into.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Maybe find common ground in the work you're doing.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
Whatever tech stack or whatever technologies you're working on.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
And go for there.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
Ultimately, your job is really not your family.

54:12.000 --> 54:18.000
And if it's just a job for you where you go and you do your shift, you go home.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Make friends outside of work that are into Magic the Gathering.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
There you go.

54:21.000 --> 54:26.000
And our last boost comes in from the pod sage himself, Dave Jones, with 12,000 sats.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
Another hot boost.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Coming in hot with the boost.

54:29.000 --> 54:36.000
I wish Microsoft would just bite the bullet and switch Windows from the NT kernel to the Linux kernel.

54:36.000 --> 54:42.000
They would save a ton of money on R&D and solve all their kernel security exploits in the process.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
Linux kernel with a Windows shell sounds appealing to me.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
Oh man, this seems like the ultimate nerd fantasy.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I've heard iterations of this.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
And Dave, I have to be honest with you.

54:52.000 --> 54:58.000
If Microsoft shipped Windows on top of a Linux kernel, I would absolutely 100% give it a go.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
I'd give it an honest go.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I'm not saying I'd stick with it.

55:01.000 --> 55:06.000
Because for me, the NT kernel, I don't really have a lot of issues with.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
I don't think it's the best piece of work.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
And you're right, it does have security issues, but what doesn't?

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
For me, it's the UI, man.

55:13.000 --> 55:20.000
It's like, you know, you got 15 years of history in that Windows UI and it's like an onion.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
The top is like the most recent Microsoft design team aspirations.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
And then you go one layer down and it's like the previous design team's aspirations.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
And you go another layer down.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
And then it's like the old Windows 2000 style stuff.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
And then you go another layer down and it's just like DOS.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Well, it's not really DOS, but you know what I mean.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
There's still times in Windows where you still have to drop down to the command line.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
I don't know.

55:43.000 --> 55:50.000
I just find all of that just sort of like they never, they never did a big purge and clean.

55:50.000 --> 55:55.000
Like Windows needed a big purge and clean probably after XP or something.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
I don't know.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
Like just do an Apple style or do a Linux GNOME style.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
Just clear the decks and rebuild.

56:02.000 --> 56:07.000
Only they would have the actual resources and teams where, and Microsoft does this.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
They have two teams in parallel, right?

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
Working on the next version of Windows, well, they used to.

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
They could have had one team working on like the refreshed user experience.

56:17.000 --> 56:23.000
But instead they went off in the land of database file systems and all kinds of wacky stuff that they had to abort for Longhorn.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
And what we got was just cooked up NT4.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
And that's what we still have today.

56:29.000 --> 56:34.000
And NT4 was a fine OS back in 1998.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
But it's feeling a little long in the tooth now.

56:37.000 --> 56:44.000
And that's my only issue is the Linux kernel would bring you a lot of great things in terms of features and capabilities and stuff that's just nice to have.

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
And great emulation environment and a great way to run containers on Windows.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Like that would be really useful.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
And you know, you wouldn't need the whole WSL subsystem at all.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
It could all just be pure.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
All those would be positives.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
But I think the big negative would still be the UI.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I think there's more negative than that.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
Oh yeah?

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Well, there's also the tracking.

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
There's all the constant advertising their latest stuff to you in some subtle way.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Or forcing some voice assistant onto your system.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Or their web browser.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
All of that would still be a thing too, I suppose.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I mean, I have this complaint about Mac, right?

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
That you have to like log into some synchronized account to use your computer.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
That seems...

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
Oh my gosh, dude.

57:22.000 --> 57:27.000
Like Monday morning when I haven't used the computers for a few days, I get in.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Oh yeah.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
And it's like there's so much.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
There's like six different notifications.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
I got to log into like seven different things.

57:33.000 --> 57:37.000
Like if I didn't have Bitwarden, I would spend an hour logging into stuff.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
And it's still tedious.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
Because I still got to like...

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
A lot of them are like modal dialogues where I got to launch the Bitwarden app.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
I got to search for the provider in there.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Copy all that stuff.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
Paste it into the dialogue box.

57:46.000 --> 57:51.000
Because, you know, it's just all these different random ass like inconsistent login boxes that pop up.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
And it's just so much.

57:53.000 --> 57:58.000
I sure am getting a fan of becoming a big fan of NixOS and GNOME together.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
It just feels like a real tight, nice little OS.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
Yeah, it's... Oh God.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
It just... I don't know.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
It's supposed to get better, right?

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Wasn't that the implicit deal?

58:07.000 --> 58:17.000
Like when we were kids and we were getting into computers, like we put up with things being rough and the graphics sucking and the speeds being slow and things being glitchy and the voice stuff not working.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Because it was going to get better.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Right? That was the implicit deal.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
We put in the time.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
And as a result, we're supposed to get good stuff.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
We didn't get good stuff.

58:27.000 --> 58:41.000
Yeah. Well, I think what happened is the business model changed from I want to sell you first hardware, then I want to sell you software via somebody else selling you hardware.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
And Apple's like, what are you talking about?

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
Still hardware.

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
And now it's like, yeah, that's not enough up and to the right.

58:47.000 --> 58:51.000
So now I need to sell you continual renewing services.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
And you're going to buy less of my thousand dollar phones?

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
All right, turn up the advertising then.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Yeah.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
It's I think, you know, we can never go back.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
And the OS just serves that purpose now.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
That's what the OS does.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
And that's why they're free now.

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
I mean, we're never going to get back to the days of, you know, the wizard beards of Sun Microsystems.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
God rest their souls.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Giving us just good quality software.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Right.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
In fact, let me throw this at your face.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Brace yourself for this one.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
Are we doomed for this to be Windows forever now?

59:20.000 --> 59:29.000
Perhaps we will never see the great rewrite that like Dave would be proposing because they're no longer making a hundred, two hundred, three hundred bucks a pop.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Right.

59:30.000 --> 59:37.000
They used to have like the home edition and the pro edition and like they'd sell those for a couple hundred bucks and they could actually make a profit from the operating system.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
But now now that's all all the OS is a freak.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
They're all free.

59:41.000 --> 59:49.000
And like it's really hard to justify spending, you know, maybe five years or whatever would take a corporation their size to research and develop.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
You know, an entire re-architecting of Windows to clean all these things up.

59:52.000 --> 01:00:01.000
It just seems like with these new business models that you're talking about right now, that kind of labor on the operating system is more off the table than ever.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
It's just going to be small incremental improvements to serve the overall platform.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Yeah, I think that's basically it.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Right. Everything is going to go to cloud services and stuff like that.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
So, well, that's got depressing.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Yeah. Well, there's Linux, you know, maybe these Linux podcasts I'm doing are going to take off in a few years.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Because, you know, like I Linux doesn't seem to be stopping and people are continuing to adopt it for some crazy reason.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
It's still new users coming to Linux.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:35.000
And maybe it's just, you know, the more dystopia this gets, the more appealing something like something that's just like an old computer.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Seriously, like the idea that it's not sinking to the cloud.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Yeah. You know, I don't know.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Maybe if you'd like to boost into the show, we'd love to have your support and your message go to newpodcastapps.com to find a new podcast app that supports podcasting 2.0,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:56.000
which is a whole range of brand new features coming to podcasting, extending the current RSS, keeping it in free open RSS.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
And one of those is the Boostagram support.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000
You can grab breezebreez.technology if you don't want to switch podcast apps.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I know you antenna pod users love your antenna pod and antenna pod is looking at integrating breeze.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
So get a head start, get it all figured out.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
You can also try out Fountain FM, which will stream stats as you play podcasts and Podverse,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000
which is an open source, multi-platform podcasting 2.0 app.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And we are also using it on our new website as the embedded player.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.000
So our embedded player will have podcasting 2.0 features like chapters right there on the web player.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
And then if you're already a Podverse user, you can click through and get to all of your podcasts and just continue listening.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
So newpodcastapps.com for all of that.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And a big thank you to our members as well for supporting the show and giving us the availability to say no.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I almost read another email.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
If you like, if you like some of these crazy emails that come in, like the offers that people send us,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I could do it occasionally, very rarely.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Let me know, send a boost in or an email.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.000
But we got one that was pitching to pay us to have a like they have a bench of AI experts.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I don't know if you saw this email that came in, Mike, but it's like this gal's like,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.000
you got to get on the AI machine learning bandwagon and here's a bench of experts that we can make available to you.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And of course, they all have something to sell, all have something to show.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
They all have a book or like an online training course or something.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And they come on and, you know, we're supposed to pretend like it's a real interview

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
and we're supposed to give them an opportunity to show their stuff.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And then we get paid. The whole thing is so shady.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.000
That's the kind of stuff that like JB is never going to have to get involved in because our members are one of our most important customers.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
That's it right there. And you can become a member at CoderQA.co.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send the good people this week before we get out of here?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Probably therapy if we keep mentioning Sun.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
There we go. Javaduke.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Oh, I already did it. You missed it. You totally missed it.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Oh, no. I'll have to listen back. They're my favorite moments.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Follow me on Twitter at Dumanuco and wish me luck. I'm playing in two magic tournaments this weekend.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
