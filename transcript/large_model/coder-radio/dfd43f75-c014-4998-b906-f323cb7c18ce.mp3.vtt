00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
This is KOTORadio, episode 423, recorded on July 16, 2021.

00:15.920 --> 00:20.040
Hello friend and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.040 --> 00:24.120
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.120 --> 00:27.040
This episode is brought to you by our friends at a cloud guru, you know, they now have that

00:27.040 --> 00:28.040
cloud playground.

00:28.040 --> 00:33.320
Mm hmm, Azure, AWS and Google Cloud sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

00:33.320 --> 00:37.040
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru.com.

00:37.040 --> 00:40.980
My name is Chris and recording for a limited time.

00:40.980 --> 00:42.720
It's our host from Florida, Mr. Dominic.

00:42.720 --> 00:43.720
Hello, Mike.

00:43.720 --> 00:44.720
Hello, Mr. Fisher.

00:44.720 --> 00:45.960
How are you feeling?

00:45.960 --> 00:47.120
Is everything all boxed up?

00:47.120 --> 00:49.320
Are you like in reduced living mode right now?

00:49.320 --> 00:56.600
Not yet, but this weekend is going to be a hell of a weekend boxing up and yeah, I hate

00:56.600 --> 00:57.600
that.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.120
I've been working so much.

00:59.120 --> 01:03.240
If I was like big money, I would probably hire somebody to pack for me.

01:03.240 --> 01:06.480
But you look at the cost of something like that, I just can't justify it.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.480
It's it's crazy.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.480
I actually looked at it.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.280
I'm like, this is this is like spilling a drink on a MacBook a week.

01:12.280 --> 01:17.120
Yeah, that is that should be a unit of accounting actually, now that I think about it.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.760
Did you see Qualcomm this week was posting that they've got something in house that's

01:20.760 --> 01:25.440
going to blow the pants off of the M1 and that they have plans to compete with Apple

01:25.440 --> 01:27.640
Silicon in PCs.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.640
Qualcomm's gonna save us.

01:28.640 --> 01:31.080
They're gonna save us from our six color tyranny.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.080
Okay.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33.080 --> 01:37.640
Yeah, they're gonna come in here and they're gonna come in with chips that are gonna save

01:37.640 --> 01:39.940
us by the end of 2021.

01:39.940 --> 01:42.840
Maybe you know, depending on delays 2023.

01:42.840 --> 01:49.520
I don't know, man, I just I guess I'm getting kind of bitter or cynical.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.520
Maybe that's the way to put it bitter and cynical.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.760
I've lost the faith in Qualcomm.

01:53.760 --> 01:54.760
They've done me wrong.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.160
I've I've had some systems.

01:56.160 --> 01:59.480
I've had some phones that had Qualcomm chips and they're supposed to be screamers and they

01:59.480 --> 02:02.200
just were pathetic.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.160
We'll see if they do it.

02:05.160 --> 02:08.160
I'm sure you'll get one though.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.080
I have some consultation that I'm going to need from you later.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.400
I'm gonna need you to walk me off of the ledge a little bit.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.400
Oh boy.

02:14.400 --> 02:19.300
But before we get there, we should probably get to some feedback because our discussion

02:19.300 --> 02:22.360
around Copilot provoked some emails.

02:22.360 --> 02:23.360
Yes.

02:23.360 --> 02:27.720
Varatunda thinks that Microsoft has finally figured out how to kill open source with Copilot.

02:27.720 --> 02:32.000
He says, I was listening to Coder 422 and your musings over Copilot.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.960
He touched on the idea of licensing washing, but I don't know if you went far enough and

02:34.960 --> 02:38.560
he links us to something that Software Conservancy wrote up.

02:38.560 --> 02:42.440
Varatunda goes on to say discusses who is not in charge of open source and how responsibility

02:42.440 --> 02:46.460
can be abdicated for a variety of reasons, and that the biggest threat to the GPL or

02:46.460 --> 02:50.060
any free software license is actually just the enforcement of it.

02:50.060 --> 02:54.240
For a licensed account, like a trademark, it has to be enforced rigorously.

02:54.240 --> 02:59.200
So the real threat from Copilot is not just copying GPL code by mistake, but that copying

02:59.200 --> 03:05.680
would be automated and wholesale and making it impossible to catch and impossible to enforce.

03:05.680 --> 03:10.400
Suddenly you have thousands and thousands of products exploiting GPL code, but no resources

03:10.400 --> 03:12.900
available to enforce those violations.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.640
This is what has me worried.

03:14.640 --> 03:20.040
If you wanted to kill open source, you don't have to kill the GPL, you just have to nullify

03:20.040 --> 03:21.040
it.

03:21.040 --> 03:25.000
Call me a cynic, but I have to say I'm genuinely worried that Microsoft has finally figured

03:25.000 --> 03:30.480
out how to kill open source, not by extending or embracing it, though they seem to really

03:30.480 --> 03:35.280
heart Linux, but by making it irrelevant because no one can enforce the license to make sure

03:35.280 --> 03:37.520
the code remains free for everyone.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.760
You don't need to kill the kernel if you can break all the tools that surround it with

03:40.760 --> 03:41.960
impudence.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.520
It could be a dark future.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.520
I guess I have an even more sadly cynical view.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.480
I think people are already ripping off the GPL left and right.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.480
Sure.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.920
Probably is happening quite a lot, right?

03:51.920 --> 03:55.380
Even if they're just kind of using it to get ideas and then writing their own versions

03:55.380 --> 03:56.380
of it.

03:56.380 --> 03:59.200
It's probably happening, but this seems like it could be a whole new scale.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.200
Right.

04:00.200 --> 04:04.200
And so the idea here is that just the pure quantity, the pure scale of it would make

04:04.200 --> 04:06.760
enforcement like Don financially viable.

04:06.760 --> 04:07.760
I think so.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.720
And then if you can't enforce the GPL, it essentially becomes worthless.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.720
I mean, I don't know.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.600
You know, I've never been a GPL hippie.

04:13.600 --> 04:20.080
I kind of, I always wondered if people who have GPL software, if you find out someone's

04:20.080 --> 04:25.240
using it and they're like a rinky dink, you know, they don't have any resources, whatever.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.640
What are you really going to do about that?

04:26.640 --> 04:27.960
Especially if you're a small shop.

04:27.960 --> 04:28.960
Right.

04:28.960 --> 04:29.960
It's like Microsoft is using your stuff.

04:29.960 --> 04:34.520
Well, then you probably want to negotiate a license, get some money, but right.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.880
But if you're a small shop and another small shop is using your code, like are you even

04:38.880 --> 04:41.040
going to bother with the lawyer fees on that one?

04:41.040 --> 04:42.040
I don't know.

04:42.040 --> 04:45.720
Well, what if it's like an independent developer, like one guy or one gal?

04:45.720 --> 04:46.720
Right.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.040
You'd basically be choosing to wreck them, but of course they are choosing to violate

04:49.040 --> 04:50.040
the license.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.040
That's a tough call.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.720
It doesn't feel like there's a good answer there.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.080
Well, it doesn't feel like you'll make a return either.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.080
Right.

04:57.080 --> 05:03.040
Alexander writes in, he's disappointed in Copilot for a whole number of reasons.

05:03.040 --> 05:06.200
After listening to the episode, he said he wanted to share his two cents.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.400
He says, I'm a professional software developer, but I think I have a biased view probably

05:09.400 --> 05:15.120
because of my experience, but I am disappointed in GitHub, Alexander writes.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.200
And here's a number of reasons.

05:17.200 --> 05:21.380
Number one, it has learned to code by observing code in open source projects.

05:21.380 --> 05:25.320
You know, the code that's probably full of bugs and security vulnerabilities already,

05:25.320 --> 05:27.200
but Copilot doesn't know that.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.520
So it's just going to suggest happily a buggy implementation.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.520
Number two, what about dependency management?

05:33.520 --> 05:36.360
Let's say one tries to use Copilot for Python web development.

05:36.360 --> 05:40.440
Now imagine that project solves two tasks, which are typically solved by two different

05:40.440 --> 05:41.920
web frameworks.

05:41.920 --> 05:46.000
Under normal circumstance, you'd choose a single framework and use it for both tasks.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.560
But I suspect that Copilot will produce code using two different frameworks, which won't

05:50.560 --> 05:53.000
play well together at all.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.860
And then there's that licensing thing.

05:54.860 --> 05:58.980
Number three, Copilot does not attribute the produced code.

05:58.980 --> 06:04.080
So one may just unknowingly include code from, say, open JDK.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.300
And I'm sure Oracle will be so understanding about that.

06:06.300 --> 06:11.040
And number four, and he says this is probably my most biased point, but Copilot actually

06:11.040 --> 06:16.220
tackles the most interesting and creative part of software development.

06:16.220 --> 06:19.600
Why not have it focus on code review instead?

06:19.600 --> 06:23.500
It'll be helpful to have a bot that finds code smells, inefficient implementations,

06:23.500 --> 06:25.920
and a lack of test coverage for extreme cases.

06:25.920 --> 06:31.280
Why not invent tools to automatically create reproducers from users' bug reports?

06:31.280 --> 06:35.260
You know, like a bot that tries to find the best minimal number of steps to reproduce

06:35.260 --> 06:36.260
a bug.

06:36.260 --> 06:38.880
That, that would be invaluable.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.640
Why not tackle automatic issue triaging?

06:41.640 --> 06:46.880
Summing it all up, surely professional developers are not going to use this in an existing project.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.600
Surely the non-professional developers won't use this in a new project.

06:50.600 --> 06:54.240
And the hobbyist developers, well, you're going to find them just constantly reviewing

06:54.240 --> 06:55.720
code instead of writing it.

06:55.720 --> 06:58.280
And for newbie developers, well, absolutely not.

06:58.280 --> 07:02.360
You just entered the field, having a tool that produces a stream of bugs that you'll

07:02.360 --> 07:06.560
spend days trying to figure out is unhelpful, and it's even demotivating.

07:06.560 --> 07:11.440
There has to be something different out there, and Copilot still requires developer input.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.280
So I think it's not a good product.

07:13.280 --> 07:16.920
It's a good scientific experiment in machine learning, and I suppose it's that, but it's

07:16.920 --> 07:18.200
not a product.

07:18.200 --> 07:22.920
I'm afraid it's yet another instance of we built it because we can, but we didn't think

07:22.920 --> 07:23.920
if we should.

07:23.920 --> 07:27.680
Thanks and sorry for the rant, Alexander.

07:27.680 --> 07:31.720
I'm just having a hard time getting my hackles up about this Copilot thing.

07:31.720 --> 07:32.880
Some people definitely are though.

07:32.880 --> 07:33.880
Yeah.

07:33.880 --> 07:34.880
You know, they're upset.

07:34.880 --> 07:35.880
Yeah, it's interesting.

07:35.880 --> 07:40.140
It is to me, because what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to take the input from the audience

07:40.140 --> 07:44.560
and be like, okay, is this a big concern?

07:44.560 --> 07:49.280
And I think they're starting to turn my opinion, but I'm still not super riled up about it.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.280
Okay, so what is turning your opinion from last week?

07:51.280 --> 07:52.560
That's probably a great way to take this.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.160
Well, I really liked what Alexander just said there.

07:55.160 --> 07:59.920
Like, wouldn't it have been so much more useful if it was doing code review or if it could

07:59.920 --> 08:03.840
help automate reproducing user bug reports?

08:03.840 --> 08:07.640
Imagine how actually useful that would be for just about all developers.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.600
Yeah, but that's a harder sell.

08:09.600 --> 08:14.880
Code review often includes things like style and following, you know, whatever the internal

08:14.880 --> 08:19.060
methodology at your organization.

08:19.060 --> 08:22.160
How could a Copilot do that in a generic way?

08:22.160 --> 08:23.920
Yeah, it'd have to be tuned for each.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.920
Yeah, you're right.

08:24.920 --> 08:25.920
That would be tricky.

08:25.920 --> 08:26.920
Mm hmm.

08:26.920 --> 08:27.920
Yeah.

08:27.920 --> 08:28.920
Yeah.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.480
I think they are starting to convince me, though, that it's it's sort of a misconceived

08:32.480 --> 08:35.380
science experiment and not so much a product.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.600
That's sort of where I'm shifting there.

08:37.600 --> 08:42.960
And I do kind of see Varitunda's point about potentially enabling license washing at like

08:42.960 --> 08:44.340
a massive scale.

08:44.340 --> 08:46.820
And that that seems like that could be an issue.

08:46.820 --> 08:49.800
But that's one of those that we just won't know if it's a real problem until we're a

08:49.800 --> 08:50.800
year down the road.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.360
I mean, I just feel like this is one of these things that's going to get a lot of hype.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.240
In reality, it's not going to be used by like serious people very much at all.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.240
Yeah.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.240
Yeah.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.920
Or it's the future of programing.

09:01.920 --> 09:02.920
Or that.

09:02.920 --> 09:03.920
Yes.

09:03.920 --> 09:04.920
Or that.

09:04.920 --> 09:05.920
Yeah.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.920
Yeah.

09:06.920 --> 09:07.920
Yeah.

09:07.920 --> 09:08.920
All right.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.080
Well, Chuck wrote in about solving sleepless nights, which is something that you and I

09:11.080 --> 09:12.560
have been struggling with recently.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.720
Oh, yes.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.600
And just just had a little bit last night.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.120
Just regarding your insomnia.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.320
I have a strategy that has been working for me lately.

09:20.320 --> 09:25.080
My pebble classic misfit sleep and deep sleep numbers tell me that I'm getting about, you

09:25.080 --> 09:27.280
know, six hours on average.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.280
Some nights it's bad.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.960
It's like two hours.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.440
And I try to get all that in one block.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.360
And recently I've been waking up after three or four hours.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.400
I'm just up.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.640
What happens is I'm wide awake and I have trouble getting back to sleep.

09:38.640 --> 09:39.640
Yeah.

09:39.640 --> 09:40.640
Yep.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.520
So he found this YouTube channel called Direction Phil.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.520
I'm saying it wrong, but I have a link in the show notes.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.320
And but here's the idea.

09:48.320 --> 09:55.160
It's a military naval historian that just speaks in a really monotone tone the entire

09:55.160 --> 09:56.160
time.

09:56.160 --> 10:00.700
And it's he says the key is and I completely agree with Chuck here.

10:00.700 --> 10:05.920
The key is to get in on a topic that, you know, you're kind of interested in, but has

10:05.920 --> 10:08.960
nothing to do with your work or life.

10:08.960 --> 10:12.360
So it doesn't trigger like any stressors, doesn't make you think about things you got

10:12.360 --> 10:13.360
to do.

10:13.360 --> 10:18.240
And it's complicated enough that it keeps your attention, but you can also just sort

10:18.240 --> 10:21.280
of drift out and listen to it again and again and again.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.000
He says maybe you might be into lectures or something like that, you know, like stuff

10:25.000 --> 10:26.640
like Galileo orbiting Jupiter.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.560
He says you go find the lecture you like on YouTube and then use YouTube DL to download

10:30.560 --> 10:33.440
it as an MP3 or something like that and throw it on your phone.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.480
Yo ho ho, a pirate's life for me.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.520
This is what I use Audible for.

10:40.520 --> 10:46.880
Just this morning I woke up at three o'clock, which I'm sure you can hear in my voice, audience.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.880
Band problems.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.800
We need to have a special like stinger jingle for it.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.360
Groups for old, you know, online support group for old men or men that are becoming old men

10:54.360 --> 10:57.880
and then having the existential crisis that they're realizing they're getting older.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.500
That's the support group I need right now.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.200
The problem is more the realization, right?

11:01.200 --> 11:02.200
Right.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.880
Because I told my mom, you know, I'm like, you know, I'm starting to realize like getting

11:04.880 --> 11:05.980
older sucks.

11:05.980 --> 11:09.460
And my mom looked at me and she's like, oh, child, you are so young still.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.340
You have no idea.

11:11.340 --> 11:17.040
And I'm like, yes, I realize I hopefully, hopefully still have a while a ways to go.

11:17.040 --> 11:21.120
But it is no doubt in my mind that I have come to the point where I'm realizing, oh,

11:21.120 --> 11:23.920
I am getting older and things are changing.

11:23.920 --> 11:26.440
And I think like my eyesight's changing.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.980
Obviously a lot of other things have changed and it's just sleep is one of them.

11:29.980 --> 11:37.400
And so I have tried to employ this with Audible where I'll try to get a book that keeps my

11:37.400 --> 11:39.680
interest enough, but not so much that I can't fall asleep.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.240
It's a tricky line to walk.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.060
I like the idea of adding YouTube to the mix.

11:44.060 --> 11:47.760
Something else that I've done, which I don't think is good, but just makes me feel like

11:47.760 --> 11:50.440
I'm in control a little bit is I'll just get up and work.

11:50.440 --> 11:56.280
And I know I shouldn't, but honestly, at least then I'm productive with that time.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.420
And as you know, no one's up, right?

11:58.420 --> 12:00.320
So it's quiet.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.240
It's surprisingly a productive amount of time.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.440
But the issue is, is that I'm just wrecked for like the next two days.

12:05.440 --> 12:10.600
I really, it takes me a while to bounce back now, you know, that's what I'm going through

12:10.600 --> 12:11.600
right now.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.040
I was like, I was up at three o'clock or it was 3.30 actually.

12:14.040 --> 12:19.520
So I, you know, I got up, I couldn't get back to sleep and I had a choice.

12:19.520 --> 12:24.180
I have a bottle of Zequil, but now that's late enough that if you take the Zequil, which

12:24.180 --> 12:27.960
for those who don't know, it's like NyQuil without the medicine parts, just sleeping

12:27.960 --> 12:33.720
whatever, you're going to be like, there's no hangover like a NyQuil hangover.

12:33.720 --> 12:34.720
It's terrible.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.040
You're going to be so groggy.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.040
Yeah.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.520
You got to take that like eight, nine o'clock at night.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.000
Eight, nine o'clock, 7.30 maximum.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Okay.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
That's probably safe.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.960
So then staring at me is my MacBook Air and it's like, you don't, you do have a bunch

12:47.960 --> 12:49.520
of Python to write.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.760
And I was like, Oh God.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.040
So there I went.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.040
Yeah.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.520
That's sort of been my, it's like, there's a lot of people that are waiting for responses

12:58.520 --> 12:59.520
from me.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.320
There's things that are like for this road trip that are coming up that are pending until

13:02.320 --> 13:06.840
I can get to them and every time we get to a phase in the planning for this road trip

13:06.840 --> 13:12.280
where something is waiting on me, it stresses me out because I've got like two weeks or

13:12.280 --> 13:17.320
so before I'm leaving and there's just not enough time and we're going to have swag on

13:17.320 --> 13:20.640
the road trip and we're going to have a website that goes live and we have a live tracker

13:20.640 --> 13:22.640
and we have people that are joining us at the meetup.

13:22.640 --> 13:26.280
We have like special guests that are coming in and we're getting like their flights taken

13:26.280 --> 13:28.320
care of and all of this stuff, right?

13:28.320 --> 13:34.440
And at each kind of major phase, something gets held up on me waiting and I legitimately

13:34.440 --> 13:39.740
can't respond to the stuff and answer the stuff while I'm recording, which happens like

13:39.740 --> 13:40.740
five times a week.

13:40.740 --> 13:42.760
So like it's tricky.

13:42.760 --> 13:43.760
It really isn't.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.880
So when I'm up late, sometimes I just bang out a whole bunch of emails.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.640
I'll just do a whole bunch of emails or I'll work on the website that we need for the road

13:50.640 --> 13:51.640
trip.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.680
I'll just do something like that that I just never get uninterrupted time for.

13:54.680 --> 13:59.960
I'm not always going to employ this strategy, but while I'm busy and things are on my mind,

13:59.960 --> 14:01.360
I'm just going to use the time for that.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.160
But I really like the suggestion, Chuck.

14:03.160 --> 14:07.200
I like the idea of that military history YouTube channel.

14:07.200 --> 14:11.640
I will throw a link to that in the show notes because I went over to that channel this morning

14:11.640 --> 14:13.880
and checked it out and I like it.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.400
I think, you know, that stuff's kind of kind of cool.

14:16.400 --> 14:22.120
And he included a link to a naval ship that was built here in the Seattle area way back

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
forever.

14:23.120 --> 14:26.600
Kind of neat, very cool.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.360
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

14:28.360 --> 14:34.040
We have two meetups, Salt Lake City on August 7th and in Denver on August 20th.

14:34.040 --> 14:38.160
There's going to be swag and goodies and some of your favorite J.B. members will be at some

14:38.160 --> 14:39.160
of these events.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.160
We'd love to see you.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.240
I'll also have a tracker at ColonyTracker.live.

14:43.240 --> 14:46.840
That's ColonyTracker.live and that's all up and going.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.280
That little tracker page will have a meetup link on there and stuff.

14:49.280 --> 14:54.640
If you want to do a micro meetup with us along the way, that's something we'll be doing too.

14:54.640 --> 14:58.880
The whole idea really for this road trip was there's been no events for a long time.

14:58.880 --> 15:04.480
The last event I went to was Texas Cyber Summit which was a stinker and I really wanted to

15:04.480 --> 15:09.520
just get out there and say hi to people again and recapture what is really out there in

15:09.520 --> 15:14.760
the real world because we just live this very skewed reality online all the time between

15:14.760 --> 15:18.360
what you see on YouTube and social media and just chat rooms and whatnot.

15:18.360 --> 15:21.600
It's sort of a skewed version of reality and getting out there and seeing the audience

15:21.600 --> 15:27.420
again sort of resets my brain, makes me realize that it's not the end of the world because

15:27.420 --> 15:28.420
of the M1.

15:28.420 --> 15:31.640
And then additionally, it's really about getting to see some of our team members that we haven't

15:31.640 --> 15:34.640
got to see since Jupiter Broadcasting went independent.

15:34.640 --> 15:39.200
So it's a big Colony reunion and we'll have more details soon but meetup.com slash Jupiter

15:39.200 --> 15:44.520
Broadcasting is where you go to get the details about the meetups that are coming up and let

15:44.520 --> 15:47.960
us know if you can make it.

15:47.960 --> 15:51.740
And let's thank Linode, linode.com slash coder.

15:51.740 --> 15:55.200
They are making this Colony reunion road trip possible.

15:55.200 --> 15:58.960
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing because they were just

15:58.960 --> 16:02.600
geeking out about the technology that was landing in Linux.

16:02.600 --> 16:06.400
That's three years before the other enterprise providers and they're still independently

16:06.400 --> 16:10.960
owned and founded on that love for Linux and contributing that back to the community.

16:10.960 --> 16:14.540
That's one of the reasons they're making the Jupiter Colony reunion road trip possible

16:14.540 --> 16:16.960
with our meetups in Salt Lake City and Denver.

16:16.960 --> 16:21.640
All of that is powered by Linode and everything that we've built since we've gone independent,

16:21.640 --> 16:26.520
we host that on Linode and if we ever run into any trouble or if you ever have any trouble,

16:26.520 --> 16:31.780
Linode comes with amazing fantastic 24-7 customer phone support or ticket support if that's

16:31.780 --> 16:32.780
your preference.

16:32.780 --> 16:37.300
They'll help you, they'll get it settled regardless if you have one Linode or you have a hundred,

16:37.300 --> 16:38.400
they're going to take care of you.

16:38.400 --> 16:42.980
They also have hundreds of guides and tutorials to make sure you can get the best out of Linode.

16:42.980 --> 16:46.600
Anything you want to run in the cloud, anything that you can virtualize or run on a Linux

16:46.600 --> 16:49.120
box, you're going to have a great experience with Linode.

16:49.120 --> 16:54.100
They have super fast systems, great great native SSD speeds, 40 gigabit connections

16:54.100 --> 16:59.460
coming into the different networks, 11 data centers worldwide, they own the links between

16:59.460 --> 17:06.060
their data centers, they are their own ISP, their high-end CPU boxes have AMD epic processors,

17:06.060 --> 17:11.600
they have blazing fast S3 compatible object storage, cloud firewalls and simple one-click

17:11.600 --> 17:13.240
application deployments.

17:13.240 --> 17:17.800
All of it comes together to make Linode a truly best of class experience.

17:17.800 --> 17:21.520
When you want the highest performance and the best ability, when you want to give your

17:21.520 --> 17:25.280
customers or your users a fantastic experience, Linode.

17:25.280 --> 17:29.000
And Linode can also be part of your multi cloud strategy, that can be a huge advantage

17:29.000 --> 17:32.860
for a lot of companies, Linode will snap in with your infrastructure management tools

17:32.860 --> 17:36.560
like Kubernetes and Terraform, make all of that just hum for you.

17:36.560 --> 17:40.260
That's why there's so many routes and options you can go from a total newbie who's never

17:40.260 --> 17:45.480
built anything before to somebody who's deploying servers at scale, Linode can be a solution

17:45.480 --> 17:46.520
for you.

17:46.520 --> 17:51.500
They really managed to pull it off, but you got to see it to actually have it click.

17:51.500 --> 17:56.680
So I want you to go right now to linode.com slash coder, get $100 in 60 day credit on

17:56.680 --> 18:00.760
your new account and you support the show and you can try out all this stuff I'm talking

18:00.760 --> 18:02.760
about and see what works for you.

18:02.760 --> 18:06.980
You're going to be really impressed with their interface to manage all of this, the capabilities,

18:06.980 --> 18:10.000
the speed and if you ever do need it, the support.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.980
It really is the ultimate hosting package and it gives me peace of mind knowing that

18:13.980 --> 18:18.840
my back end infrastructure for our listeners is running up on Linode, linode.com slash

18:18.840 --> 18:22.320
coder.

18:22.320 --> 18:30.180
So Microsoft has announced Windows 365, which provides an instant on boot experience with

18:30.180 --> 18:35.720
cloud PCs managed fully by Microsoft.

18:35.720 --> 18:42.860
They say the instant access lets workers stream Windows with either a web browser or an application

18:42.860 --> 18:47.400
to their Mac, iPad, Linux machine and Android devices.

18:47.400 --> 18:51.200
You pick up right where you left off because the state of your cloud PC always remains

18:51.200 --> 18:55.360
the same even when you switch devices.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.740
They create a virtual PC for you in the cloud.

18:58.740 --> 19:03.940
You customize it how you like with how much RAM, up to 16 gigs of RAM and up to 512 gigabytes

19:03.940 --> 19:07.980
of disk and then those customizations persist.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.260
The interface, anything you tweak up there persists.

19:11.260 --> 19:15.940
The company has built it on top of its Azure virtual desktop platform so it can also snap

19:15.940 --> 19:19.660
in with any of the administration that your company might have with Azure and Azure Active

19:19.660 --> 19:25.420
Directory i.e. when they create you an account now, they can automatically just provision

19:25.420 --> 19:29.020
you a virtual PC standard by their image.

19:29.020 --> 19:35.980
Microsoft will be launching Windows 365 on August 2nd, 2021 to a business of any size.

19:35.980 --> 19:42.020
It is officially here, the Windows experience in the cloud managed by Microsoft designed

19:42.020 --> 19:45.660
to run on any device, even a web browser.

19:45.660 --> 19:48.500
I kind of think this is a great deal for Linux users.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.780
Yeah, I didn't think of it in terms of Linux users.

19:50.780 --> 19:55.180
I was thinking more in terms of the enterprise, but I'm curious, what's the angle there?

19:55.180 --> 19:59.260
Well, imagine you got a guy like yourself, right, where you got a Thaleo system, you've

19:59.260 --> 20:04.460
invested quite a bit in the Linux ecosystem and Linux hardware, but you have these jobs

20:04.460 --> 20:08.540
that come up that just require Windows.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.540
This now is your solution.

20:10.540 --> 20:14.700
For some low monthly rate, you can have a couple of these virtual PCs up in the cloud

20:14.700 --> 20:19.140
that anyone on your team can log into with all of your development tools and your environment

20:19.140 --> 20:24.140
already set good to go and it remains there ready for you to access at any point in time.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.140
All you need is a web browser.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.460
You want to do it from your iPad, have at it Haas, you know, you want to do it from

20:28.460 --> 20:33.020
your Thaleo desktop, have at it and it means you can just stay on Linux in this theoretical

20:33.020 --> 20:36.540
world and when you do need Windows, you have it on demand now.

20:36.540 --> 20:40.020
Kind of like having the Mac Colo, only this is clearly a better solution.

20:40.020 --> 20:41.020
Oh, interesting.

20:41.020 --> 20:42.020
Yeah, that does make sense.

20:42.020 --> 20:46.980
I was thinking for enterprises that don't want to give people, particularly in the work

20:46.980 --> 20:51.340
from home world, like computers that have their data on it, give them one of these and

20:51.340 --> 20:53.980
then you can revoke it once the person's not with the company.

20:53.980 --> 20:56.140
That's probably got to be one of the biggest use cases.

20:56.140 --> 20:57.900
Work from home, secure PC.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.620
Or even contract employees.

20:59.620 --> 21:00.620
Right.

21:00.620 --> 21:01.620
Yeah.

21:01.620 --> 21:05.100
And you know, I could see a lot of office spaces that don't even want to bother with

21:05.100 --> 21:07.420
any local physical hardware.

21:07.420 --> 21:12.140
I've seen a couple of companies in the last few years that have really no land to speak

21:12.140 --> 21:13.140
of.

21:13.140 --> 21:15.780
I've even went into a company that doesn't even have Ethernet.

21:15.780 --> 21:19.100
They just have Wi-Fi and they have no file server.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.520
They have no domain controller.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.660
Everything is cloud based.

21:22.660 --> 21:27.860
The users come to the office, they get on the Wi-Fi and then all of their login stuff,

21:27.860 --> 21:29.780
everything is through the cloud.

21:29.780 --> 21:30.780
Interesting.

21:30.780 --> 21:31.780
Why not now?

21:31.780 --> 21:32.780
Why not the whole PC?

21:32.780 --> 21:33.780
Right.

21:33.780 --> 21:36.500
And I'm assuming you can roll back states with this so that you're not, you know.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.500
I would think.

21:37.500 --> 21:38.500
Yeah.

21:38.500 --> 21:39.500
If something bad happens.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.500
Yeah.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.820
It seems like this was a long time coming.

21:42.820 --> 21:44.580
This was foretold by the ancients.

21:44.580 --> 21:45.580
Yeah.

21:45.580 --> 21:50.340
Like this isn't a shocker, but it is, I don't know, for some reason it still did kind of

21:50.340 --> 21:51.900
catch me by surprise, I would say.

21:51.900 --> 21:56.900
And I think a part of, although not, I guess in retrospect, not too surprising is how hard

21:56.900 --> 22:02.460
they're leaning in on like the iPad and Linux angle on this, like all of their official

22:02.460 --> 22:04.300
documentation and all of it talks about it.

22:04.300 --> 22:06.420
Like, yeah, run Windows on your iPad.

22:06.420 --> 22:07.820
Like is that, is that a huge-

22:07.820 --> 22:09.340
Well, Microsoft loves iPad.

22:09.340 --> 22:13.420
It just seems like a weird, that seems like a weird thing to lean into in their announcement.

22:13.420 --> 22:18.020
Like clearly your use case that you just outlined, Windows shops that are just going to deploy

22:18.020 --> 22:22.780
virtual Windows is going to by far be the vast use case for this.

22:22.780 --> 22:23.780
Right.

22:23.780 --> 22:24.780
Right.

22:24.780 --> 22:27.380
I mean, yeah, I guess it's, I guess it's buzzworthy.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.020
I guess it gets headlines written.

22:29.020 --> 22:30.020
That must be part of it.

22:30.020 --> 22:31.020
Yeah.

22:31.020 --> 22:32.020
I don't know.

22:32.020 --> 22:34.900
I think this is going to be pretty much an enterprise tool, but I like it.

22:34.900 --> 22:35.900
Would you try it?

22:35.900 --> 22:36.900
Yeah.

22:36.900 --> 22:37.900
Would I try it?

22:37.900 --> 22:38.900
Maybe.

22:38.900 --> 22:43.900
I mean, I just took a look at shells.com or I think it's just shells.

22:43.900 --> 22:44.900
Similar idea.

22:44.900 --> 22:45.900
Pretty cool.

22:45.900 --> 22:46.900
They do mostly Linux stuff.

22:46.900 --> 22:51.020
I don't know, I bought enough hard drive space that I can just dual boot, right?

22:51.020 --> 22:53.760
This is going to be a first party managed experience though, right?

22:53.760 --> 22:55.660
Like Microsoft in theory could-

22:55.660 --> 22:56.660
Oh yeah.

22:56.660 --> 22:57.660
They can optimize.

22:57.660 --> 22:58.660
Right.

22:58.660 --> 23:01.380
And they're using RDP on the backend here, which is I think probably better than what

23:01.380 --> 23:04.900
you're going to see with shells because shells is using a spice and then they're bringing

23:04.900 --> 23:05.900
that into the browser.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.080
And it's good.

23:07.080 --> 23:11.940
It's a pretty good experience for what it is, but it's not as performant as RDP is.

23:11.940 --> 23:12.940
You seem, all right.

23:12.940 --> 23:13.940
Yeah.

23:13.940 --> 23:14.940
You seem pretty hot on it.

23:14.940 --> 23:15.940
I mean, I think in the enterprise this would be great, right?

23:15.940 --> 23:19.460
You don't want to give someone a PC and you want to control it.

23:19.460 --> 23:21.580
I see absolutely nothing wrong with it.

23:21.580 --> 23:22.580
Yeah.

23:22.580 --> 23:23.580
Well, because you know what?

23:23.580 --> 23:28.340
For me, I've always felt like the best way to use Windows is in a virtual environment.

23:28.340 --> 23:31.180
In a contained space, it's not your primary desktop.

23:31.180 --> 23:32.460
You access it when you need it.

23:32.460 --> 23:35.920
If something goes wrong, you can revert a snapshot.

23:35.920 --> 23:39.660
Like even when I want to run, if I've ever wanted to run a Windows server, I'd run it

23:39.660 --> 23:41.860
under virtualization.

23:41.860 --> 23:43.820
It's like an insurance policy for me.

23:43.820 --> 23:46.260
I prefer this over on the bare metal.

23:46.260 --> 23:51.340
Well, and a good dev angle here too is testing on different Windows configs.

23:51.340 --> 23:52.900
That is definitely something I would look into.

23:52.900 --> 23:54.900
What do you think of the name?

23:54.900 --> 23:55.900
Windows 365?

23:55.900 --> 23:56.900
No, whatever.

23:56.900 --> 23:59.940
You know, everything's got to be 365 now with them.

23:59.940 --> 24:00.940
I guess.

24:00.940 --> 24:01.940
Does that mean it's cloud now?

24:01.940 --> 24:02.940
Is that their thing?

24:02.940 --> 24:04.260
If it's 365, it's the cloud version?

24:04.260 --> 24:05.260
Yeah.

24:05.260 --> 24:07.660
I think that's anything that's a service is 365.

24:07.660 --> 24:09.780
I'm not using Windows on Christmas.

24:09.780 --> 24:11.460
I'm not using Office on Christmas.

24:11.460 --> 24:15.300
So they can take at least Christmas and Easter off.

24:15.300 --> 24:20.300
Would you use GNOME?

24:20.300 --> 24:21.300
Okay.

24:21.300 --> 24:22.720
All right.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.940
So it starts off reasonable.

24:24.940 --> 24:25.940
Okay.

24:25.940 --> 24:27.700
This has really gone around like a wildfire.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.700
I shouldn't say that, but it really has.

24:30.700 --> 24:36.240
A GNOME developer has been doing a four part series about GNOME.

24:36.240 --> 24:40.600
His name is Tobias Bernard and he's done part one, two and three and they didn't get a lot

24:40.600 --> 24:41.600
of attention.

24:41.600 --> 24:47.900
But then he did part four where he talks about GNOME's values and its principles.

24:47.900 --> 24:50.320
I'm going to preface this.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.320
This is one developer.

24:51.320 --> 24:57.300
This doesn't necessarily represent the entire perspective of everyone involved in GNOME.

24:57.300 --> 25:02.860
However, it probably represents at least some of the widely held feelings and beliefs in

25:02.860 --> 25:03.860
the GNOME team.

25:03.860 --> 25:10.460
And I'll tell you, I read this and I just really had a bad feeling.

25:10.460 --> 25:13.440
So a couple of the points that, and I'll link to the full article, but a couple of the points

25:13.440 --> 25:21.440
that Tobias makes is he explains that GNOME's view is they must avoid user preferences and

25:21.440 --> 25:28.140
settings as much as possible because every preference has a cost in development time.

25:28.140 --> 25:29.140
I agree with that.

25:29.140 --> 25:30.140
That is true.

25:30.140 --> 25:32.180
Every preference adds complication.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.880
It adds another thing you have to test.

25:34.880 --> 25:35.920
I agree.

25:35.920 --> 25:41.660
And I think it's a reasonable design philosophy to try to reduce the amount of user preferences

25:41.660 --> 25:42.700
that have to be set.

25:42.700 --> 25:48.500
And he says they prefer to instead tackle the underlying problems that cause excessive

25:48.500 --> 25:50.660
options.

25:50.660 --> 25:53.980
The only thing is with the GNOME project, it seems like this is taken to an extreme

25:53.980 --> 25:56.620
where it means there can be no user configuration options.

25:56.620 --> 26:01.480
Then he goes on to say, and this one I kind of strongly disagree with, the traditional

26:01.480 --> 26:02.980
desktop is dead.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.720
Yeah, I'm not sure I buy that at all.

26:04.720 --> 26:09.140
And I don't really agree with that because I think Apple and Windows are still selling

26:09.140 --> 26:10.140
quite well.

26:10.140 --> 26:13.580
Especially with what we just saw with COVID too, work from home laptop sales spiked, right?

26:13.580 --> 26:15.620
I mean, I don't think it's dead.

26:15.620 --> 26:21.220
And it concerns me that a desktop maker thinks that, but anyways, he goes on to say system

26:21.220 --> 26:24.820
wide theming is a broken idea.

26:24.820 --> 26:30.140
He suggests those who don't like the way an app looks on their desktop should stop theming

26:30.140 --> 26:33.260
and instead contribute to the app directly upstream.

26:33.260 --> 26:34.900
It's still always viable.

26:34.900 --> 26:39.540
And then that's, see that, that's the one that kind of irks me because most users can't

26:39.540 --> 26:44.100
like write Vala code or C sharp code or whatever, you know, language to this particular applications

26:44.100 --> 26:45.100
written in.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.100
Yeah.

26:46.100 --> 26:51.060
And in particular, again, like I find it a reasonable argument that theming adds variability.

26:51.060 --> 26:54.620
It makes it hard for the developers to exactly expect and test what their apps going to look

26:54.620 --> 26:55.860
like on every system.

26:55.860 --> 26:56.940
I get that.

26:56.940 --> 26:59.500
It's a hard problem to solve.

26:59.500 --> 27:05.260
That being said, when you look at the commercial platforms, windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Chrome

27:05.260 --> 27:11.100
OS, there is such a, a flip on the spectrum.

27:11.100 --> 27:16.380
Back when I first got into Linux in the late nineties, you could get resource fork editors

27:16.380 --> 27:22.240
for Mac OS and you could get theme packs for Mac OS and windows had a plus pack that included

27:22.240 --> 27:24.900
new themes in a way to tweak the UI.

27:24.900 --> 27:29.540
And there were companies like Stardock that would make cool tools to modify the way your

27:29.540 --> 27:31.260
PC looked.

27:31.260 --> 27:35.920
And then when this first smartphones came out, the ones that ran windows CE and Palm,

27:35.920 --> 27:38.540
you could customize the crap out of those.

27:38.540 --> 27:42.060
You could customize the crap out of those UIs and put little widgets everywhere and

27:42.060 --> 27:44.740
up in the little toolbars and do all kinds of stuff.

27:44.740 --> 27:49.200
And now in 2021, we have swung so far the other direction.

27:49.200 --> 27:55.340
User customizability and user control is essentially gone instead replaced by standardization,

27:55.340 --> 28:00.300
standard controls, standard way of doing things, reduction of settings is always a goal now.

28:00.300 --> 28:03.220
And there is a place in the market for that.

28:03.220 --> 28:04.220
That's fine.

28:04.220 --> 28:08.580
But I also feel like more than ever now, more than when I even started using Linux originally,

28:08.580 --> 28:13.000
there's also a place in the market for a desktop environment that does let you have some power

28:13.000 --> 28:15.300
and control and does let you customize it.

28:15.300 --> 28:21.220
And I would go on to argue that giving the user the ability to customize their theme

28:21.220 --> 28:26.760
and tweak their desktop as silly as that sounds and as much of a headache as it is for developers

28:26.760 --> 28:31.500
inspires people to tinker and become curious with their computers.

28:31.500 --> 28:36.220
And it's what creates the next generation of people who are building systems and tweaking

28:36.220 --> 28:41.460
systems because they can investigate, because they can explore their curiosity.

28:41.460 --> 28:45.620
They can open up the hood and they can play around with the engine.

28:45.620 --> 28:50.460
And I think that's probably more important today than it's ever been because it doesn't

28:50.460 --> 28:53.900
exist at all in the general market.

28:53.900 --> 28:57.820
And so for GNOME to come along and say, well, what we're going to do is we're going to lock

28:57.820 --> 29:02.340
everything down and we're going to make it just as bland and generic as all of the commercial

29:02.340 --> 29:03.340
platforms.

29:03.340 --> 29:05.320
Well, then what's the differentiator here?

29:05.320 --> 29:07.140
Because the market's already spoken.

29:07.140 --> 29:12.380
GNOME OS came out after GNOME Shell and has destroyed them in market share for other market

29:12.380 --> 29:13.380
reasons.

29:13.380 --> 29:14.380
But let's just be honest here.

29:14.380 --> 29:15.380
Like, who's your market?

29:15.380 --> 29:16.380
Who are you going for?

29:16.380 --> 29:21.400
And then the last one, Mike, the one that truly gets me angry, legitimately made me

29:21.400 --> 29:24.780
decide I am no longer ever using GNOME Shell.

29:24.780 --> 29:29.720
And it's such a damn disappointment, especially after the project specifically made outreach

29:29.720 --> 29:33.860
to extension developers to improve the extension experience, which we've talked about on this

29:33.860 --> 29:40.180
show, Tobias says, Shell extensions will always be a niche thing.

29:40.180 --> 29:43.460
Yeah, that one hit below the belt.

29:43.460 --> 29:48.140
Rather than building GNOME extensions, Tobias thinks developers should instead make apps

29:48.140 --> 29:53.100
or perhaps contribute directly upstream to GNOME Shell, again with the contribute upstream.

29:53.100 --> 29:56.900
Then you don't need the extension, as if the GNOME project would even accept your patch

29:56.900 --> 30:02.020
because they're notorious for rejecting things that don't match their ideology.

30:02.020 --> 30:07.860
And the bombastic statement of ridiculousness that GNOME Shell extensions are niche is the

30:07.860 --> 30:11.300
opposite, the opposite of reality.

30:11.300 --> 30:18.180
GNOME Shell with extensions is the vast majority of GNOME deployments, considering that Ubuntu,

30:18.180 --> 30:23.100
just the more recent versions of Ubuntu, have a two fold install base over every other GNOME

30:23.100 --> 30:29.260
desktop and it ships with a boatload of extensions by default, makes that statement ludicrous.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.740
Pop OS as well is in there.

30:30.740 --> 30:35.620
Pop OS, even Fedora dude, even Fedora ships with an extension that puts their logo on

30:35.620 --> 30:37.780
the background in GNOME Shell.

30:37.780 --> 30:44.860
Literally every major implementation on every distribution that ships GNOME Shell has extensions

30:44.860 --> 30:46.060
turned on by default.

30:46.060 --> 30:49.460
And the developer says, oh, they're a niche thing, they're going to go away.

30:49.460 --> 30:53.780
If you want that functionality, if you want the Bitcoin price up in your toolbar, if you

30:53.780 --> 30:58.140
want your ping milliseconds up in the toolbar, submit that code upstream to GNOME Shell so

30:58.140 --> 30:59.940
that way we can reject it.

30:59.940 --> 31:03.860
Yeah, I think it's crazy that the solution to that would be submitting upstream.

31:03.860 --> 31:11.820
But again, it's entitled to his opinion and obviously, you know, I don't know.

31:11.820 --> 31:14.980
The dream of GNOME extensions was a great dream.

31:14.980 --> 31:19.500
I do, I mean, it's well documented that I have some reservations about it, but I don't

31:19.500 --> 31:23.620
think the answer is everybody has to like fork GNOME and write in their own features.

31:23.620 --> 31:26.060
That's for damn sure, right?

31:26.060 --> 31:27.580
So it's interesting.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.040
It's sad.

31:29.040 --> 31:34.180
I take it with a bit of salt because this is just one per one individual's opinion.

31:34.180 --> 31:40.780
But yeah, it's I think the problem is like he starts from the premise that the traditional

31:40.780 --> 31:43.020
desktop is dead.

31:43.020 --> 31:47.500
And so it gets really easy to make grand statements that are like just not true.

31:47.500 --> 31:48.500
Yeah.

31:48.500 --> 31:52.260
Because people do like spend their day working on their desktop.

31:52.260 --> 31:58.420
And I know for myself, at least, whether I'm a Mac or Linux or what, I know how each OS

31:58.420 --> 32:00.860
works and that works the way I want it.

32:00.860 --> 32:03.980
And I hate it when like, you know, quote, unquote, the vendor moves my cheese, right?

32:03.980 --> 32:08.700
Like something changes or they tell me I can't do something in particular on Mac as they've

32:08.700 --> 32:12.260
been removing features, right?

32:12.260 --> 32:14.300
Particularly in the area of customization.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.740
I don't know.

32:15.740 --> 32:18.920
This has been a recurring theme, the GNOME extensions.

32:18.920 --> 32:21.940
I just, I don't know.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.220
I like system wide theming.

32:23.220 --> 32:26.820
I like extensions and I don't think the traditional desktop is dead.

32:26.820 --> 32:29.500
Not to like go through and cut them down point by point, but.

32:29.500 --> 32:30.500
I agree completely.

32:30.500 --> 32:36.460
I'll tell you the shift, the shift I had after reading this was I had the sad realization

32:36.460 --> 32:43.220
that the GNOME project probably through, you know, just a culture of a project and a group

32:43.220 --> 32:47.100
of people who share a common set of beliefs that, you know, they kind of they can create

32:47.100 --> 32:49.340
an echo chamber.

32:49.340 --> 32:56.060
And I truly to my core believe they're making a desktop for a user that does not exist.

32:56.060 --> 33:01.500
They're making a desktop for this theoretical, idealized new user who's going to come to

33:01.500 --> 33:07.520
Linux and wants this super simple, clean, get out of your way, just barely, but works

33:07.520 --> 33:13.060
kind of environment that is minimal and very new user friendly.

33:13.060 --> 33:18.420
And it's, it seems like an obvious approach on the surface because if you look at the

33:18.420 --> 33:25.060
computer market and the people who use desktops, well, the vast, vast, vast majority of computer

33:25.060 --> 33:26.900
users are that type of user.

33:26.900 --> 33:31.300
The vast, vast majority of users that will ever use a computer are the type of user that

33:31.300 --> 33:34.980
GNOME is building their perfect desktop for.

33:34.980 --> 33:40.940
But the reality is that's always been the case for Linux and the commercial platforms

33:40.940 --> 33:45.160
are already providing the solution to all of those users.

33:45.160 --> 33:48.940
And because of the market dynamics and work that have sold Chromebooks and continue to

33:48.940 --> 33:53.860
sell Mac books and sell Dells and those are all going to continue to ship those platforms

33:53.860 --> 33:55.540
for a very, very long time.

33:55.540 --> 33:59.180
And those users will buy Chromebooks and Macs.

33:59.180 --> 34:00.540
That's the reality of it.

34:00.540 --> 34:04.980
The people who choose to use Linux are going to be more of engineer types.

34:04.980 --> 34:09.500
They're going to be people who want that flexibility and control over their workstation.

34:09.500 --> 34:13.840
They're going to be people who are intellectually curious about how the computer works.

34:13.840 --> 34:18.860
That's always going to be the user base for desktop Linux, engineers and admins.

34:18.860 --> 34:19.980
It's obvious on its face.

34:19.980 --> 34:24.120
You're going to, of course, have new users out there that are given a Linux box that's

34:24.120 --> 34:27.380
been preset up by an admin or a friend or a family member.

34:27.380 --> 34:29.500
That's always going to be a user out there.

34:29.500 --> 34:34.380
But these are not the people actively seeking out the Linux desktop and choosing and evaluating

34:34.380 --> 34:36.100
desktop environments.

34:36.100 --> 34:38.980
Those are more technical people and they always will be.

34:38.980 --> 34:41.740
This is an engineer's operating system.

34:41.740 --> 34:42.740
Just what it is.

34:42.740 --> 34:45.940
You're either deploying it on a server to solve a problem, you're building a device

34:45.940 --> 34:50.220
or if you're using it on the desktop, you know what the hell you're doing.

34:50.220 --> 34:54.740
This idea that they're targeting this desktop environment at this user who's never going

34:54.740 --> 35:02.300
to choose their product and we have over 20 years of data to show us this.

35:02.300 --> 35:06.420
We are never going to catch up to where some of these commercial desktops are at when it

35:06.420 --> 35:10.940
comes to ecosystem integration because these users also have bones that tie into greater

35:10.940 --> 35:16.380
ecosystems and GNOME Shell is just simply not in a position to offer any kind of competition

35:16.380 --> 35:17.380
to that.

35:17.380 --> 35:20.980
And again, so they're going to have to focus on a user who can live without that kind of

35:20.980 --> 35:21.980
stuff.

35:21.980 --> 35:26.140
This all just sounds obvious when it comes out of my mouth and yet the GNOME project

35:26.140 --> 35:27.980
seems completely blinded by it.

35:27.980 --> 35:34.260
Instead, they're on this quest to actually alienate the existing user base they have

35:34.260 --> 35:41.080
today and shoot for a user that simply does not exist.

35:41.080 --> 35:47.300
It's madness and it simply invalidates the GNOME desktop for me as a possible desktop

35:47.300 --> 35:51.260
of the future because I'm clearly not their target demographic.

35:51.260 --> 35:55.940
They don't think any of us, anyone listening to this show is their target demographic.

35:55.940 --> 35:59.220
They think this person that doesn't exist that they've made up in their minds is the

35:59.220 --> 36:00.740
target demographic.

36:00.740 --> 36:05.740
And so it's with that that I just simply cannot use GNOME Shell, I cannot recommend GNOME

36:05.740 --> 36:06.740
Shell.

36:06.740 --> 36:11.740
And for you, I've got to now start a campaign to convince you to try Plasma because it is

36:11.740 --> 36:15.360
a better experience, but how do I even get somebody to try it because all of the major

36:15.360 --> 36:19.820
distributions are using GNOME Shell and it's pathetic.

36:19.820 --> 36:23.060
You know how you get someone like me to try it?

36:23.060 --> 36:26.940
So my love of Papa West is pretty well documented, right?

36:26.940 --> 36:34.180
But there's a pitch me some other distro other than Ubuntu or Pop that by default comes with

36:34.180 --> 36:38.180
Plasma and is somehow tailored for what I do.

36:38.180 --> 36:42.780
I know I've said it before, there's two things that have happened in recent history, Canonical

36:42.780 --> 36:47.620
could have chosen to go with Plasma and System76 could have chosen to go with Plasma when they

36:47.620 --> 36:48.860
created Pop.

36:48.860 --> 36:53.420
And in both cases, it just came down to GTK is what we've been using, GNOME Shell is what

36:53.420 --> 36:56.500
we've been using, it's what we know, we'll just keep doing it.

36:56.500 --> 37:00.980
When you look at who contributes to GNOME Shell, it's 80% somewhere in that neighborhood,

37:00.980 --> 37:03.980
almost 90% Red Hat staff.

37:03.980 --> 37:10.580
It's so clearly a Red Hat project that we all pretend like isn't a Red Hat project.

37:10.580 --> 37:13.420
And it's Red Hat that's driving this.

37:13.420 --> 37:16.420
And I have a lot of respect for what they do, I think the team has done a lot of hard

37:16.420 --> 37:20.620
work, a lot of good development has come out of there, but it's just no longer for me.

37:20.620 --> 37:22.660
And I'm still going through the morning process.

37:22.660 --> 37:23.660
I've lost a friend.

37:23.660 --> 37:27.140
I just want to say, as we've been on the air, my work Slack is blowing up because we're

37:27.140 --> 37:28.740
recording during the day.

37:28.740 --> 37:31.980
And they're debugging some problem, it doesn't really matter.

37:31.980 --> 37:37.300
But people are all talking about how they've now customized their GNOME terminals.

37:37.300 --> 37:40.900
And the couple people on Mac are like, well, how come we can't do transparencies and background

37:40.900 --> 37:41.900
images in our terminal?

37:41.900 --> 37:42.900
They got to get iTerm, that's why.

37:42.900 --> 37:47.780
That's why, you got to get iTerm basically, because Apple decided that you can't have

37:47.780 --> 37:48.780
that.

37:48.780 --> 37:49.780
Didn't they used to?

37:49.780 --> 37:50.780
I could have sworn it used to.

37:50.780 --> 37:51.780
They used to.

37:51.780 --> 37:52.780
They actually took it out.

37:52.780 --> 37:56.060
They said, OK, just like a small digression here.

37:56.060 --> 38:00.740
I was working on Windows the other day, a VM, because I destroyed my Windows machine.

38:00.740 --> 38:07.220
And the Windows terminal is just, it's a joy.

38:07.220 --> 38:12.260
As a terminal emulator, it's awesome.

38:12.260 --> 38:14.660
I don't understand why I can't have that on Mac.

38:14.660 --> 38:18.820
Well, I mean, I know you're such an iTerm hater, but I tell you, I think Windows terminal

38:18.820 --> 38:20.300
was heavily inspired by iTerm.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.860
Isn't iTerm not being updated anymore?

38:22.860 --> 38:23.860
No, it's updated.

38:23.860 --> 38:24.860
Oh, yeah.

38:24.860 --> 38:25.860
Mm.

38:25.860 --> 38:26.860
I know.

38:26.860 --> 38:27.860
I know.

38:27.860 --> 38:28.860
Yeah.

38:28.860 --> 38:32.900
What I would do if I were you is I'd have one terminal that's the Mac terminal.

38:32.900 --> 38:33.900
That would be my x86 terminal.

38:33.900 --> 38:39.180
And then I'd have one terminal that's my M1-compatible terminal or something, because you know.

38:39.180 --> 38:41.140
I never, ever run the M1 terminal.

38:41.140 --> 38:42.140
Oh, really?

38:42.140 --> 38:43.140
It's all x86?

38:43.140 --> 38:46.180
It's still that bad, huh?

38:46.180 --> 38:47.180
It's still a hot mess?

38:47.180 --> 38:52.300
Well, it's, I mean, I'm doing a lot of Python-y stuff, and it's just, yeah, you got to compile

38:52.300 --> 38:53.300
like this.

38:53.300 --> 38:54.300
That's got a long tail.

38:54.300 --> 38:55.300
Mm.

38:55.300 --> 39:00.380
I actually renamed terminal to terminal M1, and I have another terminal that's just like

39:00.380 --> 39:03.540
a copy of it, but set to launch in Rosetta mode.

39:03.540 --> 39:06.540
That's terminal.

39:06.540 --> 39:08.540
That's Rosetta terminal, rather.

39:08.540 --> 39:11.780
Yeah, I'm just, I don't know, man.

39:11.780 --> 39:14.500
After I read this, I had to sit with this GNOME stuff.

39:14.500 --> 39:15.500
Made me sad.

39:15.500 --> 39:16.500
Yeah.

39:16.500 --> 39:17.500
This thing is forever, right?

39:17.500 --> 39:23.900
I just, I don't know, I mean, we're all rocking iPads, and my long guy just loves it when

39:23.900 --> 39:24.900
we record.

39:24.900 --> 39:26.220
Yeah, especially during the day.

39:26.220 --> 39:32.700
Yeah, I think because I'm really struggling to stay on the Linux desktop these days, Plasma

39:32.700 --> 39:36.740
makes me happy, but it's not perfect, especially when I start getting to Wayland and multiple

39:36.740 --> 39:41.660
monitor setups with multiple refresh rates, and one that's high DPI and one that's not,

39:41.660 --> 39:43.100
one that has HDR and one that doesn't.

39:43.100 --> 39:45.980
It's a real hodgepodge monitor setup I have right now, but I just simply can't afford to

39:45.980 --> 39:46.980
replace all of them.

39:46.980 --> 39:48.260
So it is what it is.

39:48.260 --> 39:52.540
And it's really a struggle bus these days to just use desktop Linux, especially when

39:52.540 --> 39:56.460
you have things like the M1 coming out and the M1X pending.

39:56.460 --> 40:00.260
You have Windows that seems to be getting better and better.

40:00.260 --> 40:05.180
I'm never going to switch to it, but like the pressures really seem to be mounting against

40:05.180 --> 40:07.260
desktop Linux.

40:07.260 --> 40:13.420
And at the same time, you have the lead desktop project and one of their lead developers going

40:13.420 --> 40:16.700
on about how the desktop's dead and about how extensions are niche.

40:16.700 --> 40:19.300
And it's like, wow, could you be any more detached from reality?

40:19.300 --> 40:25.740
Like the people that have the future of desktop Linux in their very hands seem delusional.

40:25.740 --> 40:26.740
Delusional.

40:26.740 --> 40:27.740
I like it.

40:27.740 --> 40:28.740
Seriously.

40:28.740 --> 40:32.220
They think that they think the traditional desktop is dead and they think extensions

40:32.220 --> 40:34.780
are niche, or at least Tobias does.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.140
In my opinion, that sounds delusional.

40:36.140 --> 40:38.540
Yeah, but again, it's just one dude.

40:38.540 --> 40:43.340
And I just don't see how anybody with a straight face could say traditional desktops are dead.

40:43.340 --> 40:44.340
They're not dead.

40:44.340 --> 40:49.660
People work with them every day, especially Linux people who are, you know, overwhelmingly

40:49.660 --> 40:55.620
IT pros of some kind, whether they're developers or sys admins or DBAs or whatever.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.100
I hope you're right.

40:57.100 --> 41:01.060
Audience let me know what you think, coder.show slash contact, or you can weigh in on anything

41:01.060 --> 41:03.080
we've mentioned here or anything else you'd like.

41:03.080 --> 41:08.420
If you haven't joined our Coder QA team yet, coderqa.co, we have a new Coderly that's getting

41:08.420 --> 41:10.580
recorded soon and released very soon.

41:10.580 --> 41:12.460
You get that and access to all the previous ones.

41:12.460 --> 41:17.800
You support the show, you get a limited ad feed and that special bonus Coderly report.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.740
And that is all at coderqa.co.

41:19.740 --> 41:21.820
Thanks to everybody who does support us.

41:21.820 --> 41:22.820
It means a lot.

41:22.820 --> 41:26.540
Mr. Dominic, is there anyone you want to send people anywhere you want to send people, maybe

41:26.540 --> 41:27.540
to your long guy?

41:27.540 --> 41:28.540
Maybe?

41:28.540 --> 41:29.540
I don't know.

41:29.540 --> 41:30.540
Yeah.

41:30.540 --> 41:31.540
No, you know what?

41:31.540 --> 41:34.460
I've been a little inactive on the socials, but follow me at Twitter, add to Manuka, I'll

41:34.460 --> 41:36.020
probably pick back up in a week or two.

41:36.020 --> 41:39.000
Yeah, once, you know, you can always send us some moving pictures.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
People love that.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Yeah.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Oh, yeah.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
I'm at Chris Elias.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.380
The network is at Jupiter Signal and the show at Coder Radio Show.

41:46.380 --> 41:50.340
Links to what we talked about today, well, that's over at coder.show slash four, two,

41:50.340 --> 41:51.340
three.

41:51.340 --> 41:55.740
You'll also find that contact form I mentioned, as well as our RSS feed and links to our back

41:55.740 --> 41:58.020
catalog and all of that.

41:58.020 --> 42:02.700
And head over to Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get our live time so you can join

42:02.700 --> 42:05.340
us when the Coder Radio program is live.

42:05.340 --> 42:07.820
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of Coder Radio.

42:07.820 --> 42:17.580
See you right back here next week.
