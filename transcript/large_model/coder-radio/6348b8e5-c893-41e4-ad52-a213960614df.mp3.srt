00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,880
This is KOTORadio, episode 456, for March 7th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,080
Hello good looking and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,960
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,520
My name is Chris, and joining me like the East Coast Maven he is, it's our host, Mr.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,520
Dominic.

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,520
Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Hello, hello, hello.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,520
Hello.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,160
I join you a wrecked man, you know?

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,160
I dabbled in the markets and boy have I been wrecked recently.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,040
Last night my son's Roblox account was hacked and they took everything.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,720
They took everything from the kid.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,480
He just recently got into that game because I have three kids, my daughter, my youngest

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,920
likes it.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,080
And he was always like, oh no, Roblox, that's silly.

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,560
And then something changed about a month ago and he got so into it that he just accumulated

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,780
all this stuff.

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,420
He even managed to like convince me to get him a subscription and he like became this

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,160
trade king, like one of the top 100 players on the system that he was in.

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,000
So he's just doing great.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,960
And then I'm sitting down to record last night and I get a text message, dad, my account

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
just got hacked.

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm saying there's probably $60 worth of purchases in there now that are just gone.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He's devastated.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,800
He built it all up, you know?

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,280
He was like the big rapper with a posse handing out like items and pets to people, you know?

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,720
There's no recovery mechanism?

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,600
This is where it's like, as a dad, do I step in and like interface with the support?

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,600
So what I did is I got him all the info and you know, and had him and his mom, they filled

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,400
out like the support form and all of that, but then they're like, nope, sorry, nothing

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,600
we're going to be able to do for you.

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,800
And it just seems like what happened is I think he logged into some website that claimed

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,380
to like connect to your account and they stole his credentials and then they just programmatically

34
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,200
emptied his account, basically.

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,020
The metaverse is rough, man.

36
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,440
The rough streets of the metaverse.

37
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,760
She like, my youngest, she springs into action because they like have some sort of like shared

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
bank.

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,720
Like she logs in on her iPad, brings up the bank and starts doing like an emergency transfer.

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,840
It's like a rug pull in a crypto community, but you just see everybody scrambling.

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,080
It's it was wild.

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,680
So shall we expect Fisher coin and not by you, but by your children?

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,200
So I mean, it seems like your daughter, well, I mean, they got to they got to make it up,

44
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
right?

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
They got to make it back somehow.

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
She's like, as I say, your daughter seems like she knows what's up.

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
I don't know.

48
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,200
She's got an NFT if you want to buy it.

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,520
Pretty crazy, pretty crazy stuff.

50
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,440
You know, like I felt bad for him because in a way, it feels like getting your account

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,840
owned is probably a rite of passage for his generation.

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,280
I feel like it's gonna happen a lot.

53
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
And it seems like if the stakes are your roblox account, that's probably better than like

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,280
your Google account or your bank account when you're older, right?

55
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,840
So maybe this will instill some password hygiene in him at an early age and some caution.

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,040
I think mostly was a phishing attack, though.

57
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Well, yeah, the problem is a phishing attack, you know, even 2FA won't really protect you,

58
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
right?

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,320
Yeah, especially if you're motivated, you know, if they manage to give you a convincing

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,480
sell and a reason to authorize your account and well, why don't we follow up on last week's

61
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,420
episode where we talked about the possibility of Proton becoming a platform that brings

62
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,080
apps beyond just gaming for Linux one day, essentially with the downside of making Win32

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,240
the sort of de facto ABI for developers.

64
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,720
Marcel wrote in, I have some thoughts about Win32 as a universal target.

65
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,920
I actually really think Proton needs more attention in the productivity software space.

66
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,240
I would love to see Fusion 360 in Linux.

67
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,040
It's one of those applications that just doesn't run well in a virtual machine.

68
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,500
And it really isn't going to be rewritten anytime soon.

69
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,360
And I wouldn't say it's really legacy either.

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,120
It's still actively developed and it has many users.

71
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,240
Yeah, a lot of these like large diagramming or CAD programs that are Windows only, when

72
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,460
we start talking about this, we inevitably hear from folks that say like Marcel, I tried

73
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,840
Fusion and Wine.

74
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
It just wasn't perfect.

75
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,240
It kind of worked, but you know, nobody's going to deploy that at scale.

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,720
If it got the attention the games did, then these productivity tools that are used in

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,900
the enterprise desktop space could be brought over to Linux.

78
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,480
And that was kind of where I think I was going and I probably should have used CAD as the

79
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,560
perfect example is like that business space that maybe wants to just standardize on a

80
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,240
Linux desktop for some advantage.

81
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,720
I don't know why.

82
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,800
And maybe there isn't one.

83
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Maybe there is.

84
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,500
And you know, this is the last piece they needed.

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,280
But before you jump in, there's something else that was interesting that Sean sent in.

86
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,760
He says that a Proton runtime of sorts was actually foreseen by a great wizard.

87
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,400
He says, I've been listening since episode one.

88
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,760
It's the best show on JB.

89
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,680
The email could really just end there.

90
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
He's true.

91
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Yeah, you're right.

92
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Best email ever.

93
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Done.

94
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Although he does pay his respects to Egon.

95
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,280
Egon got some love this week.

96
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,640
You know, Egon's like a part of the show.

97
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,760
Everybody who writes on regularly becomes a character like Josh with the cold hands.

98
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,560
You know, he wrote back in and said that his hands are doing a lot better.

99
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
He got the warming pad.

100
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Fantastic, I guess.

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
It's great.

102
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
I'm glad.

103
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
I'm glad his hands are warm.

104
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
I'm glad you're feeling better, Josh.

105
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
All right.

106
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
So back to telling me I'm wonderful.

107
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Come on.

108
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,480
I want to point out that Carmack, John Carmack, said nine years ago that essentially, well,

109
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,760
here, I grabbed it.

110
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,080
I went and got the best part.

111
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,000
On Reddit, in like a Reddit comment thread, Carmack says, we blow right past Linux these

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
days.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We don't even really consider it.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,160
He says, I truly feel, this is a quote from Carmack, that emulation of some sort is the

115
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,360
proper technical direction for gaming on Linux.

116
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,880
This is nine years ago.

117
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,360
He says, it's obviously pragmatic in the range of possible support, but it shouldn't have

118
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
the technical stigma that it does.

119
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,480
There really isn't much of anything special that a native port does.

120
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,160
We still make OpenGL calls, Winsock is just BSD sockets, Windows threads become P threads,

121
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,120
and the translation of input and audio interfaces don't make much difference.

122
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,480
A good shim layer should have less impact on performance and variability than driver

123
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,800
quality does.

124
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,920
Ideally, following a set of best practice guidelines could allow developers to get Linux

125
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,680
versions with a little more effort than support, say, Windows XP.

126
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,600
Properly evangelized, again, this is nine years ago, Carmack writes, properly evangelized

127
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,720
with Steam as the monetized distribution platform, this is a plausible path forward.

128
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,760
And he actually goes into more detail, it's long and I'll link to it if people want to

129
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
read it.

130
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,960
But he goes in like some historical context about why they don't port to Linux and things

131
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,400
like that.

132
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:56,700
But I sit here now, having used desktop Linux in some form since the late 90s, and I wonder

133
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,480
if maybe this just isn't the better direction to go because it seems like it's either this

134
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,320
or Electron.

135
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,200
And I know as wild as this sounds, I think I'd rather run Windows applications under

136
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,440
Proton than have 1530 Electron apps on my PC.

137
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,360
So it would be easy to do like the cheap dunk here, but I'm not going to do it because this

138
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,240
isn't that crazy.

139
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,520
This before YouTube commenters, yeah, right, what's the difference between Win32 and emulating

140
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,140
some other platform, or running an entire giant ass, you know, Chromium instance for

141
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,140
every application?

142
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
Right.

143
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,140
That's my thinking.

144
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,140
Am I mistaken on this?

145
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:44,040
I thought Electron was moving towards having like a shared Chromium resource.

146
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,440
There is actually a way to do that today.

147
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,120
I think though the Electron app can still opt to always build their own and run that.

148
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,200
It's like, for example, on some Linux systems, you could actually run a system level Electron

149
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,720
and all the apps run on top of that.

150
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,880
But it can be so hit and miss because take Slack, for example, they don't account for

151
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,880
you running a newer runtime.

152
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,400
And so there are bugs.

153
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
It's crashy.

154
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,640
I feel like I should be more spicy, but I kind of don't think this is the worst idea

155
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
ever.

156
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:20,200
Let me try to put this in a non-douchey way, which of course means it's going to get rough.

157
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,680
First of all, you know, I just had this meeting yet again at TMB.

158
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
All right.

159
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,200
Remember we talked a couple of weeks ago about the Windows 11 change?

160
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,120
Oh, for the login stuff where you need a Microsoft account?

161
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Yeah.

162
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:38,880
Well, that's creating a surprising level of angst with a couple of my customers.

163
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,080
And honestly, like, to hell with those guys, right?

164
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,160
There was nothing wrong with the old Win32 APIs.

165
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,020
Hell, there's nothing wrong with Qt except Qt's strong desire to change their license

166
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,020
terms every year.

167
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,560
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

168
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,880
Oh, and don't forget their strong desire to communicate in the most obtuse way that can

169
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,640
always be interpreted in multiple different ways.

170
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
You know, it's funny.

171
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,780
We, so the last, we coupled Qt again.

172
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,880
We covered it, what, like four months ago, something like that?

173
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,400
I don't know, man, because I'm still singed.

174
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,460
So it's hard for me to tell at all, Blair's.

175
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,180
One of their dev evangelists actually reached out to me and said that I was simply confused

176
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:23,520
and that there was a misunderstanding between myself and the sales rep, which is honestly

177
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
completely possible.

178
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Right?

179
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
Right.

180
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
I recall.

181
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
Yeah.

182
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
I mean, you've been dealing with me for, what, like 10 years?

183
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
You know how I am.

184
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,960
I, when I said, when I want something, I'm like, this is what I want.

185
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Right.

186
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,920
I'm not really good at the whole, you know, wheel and deal kind of game.

187
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,520
So a lot of the cut, my customers listen to show I, my pitches, I'm always the Saturn

188
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
dealer.

189
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,560
You're so old.

190
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,280
Do you kick the doors too and show that they don't, you know, hell no popcorn, no hot dogs.

191
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,600
I'm just the Saturn dealer.

192
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Right.

193
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,840
Do I really have to explain what that means?

194
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,080
I feel like I do since you're like, you're so old.

195
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,520
Well, I mean, they haven't, like they literally haven't even been around for like a decade

196
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
or something.

197
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,360
All right, so Saturn was a sub brand of GM, much like Corvette, Chevy, whatever.

198
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,960
Started by like the best of the best in GM, right?

199
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,520
So it was like their elite people, at least that's the story I heard.

200
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,880
Their whole deal was no scummy sales tactics.

201
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,480
You go to the lot, you want to buy a car, the car has a price.

202
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,600
If you're a GM employee, you get a different price because that's a weird union deal.

203
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,280
Or if you're like the relative, like I'm related to GM employees, that's why I buy Chevys because

204
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,960
you get a better price.

205
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,160
Can I, oh, just to interrupt.

206
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,240
So that GM, that employee deal thing, it's so funny because as you would expect, if you've

207
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,320
ever been to a GM building, a large GM office, the entire parking lot looks like a GM car

208
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,720
dealership because it's all clean, new GMs.

209
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,480
And then like the one black sheep of the group shows up in like a Ford and it's like, oh,

210
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,000
well my car is, my car's still, it still hasn't arrived yet.

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is my old car.

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He has to like defend himself.

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It was funny.

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,400
Well, cause the employee pricing is like really good.

215
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,040
So anyway, the Saturn dealers whole shtick was you come here, you see a car in the lot,

216
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,080
you'd like it.

217
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,320
Let's say the cars, I don't know, Saturn's weren't that expensive either, right?

218
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Like $22,000 maybe.

219
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Right.

220
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Right.

221
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,920
When you, when the sticker says 22 grand, the salesman, there's no bull going back to

222
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,660
the manager and like having to say, oh, like, okay.

223
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,200
The douchey thing I always do is I don't say that I get the union discount because once

224
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,280
you do that, they always, all of a sudden they're showing you like the LS, the night

225
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,400
that I serve cars, I'm always like, oh geez, that's a little steep.

226
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,840
Don't you want the one with two power seats?

227
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Right.

228
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,080
Well, what I say is, well, what can you do?

229
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,720
Let me, let me just see, I have this union number.

230
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
Can I, what's that price?

231
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,920
And the salesman always wants to slap me.

232
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
There goes his commission.

233
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
Right.

234
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,280
Cause that's, they really do f**k them over.

235
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,440
But the deal with Saturn was the price on the car is the price on the car with the one

236
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,240
exception of the union deal.

237
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,080
But then they even published the employee price.

238
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,680
So if you were, you, you knew what it was.

239
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
That's my whole shtick.

240
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
And it's not that old.

241
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,440
They, they haven't been dead for 10 years.

242
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Have they?

243
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,920
I don't know.

244
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Feels like it.

245
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,960
Maybe it's been longer.

246
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,440
Here's my thinking on it.

247
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,560
Again, I'm just looking at this as a selfish Linux user who wants to reclaim his desktop

248
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,640
back from electron.

249
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Here's the beauty.

250
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:28,240
I believe of Linux users just accepting that Win32 would make a great target base for developers.

251
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,040
Proton could make a great shim to get a good experience at native speeds.

252
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,360
But here's the best part.

253
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,420
It cuts the Mac users out, right?

254
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,820
Because when something gets ported to electron, it's just as easy to run it on a Mac.

255
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,560
And often the experience is even slightly better.

256
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:52,320
So if you just kept everything Win32's ABI, that's going to be really hard on the M1 Macs.

257
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,400
That's going to be hard on Apple's future direction.

258
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,840
Makes it hard to move it over to their platform.

259
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,240
It keeps the business apps on Windows and Linux.

260
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,400
And I think they could live in peace together.

261
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,560
You know, when you consider WSL, when you consider, they all could kind of work together

262
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,040
in that sense and screw Apple.

263
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
And I think that'd be great.

264
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,760
What a, what a nice twist of events.

265
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:20,600
And the slow capitulation to electron that we're seeing in the industry is about enabling

266
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:27,200
people to leave the Win32 world, which before this episode, I would have thought is great.

267
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,400
But now that I'm thinking about it and I want to be like, you know, if Linux had a CEO,

268
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,280
if I was Linux's CEO today.

269
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,800
Oh, like what the Linux Foundation wants to be.

270
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Oh, sorry.

271
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Too mean.

272
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Well, yeah.

273
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,080
If there was a CEO of Linux that was looking at how to like secure the next 30 years of

274
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,400
the desktop, whatever remains of it.

275
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,200
First of all, that's a bad job.

276
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,720
But second of all, I'd be like, well, we always talk about on this show, how do you build

277
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
a moat?

278
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,240
You build a moat by making sure you don't keep bleeding to the Mac, in my opinion.

279
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
And you deal with that.

280
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,760
If you're the CEO of Linux, you ignore the desktop and you do your actual goddamn job,

282
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,360
which is IoT.

283
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,980
All these new, by the way, the metaverse is a huge opportunity for Linux now that I actually

284
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,320
believe in it.

285
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Right.

286
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Servers.

287
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Oh, for sure.

288
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
These devices.

289
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,720
Nobody wants to license Windows.

290
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,400
The way we ended up on this weird topic is that Windows 11's new account thing is screwing

291
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,540
over the types of enterprise deployments that I do at the Mad Botter for my customers.

292
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:33,920
So I am considering some, we should DM about this, some drastic actions here.

293
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:44,040
Like crazy, like Colorado style actions, because I need a platform that I'm not going to get

294
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,760
hammered because of somebody's, you know, weird strategy tax.

295
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Boy.

296
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Oh, boy.

297
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,600
And I know that strategy tax, that's your that's your thing, right?

298
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,480
You know, today it came out, I've been feeling the same way only in the podcast space.

299
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:04,280
Today it came out that YouTube is offering like $50,000 to certain podcasters to take

300
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,160
their audio only podcast and make it a video podcast and then, you know, start using their

301
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,800
ads and stuff like that.

302
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,520
And you know, you watch what Spotify is doing, you watch what Apple is doing, you see what

303
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,880
Libsyn is trying to do with suppressing ad prices and YouTube is trying to do by taking

304
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
over podcasting.

305
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,400
And I start thinking to myself, how the hell am I going to be able to stay independent

306
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,440
for the next five years?

307
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,420
It's getting really, really centralized out there.

308
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,600
For some, like the rumor is as much as $300,000 the offer is, which I still find ridiculous.

309
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,380
$50,000 couldn't even convert a single one of our podcasts to video.

310
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,380
Think about it.

311
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,760
That doesn't even pay for a year of a video editor.

312
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,320
Not to mention camera equipment, lighting, sets, editing equipment.

313
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,160
I mean, give me a break $50,000 is spent in one weekend buying the gear.

314
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,200
No, that makes no sense.

315
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Yeah.

316
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,360
I'm trying to incentivize a centralization of podcasters because once you go onto the

317
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,840
YouTube platform, you create content for the algorithm and you have to create content that's

318
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:12,120
also appealing to the ad bot because it's all an auction system behind the scenes.

319
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,040
And the auction system has preferences.

320
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,400
It looks for brand safe content and brand safe content is not only the type of things

321
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,080
that you cover, but it's the genre that you cover as well.

322
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,840
I look at independent podcast operations and I just think, I don't even know if most of

323
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,620
them are going to make it the next couple of years.

324
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,280
I think it's really bleak out there.

325
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,880
I mean, how many people do you know that do this full time?

326
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,000
Not many, if they're not part of a large company.

327
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,480
I mean, I'll see your podcasters and raise you independent app developers.

328
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Right.

329
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,440
That's what I'm thinking is where the parallels are at.

330
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,600
Well, we're not even through the feedback and I think it's, if you're a drinkin' man,

331
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,120
it's time for your Coder Radio depression cocktail.

332
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,720
If you had a bummer episode on your bingo card, no, I don't know.

333
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
It'll be fine.

334
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,760
Listen, when Spotify owns the market and they still have to pay Apple 30 percent, it'll

335
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
be great.

336
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
Don't worry.

337
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,320
I actually think both you and I have been fairly good at keeping up with the way that

338
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,840
the internet wind is blowing.

339
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,960
But when you have been in this for a while and it keeps happening, there's just an inevitable

340
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,640
exhaustion that comes along with it.

341
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,680
Then you think to yourself, like at least I do, I think, God, I really just want something

342
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:33,880
that I could essentially put on autopilot and do for the next 40 years.

343
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
That's what I want.

344
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,000
I want a job I could just and one that doesn't kill me health wise.

345
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,880
Like I've realized I've really got to start making some improvements in that regard.

346
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,840
From the holidays until just about last week, I think I was having like some real high blood

347
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,280
pressure days, some really bad migraines and hypertension issues.

348
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,400
I was really pushing the health stuff too far.

349
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,520
I had to dial it back a little bit.

350
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,800
I have to keep rethinking that all the time.

351
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,000
These inevitable changes in the business, they don't make things easier, they make it

352
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
more stressful.

353
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,640
They make it harder and harder to just have a... A lifestyle business feels like the

354
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:20,640
wrong connotation because I do work hard, but I'd like not to have to work hard every

355
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,320
day all the time.

356
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,320
I feel like maybe I'm not exactly on the same wavelength, but I just went through a pretty

357
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,680
dramatic shift personally and with the business, with TMB.

358
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:40,240
Now just things, I feel like the rate of... I can't see a change, because it's not like

359
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,880
there's a new iPhone style event.

360
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,040
Although again, if you're young, check out, seriously, the metaverse, although I hate

361
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
that term.

362
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
I would say VR.

363
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:57,120
Although I'm more interested in AR practically, but just the rapid consolidation in basically

364
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,840
everything makes the problems almost like the technical stuff, like, oh, should I do

365
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,080
this in Mac or Windows or Pop or some other Linux?

366
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,880
Or is this, oh, if I try to do this and enter this vertical, who is going to put their boot

367
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
on my throat?

368
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Yeah.

369
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Who's the gatekeeper?

370
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
The platform?

371
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Yeah.

372
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Who's the heavy?

373
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Yeah.

374
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,800
We've done a good job of taking the internet and really centralizing it super well.

375
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,440
I watched... Forgive me, I don't recall, but there was a PBS documentary, it was made

376
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,960
by the people who made Triumph of the Nerds with Bob Cringley.

377
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Remember that one?

378
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,520
Yeah, I remember that.

379
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,560
He did another one about the internet, or not him, but the same producers.

380
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,800
Just the utopianism, right?

381
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,600
Everybody you can have a business... The mom will be working when the kids are at school

382
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
and she'll run a little shop.

383
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
It's like Etsy.

384
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Everybody's Etsy, effectively.

385
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,200
But damn, the centralization, it's just like... It's so funny.

386
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,080
No one predicted Facebook back then.

387
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,000
Not that I hate Facebook.

388
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I hate Facebook.

389
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,640
I don't know, like Apple is once again in court, right?

390
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,880
That lady who's suing Apple just got slapped by the court.

391
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,760
She had to pull down all the documents she shared.

392
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,800
Well, all right.

393
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,480
So let's talk about building something, because-

394
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
Positivity.

395
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
You gotta try.

396
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,960
Like, you can't stop trying, and a lot of times I think what we discover is in times

397
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,640
where it just seems like there's total chaos, some of us eventually figure out the signal

398
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,360
from the noise, and you start building, and when things turn around, you're hopefully

399
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,160
in the right position to ride that wave.

400
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:45,880
So Steve asks, really, how do I build something today that I'm involved with today but I know

401
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,560
I will not be involved with shortly down the road?

402
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,720
I'm the VP of my kids' high school band parent association, and we've decided we're gonna

403
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
create a website.

404
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,200
He says, of course, I headed over to Linode and made an account, got that $100 credit

405
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,880
at linode.com slash coder, I made a WordPress server.

406
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,160
I had it running within five minutes.

407
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
That's great.

408
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,140
Got the DNS SSL going 10 minutes after that.

409
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,720
But after a week of doing different mockups for the other board members, I started to

410
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,760
think to myself in three years when my kid graduates, I'm not gonna need to run this

411
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,760
anymore.

412
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,240
I'm probably gonna hand it off to somebody who uses password 123.

413
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,000
So it started getting me thinking, how should I set this up in a way where I can hand it

414
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,040
off to somebody who might not be an expert?

415
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,480
Should I go with some sort of fully built hosting service, document everything?

416
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
What do you guys think?

417
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,200
Also, by the way, Egon is amazing.

418
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,520
He is instantly my hero.

419
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
There you go, Egon.

420
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,080
You got a fan club now.

421
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,360
I don't understand what's happening.

422
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,480
He's got more fans than we do.

423
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,600
Egon, bastard.

424
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,080
Kind of riffing on Chris's complete nihilism here.

425
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,480
It's not your problem.

426
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,720
If you're handing a system over to somebody who's gonna also have complete control of

427
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,160
the system, there are many more ways for them to screw that up than having password 123.

428
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,320
Brandon, that's a pretty, you can't, right?

429
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
You can't see the future.

430
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,960
You can't protect against everything.

431
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,320
Hell, I'm right now using add-in for IRC.

432
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,960
Do you know why?

433
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,560
Because all the other ones are crappy, the new ones are crappy electron apps.

434
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
It's true.

435
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
You cannot account for Luddite.

436
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
I see what you did there.

437
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
I like it.

438
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
No, but I don't know, Chris.

439
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,680
All right, what would you tell him to do?

440
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,580
I think he is thinking about the right things.

441
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,880
What I suspect he needs to do is just be really clear up front.

442
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,000
Here is your options, and these are the risk trade-offs, and one of the risks of the go

443
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
set up WordPress on Linode would be in three years when I move on, you're gonna need to

444
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,100
find somebody else who knows how to operate this system.

445
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,720
With that kind of a heads up, that does not seem like an impossible goal to me at all.

446
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,040
You do have things on the other end of the spectrum, like your Squarespace is out there

447
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,660
where they essentially will maintain all the backend tech.

448
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,680
That's my value proposition where I see a thing like Squarespace or Tumblr is if you

449
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,280
want a webpage that somebody can just set up and then forget about for five years, it'll

450
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,440
do that for you.

451
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,120
You won't have to touch it, but I think you and I probably both know there's disadvantages

452
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,920
to that as well.

453
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,880
I would just say communicate first.

454
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,840
Build something, and then really all you need is a document, a Google Doc that they have

455
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,200
the URL to or something that just documents these things, store the username and password

456
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,680
somewhere on their site so they have it, and tell them to refer to that envelope.

457
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,640
You've done your due diligence, and you've also, I think, gone above and beyond at that

458
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,640
point.

459
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,740
That's how you build it to handoff, and document it early.

460
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,920
Don't wait.

461
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Do it while it's fresh.

462
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
I like it.

463
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
Very reasonable.

464
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Thank you.

465
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:40,600
Well, also in the good news side of things, we have an East Coast Meetup.

466
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
That's right.

467
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,240
We are finally doing a East Coast Jupiter Broadcasting Meetup on April 9th, 2022 in

468
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,080
Raleigh, North Carolina.

469
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,280
We have details at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

470
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,680
About 30-ish people are going so far.

471
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,320
Starts at 3 p.m. Eastern at a park, and across the street, there's Prime Barbecue, and on

472
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,660
the other side of the park, there's a brewery as well, so we figured we'd hang out at the

473
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,660
park.

474
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,660
Barbecue.

475
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,660
Now, what do you think?

476
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,280
I know this is in your neck of the woods, but it's going to be tricky, you know?

477
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,080
I'm going to say it now.

478
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,960
If I can get childcare, which is extremely likely, I'll be there.

479
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,560
I'm looking forward to that.

480
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,480
We could have ourselves quite the J.B. reunion, because it sounds like there's a good chance

481
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
you're going to make it.

482
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,920
I think there's a good chance Westpain is going to make it.

483
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,920
There's a good chance that, well, I know I'm going to make it.

484
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,380
I know that Alex from Self-Hosted is going to make it, Brent from Linux Unplugged and

485
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,780
Brunch is going to be there.

486
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,480
My wife, Adia, will be there.

487
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,600
So that's just, you know, so far.

488
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,880
So we're getting quite the party.

489
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
Can I bring swag?

490
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
Oh, yeah.

491
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
Of course.

492
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,520
Now, can I run a little contest?

493
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,200
Chris does not know I was going to say this beforehand.

494
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,120
I have one question.

495
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,280
What is the best version of BSD?

496
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,480
And there's only one correct answer.

497
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,200
Do I have a guess or do you want people to tell you at the meetup?

498
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Guess.

499
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
You can guess.

500
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,440
Well, then it has to be the one and true free BSD, because that's the one Alan...

501
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Incorrect.

502
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Snow Leopard.

503
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
Of course.

504
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Of course.

505
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,680
How did I, how did I not know that?

506
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Of course.

507
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,080
First of all, barbecue and brews.

508
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,640
You know, Chris, this was like a mic trap.

509
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,480
He's never been able to get me to go anywhere.

510
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,560
He's like, I will locate it between the bar and the barbecue place.

511
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,860
No matter which advice he wants to hit, he has to cross us.

512
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
He has to.

513
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,120
There's no way around it.

514
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
It is the perfect trap.

515
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,780
Although, you know, we're probably going to wreck the show because it feels like if we

516
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,120
haven't met this far into the show, if we meet now, it's going to make things weird.

517
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,900
Well, I used to watch you in your, in your youth days on the video, the old...

518
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,160
Back when I was handsome.

519
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,400
Listen, I've heard stuff.

520
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,240
Apparently you're quite the silver Fox these days.

521
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,040
Let's not, let's not get wild with ourselves.

522
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Tell me, tell me.

523
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,320
Now this is North Carolina and you know this.

524
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,360
I love me some nice Carolina barbecue.

525
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
Have we looked into this place?

526
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
So I, it's funny.

527
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,760
I think it might be Texas style, but I'm not sure.

528
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Son of a bitch.

529
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,780
But the, the ratings are good.

530
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,600
The ratings and reviews are really good.

531
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,080
I will prepare my lower intestines.

532
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Yeah.

533
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,120
See, I love barbecue, but you got to plan for it.

534
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,440
You know, what I do is, uh, I kind of like go easy.

535
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,960
You have a barbecue safety plan?

536
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Yeah.

537
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Yeah.

538
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Well, it's just a regime.

539
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
It's a regime.

540
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,240
Like if I'm going to go somewhere special and I want to eat, I'll just kind of, I'll

541
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,960
go light for a couple of days.

542
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,100
I'll super hydrate.

543
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,640
You got to super hydrate.

544
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,720
And then I'll go into the barbecue place strategically.

545
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,200
I go, I go light on the really processed meats, you know, your sausages, your links, that

546
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,560
kind of stuff.

547
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,680
And I'll go more so on their specialties because it's a more of a rare thing and they're generally,

548
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
I find easier on my system.

549
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,360
And then, uh, I also kind of try to not do much on like the Mac and cheese, but I got

550
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,880
to have a little bit of Mac and cheese and beans.

551
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,200
And of course, if they got the corn and they got the cornbread and they got the butter

552
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,520
and the honey, I got to get that with some root beer.

553
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,640
I got to try that too.

554
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,240
And if they got the slaw, I'm going to get the slaw.

555
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,280
They got a couple of sauces.

556
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,840
I got to try a couple of, oh man, I'm getting excited.

557
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,480
The sauces is what kills me because I'm like, oh, I got to try this.

558
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,320
I mean, I just run around like a maniac.

559
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,160
I am getting excited about this.

560
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,900
And you know, Alex has got a spot where we could go back.

561
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,800
We could do some recording if time allowed, you know, if, I mean, if we got you, me and

562
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,040
Wes in a room, we could probably do some podcasts.

563
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,480
Maybe that's, maybe that's when we do our coderly.

564
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,800
Maybe we do like a coderly special while we're there.

565
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Something like that.

566
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,600
Anyways, if you want to join us April 9th, 3 PM in Raleigh, North Carolina, join the

567
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,740
meetup page so we can tell the restaurant about how many we expect meetup.com slash

568
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,280
Jupiter broadcasting, and of course you should come because cold hands, Josh will be there.

569
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,360
You can shake his cold hands, keep him, keep him warm.

570
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
That's exciting.

571
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,400
Do we know how roughly large his hands are?

572
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
I could bring him mittens.

573
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,080
You know, I think he's good now.

574
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
He's good.

575
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
I think he's healed up.

576
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,160
Well, he's got a suite of suggestions from the audience that took care of him.

577
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
He's got a whole suite.

578
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,080
So, but yeah, come shake his cold hands.

579
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,400
Maybe Egon will be there.

580
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,040
People that, you know, are famous.

581
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,280
Linode.com slash coder, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and go there

582
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
to support the show.

583
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,160
It lets them know you appreciate them sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

584
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,040
It's the cycle of podcast life after all.

585
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,340
And Linode is such a great product to be right here on the Coder Radio program because this

586
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,320
is the developer's cloud.

587
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,920
This is where I genuinely think you should build your next project.

588
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,400
You can run the infrastructure for your business or your personal project with Linode.

589
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,440
They have 40 gigabit connections coming into those hypervisors.

590
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,160
They've got 11 data centers around the world.

591
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,040
They just recently rolled out MVME PCI storage for some of their rigs.

592
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,260
So you can just get incredible IOPS per gigabyte.

593
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,940
It's one of those constantly improving services.

594
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,440
And that's why it's easy to recommend it for you.

595
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,640
And just recently, a brand new thing has arrived.

596
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,360
You can now join the Linode Managed Database beta.

597
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,520
They're rolling out managed database support, the perfect combination of industry standard

598
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:10,560
software like MySQL, backed by Linode's team on their infrastructure.

599
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,840
You can sign up right now for early access.

600
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,800
You can help influence the product's direction and give them some feedback.

601
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,160
This is going to be a big service.

602
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,560
This is big business.

603
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,720
And it makes running a database simple and straightforward.

604
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,540
You don't have to be some sort of DBA to now have the power and scalability of a database

605
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,300
backed by Linode.

606
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,520
They're working on that kind of stuff all the time.

607
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,320
They've been doing this for 19 years, constantly improving, making things better and better.

608
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,400
And with 11 data centers around the world, you know you're going to find something close

609
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,740
to you or close to your customers.

610
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,440
Over the years, I think I've appreciated now their object storage and their UI and the

611
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,040
way their dashboard works and the way their API works more than just about anything else.

612
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,040
But what I hear from the audience all the time is how great the support is.

613
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,560
Someone ends up in a jam and Linode's 24-7 customer support by phone or by ticket, along

614
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,720
with hundreds of guides and tutorials, helps them get things figured out.

615
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,840
That really matters when it comes down to it.

616
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,080
And with pricing 30% to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers, well, you can make

617
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,920
an economic argument too.

618
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,720
So I've got the performance reasons, I've got the support reasons, I've got the pricing

619
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,240
reasons, and it's an opportunity to support the show, learn, and try something.

620
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,200
That's pretty good combo.

621
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,960
Now you see why I love having them as a sponsor and think you should check it out.

622
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,760
So go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 for 60 days on a new account and support

623
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
the show.

624
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,080
Go to linode.com slash coder.

625
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,400
Holy crap, NVIDIA and Samsung have had a bad week.

626
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:45,920
I guess the same hacker group, Lapisus or something to that effect, has targeted Samsung

627
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,120
and NVIDIA.

628
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,240
They're leaking data for both of them.

629
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,720
They're trying to get NVIDIA to open source their driver, threatening to release core

630
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,680
information about their cards if they don't.

631
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:03,080
They've put out data for Samsung's bootloader on newer Samsung Galaxy phones, including

632
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,200
stuff for some of their encryption and access control information and activation servers,

633
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:14,000
and data on maybe source code on how they authorize and authenticate Samsung accounts,

634
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,400
APIs, and other user-facing services.

635
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,460
I mean, huge leak.

636
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,880
This happened on Friday over the weekend, so I didn't get to go through it very much.

637
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,540
The NVIDIA leak, so far 19 gigs of data has been released by this group.

638
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:33,480
They kind of became famous in late 2021 for targeting Brazil's Ministry of Health.

639
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,320
And it's 190 gigs of data they've released for Samsung, which is 10 times bigger than

640
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,440
the NVIDIA one.

641
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,680
It's a massive two leaks in the same amount of weeks.

642
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,160
You know, I took this and I know, you know, whatever big companies, but I feel a lot of

643
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,880
sympathy for the IT folks working at these companies that have to deal with this shit

644
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
now.

645
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
Oh, man.

646
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
Yeah, the IT folks.

647
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
Oh, yeah.

648
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
When you think about that.

649
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
Look, this is a nightmare.

650
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
I don't even know.

651
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,800
Yeah, I don't like this kind of thing.

652
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
I think it's bad.

653
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Yeah.

654
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,440
I mean, I don't think this should be going on.

655
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,360
I think if you want somebody to open source something, okay, we talk a lot about people

656
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,240
using Linux open source.

657
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,160
I've talked about my perspective on maybe open core needs to not be a dirty word, right?

658
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
Over and over again.

659
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:25,800
And that, you know, maybe people doing Linux development in the open on the server side

660
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,320
should be considered part of the community, even though it's not like the desktop.

661
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,360
And there are disagreements there that I think make sense, right?

662
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,520
I'm pretty sure other hosts in the network strongly disagree with that.

663
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:41,960
I would say that I'm pretty sure I could speak for all of us when I say that hacking someone

664
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,360
to make them open source something is just not gonna work, right?

665
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,600
Not a good look, huh?

666
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,080
It's also going to upset them and probably make them be even more protective, more closer.

667
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,340
In a statement, they say, quote, we request that NVIDIA commits to completely open source

668
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:02,500
their graphics processing unit drivers, which is never going to happen.

669
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Not now.

670
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
Are you kidding me?

671
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
I don't know, Chris.

672
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:10,320
If somebody like punched you in the face and was like, no more M1 Mac for you, I'm pretty

673
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,280
sure you'd go buy the M1 Mac mini.

674
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,000
That's almost certainly going to be announced tomorrow.

675
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah.

676
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That's what I did there.

677
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,920
Yeah, I did see that the group said that if NVIDIA does not comply, they will release

678
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,920
the complete silicon graphics and computer chipset files for all recent NVIDIA graphics

679
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
processing units.

680
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Direct quote.

681
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,200
Well, then I hope you were in Russia, because if you're American, you're going to Leavenworth.

682
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,920
I don't even know what to say, like, what's with you in Leavenworth?

683
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
It's a great town.

684
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,880
I'm real worried about going to Leavenworth.

685
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
What are these days, man?

686
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,080
What are these days?

687
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
Coder from Leavenworth.

688
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,560
You know, old time listeners know that Dick Cheney used to guest star on the show.

689
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,100
He's not particularly happy with me right now, so.

690
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,040
This to me feels almost like they must know this.

691
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,600
There's another motivation here.

692
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
It's almost like a publicity stunt.

693
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,280
Like when I say publicity stunt, I mean, they are clearly very skilled, and they're getting

694
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,080
a lot of notoriety for this.

695
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,440
I don't know how they monetize that, but that could be a goal here just to kind of get attention

696
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
for that.

697
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,440
And this is a cause that they can kind of attach to, or, you know, this is something

698
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,480
they really think that we're a method they can affect change.

699
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,120
And I think both of you and I are of the opinion that that's ludicrous.

700
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,680
Like these U.S. companies are just going to get more defensive as a result.

701
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,960
I just can't even imagine this ever happening, as much as I would love to see it.

702
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,760
I mean, part of me is like, well, just do it.

703
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
Just do it.

704
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,840
No, it's the methodology that bothers me too, because, you know, you and I both know this

705
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
very well.

706
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,200
I won't mention that show that we don't like to talk about, but I love Unfilter, sorry.

707
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,960
There is an entire, like, wing of industry and of Congress that is all about FUD around

708
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
technology, right?

709
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,120
It's always, oh, you can't buy this printer because the Chinese are going to hack your

710
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,520
kids' photos or stupid lease agreement that you're printing.

711
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,720
Don't buy this from this company.

712
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Yeah.

713
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Yeah, sure.

714
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
That happens all the time.

715
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
This is a legitimate problem.

716
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:10,400
I don't know if I was a congressman from, let's say, Florida or a senator, the person

717
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,160
I'm thinking of.

718
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:22,000
I would be talking about this because this is my whole anti, you know, open software,

719
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,640
open international cooperation, right?

720
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,920
Because when you talk about open source, you're really, you know, when you're not talking

721
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,820
about like Billy Bob or Mike's open source project, you're talking international cooperation

722
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,200
by the community, right?

723
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,000
By the regular people, not, you know, defense to defense or industry to industry, right?

724
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,440
The scale of NVIDIA going full open source would change the industry forever.

725
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,040
It probably wouldn't be good for NVIDIA at this juncture because they're winning, right?

726
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,560
You know, Netscape was the big open source community win.

727
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,960
I can't believe we're going to talk about Revolution OS here, but we are.

728
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,100
So watch the documentary Revolution OS and it's definitely a product of its time.

729
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,520
But the key takeaway from that that I'd like you to get is that Netscape went open source

730
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:15,720
not from engineer activism, it's the bottom, but from top down, the top of the company,

731
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,720
using it as a strategic moat against Microsoft, right?

732
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,960
As a way to try to defend themselves from IE.

733
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,480
Our younger listeners have no idea what the hell I'm talking about.

734
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,400
Chris, can we just briefly give them a history of the browser war?

735
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:37,400
There was once a great browser with a big N. Yeah, and it had flying stars every time

736
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
the page would load.

737
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,840
Netscape offered really the first usable consumer browser.

738
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,560
There was things like Mosaic and other browsers that you could browse the web with, but Netscape

739
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,160
came along and offered something that was truly a leap forward and it took Microsoft

740
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,400
years to catch up with Internet Explorer.

741
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,280
And as Microsoft got closer and started bundling Internet Explorer into Windows, Netscape realized

742
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,220
they needed to make some sort of change.

743
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:06,000
They could no longer charge for Netscape, which before had been a paid product.

744
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Airware was a big deal back then, and they would have to pivot to open source.

745
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,800
And Netscape wasn't just a browser, it was a whole suite of software back then, and so

746
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,360
it was a revolutionary change.

747
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:22,320
And as we now know, Microsoft caught up around Internet Explorer time, four, and by five

748
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,320
they were starting to dominate, and by six they'd completely taken off.

749
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,820
During that time, Netscape faded, and from the ashes of Netscape, Firefox rose as like

750
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,360
the phoenix that came from the ashes of Netscape.

751
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:42,160
And so Mozilla and Firefox's legacy ties back to that Netscape browser from the 90s.

752
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,080
I mean, that's it, right?

753
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
That's right.

754
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,200
But long gone now, right?

755
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,440
And now Firefox isn't in great shape either as time goes on.

756
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:56,880
And like the strategy there was we got to do something because this 10,000 pound gorilla

757
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
is coming for us.

758
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,720
It wasn't like a, what you're saying, and I agree with, is it wasn't this grassroots

759
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,080
let's give something back to humanity, let's make something common code of the people so

760
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,580
everyone can rise.

761
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:15,320
It was, oh, we've got to save ourselves from this gorilla.

762
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:20,040
It wasn't like a, it wasn't so much a charity as it was an act of desperation.

763
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,400
It was a strategic choice by a very, very pro-capitalist business exec.

764
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Right.

765
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Yeah.

766
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,960
I mean, the reason I keep going back into all this ancient history about Saturn and

767
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,280
about Sun Microsystems, got to get them in every week.

768
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
Nicely done.

769
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Thank you.

770
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,120
And Netscape is in a lot of ways what we're seeing now with the giant tech titans, I don't

771
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:46,360
know how we end here every week, but I feel like we have no choice, is basically the dream

772
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:53,760
of I'll roughly call it the 90s tech world, right, failed, right?

773
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,160
It never happened.

774
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:02,240
It became these giant platforms that effectively are walled gardens.

775
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:09,880
It's hard if you weren't there, but I think predicting where we are from where we were

776
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,760
is very hard and I don't think you would be happy, right?

777
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,320
If you teleported 1996, Chris, into now, yeah, the new gadgets are cool and iPhones are great

778
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:29,000
and whatever, but the promise of the open internet has effectively, I think, been basically

779
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,840
the value has been gated off, right?

780
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,920
The value has been corralled.

781
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,920
That's bad.

782
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
Yeah.

783
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,400
I wonder if it isn't sort of, there is layers of ecosystems that are essentially built on

784
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,260
TCP IP and HTTP is one of them.

785
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,800
The app stores, that's one of them.

786
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,440
Bitcoin is one of them, like there's all these different layers and they all sort of inevitably

787
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:02,320
have this creep towards centralization and it just seems to be that centralization offers

788
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:09,360
efficiencies at scale that are so attractive we inevitably end up there.

789
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,600
Oh, and it offers the best return on venture capital.

790
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Sure.

791
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,920
And control, right, that's what you mean because then they own it, it's theirs, they spent

792
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,240
their money and they have control over it.

793
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,040
Now the interesting thing there is when something like this becomes the reality, the norm, like

794
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:31,880
it is today, then when we go to war, the dynamics of how that war is fought now are so different

795
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,520
than anything we have ever seen.

796
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,360
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

797

Go there and receive a free Datadog t-shirt and try out Datadog two weeks for free.

798
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,520
That's right, Datadog is a software as a service monitoring and security platform.

799
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,460
It enables full stack observability for developers, IT operations, security and business teams

800
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,240
in the cloud age.

801
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,640
Datadog's platform, along with 500 plus vendor backed integrations, allows you to correlate

802
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:05,920
your metrics, your traces, your logs, security signals, infrastructure data, your applications,

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,480
third party service information, all in a single pane of glass.

804
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,080
Are you getting how powerful this is?

805
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,680
And they're beautiful too.

806
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,480
The dashboards are beautiful.

807
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,040
These capabilities combined with these drag and drop, beautiful dashboards, I mean bootiful,

808
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,240
and Datadog's machine learning based alerts, well that's going to help your team troubleshoot,

809
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,360
it's going to help you collaborate more effectively, it's going to prevent downtime, it's going

810
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,640
to enhance performance, reliability, and generally improve communications.

811
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,320
Check all those boxes, it's a powerful platform.

812
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,680

That's pretty nice.

817
00:41:52,040 --> 00:42:00,400
I'd say like a solid 38 to maybe even 40% of my wardrobe, quote unquote wardrobe, is

818
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,580
swag.

819
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,360
And that has taken a hit these last couple of years.

820
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,840

Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

824
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,560
So Russia is looking to legalize software piracy.

825
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,160
The business news, which is like their Wall Street Journal or Financial Times over there,

826
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,760
is reporting that in the backdrop of sanctions that are gaining momentum, Russian authorities

827
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,680
are urgently preparing support measures along which are being discussed, the suspension

828
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,140
of criminal and administrative liability for the use of pirated software from countries

829
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,140
that support sanctions.

830
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,240
And the way they're going to do this is they're going to essentially declare, for national

831
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:52,780
emergency purposes, a standard nationwide software license.

832
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:57,420
And in this software license, they're going to make this essentially permissible.

833
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:04,800
So they're going to license software piracy by any company that's participating in these

834
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,720
sanctions, which is remarkable because most Western tech companies are at this point.

835
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,160
Microsoft probably being the one that's going to affect them, followed by IBM and Oracle

836
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,160
the most because they do run Windows in the Russian government.

837
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,840
And you know, when I think about this, the other thing that they're responding to, Mike,

838
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:26,700
is this gets really tricky in the world of Office 365 subscriptions and software as a

839
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,400
service when all of a sudden you just get turned off.

840
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,680
Like they have to scramble.

841
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,680
Yeah.

842
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,680
It's Russia, though.

843
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,000
They'll find a way around that.

844
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,600
And by the way, I want to say Privyet, Sukhi.

845
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,960
You little Sukhi have been stealing every app I've ever made.

846
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,760
It's really not that new to them.

847
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,760
I'm like, what?

848
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,760
This is new?

849
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,480
I think they're legalizing something that has been probably practiced a lot.

850
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,960
I don't want to like besmirch all Russians, but many software developers I've talked

851
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,800
to have said that like the number one source of piracy for their software is Russia.

852
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
Yeah.

853
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:03,400
But still, fascinating for a nation just to say, as a nation, we're going to legalize

854
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,400
software piracy.

855
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,400
I'm sort of amazed that Putin is running Windows.

856
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,520
There's that picture.

857
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,520
I know, right?

858
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,440
Although it is Windows 7, apparently.

859
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
Yeah.

860
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,120
They've been trying to drop the habit for a while, but they just haven't.

861
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,120
Which says a lot about Microsoft's strategy, right?

862
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,660
That it definitely is good to sell people things they can't quit.

863
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:30,360
As a software developer, I believe that people should pay me for my work and my fellow developers.

864
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,240
Maybe just this last month, I think in February, we did the lament for all the dead indie Mac

865
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,240
developers.

866
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,840
I don't think we need to go into that again, but if the little companies could have grown

867
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:45,400
into middle-sized companies and survived and thrived, you wouldn't have this monopoly

868
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,000
problem quite as bad, right?

869
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,800
This kind of like a Titans against the rest of the world.

870
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,800
Yeah.

871
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,920
I almost wonder if the fragmentation you see in the Linux community has been a good thing

872
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
in this regard.

873
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,960
There's not one centralized authority that can turn your access off to open source and

874
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,720
free software desktops.

875
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:07,520
I fantasize one day, a decade, when El Salvador has had time to continue to grow and improve,

876
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,640
maybe going down there and spending six months out of the year or three months out of the

877
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,040
year living and working out of El Salvador, or someplace where life is a little slower

878
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,440
and I can spend Bitcoin.

879
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,800
I think to myself, well, how would I feel if I was there and one day they started getting

880
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,960
some of these sanctions like this?

881
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,520
I try to remove myself from the present day and think, where do we take this?

882
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,420
Now that this is a thing, where does this stop now?

883
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,660
If and when we start having an issue with China, will the Western tech companies respond

884
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,160
as strongly in shutting China out?

885
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,160
I suspect they won't.

886
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,940
I think it's going to be an interesting, weird standard that these tech companies are going

887
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,960
to have to apply now.

888
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,440
I would even argue it's very strange that these companies are effectively acting as

889
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,440
nation-states.

890
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,640
They're essentially just applying sanctions of their own.

891
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,720
I suppose nobody wants to be seen as earning money from Russia.

892
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,160
That's got to be a part of it.

893
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,140
But also, you're not earning that much money in Russia.

894
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,800
That's such a great point.

895
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,000
It's easy for them to make this move today because Netflix just made a big deal out of

896
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
it, but Netflix doesn't even have a million subscribers in Russia, and they're doing it

897
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,840
through a third-party company as well.

898
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,400
It's like, yeah, it really wasn't a big deal for them to pull out of Russia.

899
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,480
To be clear, I don't think either of us condone any kind of invasion or any sort of shit like

900
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,480
that.

901
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,040
Oh, no, of course not.

902
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,240
This is what the centralization, though, that we talk about all the time does enable.

903
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,680
Besides just from control over the market, besides just putting a boot on developers'

904
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:55,140
face, besides setting the price for what software should be, they also have this ability now.

905
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:59,760
If Google shuts them off, that's a massive loss for the people.

906
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,860
And probably only really, in my personal opinion, strengthens the regime's control.

907
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:10,120
And I think we should be careful to say that when you have said it, we have nothing against

908
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,120
Russians.

909
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,200
I don't know what to say on all this stuff.

910
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,400
I feel like there's a lot of virtue signaling going on.

911
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:23,740
I wish the internet was being used to humanize each other more and bring us closer together

912
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,640
and realize that we have more in common than we have different.

913
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:34,680
But instead, what we're seeing play out here is we are splitting the internet up.

914
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,840
We're creating different internets.

915
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,720
We're creating three internets effectively, right?

916
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:46,800
The Eastern European Russian one and the Chinese one and roughly the American Anglo.

917
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,580
And we're using it to drive a wedge between each other and get even further apart, which

918
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,900
is incredible because the technology could be used for exactly the opposite.

919
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,960
But the way things have played out, that's just not how we're using it.

920
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,760
And I just have no other comment other than this is just what we're seeing play out.

921
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,580
These are the times in which we live.

922
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,520
And I do think these things swing.

923
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,280
The Web3 guys, they get a hard time for being pie in the sky.

924
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,280
But...

925
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,460
Oh, from me, right?

926
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,800
But what is like their number one mantra is decentralized.

927
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,640
They I can't say that they make sense, but they're starting to seem a little less crazy

928
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,640
to me.

929
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,760
Yeah, I'm still like, I don't think everything needs a token.

930
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,920
But I do like the idea of decentralized services, decentralized identity, decentralized data,

931
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,480
that kind of stuff I think I'm getting more and more into.

932
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,480
So maybe they're onto something.

933
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,320
Maybe eventually we'll shape out into something.

934
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:46,280
You know, it's not to tie it into another podcast, but do you listen?

935
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,880
I'm sure you do the Verge cast, right, the Verges?

936
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,360
I have, not regularly, but I definitely have.

937
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,360
I listen regularly.

938
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:57,120
And one of their kind of chief writers there, Dieter Bohn, he actually moved on to Google.

939
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,800
So they did like a farewell interview with him.

940
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,900
It's interesting because they brought Walt Mossberg back for this.

941
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,960
You should listen to it because I know you like Walt.

942
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,960
Sure.

943
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,280
And Walt and him have been having this multi-year argument about the open web, which is Dieter's

944
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,840
kind of position.

945
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:18,320
And Walt, you know, was a very, I wouldn't call him an Apple fanboy, but-

946
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,040
But he's basically apps have killed the open internet position, right?

947
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,040
No, Walt is pro-app.

948
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,040
Yeah, right.

949
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,680
Security, blah, blah, blah.

950
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,280
And at the very end, Walt says, I think, you know, with everything going on, you may have

951
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,280
had a point.

952
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,280
Really?

953
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,980
And I'm starting to feel the same way about the hippies that I get irritated with on Telegram

954
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,080
and don't log in for three months.

955
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:44,880
You all may have a point that when you have centralized app stores, you effectively have

956
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:52,760
a centralized control system and a kill switch, which I'm not sure we want that.

957
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,800
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

958
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,480
I think that's why somebody as repugnant as Richard Stallman got so much traction for

959
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,960
so long, why he was given so much runway, because he did make some solid core arguments.

960
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,500
The problem is the messenger botched it.

961
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,960
The messenger was also kind of a dickhead, right?

962
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,960
I'm just saying.

963
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,960
Yeah.

964
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,960
Well, that's what I mean.

965
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,960
They botched it.

966
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,280
The free software movement.

967
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,660
It's like it needed Richard Stallman and then it needed to split away from Richard Stallman

968
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,660
a long time ago.

969
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:31,880
You and I both know somebody who also is very much in line with him that lets his personal

970
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:40,400
issues get in the way of what I am now coming to believe is a kind of correct message.

971
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,880
It's very anti a lot of what I've been doing, but I kind of, you know, it doesn't sort of

972
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:52,800
make sense that somebody who is wired to have an extreme personality is also wired to maybe

973
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,920
see things that everybody else isn't really seeing.

974
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,480
Like, you can kind of understand why some of these people are ahead of the curve on

975
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,480
this.

976
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,480
Oh, it makes complete sense.

977
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,440
I'm thinking about the few individuals that I think we both have in mind.

978
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,760
Yeah, obviously being kind of a contrarian, not really giving a crap if people don't like

979
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,760
you, right?

980
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:20,640
Like if you almost relishing in it, in the one case, I yeah, not the best business choice,

981
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,040
but it's certainly a thing you could do.

982
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
Yeah.

983
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,040
It's definitely not the best business choice.

984
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,680
You know, I'm sitting here in front of an iMac pro because reasons.

985
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,680
More and more.

986
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:38,240
I'm just less and less comfortable with proprietary platforms, especially as we go into things

987
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,240
like VR.

988
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,600
Yeah, I'm really worried about that.

989
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:48,780
The resources, the ecosystem, it feels like the domain of big tech because it is so it

990
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:53,760
lends itself to the app store model and it lends itself to a content ecosystem where

991
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,360
you can pop into a room and watch an episode of Star Trek on demand, right?

992
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,880
So that stuff needs deals.

993
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,420
There's no like open ecosystem for that kind of thing as far as I know.

994
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:09,320
So I worry, I worry a lot about VR and my family this whole last weekend in the evening,

995
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:15,000
we sat down and I let each kid spend a little bit of time in VR and explore it and my youngest,

996
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,400
she loves the chill out, like go in the forest, plant trees, feed the animals games.

997
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,400
What game is that?

998
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,520
It's one of the Oculus ones.

999
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,720
It might even be pre-installed or if it's not, it's just like in one of their meditation

1000
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,720
areas.

1001
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,400
It's actually kind of nice.

1002
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,920
My middle child, she likes the Beat Saber type stuff and my oldest, he is a big fan

1003
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,200
of like the socialized metaverse, go in and talk to people.

1004
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:46,520
He went into Facebook's metaverse thing and they actually have it staffed.

1005
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:55,120
Facebook or Meta is paying people to staff their virtual like, you know, amusement park

1006
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,120
games.

1007
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,600
So you go in there and there is Meta employees that are explaining to you how to play the

1008
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:04,080
games and get you on the ride, like in a real amusement park.

1009
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,720
That's what they're spending their money on.

1010
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,200
It's incredible and I just, when you see that sort of stuff, I don't really see how free

1011
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:15,640
software and Linux is really going to compete or when you look at gaming like Microsoft

1012
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,520
with their Xbox streaming platform.

1013
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:24,120
And I know you noticed this week that they're like doing a whole flight simulator API system.

1014
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,560
I don't even know really what it does, but to me it seems like this is an obvious direction

1015
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:31,740
where they can take their technology, their cloud tech and make it available as like an

1016
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,320
API.

1017
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,960
So it's not a flight simulator system.

1018
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:43,120
They're using Azure to make Xbox cloud services available to other people, to other developers.

1019
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,800
The flight simulator is Microsoft flight simulator was their test case.

1020
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,840
So the way they're getting it to work on lower powered Xboxes is through the cloud, leveraging

1021
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,600
it off on cloud services.

1022
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,300
So again, you could see how you could take something like the Oculus Quest that maybe

1023
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,040
doesn't have enough horsepower if you want some decent battery life and you could supplement

1024
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,260
it with something like this.

1025
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:08,360
And again, I just don't see that being in the domain of a free software project.

1026
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,360
I don't know.

1027
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,360
We'll see.

1028
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,680
It's tricky for sure, but everyone in my family is a believer now.

1029
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,280
We're all on board.

1030
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,280
They all want one.

1031
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,480
I'm not getting them one.

1032
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,560
We're only going to have one VR headset in the family.

1033
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,920
That's one of the ways I'm just going to kind of tap the brakes on this thing.

1034
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,560
Yeah, the same here.

1035
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:32,360
I have barely used the Oculus other than the first couple of days early in the morning

1036
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:41,480
because the 14 year old is scary addicted to it.

1037
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,240
I think there's a whole set of problems that are going to come, not for us personally,

1038
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:50,240
but society as a whole from these more immersive experiences.

1039
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,720
Probably so far it's been positive for us.

1040
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,880
It really has.

1041
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,900
They move around more than when they're playing on their iPads.

1042
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,200
The socialization has been good.

1043
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,200
That aspect I was a little concerned about, but in small doses, it's been interesting

1044
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,200
and good.

1045
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,520
It's been fun to watch them be creative because you can cast the Oculus to your phone or to

1046
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:17,360
your computer, and it adds a little bit of extra load to the Oculus.

1047
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,400
I can see what they're seeing in a 2D version, which is fantastic for walking them through

1048
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,780
stuff.

1049
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,600
It's fun to watch them explore and play in there, but I do think it would be something

1050
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:31,440
that I would set rules around on total amount of time and stuff like that.

1051
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,440
It's all going to be interesting.

1052
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:39,600
I've been really thinking, when you look at the macroeconomic situation going on in the

1053
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:45,240
US, when you look at the conflicts going on in Ukraine and the long-term ramifications

1054
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:52,780
between Russia and China and all of what's going to come of this conflict, when you look

1055
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:57,280
at how the tech industry is changing, when you look at what's brewing in the cryptocurrency

1056
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,780
community and Bitcoin and you look at what's going on with VR, I can't help but feel like

1057
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:08,500
the ride to 2030 is going to be like nothing we've experienced so far.

1058
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:14,280
These last 40 years of my life were just like nothing compared to what we're about to go

1059
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,160
through in the next eight years or so.

1060
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,120
It's going to be wild.

1061
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,000
It's going to be a blur.

1062
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,120
We're going to be struggling to make sense of it every single day for a while.

1063
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,040
But tis the season.

1064
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,480
I guess we'll see how we do.

1065
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,920
So far, our track records have been pretty good on the calls, but we'll see how we do.

1066
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,960
That's why in a way, the meetup feels almost like life returning to normal.

1067
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,840
We're just going to get together and hang out and be at a park and eat barbecue and

1068
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,640
talk about stuff.

1069
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,920
That's weirdly normal all of a sudden.

1070
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,680
That's why I'm looking forward to that meetup big time.

1071
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,680
It's less than a month away.

1072
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,680
It sounds like a party.

1073
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,240
Well, then, just last but not least, I'll say thank you to our members, everybody who

1074
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,400
joined us at CoderQA.co.

1075
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,560
You are the heroes of this show and we'd love some more support.

1076
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:11,840
You get this show with limited ads to no ads, actually, and you also get the same production

1077
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,360
quality that Drew always puts into it, which is nice.

1078
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,820
You just get a slightly more compact version and you get our Coderly report, which comes

1079
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,760
out once a quarter.

1080
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,760
We appreciate that.

1081
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,000
If you want to support this show and all of the shows on the network, well, that's at

1082
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
jupiter.party.

1083
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,560
I stuck my hands out to celebrate all of the shows and I knocked over my pen because I

1084
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:36,280
was so excited about you supporting all the shows at jupiter.party.

1085
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,760
Anywhere you want to send folks?

1086
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,400
Alice.dev and at Dumanuco, D-O-M-I-C-C-U-O.

1087
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,640
I hope that that was wrong, but at Dumanuco on Twitter.

1088
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,080
Tell you what, I'll link it in the show notes.

1089
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,620
How about that?

1090
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:54,680
Don't tell my very dead uncle that I forgot how to spell our real last name.

1091
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,080
Thanks to what we talked about today, coder.show slash 456.

1092
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,800
You can join our matrix community.

1093
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,880
We've got some Coder Radio chats over there.

1094
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,880
Take the blue pill.

1095
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,880
Matrix is terrible.

1096
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,880
IRC for life.

1097
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,880
Yeah, that's probably true.

1098
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,880
That's probably true.

1099
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,480
It's a little rough, but it's colony.jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1100
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,760
That's colony.jupiterbroadcasting.com if you want to join us.

1101
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,760
We're live on Mondays.

1102
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,400
If you'd like to join us live and we love your feedback at coder.show slash contact.

1103
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,360
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode.

1104
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:30,960
See you right back here next week.
