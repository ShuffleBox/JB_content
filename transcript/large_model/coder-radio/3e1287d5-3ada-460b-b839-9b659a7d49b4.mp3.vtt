00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Coder Radio, episode 428 for August 23rd, 2021.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Hello, friend, and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
and the whole world of technology around software development.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
This episode, it's brought to you by Cloud Guru.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
You know, Cloud Guru has the cloud playground.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
That means Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
So go get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloudguru.com.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
My name is Chris, and joining me, like the podcast pro that he is,

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
it's our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Hello, Mr. Fischer.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
What's up?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Podcast time. Yes, here we are.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
I am excited to be in Colorado Springs.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
We went eight days off grid, no hookups, running off solar,

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
and so now it feels luxurious to be at a campground parked and plugged into power

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
and have air conditioning and stuff.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
It's like I'm fancy all of a sudden.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
However, it's like a downtown city here.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
This campground is so fricking crazy busy.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
So apologies if I've got weird sounds in the background

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
because there's a whole party going on around here.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Are you fired up about the podcast, though?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
You ready to go?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I've been looking forward to this.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I've been waiting for this one a long time.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah, well, I mean, I kind of have been the opposite.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
I've kind of been dreading it because the inbox this week, the inbox, Mike,

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
it was so bad.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
We got so many emails, but good.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
It was a good problem to have,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
and so we thought we should definitely try to get to some of these.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
And listener Chris, not me, but listener Chris was fired up about Crystal.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
He says, Hey, guys, I'm a little bit behind,

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
but I just listened to the Ruby and the Rough episode,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
and I have to plug Crystal at crystal-lang.org.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
They released version one not that long ago.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
It's written like Ruby, but compiled down and fast like C.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I've started to rewrite some of my Ruby in Crystal,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
and it's been a huge success.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Thanks for what you do.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
And sorry I haven't chilled Crystal before.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I'm just now catching up.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
OK, so I really I really didn't know what else to say other than I guess.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Thanks, listen to Chris for firing, firing an email about Crystal.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
It was totally off topic, but felt like we should include it at least.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Well, it's actually not that off topic.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
If you remember the dark days of the coding challenges,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
it was one of the languages that was and I used to torture each other.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Oh, yes, right.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
If I had done my homework, I would have been able to find the episode.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
But unfortunately, or fortunately, there's just a lot of code

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
or radio out there in the universe, and I could not find it.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
But it's there somewhere.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
We need some sort of system that goes through and indexes all of the speech,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
you know, like a does a transcription and then generates keywords.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Why is there not like a Google search of podcast content?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
They were playing around with it for a while,

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
and then they just sort of dropped it.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Really?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Because, you know, there's I wanted to reference something

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
for today's show from ATP, something John Siracusa said.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
And after like an hour and a half of trying to figure out where he said it

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
and which episode and thank God they use chapter markers,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I still could not find it because it turns out I was a year off in my luck.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
And I was like, I tell with this, I'm not I'm not doing this.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah, I there probably are a few other services out there.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
There's there's companies out there that are doing it to monitor when brands

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
are mentioned because it's a smaller problem scope, right?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
They can just monitor for Netflix.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Sure. Makes sense.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
So there's businesses around that. So I think it'll expand from there.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
All right. Well, Jim wants to know more about C++ deets from you.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
He says, you know, last week, Mike tossed out one of his classic throwaway

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
saying that he's running C++ on his back end.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
And well, are we just supposed to ignore this?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Please share as much as you're able.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
What mode of running? What libraries?

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
What inner motivation led you to make this choice?

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Are you running C++ and CGI and WebSockets?

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Dark Matter C++ developers are slowly steering their organizations away

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
from cute native apps. And I want to know what you're doing.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah. So so definitely not cute. Right. This is a server size stuff.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
I mean, very simple, very kind of pure ANSI C++ here.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Just CMake the ID.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Some of us are using C line.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
I'm using VS code because I've just drank that Kool-Aid like it was going out of style.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
The way we're using it is maybe less web servery than either I made it sound

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
or that you got the impression of. It's more we have Python.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
So the stack is like, OK, we have an application.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Most of it, the interaction, you know, the Webby stuff isn't flask for the most part.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
And anything performance in C++, it was going to be rust, interestingly enough.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
But finding external help for rust is way too hard and way too expensive right now.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
So we kind of fell back to C++.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
I have to say we are we have taken a I think a little bit of a weird approach.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
So one, because we control everything, this is our own thing.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
It's the newest standard C++ 20.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
So we're using all the fun little new bits, right?

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
The smart pointers, all that good stuff.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
We're also not using boost, which I think is important to mention.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
We're kind of doing things just as they are.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Standard library, everything else is kind of written ourselves.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I know that smacks of not invented here,

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
but there are reasons that I think probably over the next six months we'll talk about.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
But why for something like this where we want to control it full stack

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
and it really is full stack, meaning from server to hardware,

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
to not to not have that level of dependency.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
So that kind of segues into your other point.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Dependency management.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Other than like the standard stuff you would have in CMake,

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
we really don't have many dependencies.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
That may not be true forever.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
And, you know, I know I know there's options,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
but this is kind of where we need performance.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
And don't get me wrong where we can.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
We're doing everything in Python, but sometimes that's not applicable.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
I know there's ways to compile Python down.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I look at them. I get it.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
It's just a little too Voodoo for me.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
Easier to write a Linux C++ binary and has a call into it.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Right. Sure. Well, thank you for sharing that.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
Our next email is asking for us to consider Intel for a moment.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I didn't bring my tissues.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I know. Yeah. And your beard to pour one out.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
I need a 40. Yeah.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Jacob writes, Can you guys talk about Intel for a few minutes?

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm with Chris that Canoma is deploying solutions that widen the chasm with their audience.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
But if it was a contest, I would think Intel would be able to take the cake.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
I've never seen a company deploy more promises than actual products.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
While they will likely always stay relevant for a large audience.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
How do you see their future unfolding?

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
Do you think Apple's upcoming M1X or M2 processors will encourage a double digit shift from the x86 architecture?

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
Our thoughts on Intel, Mr. Dominic, what do you think about Intel's future and their products?

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Like I was thinking about our friends over at System 76.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
They tell me they're working on a laptop that they want to have out in a couple of years.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Right. And I thought to myself, God, it could be really awesome.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
You know, metal chassis.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Maybe it's milled from a block of aluminum runs.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Linux has replaceable parts.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
And then I thought, oh, but it's probably going to be an Intel chip or at least an x86 chip.

07:54.000 --> 08:01.000
And that may be a deal breaker for me because it kind of feels like buying a gas guzzler in an era of electric cars.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I mean, what's the time frame here?

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Is it like now or is it five to 10 years?

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
I mean, I think starting now, but the way Jacob defined it, it sounds like with the M1X or the M2,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
assuming there's some good performance gains there.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
I think it's and I know we get a lot of heat for this, but there's no way to, I think, you know,

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
objectively look at the situation and not say that the M1 class of processors from Apple isn't a leap forward,

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
which, you know, necessarily means Intel needs to catch up.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
I know my broader thoughts are Intel made a bet like five, 10 years ago that didn't pan out.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Right. And they got kind of hosed. They're not going to go away.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
They're a big company. They'll be fine. Can they catch up?

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Sure. Right. They could have the next good idea for processor technology.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Is it going to happen within the next, let's say, two, three years?

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
I don't think so. But keep in mind, Apple is not going to like license their processors out.

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
Now, you might be thinking, OK, a risk architecture like, you know, those type of processors and maybe IOT.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
That's true. That's a market that I don't think Intel competes in very well.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Right. You're with your IOT devices, your kind of automation factory kind of stuff.

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
You're probably running ARM. And I know Syfy, the company Chris Ladner went to from Tesla.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Chris Ladner, for those who don't know, is the guy who made Swift at Apple.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
That's what they do. Right. They do like bespoke RISC-V processors for IOT devices.

09:26.000 --> 09:35.000
That's also a competitor. I mean, on the desktop, I sort of feel like that's the market we all all us nerds care about quite a bit,

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
but kind of doesn't matter. I don't know. Also, those Ryzen chips are looking pretty good.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
And that's the wild card here, right? Is maybe AMD pulls it out.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
Maybe Intel with their ARC GPU and just really gets off their ass and actually manages to produce something.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
But I suspect with Intel, it's a corporate structural issue.

09:54.000 --> 10:01.000
I think the rod is from within and they just they got complacent again and their management structure changed.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
And now they cannot fix their problems. At least that's what I worry about.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
And I have to say, I'm not sure yet, Jacob.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
You really I think I'm on board with what Mike says is I need to see where Ryzen plays out.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
I need to see what some of these with these AMD laptops with AMD GPUs in them, what they look like,

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
because we've seen a few on the market, but we haven't seen it at the scale that we've seen the Intel stuff yet.

10:25.000 --> 10:34.000
I did note when I was talking to the System76 crew, my thought was, oh, but it it's still going to be Intel.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
Right. So it's almost like doesn't matter. And I hadn't conclusively reached that.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
But it it started to it's starting to feel that way.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
And I'd be curious to know if the audience out there feels similarly like it's one thing I think, too,

10:47.000 --> 10:54.000
when you're thinking about it from like a theoretical standpoint, like, oh, yeah, if I'm going to go blow two grand on a laptop,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
you can just sit there and you can throw around what you may or may not do all the time.

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
It's easy. But when you when it actually comes down to I can only buy a laptop like every four or five plus years,

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
like it's not something I do all the time. This is like my one chance to get it right.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I want something with a good screen. I want something with a good build quality.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
I want something with a good keyboard. I want something with good battery life.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
And I want something that has high performance. And it's my actual money now that I'm spending.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
I find it getting harder and harder to buy an X86 based system.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Thankfully, I'm just in a wait and see mode right now. C Sharpator writes in though.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
He says, Anyways, I can't help but take those stack overflow surveys that you guys cover as just a chance to rag on C Sharp.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
Even though it's not my favorite language, Objective C is a bit overheated, in my opinion.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
C Sharp, on the other hand, is an evil virus from hell forced upon the human species.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
I've never encountered a language that was far more removed from what it claims to be.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
In the case of C Sharp, it's, quote, easy to read and easy to use.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
But that phrase couldn't be a better description for everything C Sharp is not.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
The nastiest and most unpredictably dysfunctional code I've ever seen in my life has always been written in C Sharp.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
It's ugly. It's easily breakable. And you could never rely on most people to write anything maintainable.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
The best C Sharp can do is work in a clunky way.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
I was shocked when I found out that C Sharp was 60 percent loved.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
But the more I thought about it, I thought about is probably a blessing.

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
Really, that many programmers seem to either not remember how terrible C Sharp is or because they've long abandoned it for the browser.

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
I never forget the nightmare that is C Sharp, especially back before stuff like VS code existed.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
And I had to use the old Visual Studio institutionally forced upon me.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
There may be worse languages objectively, but C Sharp will always have a special place in my heart.

12:48.000 --> 12:56.000
Like as much as I hate JavaScript for spawning electron, at least electrons cross platform and is actually easy to use.

12:56.000 --> 13:03.000
In fact, many of its problems stem from being so easy to use that a lot of people can build apps that just work well enough and never had to learn good programming habits.

13:03.000 --> 13:10.000
C Sharp is the worst. I mean, I don't know about that.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
I think there's some people out there that would strongly disagree.

13:13.000 --> 13:21.000
I know some people who desperately are in love with C Sharp and trying to figure out how to balance their real relationship with the relationship with C Sharp.

13:21.000 --> 13:31.000
Yeah, I mean, so I feel for the writer here, right, because he's got like my level of love for object to see a language that I would say the vast majority of people hate.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
He hates the language the vast majority of people love.

13:34.000 --> 13:44.000
The funny thing that he mentioned there that he was forced to use Visual Studio. I'd care to wager one of the main reasons lots of people like C Sharp is because of Visual Studio.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
I don't know, man. I mean, it's not really my bag, right? I tend to run Mac or pop.

13:48.000 --> 13:58.000
But if you want an IDE that does lots of stuff for you and helps you out, granted, I know it adds complexity with all this weird config files.

13:58.000 --> 14:08.000
But I find any argument this is a Visual Studio does not succeed in its primary mission of being a great IDE for development a little.

14:08.000 --> 14:15.000
Nonsense, and I know that's not the argument he's necessarily making, but see, a lot of this stuff is about like taste and preferences, right?

14:15.000 --> 14:23.000
Like, why do I like Objective C? Because I'll turn this into a positive argument, not to bash on C Sharp, because I actually I actually kind of like C Sharp.

14:23.000 --> 14:34.000
Objective C, until like the very end, and I know end is like in quotes, because it's not dead yet, I will assert that forever, just didn't have that many features.

14:34.000 --> 14:41.000
Like, I'm doing a bunch of Python now, and there's like a million magical ways to do things in Python, right?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
You know, because of like, you know, different libraries, whatever.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
The Objective C is like, you can send a message to any object.

14:48.000 --> 14:56.000
We have built in these very few features. Then you can import Coco fine, you get some stuff there.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
But it's a simple language with simple concepts.

15:00.000 --> 15:07.000
Until you crack open the C part of it, and then you you know, you can it's still simple, but you can go cry because you have to do a lot of memory stuff.

15:07.000 --> 15:21.000
I have a feeling that some people like C Sharp because it's a big language with lots of features and just a ridiculous amount of abstraction, right?

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Objective C is like, hey, man, you want to do that? No problem.

15:24.000 --> 15:34.000
You can cobble together traditional C blocks and like whatever weird NS auto release pools and objects sending things we've got going on here and do some dynamic stuff in the runtime.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
C Sharp is like, oh, dude, we have a class for that.

15:36.000 --> 15:43.000
Yeah, just throwing away and just throw an async away and we'll figure it out. Don't worry about it like that.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
I don't know. It's kind of like easy mode, right? Yeah. And that's not a bad thing. It should be easy mode.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
Like, OK, can I bitch a little bit? Do it. Doing tons of Python.

15:52.000 --> 16:03.000
Loving it, except for both PyCharm pro and VS code, for whatever reason, cannot do IntelliSense on the SQL Alchemy like classes, right?

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
So if you have a model that inherits from things like DB dot model, and I think we should just take a step back.

16:09.000 --> 16:16.000
SQL Alchemy is effectively active record or entity framework from, you know, it's an ORM.

16:16.000 --> 16:23.000
As a guy who has a serious typo problem, as Chris can tell you, that has been killing me.

16:23.000 --> 16:34.000
Because I just not being able to hit like dot escape or I think I think I might I think I have a hot to like that tab and seeing the options of methods and properties is.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
I spent like three hours this weekend trying to figure out why why it's not working.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
And there's just a bunch of like annoyed people on Stack Overflow. I don't understand why this doesn't work.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Right. That's the kind of like quality of life thing that's annoying.

16:47.000 --> 16:58.000
And if you are a Python Easter of of more of a beard than me and you can explain to me why VS code cannot figure when I do like my model dot query dot, you know, whatever.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Why the dot doesn't bring anything up. I will be very happy.

17:01.000 --> 17:07.000
I think they prefer to be called Python hounds. I thought they were like snake charmers.

17:07.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah, that's right. That's right. Another topic that we cover on the show that got some feedback and we're still we're still the door still open on this one.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
Is transitioning into a manager from a developer to a developer manager.

17:20.000 --> 17:28.000
Jacob wrote in and said, there's one thing that I really recommend is sit down with each person and do a one on one session and ask them this question.

17:28.000 --> 17:38.000
Tell me about a mentor that impacted your life. He said, you'd be surprised at the kind of answers you get and insights you get into what motivates people.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
And then Peter wrote in with two book recommendations, the Unicorn Project and the effective manager will have those linked in the show notes.

17:47.000 --> 17:58.000
He says they give you actual advice and not just theory and that the Unicorn Project gives you a good idea of like how to run a DevOps shop, but in story form.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
So that's the Unicorn Project and the effective manager will have those linked in the show notes.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
If you got some all some of your own snakes that you have to charm, you know, those are very useful.

18:08.000 --> 18:22.000
We have more we have more feedback to get to. But if anything we've talked about on the show strikes an interest of yours and you want to talk about it more or expand on something or you have thoughts or insights, go to Coder dot show slash contact and share those with us.

18:22.000 --> 18:32.000
I'm in the Colorado Springs, like I mentioned, we just did our Denver meetup a couple of days ago and there was an incident that I got to talk to you about because there's been some demands.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
That have been made that I need to relay to you and we got to come to some sort of decision.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
So there was a bit of a Coder upset at the Denver meetup. I swear to God, if you say closure, nope, nope.

18:44.000 --> 18:54.000
A Coder quorum was assembled. They came up with a list of demands and then they claimed one of the bars as their territory.

18:54.000 --> 19:03.000
So that got a little weird. And then they wouldn't let any of us Linux nerds enter the bar land until they had your blessing.

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
And they refused to listen. And I told them you weren't coming because we assumed you were going to be moving and they just weren't having it.

19:10.000 --> 19:20.000
So now they're holding several MacBooks from the participants hostage, threatening to spill water on them unless, you know, you show up at a future meetup.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
I don't know how long it's going to go on. I think they're even threatening a hunger strike. It's pretty bad.

19:24.000 --> 19:31.000
The one in Denver is the one I should have gone to with. And by the way, just for Carl, I've gained 400 pounds.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
So don't mind the really big jacket coming into the system. Seventy six factory. Just it's cool.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
You know, I've been eating Twinkies. Oh, man.

19:39.000 --> 19:45.000
Can I just say the hardest thing about this meetup is the fact that I gained a bunch of weight during the lockdown stuff.

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
And so now I have to go around like I don't fit into my clothes like it's just the whole thing's embarrassing.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
It's just, you know, I have a bunch of the J.B. shirts that I no longer fit into, like the old Coder ones.

19:56.000 --> 20:03.000
I'm like, those are my aspirational shirts now. Yes. Yes. The Coder like 100 shirt is like I look at it sadly all the time.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
Oh, man, I know. I know. And, you know, you know what?

20:07.000 --> 20:15.000
Honestly, where it really kicked off for me was a year ago, we were just going independent.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
Like this week is the week we went independent. Like tomorrow was the day we announced it.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Happy anniversary. Thank you.

20:21.000 --> 20:28.000
And the the months, many months that led up to that, the negotiation process was extremely stressful.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
And it was right at the beginning of the lockdown and all of that.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
And I just put on a ton of weight and I realized, oh, stress really does make a difference on that kind of thing.

20:37.000 --> 20:44.000
And like I have to I'm going to have to just take steps in the future when I'm under a lot of stress to kind of like preventative care kind of thing.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
But man, oh, man, was that a process? And now here we are.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Here we are doing the meetup and all that kind of stuff. It's been great.

20:50.000 --> 20:57.000
So almost one year to the day as we record. By the time this episode comes out, it'll have been the year anniversary. It's pretty great.

20:57.000 --> 21:05.000
So for folks who might want to plan to go to a future meetup, wink, wink, is there somewhere that these are posted or?

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
I think we're going to come up with a meetup dot com replacement right now.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
We're still using meetup dot com. OK, but I feel like it's time to find something else.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
Meetup is is designed around the idea that you're holding meetups in your area.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
It's not designed around the idea that you're holding meetup somewhere far away from you.

21:23.000 --> 21:30.000
Oh, by the way, Optimus Gray points out in the chat room that you can go to notes dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash Coder radio

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
or just go to notes dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com and you could search there for our coverage of Crystal.

21:35.000 --> 21:41.000
There is a really nice index of all of our previous shows with a special search front end.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
In fact, the Coder audience might find actually pretty clever.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
So that's notes dot Jupiter broadcasting. It's like it's quite the fancy search.

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
Lino dot com slash Coder. Go there to get one hundred dollars on a new account and you go there to support the show.

21:54.000 --> 22:01.000
The year of independent Coder radios has been made possible by Linode and we enthusiastically endorse them.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
They started in 2003 as one of the very first companies in cloud computing.

22:04.000 --> 22:10.000
18 years later, they've just that entire time focused on that mission. They haven't gone crazy.

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
They didn't get like some weirdo VC funder in there that wanted them to get into like some crazy aspect of technology.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
They just hunkered down and built something incredible.

22:19.000 --> 22:25.000
And as the different things in the market evolved, Linode has consistently responded and over delivered.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
And that's the part that I have been fortunate to witness over the last couple of years.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
Like I'll tell you something they've added kind of more recently that when I first started using the note, I never thought they'd have.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
And it's bare metal boxes. I just never thought that was going to be their game.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
But they looked at it. They said, you know, it's something customers want and it's something we can do right.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
On top of that, though, they just have an easy to use, powerful cloud dashboard.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
They have 11 data centers around the world you can deploy to.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
So if you need your application to be performant, if you need it accessible, they've got you covered there.

22:54.000 --> 23:02.000
They've got DDoS protection. They've got this beautiful, beautiful, beautifully fast network because they are their own ISP.

23:02.000 --> 23:12.000
And the reason why I want to mention this is I have set up applications that I have deployed in different data centers that come back to their New Jersey data center for object storage.

23:12.000 --> 23:19.000
Or something like that. And I was worried that maybe that wouldn't be fast enough, but it has been exceptionally well performant.

23:19.000 --> 23:30.000
The entire time we were on this trip as the crew is recording clips, both video and audio, which, man, man, were people just like Brent was working his tail off.

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
We would get together in the evening at the Airbnb and we would upload all of our various footage to Linode's object storage.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
So we have one centralized place.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
We don't need to bother with any crazy front-end software. You just upload it to their object storage.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Anything that can talk S3 can talk to Linode's object storage.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
They have also entire one-click application deployments of the entire stack, if that's what you like.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
Or you can do it yourself. And their pricing is 30 to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
But with that $100 credit you're going to get when you go to linode.com slash coder, you can really kick the tires.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
You could try out one of their high-end AMD epic dedicated CPU systems that just kicks the butt of everybody out there.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Or you could go for their $5 a month box and see how far you can push it.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
You'd be really surprised by that. And Linode made our Jupiter Colony reunion road trip possible.

24:17.000 --> 24:25.000
They were there at the Denver meetup giving away prizes and some pretty special events and memories were created because of their support.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
And now you can get $100 to go try it out for yourself.

24:29.000 --> 24:35.000
Just go to linode.com slash coder, get $100 on your account and support the show.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Linode.com slash coder.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
I was a little fired up last week and that's what got the most feedback into the show.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
I was having a real strugs with NSURLSessionD on the Mac.

24:49.000 --> 24:58.000
So quick recap, because I'm a glutton for pain, I thought to myself, I don't really have a great computer for this road trip.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
I kind of went all in on my X1 Carbon at the beginning of the year.

25:02.000 --> 25:09.000
And frankly, I'm just not very happy with the overall performance and battery life.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
Other aspects of the machine I am quite happy with. I love the build quality.

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
I think the keyboard is great. It runs Linux because I got the Fedora edition like a freaking champ.

25:19.000 --> 25:27.000
Like if you needed a mobile workstation to do some web development, to get terminal access, to check your email, to browse the web.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
This thing is checking the boxes all day long.

25:30.000 --> 25:39.000
However, if you are trying to do a crazy remote live stream broadcast with a dozen different applications,

25:39.000 --> 25:46.000
including a full digital audio workstation, including OBS for broadcasting, including soundboard software,

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
Edge browser, Chrome browser, Firefox browser, all running simultaneously,

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
Jack and Pipewire running the background routing options, doing real time effects processing.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
And then, of course, recording each individual device and track to a FLAC file in real time to the hard drive.

26:01.000 --> 26:08.000
Like that's the baseline before I'm even like browsing the web, reading the news stories, responding to the chat room or launching Slack.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Like that's the baseline is a lot of work for a machine.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
And I just opted. I just said, I got to bring the MacBook Pros because that's the fastest machine I've got.

26:17.000 --> 26:25.000
OK, so far, I'm with you. OK, so I tried it and I thought, how bad could it be?

26:25.000 --> 26:31.000
And I really I really got nailed by something called NS URL session Damon last time.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
And at the time, because I didn't really know what it was, it was I was in problem solving mode.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
It was consuming all of my available bandwidth. It was just really going to town.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
First, it consumed all my downstream and then it consumed all my upstream.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
And it happened for a period of like three days. It was really getting to like by the time I've done Coder,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I was three days into this being a problem.

26:50.000 --> 26:59.000
What I learned after the show is that NS URL session Damon is actually kind of a good idea in principle.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
I think it's actually the implementation that is the problem.

27:03.000 --> 27:09.000
It's a Mac OS system process that is used for downloading and uploading data for any application.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
Initially, I thought it was like just an iCloud thing or something just for Mac OS.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
But now I understand it's actually a class that is made available for any application.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
And any application can delegate transfers to that Damon.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
And the nice thing is that it will continue even after you quit the application.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
So you can be like Telegram and say, hey, I need to download this thing.

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
NS URL session will do it for you. The main telegram process is left free.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
You can quit it. The download continues.

27:38.000 --> 27:46.000
And through my investigation, basically by throwing LSOF and looking at everything it's doing because activity monitor gave me information.

27:46.000 --> 27:53.000
But by using traditional Unix tools, I was able to determine like edge uses this telegram uses this.

27:53.000 --> 28:01.000
Of course, all the iCloud stuff uses this like tons of applications are using this damn NS URL session in the background on my Mac.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
And that is why it was just constantly doing shit because I had limited connectivity.

28:06.000 --> 28:15.000
And so things just sort of queued up and it was just dutifully going through the list and executing its list of things to download, consuming all of my bandwidth.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
And we got a lot of emails in that people said, yeah, this drives me crazy.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
Hans wrote and said he switched to plasma.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
He switched to KD neon because he was just sick and tired of all the stuff that the Mac does in the background.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I'm just curious to see if you agree.

28:30.000 --> 28:37.000
Like, I don't think you've really suffered from this because you probably are somewhere either with high bandwidth or something like you've never been plagued by this problem.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
I don't think I've never had this problem could happen to anyone.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
It could happen to any Mac user.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
You just kind of need to be like in a low bandwidth situation for an extended period of time.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
And there were a lot of options that were that came in.

28:51.000 --> 29:05.000
Nobody really wrote in with like a way to use launch control to just disable this thing, which is what I actually expected because that was the route Wes and I took was like, well, let's use the system application launcher to just shut this thing down.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
But no, no.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
What people suggested I do is use a hammer.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And I ended up doing just that.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
So I checked out two applications that were written into the show.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
One is called Lulu by a company called Objective C S E.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Yes, I know you like that.

29:22.000 --> 29:29.000
And this will have a link in the show notes is a really neat open source firewall.

29:29.000 --> 29:37.000
It it watches for outbound connections and then prompts the user if they want to allow or block that connection.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
And you can say temporarily block it or block it forever.

29:41.000 --> 29:50.000
And it runs at the network level using the newer APIs in Mac OS to to make sure that only the software you allow goes out.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
And the UI is fine.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
It's not phenomenal, but it's fine.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
And it absolutely gets the job done.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
It's at objective dash S E E dot com.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
And it's Lulu.

30:00.000 --> 30:09.000
The only problem I had with Lulu is a couple of applications didn't work like transmit and by word and a few other applications just weren't working.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
And I knew about Little Snitch, which is like the OG firewall.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
I legitimately may have used Little Snitch back in the like the Mac OS nine day or eight day.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
Like, I mean, a really long time ago, I'd use Little Snitch.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
So I thought, let's go see how they've done.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Now that company's name is Objective Development.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
So you've got Objective C S E E and Objective Development.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
It's like company names both.

30:34.000 --> 30:43.000
I know. I know. And Little Snitch is some big, but like the good kind.

30:43.000 --> 30:48.000
Wow. I know. I know. It's it's phenomenal.

30:48.000 --> 30:56.000
I mean, just as far as like as far as like an application design, it gives you like a real time NORAD missile map of like where all your connections are going.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
A beautiful way to see which ones you've allowed or disapproved.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
It gives you prompts that it's aware of certain third party applications.

31:04.000 --> 31:18.000
So like if you are another independent software developer and you deny that application's connection to the Internet for some of them, like say Bartender, it'll come up with a little disclaimer says, hey, bro, just so you know, you know, these are good guys.

31:18.000 --> 31:24.000
This is just the auto update. You could just go into the preferences and turn that off and still allow this thing access to the network if you want.

31:24.000 --> 31:31.000
They've vetted certain independent third party Mac apps and give you additional context when you go to deny them access, which is kind of nice.

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
They've also made it really simple to understand what stuff is iCloud stuff and what stuff is Mac OS stuff.

31:36.000 --> 31:44.000
And I just use this thing like full stop to just shut down as much possible on the Mac while I'm recording.

31:44.000 --> 31:51.000
And at this point in time, I've nearly blocked 60 different processes from connecting to the Internet.

31:51.000 --> 31:58.000
It is. Mind boggling how much crap on the Mac connects to Apple.

31:58.000 --> 32:10.000
I mean, you click the safari URL bar, four different background processes connect to Apple, you launch Spotlight, three different processes connect to Apple constantly all the time.

32:10.000 --> 32:22.000
I mean, the list is like I said, it's 60 different processes long now that come up when I like either launch an application or boot Mac OS that all phone in to Apple.

32:22.000 --> 32:32.000
And it reminds me when the Linux community crapped their pants over the canonical dash search and how it sent a ping to canonical when you would search for Amazon items,

32:32.000 --> 32:41.000
because literally every move I make on Mac OS, some process is connecting to Apple or some just automated sync process is connecting.

32:41.000 --> 32:49.000
And it's it is really eye opening to see how much this Mac is talking to the mothership whenever you're doing anything.

32:49.000 --> 32:58.000
And so I've just blocked all that crap while I'm recording. I've just I've created a profile that's like a hardcore profile that tons of stuff is shut down hard.

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
And now it's working great. I don't know if it's going to cause any long term damage to my Mac, but in the meantime, I can at least use my Internet.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
It's not your Internet or your computer. You need to accept that.

33:08.000 --> 33:17.000
Apparently it feels like half assed on Apple's part here because they've created this NS URL session, Damon, that kind of seems like a good idea.

33:17.000 --> 33:24.000
But wouldn't the next obvious step be to meter that in some way to not abuse a connection?

33:24.000 --> 33:32.000
You know, like it's not just like the next obvious thing. So it's server based software and it's Apple.

33:32.000 --> 33:41.000
True. I mean, when you look at all the stuff that just connects to the Internet anyways, it's clear they give zero craps about the amount of network activity and network connectivity they use.

33:41.000 --> 33:47.000
They don't give a shit. They have no concept of like I'm using this on a tethered connection.

33:47.000 --> 33:55.000
Now granted, there is an API now to tell that you're on a tethered connection and responsible developers could like, you know.

33:55.000 --> 34:01.000
Act accordingly, right? So we were able to ascertain like what exactly they're doing or it's just telemetry, right?

34:01.000 --> 34:12.000
In most cases, it looks like it's it's checking to see if something is on a denialist to checking to see if something is signed or it's checking to see if something needs to sync or like with Spotlight.

34:12.000 --> 34:18.000
It's pulling in market information for stock searches and all this crap that I just don't need.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
It's it's preemptively caching a lot of that stuff in the background.

34:22.000 --> 34:30.000
Or there's a lot of assistant services and Siri things that just try to like connect and be preemptively ready when you click a URL bar.

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
All that stuff, though, generates metadata. Even if it's not intentional tracking, it is metadata that gets triggered.

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
And if even if it's not Apple that logs it, your ISP could be logging it. So I just turned all that crap off.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Yeah, that's not good. I don't even know. You know, it's just not good.

34:45.000 --> 34:55.000
And it's kind of a garbage experience going through it because for like the first two days, you just live with tons of prompts about approving or denying software connectivity.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
And you just have to wait because you can't really proactively go through and do it.

34:59.000 --> 35:07.000
You kind of just wait until something prompts and then you tell it no. And so for like two days now, I'm just sitting here saying allow or deny. And I think I've caught most of it at this point.

35:07.000 --> 35:14.000
But it takes a while to get it set right. And this whole thing could just be avoided if I could just go under like the Wi-Fi menu and say low bandwidth mode.

35:14.000 --> 35:23.000
And then, you know, problem solved because they've already done the hard work of consolidating a lot of the background process and downloads in this URL session.

35:23.000 --> 35:34.000
So it's like, just give me the damn option to just throttle that thing. It could just be a little checkbox in the Wi-Fi dropdown that says limited connectivity or something, for goodness sake.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
There'll be no checkboxes and dropdown menus on Mac.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
No, you can't have that. Maybe at best I could get something if I held down the option key.

35:41.000 --> 35:47.000
Anyways, I really like Little Snitch. I paid the 47 bucks, even though after this road trip, I don't know if I'm going to ever need it again.

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
But I figured, you know what? Great software, really well designed. It's been around forever.

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
And now I actually feel like this Mac is under my control and it shifts my feeling about Mac OS.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
Like I'm I'm happier with it again. It's doing the job for me once again.

36:01.000 --> 36:09.000
And as long as I just use these tools to brute force it to behave the way I want, it's fine.

36:09.000 --> 36:15.000
Oh, man, at least it's really cheap hardware and doesn't have a lot of ongoing costs.

37:52.000 --> 37:58.000
So there's a meta topic you and I have been discussing for a while, and it's platform control.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
And we've come at this in several different ways.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
We've talked about it in terms of app stores before.

38:03.000 --> 38:09.000
I think you could even say the CSAM scanning is an attempt to establish a bit of preemptive control.

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
But what we got insights into since, I don't know, the last episode or so,

38:14.000 --> 38:22.000
it really shows us that every like worst case scenario we've spun in our heads about this is absolutely true and vindicated.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
Because if this epic lawsuit does nothing else,

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
we are getting some great emails that are truly revealing the actual nature of these companies.

38:31.000 --> 38:37.000
Yeah, I just want to take a lap here and say, so when I was talking about this crap in like 2013, 2014,

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
even all the way back to 2012, people said I was crazy or whatever.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
I was right the whole damn time. Thank you.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
It might have even been worse than you were saying.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
It's actually worse than I thought it was.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
Yeah, that's the thing.

38:51.000 --> 38:56.000
So the emails that are coming out and there are some great summaries we'll have linked in the show notes

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
basically show that Google had a secret initiative originally called Project Hug

39:01.000 --> 39:08.000
that offered certain very special high profile software developers very special treatment,

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
including maybe not having even kicked back a 30 percent fee.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
Google's Larry Page told Steve Jobs in 2010 that, quote,

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
there will always be places we compete and there will always be places we cooperate.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
After another meeting between Apple and Google and senior executives,

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
they had notes that showed that the executives all agreed, quote,

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
our vision is that we work as if we are one company.

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
That's some duopoly right there, Mike. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

39:36.000 --> 39:42.000
Like there was just emails that said we're not going to feature our competitors in the App Store.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
There is all kinds of nastiness in there.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
A lot of them are buried in PDFs, too.

39:49.000 --> 39:57.000
My impression of this and the argument I even made back in like 2014 was that this is not necessarily evil

39:57.000 --> 40:03.000
or wouldn't be evil if Apple didn't go so far and I'm going to pick on Apple a little bit to say that they didn't do this.

40:03.000 --> 40:11.000
Right. Because if you look at all this stuff, it's actually businesses operating as businesses do and saying, OK,

40:11.000 --> 40:18.000
there's this potential developer or partner or whatever that has a big enough audience that we need them.

40:18.000 --> 40:24.000
And therefore we can't extract as much revenue out of them. So we have to make a deal.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
That's just like how normal business goes.

40:26.000 --> 40:31.000
I remember software, et cetera, which might not some people might not be old enough listening,

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
but like they used to make these kind of deals all the time. Right.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
They'd get a better cross promotion with a publisher of a game or with a software suite.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
You know, retail stores do this kind of crap all the time, too.

40:42.000 --> 40:48.000
The difference is Apple, for whatever reason, wanted to have this. I don't know.

40:48.000 --> 40:54.000
It's like wrap themselves in the in the flag of small business and like a quality for the little guy.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
Well, it's obviously the best possible message they can derive out of that app store, right?

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Yeah, but not if it's found to be just like completely false.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
And it these emails revealed not only is it false, but it was never, in fact, true.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
Right. It's always been the app store of big business.

41:08.000 --> 41:17.000
Right. It's always been. Well, if you're Netflix or Microsoft, you know, but even OK, like I have a surprising.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
Well, I think you'll find it surprising. But why don't we cherry pick some cases here?

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
And like just for folks who maybe didn't stay up all night and read all the emails.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
Now, are you thinking like the big fish circumstance, like which one are you thinking of?

41:29.000 --> 41:35.000
I was I was thinking, yeah, the I think I titled it sucks to be big fish games.

41:35.000 --> 41:43.000
Yeah. Someone from app review is writing to their their upper management being like, I don't have a reason to reject them.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
Are we just going to tell them nothing? It's amazing.

41:48.000 --> 41:57.000
It ties into the other thing. There's an email and I think we link in the show notes where the app review executive is writing to the higher ups and saying,

41:57.000 --> 42:03.000
if we're going to have an unwritten rule that you cannot compete with us to be in the app store.

42:03.000 --> 42:11.000
Then we should just say that. Right. Because that ultimately a lot of big fish games, a lot of these come down to you can't be competitive with Apple.

42:11.000 --> 42:19.000
Yeah. Or they're going to take there's going to be some sort of there's going to be some sort of down low, quiet, punitive action that they won't maybe even tell you about.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
And then you as a developer just keep slamming your head against the wall.

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
Well, they have multiple ways of doing this. Right. In the case of big fish games, they just like two years of trying to get on the app.

42:27.000 --> 42:36.000
So they let them on the app store. And I think a more interesting case is actually like Spotify or before they bought Shazam,

42:36.000 --> 42:43.000
when Shazam launched a new app to replace and the quote replace iOS music player, piss them off, piss Apple off.

42:43.000 --> 42:49.000
Eddie Q writes and he forwards the their announcement and this and he says and then Matt Fisher writes,

42:49.000 --> 42:56.000
the team is asking whether we should promote this today. The iPhone guys have also called us asking if we're going to promote it today.

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
And of course, then Eddie replies to that email and says, no promotion.

43:00.000 --> 43:08.000
We are not going to promote something that puts its goal as replacing our music player unless it's significantly better than our player.

43:08.000 --> 43:14.000
And this is not. Now, there is the unless it's better than our music player, which makes it sound like if it was, they would consider it.

43:14.000 --> 43:22.000
But something tells me something tells me, especially now that music is part of their services revenue, they would never consider doing that.

43:22.000 --> 43:29.000
But there's also a tidbit in there that's a little inside baseball. But back when I was doing a lot of startup app development for folks,

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
let me tell you something. Being in the iPhone versus not being in the iPhone was a huge deal.

43:34.000 --> 43:41.000
Forget about the money itself, about access and cooperation from Apple.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
I think we talked about this a couple of years ago where I would have one customer who was like in the iPhone.

43:45.000 --> 43:54.000
They were a startup. They could literally call up a rep and get help with whatever was going on versus like a regular business would just be like, it's a black box.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
You submit it, but you get whatever back.

43:56.000 --> 44:03.000
I'm reading through the Netflix stuff, too, where they where they're negotiating lowering Netflix's in-app purchase price

44:03.000 --> 44:11.000
and talk about what Netflix think would happen regarding, you know, subscription cancellations and how they could possibly leverage that.

44:11.000 --> 44:17.000
But they say they feel like, you know, for Netflix, they're going to have to give them a deal here because, you know, they're a special customer there.

44:17.000 --> 44:24.000
It's it's it's really something to see these emails. This one's from Peter Stem to Phil Schiller.

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
And they got it right here. Epic got it. They got him.

44:28.000 --> 44:34.000
It's good to be Apple, right? Like they got they became a platform king just at the right moment.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
Right. They really nailed that app store thing. They almost blew it.

44:39.000 --> 44:46.000
And they really turned that around and got themselves to essentially be the gatekeeper for so, so, so many users.

44:46.000 --> 44:53.000
I have some bacon. Oh, really? Tell me a little bit about this bacon. Is it smoked?

44:53.000 --> 45:05.000
Yes, this is smoked. This is gamified bacon. I think there's one thing that I don't know that's gotten enough attention during this epic hearing.

45:05.000 --> 45:13.000
The disclosures basically would not basically outright proved that the games on iOS are subsidizing the rest of the app store.

45:13.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah. If we look at these kind of like bigger rejections, like the one where Microsoft tried to like get on their heels and fight Apple a little bit.

45:20.000 --> 45:29.000
It's all about cloud gaming. And I have been dunking on cloud gaming for several years on the show, but I think we're getting to it now.

45:29.000 --> 45:35.000
And that is a big, big market and a lot of that sweet, sweet revenue, that monthly recurring revenue.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
And that's what it's all about. And how how Apple handles that will be interesting.

45:39.000 --> 45:45.000
And what are they going to do when all these guys switch to a Web app? Also be interesting.

45:45.000 --> 45:52.000
What are your thoughts on Google? I mean, how about this name? How about this name, Project Hug? How about that?

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
It's almost like the poor imitation of Apple's tactics in a lot of ways.

45:56.000 --> 46:11.000
It's just even more ham fisted. It's like they they they came up with a cute, sick, twisted name for their cutting deals with special interest to, like, you know, pay their 30 percent commission or something like they got a name for it.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
Project Hug. It's gross. Like that's just it's not Apple's not the only bad actor here.

46:16.000 --> 46:22.000
No, not at all. I mean, there's stuff from from this hearing from this case that we've seen about Microsoft and Sony, too.

46:22.000 --> 46:28.000
They're all doing this. Like if you are a big enough name that they need, they'll just make different deals with you.

46:28.000 --> 46:34.000
I sort of find the Apple case more egregious because they're the ones who got on the soapbox.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
You know, they always have those crappy like human interest stories at the beginning of WWDC.

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
Right. And no offense to the individual developers or the idea that, you know, we should promote less known developers.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
I would love to be promoted, too. But it's that's just not the reality of the situation.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
Yeah. Having said that, I think this is all good news. In what way?

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
Because once you get caught, you can't get away with it.

46:55.000 --> 47:02.000
So, like, I'm thinking back to some of the hate mail that I in particular used to get from the show when people would say, oh, it's just whatever.

47:02.000 --> 47:09.000
You know, you know, second place sweeps. I don't know what kind of kind of bull that Apple wouldn't do that.

47:09.000 --> 47:15.000
It's a fair market, blah, blah, blah. They denied it. They said they didn't. Well, now they just got caught.

47:15.000 --> 47:20.000
And I think the most common thing we got was like Apple's doing this for safety of the consumer.

47:20.000 --> 47:25.000
Apple has to do this for the device security. Right. And it's bullshit. If you read the emails, it's revenue.

47:25.000 --> 47:30.000
Right. It's it's it always has been from like the very early days from the day one.

47:30.000 --> 47:39.000
Right. So the the thing is, once you get caught, especially in I mean, I don't think Congress is actually going to be effective because.

47:39.000 --> 47:50.000
Yeah, but I think Apple is going to think twice and all these vendors are going to have to think twice about how how just how hard they laid the boot down on the neck of the indie developer.

47:50.000 --> 47:59.000
I wonder, you know, we've covered over the years these developers who have had a big enough clout to actually generate some sort of press coverage about their mistreatment.

47:59.000 --> 48:12.000
And there's been dozens of them now. And you wonder if they hadn't just screwed those up, if they had if they had just done right and just changed a few things like as time went on, they dropped the commission down.

48:12.000 --> 48:20.000
And if they cut a special deal with somebody like Netflix, maybe they they institutionalize it and they make it a system that anybody can apply for.

48:20.000 --> 48:26.000
And they had just done things like that over time. None of this. None of this would be happening.

48:26.000 --> 48:34.000
They can't write their publicly traded companies. The chart has to go up into the right. You can't just make less money than you could make.

48:34.000 --> 48:43.000
That's a good point. And especially when you have a lot of pressure to always be making more money, it really does get you to the point where eventually you have to start making some kind of compromise.

48:43.000 --> 48:49.000
And if you can't sell, you know, if you can only you can only sell so many devices, there's only so many people in the market.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
And then you got to start you got to start milking that existing market for revenue growth.

48:53.000 --> 49:00.000
It's the only choice they have. Let's not forget, right in their little services pie, which is not that little, very big.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
The largest part of it is, in fact, App Store commissions. Yeah, yeah, that's true.

49:04.000 --> 49:20.000
I wonder how stuck they are, though, because some of these documents seem to suggest that Apple and I would assume Google struck deals with some of the carriers that if the app is purchased while on LTE or, you know, on their on their on the carriers network.

49:20.000 --> 49:29.000
That they're getting like 20 percent of that 30 percent, like the carriers are getting a ginormous portion of that transaction.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
And I don't know if that's still the case, and I don't know which carriers.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
Well, granddad Monopoly's got to get in there, too, right?

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
But that makes me wonder, then, well, how much room does Apple have to move?

49:39.000 --> 49:49.000
You know, if if they're if they're paying out 15 to 20 percent of their 30 percent cut to Verizon or whatever, they may not have a lot of room to move down.

49:49.000 --> 49:58.000
They may be kind of stuck by their agreements that they stuck with these carriers to get them to allow people to download 200 megabyte apps on the carriers networks.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
You know, because when the iPhone first came out, remember, they really limited that.

50:01.000 --> 50:08.000
That was a big deal. And then and the network struggled. They struggled to keep up with the data use of iPhone users.

50:08.000 --> 50:17.000
I still believe that the bigger problem is actually the control and the review of the applications and how restrictive they are when you are not them.

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
Right. Again, going back to Spotify for a long time.

50:21.000 --> 50:26.000
And I think still presently, there are just things that Apple Music, which I am an Apple Music subscriber.

50:26.000 --> 50:32.000
I use it every day. It's fine. But, you know, if it didn't come with like everything else I have.

50:32.000 --> 50:39.000
Spotify is definitely the superior music service, right? Podcast player, but good music service.

50:39.000 --> 50:43.000
But just that, you know, I can talk to my car easily and have a play.

50:43.000 --> 50:50.000
Apple Music is, I don't know, the home pods that somebody convinced me to get that I love now.

50:50.000 --> 50:59.000
Apple Music is easier, right? I don't know. I feel like we were at one point on this way to a glorious future of the open Internet and like Web applications.

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
And it was the 90s. It was going to be great. And then somehow Facebook and the App Store became the Internet.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
And now we're all just a little sad.

51:06.000 --> 51:12.000
I say it's the consumer's fault because the consumer couldn't figure out how to find without these curators.

51:12.000 --> 51:18.000
You know, discovery has been a problem for all types of media and apps.

51:18.000 --> 51:27.000
And these app stores and these platforms like Facebook came along and they offered news feeds and they offered curated apps and they said, go here.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
You no longer have to think about it. And the consumer said, oh, yes, please. Yes, thank you. Thank you.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
And now we're in this position.

51:34.000 --> 51:41.000
Yeah, but I feel like, you know, great granddaddy was making the same argument about those new fangled magazines when they came out.

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
Probably true. Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send people this week before we get out of here?

51:47.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah. Follow me at Dumanuco on Twitter. And I am still hiring for a QA person and a Pythonista.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
So and what is the best way for them to find you?

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
Because we had because I think we had mentioned they could like they could go find the job posting online.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
But then somebody e-mailed is like, I don't know how to e-mail Mike.

52:03.000 --> 52:11.000
I don't know how to get it. Yeah, it's a zip recruiter slash the Matabotter Inc. Actually, if you just Google the Matabotter jobs, it comes right up.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
There you go. And we'd love to have you join us live.

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
We do this show Monday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern over at JBLive.TV.

52:18.000 --> 52:25.000
Links to everything we talked about today at coder.show slash 428, including those incriminating PDFs.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
You'll find our contact form there. We'd love to get your feedback.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
It was a huge part of this week's episode and we'd like to make it a big part of next week's episode, too.

52:32.000 --> 52:39.000
Go subscribe, maybe share the show with a friend who might enjoy it. Word of mouth is the best way to spread these here podcasts.

52:39.000 --> 53:02.000
But that does do it for this week's episode of the Coder Radio program. See you right back here next week.
