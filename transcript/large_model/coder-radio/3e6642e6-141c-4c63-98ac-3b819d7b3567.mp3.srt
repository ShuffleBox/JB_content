11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,280
My name is Chris and joining us tweeting to troll me, it is our host, Mr. Dominic.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Hello Mike.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
Hello Chris.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,760
And, uh, you know, I am, I am truly sorry that we said gathering here to dunk and pour

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,520
some out for your home pod, son.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
Already!

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
We're just right off the top.

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
We said going hard!

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
Wow.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,200
You know, I've been getting trolled all week about this.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,720
Yeah, this must have been a bad week for you, Mike.

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,200
Was it a bad week?

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Yeah.

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,880
I mean, it involved, uh, first of all, of course, I found out via like an audience member

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,880
ribbing me.

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,200
So that's, that's how I found out about the home pod getting canceled.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,280
It's rough.

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
You know what I realized?

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
I had, I had a moment, right?

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
I had several moments because- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
Did you hear that snap?

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Did it come through?

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
Yeah.

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
It was inevitable.

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
I know.

36
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't normally, I don't normally buy Apple products that you can smell from a mile away

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,240
aren't going to make it.

38
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,080
As I sit in front of an iMac pro who also got killed this week.

39
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,840
That, you know, yeah.

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Yeah.

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,920
That's a good example actually.

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,560
But, uh, the home pod, I think the problem with the home pod was that you had to experience

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,360
it to understand its value because it's, it's something you hear.

44
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,520
It's not something you can see.

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,980
It's not something you can touch.

46
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,400
It's something you hear.

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,280
And to really appreciate the home pod, you needed two of them to really make this sucker

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
sing.

49
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,240
So I am actually going to give you something on the home pod.

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,760
I had a guest over the other night and I wanted to play music on the Sonos.

51
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Yeah.

52
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,320
But because of Apple's, how can we put this?

53
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,560
Game of Thrones, Iron Throne style lock on their platform.

54
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,040
I was unable to do that in less than seven taps, which required me to put in my Apple

55
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:28,680
ID password on an iPhone, which already has, if I said, Hey, Solana, I'm avoiding the real

56
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
name, right?

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
Hey, cilantro.

58
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Buenos dias, Selena.

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
Selena.

60
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
My Spanish.

62
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,760
It's, I took it for 10 years and then I forgot.

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,400
It kind of did not keep the spirit of what I was going for there.

64
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,220
You know, C plus plus was over, you know what I'm talking about here.

65
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,520
Had I had a home pod and you know how much this hurts me, Chris.

66
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,640
The moment would have been saved.

67
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,880
Not even one tap.

68
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
Yeah.

69
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,080
But a, Hey, cilantro.

70
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,120
Or just a quick, you know, it integrates super well with airplay, right?

71
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
It's an airplay speaker.

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Yeah.

73
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,200
Apparently my Sonos is too old.

74
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Yeah.

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Yeah.

76
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,320
I mean, I'm in this weird like sunk cost fallacy where Apple used to like Sonos and it used

77
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
to work.

78
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,880
Like you can't, did you know you can't change the volume on a Sonos with the, with the rocker

79
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,640
on the, it's, it's, it's actually like ridiculous.

80
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,520
And I'm kind of like, I want to buy a home pod, but then they canceled the home pod,

81
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,160
but I also don't want to reward what is very obvious anti-competitive behavior.

82
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,480
And like Sonos is like, you could buy a newer Sonos that allows airplay to, but I'm like,

83
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,780
I don't know the speakers, the same speaker.

84
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,160
So the Sonos is a niche, right?

85
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,040
This, this is, this was a super niche product.

86
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,200
I'm not sure why Apple ever made it, but it actually was an exceptionally good product.

87
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,280
It was so good that as you know, I bought several of them, but I also, you mean the

88
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
home pod?

89
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
Yeah.

90
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
Not the song.

91
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,400
It made me, the home pod made me switch to the Apple TV as well.

92
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,980
So they, they sucked me in that way because again, I'm an Apple TV user.

93
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,560
So it's like the Sonos was the mistake.

94
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Yeah.

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,440
It it's so great the way they, they sorted out the Dolby digital stuff.

96
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:11,120
So that way the home pods like wireless surround sound is just a tap away and it works so well

97
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,040
and it really adds a layer.

98
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,600
You know, I had, it was one of those moments where my wife leaned over and she said, I'm

99
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,160
really glad we set those home pods up.

100
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,960
This really is more immersive.

101
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,300
Like she, you know, when the wife notices it, you're like, you really feel good.

102
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,300
They just sounded so good.

103
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,200
The problem was they're so locked into the airplay ecosystem.

104
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,740
And then on top of that, Siri's not very good.

105
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,360
And because you had to hear them and you had to already be in this ecosystem to get them

106
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,720
and they were priced too high, you know, they came out at 350 later, lowered to 299.

107
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,540
The other thing is from a home assistant perspective, home pods can be set to work with a self-hosted

108
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,600
home assistant instance and become voice control for home assistant and I would love it for

109
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
that purpose.

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,360
That's another reason why I got so into it, but I knew it was coming.

111
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
I knew it would happen.

112
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,400
And the mini, the iPod, the home pod mini, it's fine, but it's, it's nowhere near the

113
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
same level.

114
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,120
And see, the thing is, is if you look at the home pod as not like a, an echo competitor,

115
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,160
but if you look at it as a home theater system competitor or a Sonos five competitor, that

116
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,520
$300 price point is actually pretty reasonable because something close to it's about $500.

117
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,340
So when you look at it from a home theater standpoint, because this is, I was using this

118
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,520
in combination with a set, well, I still will be until they stopped being supported in combination

119
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,600
with a sound bar and a dedicated subwoofer and then one home pod mini as a tweeter.

120
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,760
So I have quite the setup with this Apple TV and it all works flawlessly.

121
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,440
And there's not a single wire I had to run to do any of this.

122
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,840
I just set the units down and connected them in the UI and forever forth they are now the

123
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,280
sound system for the Apple TV and it's, it's nice and my family likes it.

124
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,960
And so I, in kind of a moment of like, Oh, what am I going to do now?

125
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,840
I bought another one while I still could.

126
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,680
So I've got another one that I'm going to leave in the box.

127
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,080
I think I'm going to actually leave it in the box.

128
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,400
I'll see your one and raise you to, I literally just bought two as you've been talking.

129
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
That's amazing.

130
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,120
You just spent $648 and 83 cents on home pods.

131
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,120
I think they're, you know what, I honestly was having a conversation with my wife.

132
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm like, you know, you don't really want to burn the money, but at the same time, like

133
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,800
we really like these and she likes them too because she likes to listen to our audio books

134
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,180
and her podcasts when I'm not there, she just can fill out the, the thing is, is we have,

135
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,180
we have a pretty small space, you know, 300 square feet or so, and we put home pods throughout

136
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
it.

137
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,960
We can have seamless audio everywhere throughout the home with these suckers.

138
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Love them.

139
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
It's too bad.

140
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,960
Well, you know what it is too, when I'm like doing stuff around the house, I don't want

141
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,000
to have to like tap seven times to play a goddamn song.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,140
You know, I know it's, there's other ways to solve this problem and all of that.

143
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,800
So it's not like it's, it's not like it, it's not like it discontinued a super important

144
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,480
computing platform, but that's, you know, I knew they were going to do this stupid ecosystem,

145
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,700
stupid lock-in, stupid, stupid, no line in whatever.

146
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:13,400
So apparently if you paste an image into adium now, it encrypts it into some sort of spring

147
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
format.

148
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
This is getting no, no.

149
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
It's adium.

150
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
I don't give a crap.

151
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
I'm not doing it.

152
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,040
I will not do that.

153
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
No.

154
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,360
So you asked the audience, you know, what should, what, what would hit a nerve the most

155
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,680
with me to troll me this week?

156
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Yes.

157
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Hang on.

158
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
I want to read all the options.

159
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
I have a whole plan.

160
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Okay.

161
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Sorry.

162
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
You know, I get upset about it.

163
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
You know, I know, no, I know it's important.

164
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,960
I know that chat client from 1997 is extremely important.

165
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,440
I don't think it's actually from that.

166
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,080
No, it's not that actually, no.

167
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,100
So I'm completely unprepared because instead of clicking the link in the doc, I decided

168
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,800
to go through my Twitter history and apparently I just tweet.

169
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Oh yeah.

170
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I got them right here.

171
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Hang on.

172
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
I have an order I want to do.

173
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,260
Oh, so coming in in the rear, what was the question?

174
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,880
Things I could troll Chris about.

175
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Yeah.

176
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
Yeah.

177
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,360
So 18.1% of the vote brought in the rear and I feel like to be honest with you, that's

178
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,180
a lot of you Linux unplugged guys feeling short in the pants.

179
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,880
Just want to knowledge it, but we'll just keep moving.

180
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,840
18.8 is classic Jar Jar.

181
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Fair enough.

182
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
Right?

183
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
23.5 sues.

184
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

185
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Germans, please.

186
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Sousa slash lizard people, but with a commanding lead of 39.6%.

187
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,600
The demise of the HomePod.

188
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,880
Although I feel like I really blunted my blade here by buying two of them live on the air.

189
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,080
You know, I love that all of these, some people, like these are all like baseline good troll

190
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,560
topics apparently.

191
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,040
I got, I got, I got notes from the sues people all week long for some strange reason.

192
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
It definitely wasn't me.

193
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
No.

194
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,220
It wasn't me like aggressively tweeting you every day and hiding notes and source code

195
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,220
on websites.

196
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,800
Oh, you found it nicely done nicely done.

197
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,680
The best is I can't use the coder by its name.

198
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
Oh, there's a company called that.

199
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,240
So it's going to be coder tales and I filed the trademark.

200
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,740
So Oh, okay.

201
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,740
Tales from the coder.

202
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,740
I mean that works right.

203
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,560
Coder tales, but don't worry cause they're all going to be themed on an intrepid lizard

204
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
name.

205
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Sal.

206
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
Oh my Sal.

207
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
Susie, Susie.

208
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Oh no.

209
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,880
It'll be a girl lizard and I'll call her Susie.

210
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Oh my God.

211
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
It's perfect.

212
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
That's pretty good.

213
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
That's pretty good.

214
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Actually.

215
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,120
I mean, I don't like the sues part, but that's pretty good.

216
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,640
Is Mike investing tens of thousands of dollars in trolling Chris?

217
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,840
Maybe, maybe it's just, maybe that's a good way to make biz sound.

218
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,120
Business choices could be, you know, we got a little sues note from Nathan.

219
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,560
He wrote in, also he mentioned that a lisp is great and that he recommends people check

220
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,320
out portacle, which is an IDE sick, I know of course.

221
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,240
Also he said that he recommends that people check out the vs code extension for common

222
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
lisp.

223
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
It's pretty great.

224
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Oh my God.

225
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,580
But he, he wants to know if you're going to put your money where your mouth is and eventually

226
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,160
install open sues on your Thalia.

227
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,280
He says I've been triggered by Chris's criticisms with open sues.

228
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,760
What are you high?

229
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,760
But he says, I'm realizing maybe Chris is right.

230
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,840
I have also experienced many of the paper cuts that he has and I can't really say I

231
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,680
use open sues or Sousa as a daily driver anymore.

232
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,000
By the way, looking forward to the robe.

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,880
I think you should do it again next year.

234
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
Boom.

235
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,960
Looking forward to morning coding in the robe, he says.

236
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,680
So what is the, what Sousa isn't Thalia worthy.

237
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,860
So I have a trolley answer, but I'm going to give you the real answer.

238
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,800
With the Thalia starter board.

239
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Can I install Sousa?

240
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Oh sure.

241
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,080
I thought that was like a custom, no, no, I don't work fine.

242
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,560
He runs independently of the OS.

243
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Oh, okay.

244
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
It's for Merlin.

245
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Okay.

246
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
Yeah.

247
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
I don't know.

248
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,640
I don't know if, uh, like some of the system 76 tools and stuff, I don't know if those

249
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,760
are packaged for Sousa, but the system will run.

250
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,080
Well, my Thalia is, is a glorified flight simulator right now.

251
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,400
I mean, when I say glorified, it's the only computer I have with a good GPU.

252
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:20,760
So it's actually the best computer I own, but it has one job, like it does one thing.

253
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,840
Is that windows 10?

254
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
It is not.

255
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Oh really?

256
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
It is pop OS.

257
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
No.

258
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Oh, okay.

259
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,120
That'd be pretty funny if it was now, I did try to do a video.

260
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,700
If you want to troll me about my OS is on my lemur.

261
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Not so good.

262
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Yeah.

263
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Fan noise.

264
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
Oh yeah.

265
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Yeah.

266
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
The fan noise.

267
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Yeah.

268
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Yeah.

269
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,700
It's, it's tricky.

270
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
It's tricky for the laptops.

271
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,560
So the iMac pro, I am sorry, Ivan, you never even got a chance.

272
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:54,000
Like Apple was like, this is our new pro Mac and then Mark Warman was like, no, you.

273
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,840
They really thought that was going to be the high end Mac forever.

274
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
You know what?

275
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
It's, it's not a bad computer.

276
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,680
I mean, it's unfortunate that the day I get a dead pixel, I will have lost $5,000.

277
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,520
Well, and, or if you ever need like storage fixed or a screen fix, you've got to bring

278
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,320
your entire fricking computer in.

279
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,480
Or the fact that I've done benchmarks on my MacBook air just destroys it in many cases

280
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
that I can.

281
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Well, there's that too.

282
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,240
But I mean, just in terms of like even an M one based iMac, still going to have some

283
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,480
of the limitations that limitations that an all in one computer has.

284
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,520
Honestly, I wish it, okay.

285
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,560
I don't know why we're going here, but I wish I had not bought this and it waited and bought

286
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,560
on a M one iMac pro or whatever they're going to call it.

287
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Right.

288
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
I'm Mac, whatever.

289
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Yeah.

290
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
I'm sure they'll probably still call it.

291
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,680
I'm like the M ones, the performance for things that I do like specifically as a software

292
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,840
developer, like I only have one case where I care about GPUs and that's where I'm yelling

293
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,520
at kids for not knowing what pointers do, which by the way, our rip van Winkle, or I

294
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,400
think we actually, I recorded two episodes already, but then I had a little issue with

295
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
the name.

296
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,000
Hey, uh, speaking of streaming, I put, I'll put a link in the show notes to the USB 3.0,

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,560
like $15 capture card that I'm using with Linux right now, 1699, they raised it, but

298
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,400
people had emailed it and I should have totally put that in the show notes last week.

299
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
So I will have that in there.

300
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Oh, that's awesome.

301
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Yeah.

302
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Yeah.

303
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Yeah.

304
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
People were asking on Twitter too.

305
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Real time.

306
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,360
Follow-up chat room tells us, uh, Nevin chat room and, uh, Neil in chat room say that the

307
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,920
system 76 tools are in the build service and available on Sousa and that Sousa works

308
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,640
great on the Thalia workstation.

309
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,440
So no excuse now, Mike, get the four men.

310
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,520
I listen when my, my four year old son, who's going to be five next month, you know what

311
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,520
for his fifth year old, both three son, I didn't get you a cake.

312
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,480
I didn't get you any kind of Avengers or Ironman doll or whatever.

313
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,280
You get to install open Sousa on daddy's computer.

314
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,540
What a gift.

315
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,920
And he'll say, I want to live with mommy.

316
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,040
Fair enough.

317
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,860
Leno dot com slash coder.

318
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,480
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit.

319
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,200
And of course support the show.

320
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,340
$100 for new accounts is a great deal.

321
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,200
Not only is that just a ton of credit, which is super nice deal, but it's a really solid

322
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,440
way to try out the stuff that we talk about with Linode all the time.

323
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,000
Linode is how I host everything with JB 3.0 from our community stuff to just the tools

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
that we use.

325
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,340
And some systems are small little micro boxes that we've set up to do like real singular

326
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,880
kind of tasks, one or two jobs.

327
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,440
And some are larger boxes that run several applications at the same time.

328
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,120
Linode has a wide range of systems you can choose from.

329
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,880
And their pricing is 30 to 50 percent less than major cloud providers like AWS or Google.

330
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,500
And they've been around forever.

331
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,240
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in this business.

332
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,460
And they have honed that into a lean mean machine.

333
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,900
What they have focused on, they have focused on well and done extremely well.

334
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,680
Their cloud dashboard is clean, simple, clear, gives you good feedback, really approachable

335
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,100
if you're new to all this stuff, but just a few clicks away from getting really advanced.

336
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,360
If you're more familiar with some of these things.

337
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,340
And Linode is fast.

338
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,880
They have fast, fast networking.

339
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,680
They have 11 data centers around the world.

340
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,920
They have native SSD storage, 40 gigabit connections coming into the machines.

341
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,720
It's really fast and it's stable too.

342
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,080
And they have a bunch of features that make using Linode just a breeze.

343
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,880
Their cloud manager makes it possible to manage a bunch of machines at once or just a single

344
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
machine.

345
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,480
They make it really easy to manage your backups, your snapshots or even move between data centers.

346
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,740
We got an email in from the show from Listener Chris, not me, but Listener Chris, though

347
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,520
I echo his sentiments.

348
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,340
He said he used Linode initially just as a way to do code deployment testing.

349
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,200
He had a Linode set up with a domain that he would deploy to and he'd send that out

350
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,340
to clients or whoever was testing it and they could bang on it in a real world way and give

351
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,340
him feedback.

352
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,420
And he said, well, one day I was experimenting with it and we had the website on a quad core

353
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,860
system, he said, and the Linode was a single core system, but the Linode test site was

354
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,720
faster than the production website every single time in all of his tests.

355
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,720
And so eventually the conversation, it came up, why is the test site faster than production?

356
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,320
And so they migrated everything over to Linode.

357
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,360
It's just a great story because we had a Listener Jeff who wrote in and did the same thing with

358
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,860
his Nextcloud instance, very similar story.

359
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,720
And both of them just had tons of great things to say about Linode support.

360
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
And I hear that a lot.

361
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,380
It's just beyond a level which you would expect.

362
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,120
It's just really great support.

363
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,520
But I love Linode because they've been supporting Linux and projects and events that I love

364
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
for a really long time.

365
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,440
And the reason why that pushes buttons is not only because of course I love Linux, but

366
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,540
it means they have a passion about this technology.

367
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,800
They're in it because they want to be.

368
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
They love the technology.

369
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,600
It's not because they just got a bunch of VC funding and decided they could go dominate

370
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,240
a market.

371
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,680
They started early just as a love for something that was now coming into the Linux kernel.

372
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,320
Like this was back in user mode Linux days.

373
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,680
And they grew that into one of the largest independently, they are the largest independently

374
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,320
owned cloud provider.

375
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,000
Think about that.

376
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,720
They're even their own ISP now.

377
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Isn't that remarkable?

378
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,920
They did that back in 2016.

379
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,480
And Linode is dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

380
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,680
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode and it runs damn well.

381
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,760
I can tell you that from personal experience.

382
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,760
So go try it out.

383
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,160
Put it to the test, linode.com slash coder.

384
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:37,000
Go there, support the show and get that $100 credit, linode.com slash coder.

385
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,760
You really screwed up that Linode ad.

386
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Oh yeah?

387
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,040
You forgot to mention the greatest feature they have.

388
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Oh, what is it?

389
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
OpenSUSE.

390
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
That's right.

391
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
It is on there.

392
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
You're right.

393
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,040
They got Arch on there too.

394
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Oh no.

395
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
No.

396
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Don't say that.

397
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
No one will subscribe.

398
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
We're not going to make any money.

399
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
What are you doing?

400
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I know.

401
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
You're right.

402
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
I shouldn't.

403
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
I shouldn't say it.

404
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
SUSE.

405
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
It's what you want.

406
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Oh, I am really just, I am torn up about the HomePod thing.

407
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,040
I know it sounds silly, but I really, I just spent a stupid amount of money.

408
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,920
I wish Apple could just like chill and lower their prices by 15%.

409
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,640
If I could keep the HomePod at $299, but then make it like part of a mesh wifi network system,

410
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
that might be something.

411
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Oh God.

412
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
No.

413
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
No, it wouldn't.

414
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
All right.

415
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,400
Well, there's other things to talk about, but before we get to some of the things we

416
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,480
should probably talk about, some of the emails we should probably get to, I wanted to talk

417
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,880
about this article, or it was a study, but then there was an article published about

418
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
it.

419
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,180
It was research that was done in the UK that shows that the average, and I'm sure this

420
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:44,240
is true for American workers too, the average UK office worker is only productive for two

421
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,960
hours and 53 minutes out of a workday.

422
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,600
It seems like a wild overestimation, but keep going.

423
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
You think?

424
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:58,040
They say with social media, going through news websites, YouTube and whatnot, that generally

425
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,160
when you condense the amount of time people are actually working, it's just under three

426
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
hours.

427
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,240
They polled around 2000 UK office workers all over the age of 18 and they asked them

428
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,840
a series of questions and depending on how they kind of came at it, like this is the

429
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
question they asked them.

430
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,120
If you had to state a figure, how long do you think you spend productively working during

431
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,560
work hours on a daily basis?

432
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,640
With that question and other questions that started to derive this information, and you

433
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,760
think it could be actually less than that?

434
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
I think it's less.

435
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Yeah.

436
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,180
I think I'll tell you what a big part of it is, because I do not dispute this either,

437
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,760
and I think two hours, they say almost three hours, two hours, 53 minutes, I bet it's more

438
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
closer to two hours.

439
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,560
And I think a big part of it is the white space between meetings, like what do you do

440
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
with that time?

441
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,560
You read your email, you browse Facebook, you watch YouTube.

442
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:57,000
So I will say one thing in, I guess, a more positive direction that once childcare comes

443
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,080
back for the majority of the country and I'm speaking to our US audience, I know in Europe

444
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,440
you guys have got this sorted, mostly from what I hear.

445
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,520
I can tell you as a dad with a kid at home, there's a reason we do the show at eight o'clock

446
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
at night now.

447
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
Right?

448
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
Yeah.

449
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,100
Because, I mean, you know this Chris, we had this conversation privately, absolutely no

450
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,880
way I can do the show at three o'clock in the afternoon anymore because of the work

451
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
from home nature of things.

452
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,960
But as childcare and schooling and aftercare comes back, I'm sort of optimistic.

453
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,120
I think in 2023, and yes, I mean, two years from now, productivity is going to go rapidly

454
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,800
up because you know what, when you can design your own workspace, I mean, Chris, I wish

455
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,680
this was a video show for the first time in the 4,000 years we've been doing it.

456
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:50,480
Because I have the Coder 300 poster behind me, no disrespect to the 400, but as a gift

457
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,760
it was framed for me and it's like the backdrop I do for meetings.

458
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,960
And I set up my own little side bedroom in my house as the ideal workspace.

459
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,800
I have a kitchen, obviously it's my house, I have private bathrooms, I can take my lemur

460
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,880
out and work in the yard.

461
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,760
Other than not having childcare because of COVID, and maybe I'm going to be wrong, but

462
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,600
we'll tell this in a year because people can listen back to my Swift episode, very wrong.

463
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,680
I think, and mark me on this, I think next year or the following year, this work from

464
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,800
home trend for software developers in particular will be a net positive.

465
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,480
Because think about it, Microsoft, when it was founded, every developer basically had

466
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,240
either one office mate or by themselves.

467
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,040
So in a work from home situation, aren't we all just working basically by ourselves or

468
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,000
with a partner or a spouse, you know, who shares the space with us?

469
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,120
I mean, I got to tell you, I've written more code.

470
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,800
I mean, child interruptions, yes, are a thing for me, but I have written more code in the

471
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,040
last 10 months since I've been single, divorced.

472
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,000
This is the way to work, you know, not in the office.

473
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,360
If I could push an easy button and have it any way I want, it'd be a mix like this, what

474
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,120
I'm doing right now is better in the studio, but like all of the administrative stuff,

475
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,400
the emails, the sponsor calls, like the planning, I do that better from home.

476
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,720
It's just, you know, fancy me, but for me, it's better to have two different spaces to

477
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,180
work and I just do different work in each space, but I think there is a challenge for

478
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:41,000
some people that are working at home to not get distracted because you've got, you know,

479
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,400
maybe multiple monitors, maybe more monitors than you have at work and you got your chats

480
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,760
up on some of those screens and you got a browser with YouTube up, I mean, I'm just

481
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,560
describing myself, but right.

482
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
You have adium up.

483
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Yeah, of course.

484
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Right.

485
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Of course.

486
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,440
Somehow still getting it to run and you don't have, hey, that snow leopard container is

487
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
going strong.

488
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,440
That should be a thing.

489
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,360
I'm just saying I might make it a thing.

490
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:11,240
Don't tempt me so I could see it and then honestly I can't tell you how many times I've

491
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,720
been in a meeting where a developer is just basically listening to a bunch of other people

492
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,480
talk and I don't mean any disrespect because I have so much respect for people who have

493
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,860
design talent, but I have been in a lot of meetings where a designer will be going on

494
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:32,580
for a long time, um, or like a, like a, the planning person will be going on for a long

495
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,420
time or somebody who's kind of not really related to the rest of the work.

496
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:43,920
There's so many times where somebody will dominate several people's time and you then

497
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,080
shut you, you leave that meeting and you've got another one in an hour or an hour and

498
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,080
a half and it's not like you're going to, you're not, you know, you're not going to

499
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,360
get in the flow between those two meetings because not only are you thinking about that

500
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,120
upcoming meeting, which kind of screws with the flow, but you don't necessarily have enough

501
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,640
time cause you got to unwind from the meeting you were just in and then got to get a transition

502
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:10,420
and there's just like this kind of debt that all of these meetings, even if it's say two

503
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:17,020
or three a day, but it's often more and how, and so many of them just seem like an inappropriate

504
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,700
use of talented people's time.

505
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,160
And I'm not trying, I'm not trying to be cliche about this because I honestly, this is just

506
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,760
something I I've experienced myself and formed this opinion over time based on having many

507
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:37,480
clients and jobs now that I have experienced this and it leads to this sort of baseline

508
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,400
reduction in productivity because you get very little accomplished in the meetings that

509
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,120
couldn't have been accomplished via an email thread.

510
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,800
You get this white space between the meetings that prevents you from getting flow time so

511
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,620
you don't get anything super productive done and what you end up doing is having to cram

512
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,000
your flow time into these small little chunks of time throughout your week that are sometimes

513
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,440
at crazy hours because that's the only time people aren't around and it feels like you

514
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,360
end up doing a bunch of work that isn't actually the work of your main job and I don't know

515
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,960
if you've ever, you probably haven't, you probably have never worked anywhere that uses

516
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,200
the OKR system which is a system that Google and Intel came up with figuring out.

517
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Nope.

518
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Yeah.

519
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,720
So OKRs are a lot of fun, it's a great way for, the idea is kind of actually pretty solid.

520
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,760
It's an idea for an entire company to come up with objectives and key results that everybody

521
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
is striving towards.

522
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,040
The idea that everybody is sort of rowing in the same direction all the way down the

523
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,160
chain and people get key results.

524
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,320
Sorry, is this hell?

525
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,520
Yeah, I know.

526
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,200
And the problem with institutions, and I've been at several of them that implement OKRs,

527
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:49,280
is the OKRs become an entire job in themselves, managing everybody's objectives and key results,

528
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,600
going through and checking in on everybody's key results, auditing it, and then they get

529
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,560
incorporated into reviews and you end up with an entire job that is just managing the process

530
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,520
of doing your job.

531
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,180
And they may not, sometimes it's OKRs for other people, it's not OKRs, it's something

532
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:10,100
else for other shops, but it creates all of this wasted time.

533
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:16,360
So when I see only two hours, really two to three hours of productive time from UK office

534
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,160
workers, I think that contributes significantly to it because the people in that survey did

535
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,400
not consider that stuff productive uses of their time.

536
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,560
And you combine that then with just general procrastination, you know, needing to go to

537
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,460
the doctor or something's interesting happening in the news that has everybody's attention,

538
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,100
and it's a phenomenal, unbelievable amount of money, because that's where it all comes

539
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:45,920
back to, it's a phenomenal amount of money that corporations are burning in people time.

540
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,840
In Zoom calls and whatnot.

541
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
It's amazing.

542
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,640
And you see it in morale.

543
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,600
Oh, well, OK, yeah, at some level, isn't that just the business serving the process rather

544
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,560
than the process serving the business?

545
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,200
I think that and I think that's what contributes to this quite a bit is it becomes a lot about

546
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
the process.

547
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,920
Yeah, oh, you can tell it gets me fired up.

548
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
I mean, I feel sick.

549
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,200
I'm honestly nauseous right now.

550
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,400
I've been told by clients, oh, yeah, we're not like that.

551
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,080
And then I get into these meetings and I it's a balance.

552
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,080
I don't want to come across as like I'm against all this stuff because I've seen it done right

553
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
too.

554
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,360
But I tell you what, I could use a little more of that structure around here, though

555
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,160
the robe is moving along the international.

556
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,200
So it turns out, oh, Jesus Christ, we can't even go a week.

557
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,880
People want to know they want a robe update.

558
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,800
The thing is, like now they want their robes and they're on their way.

559
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,120
I think probably by next week you will have a pretty big update.

560
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,960
Here's something I learned in this process.

561
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,400
Lord take me, please.

562
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,000
There's like a couple of countries we just straight up can't ship to.

563
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,680
So there was like a handful of people we just couldn't ship to Iran.

564
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
Yeah, Iran was one.

565
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,620
It wasn't a lot of them, but we have listeners everywhere.

566
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,620
It's awesome.

567
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,660
We have listeners in countries.

568
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,480
It's literally illegal for us to ship to.

569
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
How cool is that?

570
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Did you know we have Iranian?

571
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,040
I mentioned Iran for a reason.

572
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,120
We have Iranian followers on social media.

573
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
Yeah.

574
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
How great is that?

575
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
I think it's pretty cool.

576
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,520
Maybe it could be U.S. U.S. citizens living there or it could be people trying to learn

577
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,560
English or people interested in the technology stack.

578
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,040
Either way, I just think it's great.

579
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Yeah.

580
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
I think it's great.

581
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
I wish we could send them a robe.

582
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,760
But we can't ship a robe there, unfortunately.

583
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
Without going to jail.

584
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
Yeah.

585
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,280
Also, a lot of countries' customs won't allow an item to come in without a phone number

586
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,120
on there.

587
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,320
So some of you are going to get my personal phone number as an Easter egg on here.

588
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,120
Please, for the love of God, send it to me.

589
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,640
I have a Twilio app ready to text them Jar Jar Giffies.

590
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,340
So just to give you, like, just here's an insight into all of the little background

591
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,060
gymnastics happening.

592
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,480
The compromise ended up being I put my personal phone number as the shipping phone number

593
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,880
to get these through customs.

594
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,400
Can you imagine the levels of conversations and amount of conversations we had to have

595
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,360
for that to be the final solution?

596
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,360
Yeah.

597
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
It's been a process.

598
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,920
I feel like someone told you robes were a bad idea.

599
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
I don't know.

600
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,760
I feel like at some point.

601
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
But go ahead and call me.

602
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
You know what?

603
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,240
If you got a robe and my phone number's on your shipping information, I'll take it.

604
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,120
Can I have your personal phone number?

605
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,400
You probably have it somewhere.

606
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,280
I'm sure I do, but who knows if I remember, right?

607
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,960
The truth of the matter is if you really want to get a hold of me, it's probably not by

608
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,160
the phone.

609
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,160
But I'll give you any number, baby.

610
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,880
So anyway, so the robes probably soon, probably have a bigger update for the robes soon.

611
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,920
I feel like actually legitimately learn something and I still feel like I got I got enough figured

612
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,480
out for like the next item.

613
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,400
So the next item I want to do, you know, besides like the standard stuff for the show is like

614
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,760
I want to do like some point something that maybe has multiple sizes or something.

615
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,920
So I can figure that that out like a like a quarter radio tuxedo.

616
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,040
Is that what we're looking at?

617
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,480
French coat or no, not no trench coats.

618
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
Columbine.

619
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Right.

620
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Right.

621
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
That killed the trench coat, didn't it?

622
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Kill the trench coat.

623
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,920
I think I think both you and I would look good in a trench coat.

624
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
I think we're trench coat.

625
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Yeah.

626
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,320
Well, you know, we're sort of plump, jaunty fellows.

627
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,320
Yeah.

628
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,320
Yeah.

629
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,640
As you get past 30, I think you qualify for a trench coat.

630
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
I mean, right.

631
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,720
So like in high school trench coat.

632
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Not awesome.

633
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,240
The guidance counselor wants to talk to you.

634
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Yes, totally.

635
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,440
When you're like 30, mid 30s or in your case, 40s.

636
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,440
Right.

637
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Yeah.

638
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
And it rains here.

639
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,440
Well, not not almost 40s, but not yet.

640
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Oh, OK.

641
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,760
I thought I thought you were within striking distance.

642
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,840
Let's just say the next birthday, I'm not going to be celebrating much.

643
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
I see.

644
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,880
OK, well, moving on.

645
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
It's close.

646
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
Yeah.

647
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
So about adium.

648
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,880
It's fantastic.

649
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,680
And I might actually contribute to open source.

650
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,880
And when I say contribute, I mean, do what every good open source contributor does, fork

651
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,960
it, ignore the maintainers and run my own version.

652
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,320
You need to get like an M1 version.

653
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
No, it works on the M1.

654
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,560
Yeah, but probably under Rosetta, right?

655
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
Yeah.

656
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
But that's not even the problem.

657
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:59,600
It doesn't scroll up when I get a new message because they changed the API for scrolling

658
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,680
of you like two years ago.

659
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,800
And adium was like, man, you ever listen to yourself and just think, man, I'm really just

660
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
the perfect Windows user.

661
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,480
Have you ever because that's such a Windows thing.

662
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,580
What you want is you want apps that run for a decade.

663
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,200
That's Windows, man.

664
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Or Solaris.

665
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,920
Oh, hang on.

666
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,280
Hang on.

667
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,080
I have my seltzer here.

668
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,520
Yeah, and no, it's not an alcoholic seltzer.

669
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,240
It's a sad Publix brand seltzer.

670
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,320
I tried a hard seltzer for the first time yesterday.

671
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Just a sampler.

672
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
It's like candy.

673
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Did you like it?

674
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
Well, it was just a just a sampler.

675
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
No, I didn't.

676
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
I didn't end up ordering it.

677
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
But I actually thought I don't know.

678
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,120
I mean, it felt like it was probably healthier for me than a beer.

679
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,680
But I ended up getting a cider.

680
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,320
I just like to go for gin and like send you messages at night.

681
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,600
Yeah, I think that's probably a healthier route to go than a few beers for, you know,

682
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
you look for the efficiency.

683
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,400
I think the bread, the calorie count in beer is higher.

684
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,920
But seriously, why wouldn't I just patch adium instead of like, I don't know, changing?

685
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
I don't want to change.

686
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,960
Are they up on, I know it's open source.

687
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,000
I don't know if they're up on GitHub.

688
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Source Forge, baby.

689
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Source.

690
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,400
It was last time I looked, but that might be unfair to them.

691
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,600
Datadog.com slash coder radio.

692
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,640
Analyze code level performance across your environment and troubleshoot issues faster

693
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
than ever.

694
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,880
This is what Datadog does.

695
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,440
It gives you visualizations and the ability to solve problems.

696
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,320
And these dashboards are gorgeous.

697
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,800
Go to datadog.com slash coder radio just to see what I'm talking about.

698
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,120
I think what's great is Datadog's continuous profiler.

699
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,400
It automatically collects profiles from your production servers all the time.

700
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,460
So then you can go back and analyze your data quickly with minimal overhead right when you

701
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,460
need it.

702
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,300
You get a unified picture of your environment by correlating code performance metrics with

703
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,500
your server metrics from the low level server to containers and applications all the way

704
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,800
up with real time dashboards.

705
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,840
And with lots of nice quick integrations that get you up and running with different stacks

706
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,000
immediately, things like tracing and log management and of course that continuous profile, you

707
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,520
bring it all into one platform.

708
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,720
You're seeing the beauty of this when you can pull data from different sources, visualize

709
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,580
it immediately.

710
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,340
Datadog enables you to pinpoint the root cause of issues faster than ever and communicate

711
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,720
that with your team.

712
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,060
So go try it for free.

713
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,620
They got a 14 day trial and you can support the show when you do it.

714
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,800
So go to datadog.com slash coder radio.

715
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,960
You go there for a limited time.

716
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,840
If you start a free trial and you create a dashboard, you'll get a free t-shirt and I'll

717
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,200
tell you what, it's been a little while since I've gotten a free swag item.

718
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,080
That sounds kind of fun and you get to see how gorgeous and easy to roll out these dashboards

719
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,080
are.

720
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,200
So go try it out right now, datadog.com slash coder radio.

721
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,140
Thanks to everybody who supports the show by going to datadog.com slash coder radio

722
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,320
and thanks to Datadog for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

723
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,980
Well, you feel like solving some problems?

724
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:56,160
We have an email that perhaps we could lend our wisdom towards, sort of point it like

725
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
a superhero ray.

726
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,840
Sure, why not?

727
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,920
Justin writes in, he says, he says, I love SUSE and I want Linux Action News to do more

728
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,640
SUSE content and Linux Unplugged to have all the SUSE developers on.

729
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,960
Justin, you're correct.

730
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
End of email.

731
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Got it, Chris.

732
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,360
I took care of it while you had your drink.

733
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,200
All right, moving on.

734
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,020
Actually he says he is excited about Coder Bytes or Coder Tails now.

735
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,360
Well let's wait for the US trademark office before he does anything else stupid.

736
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,160
So he says, I think he's got kids, I think he's going to have them watch some of it.

737
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,680
But he says what he wanted to write in about was the Snake in the Room episode 393.

738
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:40,280
He said, I think the business rationale that Mike laid out to move to Python is totally

739
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
agreeable.

740
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,280
It makes a lot of sense.

741
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,360
I went to university and I've been migrating legacy bash, TCL, Perl, Python 2 ticketing

742
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,640
systems built on top of a flat file database from a Unix mail handler to a proper database

743
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:58,000
driven system with a Python 3 API and React JS front end, as well as all brand new shiny

744
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,480
command line interfaces.

745
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,640
I have to say, Python makes this buttery smooth.

746
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,520
In comparison to the old system, it makes it smooth.

747
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,880
And that helps soften the edge for adoption and all of this runs on CentOS 6 where I have

748
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,240
issues running debugging tools because it's so old.

749
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,920
Anyways, he says he completely agrees with me on Plasma.

750
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,600
He thinks it's currently the superior desktop environment compared to GNOME on technical

751
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
merits.

752
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,280
However, and he's absolutely right here, Justin says that GNOME has the backing of major companies

753
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,760
like Red Hat, Canonical, System76 and more.

754
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,620
He thinks it's a Betamax versus VHS fight.

755
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,160
And I think he's implying that Plasma is Betamax.

756
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,580
He says there's other great projects like elementary OSes, Pantheon or Mate or even XFCE.

757
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,960
But the reality is that really the backing is behind GNOME.

758
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
And he's right.

759
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,960
It's been on my mind recently.

760
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,740
But he has a question for us.

761
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:55,640
As a visually impaired UX software developer or tech humanizer, as I like to call it, he

762
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,400
says, who uses a hackintosh, he says, yes, I hope it's running Snow Leopard, maybe I

763
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,480
need to move away from Mac OS before my Intel rig is totally unsupported.

764
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,360
I want to move to some Linux distribution, but no desktop or distro has everything I

765
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,360
need to do my job.

766
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,220
This is in part because of accessibility software like a screen magnifier that works the way

767
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,920
visually impaired person can use it.

768
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,560
But more importantly, buying of business applications like a real desktop mail program, a real desktop

769
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,360
calendar, and a single well-developed theme that doesn't bork between toolkits or glitch

770
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,240
when I use a magnifier would be great.

771
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,560
I recognize this as a community effort.

772
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,840
And if I want these changes, I got to work on them myself, but I don't even know where

773
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,920
to start.

774
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,720
If you were 20 again, but today and you wanted to contribute features you needed to use a

775
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,080
platform, what platform would you pick?

776
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,720
And how would you get started?

777
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,360
You better answer first.

778
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,680
Wow, that's a huge question.

779
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,680
And part of me kind of went like, well, maybe, I mean, maybe is it worth considering Mac

780
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,680
OS?

781
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,680
That's what I was gonna say.

782
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,680
Just buy a MacBook Air and be done.

783
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,240
You know, and they have great accessibility features.

784
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,480
But then I got what he's saying.

785
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:08,040
He's like, but Justin's in a position where he could develop software, he could contribute

786
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,560
to this area, he's willing to do it.

787
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,960
And he's young enough that he has the time to burn.

788
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,400
That is actually like talk about like the sweet spot, right?

789
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Like, if anybody was actually going to make a positive contribution to a free desktop

790
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,920
to improve its accessibility, it sounds like somebody that's exactly in his position.

791
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,040
You know, I love the system 76 folks, but I would actually say hook up elementary.

792
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,280
I think I think Cass, I mean, I can't speak for people, but I think that they would be

793
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,480
open to any contributions for this.

794
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,320
Yeah, you could definitely start there.

795
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,900
I wonder if I wonder if it also be worth considering going further upstream to somebody like the

796
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,240
GNOME project because Justin makes the point in here that GNOME has like some of the major

797
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
backing.

798
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
Well, true.

799
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
That would make sense.

800
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,960
Yeah, maybe somebody you got to you got to figure to like this almost feels like in the

801
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
right timing.

802
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,080
This could be a good Google summer of code sponsored project to contribute.

803
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
No, you're right.

804
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
It should be like GNOME.

805
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,080
Really?

806
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,680
It should be higher, higher up the stack than than a pantheon.

807
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,320
Get into GTK and then the distros downstream can take advantage of it may just adopt it

808
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
by default.

809
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,080
Yeah, you know, I mean, like Google, this seems like something Google would sponsor

810
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,480
like as a summer of code event like there are there's got to be people out there.

811
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,000
You mean alphabet, right?

812
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's a great idea.

813
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I love this idea.

814
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,800
I mean, I tell you what, don't do this on the air because get you in trouble.

815
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,800
But let's do it.

816
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,080
Anyway, write something for accessibility.

817
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,080
That's not easy.

818
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,760
So email me, email me, man.

819
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,360
And there's a Thalia in it for you.

820
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,360
Wow.

821
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,720
But it's got to be completely free software.

822
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,680
It's got to go either to GNOME or a similar organization.

823
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,320
It can be so long as it's like GPL or the hippies will tell me what's real free software.

824
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,920
Yeah, but it can't be like BSD, I guess, I guess BSD is BSD free.

825
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,880
Wouldn't it be something or contribute, you know, look at see what about contributing

826
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,560
to an existing project that's out there.

827
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,680
But yeah, that's what I'm saying.

828
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,640
Like like fix text rendering in, you know, I don't know.

829
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Yeah.

830
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,240
You know, you mentioned there was that problem with themes when you when you zoom in.

831
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,440
And is that is that the problem of an application or so?

832
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
That's it.

833
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Fix the theme thing.

834
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
There's a Thalia in it for you.

835
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
Wow.

836
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
On the Mad Botter Inc.

837
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
That'd be pretty great.

838
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,760
And, you know, it's a good charitable thing to have because there's it just would benefit

839
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,240
so many more people to Justin.

840
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,000
So if you are one of those rare people in that position, if you've got the time, the

841
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,000
will, the interest and the empathy of the situation, man, that's pretty pretty amazing.

842
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Really.

843
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,200
I think it's pretty great.

844
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Just real fast.

845
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,680
I have to say this for the state of California.

846
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,680
This is not a lottery.

847
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
All right.

848
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
Right.

849
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
Yes.

850
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
I got in trouble last Earth Day.

851
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,680
I had a little fun.

852
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
Not a lottery.

853
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,420
How classic, Mike, is it that you got in trouble with something to do with California?

854
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,600
Like that's that's classic.

855
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,000
I continue to get in legal trouble in the state of California where I have only been

856
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,320
like four times, like for a week at a time.

857
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,000
But I stay out of here.

858
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That's what they're saying to you.

859
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,720
We don't like your kind son.

860
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Man oh man.

861
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,720
Yeah.

862
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
But I'm not joking.

863
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,720
Seriously.

864
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,840
If you do that, there's a Thalia in it for you.

865
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,200
Shameless marketing on my side because that's who I am.

866
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,080
Chris taught me, you know, he's old.

867
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,320
He's like 47 now.

868
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
Feels like it.

869
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,320
I'm a young 33.

870
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,640
Yeah, so I'm actually kind of worried that sometimes it feels like I am.

871
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:27,200
I'm like, geez, if it gets much worse than this, I really thought you were in your 50s.

872
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,720
I'm totally joking.

873
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,360
Sometimes I feel like it.

874
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,880
Sometimes I feel like I'm the Commodore 64.

875
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
I do that.

876
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,800
I do the kid math, you know, because I got three of the stinkers and my youngest is seven.

877
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,000
So I'll do the kid math sometimes and OK, so I'm going to be I'll be this old.

878
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I'll be OK.

879
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
OK, so I got it.

880
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,200
I got to start treating myself better.

881
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,360
That way I have the energy to keep going when I'm in my 50s and I'm kid free.

882
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:54,800
I have been drinking this crazy, crazy ass vegetable juice, vegetable fruit elderberry

883
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
smoothie.

884
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Oh, yeah.

885
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,120
I've heard good things about elderberries changed my life.

886
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,120
Really?

887
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,880
I start my day with the taste of ass in my mouth.

888
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,080
Oh, it's not good tasting elderberries.

889
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
Yeah.

890
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
Yeah.

891
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
What's it called?

892
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Matt's.

893
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,080
It's actually called Matt's.

894
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,080
Oh, my God.

895
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,840
I wish I could go to my fridge, but everything would fall off my desk if I got up.

896
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,080
Matt's super juice.

897
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,200
Super immune juice.

898
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,440
See, Uncle Matt's elderberry juice.

899
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,480
That's something else, huh?

900
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
Not Uncle Matt.

901
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Might be Uncle Matt.

902
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
I don't know.

903
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
It's like pink.

904
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,720
OK, so you got the anyways, you get the.

905
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
Oh, yeah, that's right.

906
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,440
Elderberry supposed to be good for the old immune system.

907
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,560
Well, because my kid like there's not a disease in school that he hasn't met that he didn't

908
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,560
like.

909
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,360
I mean, he's like, yeah, let me go up to dad and kill him.

910
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,500
He only has to the only you know, the only thing is when dad gets sick is he only has

911
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,720
to continue to work and do everything he had to do.

912
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,120
But this time he has to do it sick.

913
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
That's the only thing.

914
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,120
That's no big deal.

915
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,520
There is nothing like having your your spacebar lock up because you just spit mucus right

916
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,720
into it.

917
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,360
Happens to even non butterfly keyboards.

918
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,600
I am back on the code keyboard because you need something that can handle mucus, man.

919
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,360
You got to you need some distance.

920
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,360
That's what you need.

921
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
Get out.

922
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,360
Get your mouth out of that keyboard.

923
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,320
Hey, listen, if you have the implant, I'm ready to go.

924
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,760
But we should move on because we're getting to the end of our night.

925
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
All right.

926
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,000
You know, we you know, we haven't done for a couple of weeks.

927
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
We haven't thanked our members.

928
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,080
I want to say thank you to our Coder QA team.

929
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,160
You guys are great out there.

930
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,400
You get the limited ad feed.

931
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,060
You get which is fancy, right?

932
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:26,280
So that way you get just the just the show limited ads.

933
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
But you know what?

934
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,320
You also get the quarterly.

935
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
You know what?

936
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
Just so that way you get the quarterly, too.

937
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,600
We know we had oh, yeah, we just took it there and we put it in there.

938
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,600
We put it in the feed and you can sign up at Coder QA dot co.

939
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,000
And then once a quarter, you get the quarterly.

940
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,840
And we just we just stick it in your feet.

941
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,920
We just stick it in your feet in the limited ad feed where you have the limited ads.

942
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,520
We stick it in your feet and that's where you get it or we'll put it up for download

943
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,520
as well.

944
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
That can happen, too.

945
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,840
Mr. Dominic, is there anything you'd like to mention before we get out of here?

946
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,960
No, but Earth Day is coming up and there'll be yet another Thaleo on offer for me because

947
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,520
I think Thaleos are the entry way to drugs to good programming.

948
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,840
So by the way, they have a new one out, the Mira.

949
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,840
Yeah.

950
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,520
I like the small one and the big one, and it's totally the one I would go for.

951
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,120
So don't tell my good friend Carl, but it's the one they should have built the first time

952
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,080
instead of the one.

953
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,320
Yeah, I kind of think so, too.

954
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,960
I've heard the decibel difference and they have several improvements into that area.

955
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,880
But the only thing now is I got to start budgeting because I do want to replace my desktop PC

956
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
this year.

957
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,080
But the GPU prices are crazy.

958
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,080
It's not their fault.

959
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,960
Now, that's not them, though.

960
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:45,800
Some a**hole has Asus, and Drew, I am so sorry tonight, has Asusa facility in Plant City,

961
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:54,160
Florida, running five Mac Minis, two Thaleos, and several rack servers mining Dogecoin right

962
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,160
now.

963
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,560
Get the hell out of here.

964
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,040
What kind of monster would do that?

965
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,040
Dogecoin.

966
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,680
I'm not joking.

967
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,720
I am in the Doge.

968
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,000
To a disturbing degree.

969
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,960
Is there something great about it that I don't know?

970
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,480
Can you trade it for other cryptos or what is it?

971
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,880
I've either become enlightened or I've had a psychological breakdown.

972
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,880
So we'll see.

973
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,880
OK.

974
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,520
I mean, I think Wes likes the Doge, too.

975
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,440
So well, if Wes likes it and I like it, I think he dabbles in the Doge, then it's probably

976
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
OK.

977
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,540
Yeah, if he's into the Doge, then I'm safe.

978
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,600
It's usually when Wes tells me I'm crazy that I'm in bad shape.

979
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,860
Or he's had some sort of break and you guys have just broken at a similar time.

980
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:38,920
It would be scary if Wes was becoming more like me because that's.

981
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
He's our straight man.

982
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,920
Right.

983
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
He is the straight man of the network.

984
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,920
Really?

985
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,920
Yeah.

986
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,920
Like the rest of us are psychos.

987
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
I know.

988
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
Maniacs all over the place.

989
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,400
Wes is like, well, it's not that bad.

990
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,400
Calm down.

991
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
You know, it's OK.

992
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,400
He's always so rational.

993
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,400
He's always like, calm.

994
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,920
You and I are like, fuck them.

995
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
We hate them.

996
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
Hey, you know what?

997
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,920
It's what makes makes for content.

998
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
You know, you got to have a straight man.

999
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,880
You got to have a straight man in the group.

1000
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,240
So I would assume you're going to be tweeting at Dumanuco for that Thaleo stuff.

1001
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,040
And the company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

1002
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,040
Absolutely.

1003
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,040
I'm over there, too.

1004
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,040
I'm at Chris LAS.

1005
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,160
And the whole gosh darn podcast network is at Jupiter Signal.

1006
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:17,040
And this here podcast, this one, this one right here, it's at Coder Radio Show.

1007
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,040
It's got its own Twitter.

1008
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,040
It's got its own Twitter.

1009
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,040
