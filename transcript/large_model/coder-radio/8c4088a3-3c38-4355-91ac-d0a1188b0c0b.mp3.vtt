This is Koda Radio, episode 433, for September 27th?

00:16.000 --> 00:20.360
Hello friends, and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.360 --> 00:24.080
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.080 --> 00:27.960
This here episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru, you know Cloud Guru has those cloud

00:27.960 --> 00:32.880
playgrounds, Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud sandboxes on their credit card, not yours.

00:32.880 --> 00:38.040
So go get certified, get hired, get learning, at acloudguru.com.

00:38.040 --> 00:42.960
So I'm Chris, and of course we are joined every single week by our esteemed host, the

00:42.960 --> 00:45.280
man in Florida himself, Mr. Dominic.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.280
What's up?

00:46.280 --> 00:47.280
Hello.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.280
Hey girl.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.280
Oh hey, how you doing?

00:49.280 --> 00:50.280
I am good.

00:50.280 --> 00:55.440
I have been coding to the bone, Python baby, all day, all night.

00:55.440 --> 01:00.240
Well it seems like you're doing three things, I'll spoil the third one last, but I do know

01:00.240 --> 01:04.360
number one is Python, number two is bitching about Safari on Twitter, I know you're getting

01:04.360 --> 01:05.760
in on that a lot.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.680
Every time I change tabs, it's like a psychedelic adventure, I don't understand why.

01:09.680 --> 01:10.680
Oots, oots, oots.

01:10.680 --> 01:14.600
Yeah, you're at the disco when you're browsing the web now, I think it's brave.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.960
But the third is the most important, and we just gotta get to it at the top of the show,

01:17.960 --> 01:22.640
we can't delay anymore, according to Twitter, you now have a kitty cat.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.200
I do have a kitty cat.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.200
Wow, congratulations.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.560
Thank you, I've had a kitty cat for about a month, but I don't think I've ever shared

01:27.560 --> 01:28.800
that I have a kitty cat.

01:28.800 --> 01:33.280
He is the most savage, savage of QA personnel.

01:33.280 --> 01:37.560
Yeah, you gotta put him on the payroll for tax purposes, I totally understand.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.480
If the code is bad enough, he just takes a quick nap on my launch keyboard and deletes

01:41.480 --> 01:42.480
a file or two.

01:42.480 --> 01:45.640
I just kinda take umbrage with the fact that you've had a kitty for a month and this is

01:45.640 --> 01:47.120
the first time it came up on the show.

01:47.120 --> 01:51.120
I'm sorry, you know what, I just, there's so much going on, I'm God willing, I'm launching

01:51.120 --> 01:56.760
something by or more likely on the 15th of October, but you know, developers and estimates

01:56.760 --> 01:57.760
always fun.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.720
We could blame the audience for yelling at us for last week and just threw us off our

02:00.720 --> 02:01.720
game.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.780
Yeah, you know, I just cried for like a week, really, that's what happened.

02:04.780 --> 02:08.720
Just really super briefly, and I mean this, I mentioned last week that I was really looking

02:08.720 --> 02:13.040
forward to trying out the new focus feature on iOS 15.

02:13.040 --> 02:17.840
As a man who is deeply challenged with his ADHD, I have to say focus mode has been great,

02:17.840 --> 02:23.360
and what really put it over the top is when I combine it with shortcuts and NFC tags.

02:23.360 --> 02:28.680
So I have an NFC tag here on my mixer in the studio, and I have it set to when I put my

02:28.680 --> 02:35.120
phone down, which is, this mixer, oddly enough, has a phone holder, it has a spot for your

02:35.120 --> 02:40.280
phone and so I put the NFC tag in that spot, and when I set my phone down in its little

02:40.280 --> 02:45.700
spot here, it automatically sets it to recording mode, which is so brilliant, and you can do

02:45.700 --> 02:50.120
shortcuts in a way where it doesn't prompt you, it just does it, and then I have it set

02:50.120 --> 02:54.720
to just automatically turn off when I leave, and it's been great.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.720
It has been.

02:55.720 --> 03:00.000
That is choice, and so I'm gonna put a little NFC tag at my desk and a little NFC tag on

03:00.000 --> 03:03.720
my way out to the car, and I'll just tap it as I'm going there or I get to my desk and

03:03.720 --> 03:07.720
set the different modes, and I never even have to touch a button on the phone, I just

03:07.720 --> 03:09.760
put it where I was gonna set the phone down anyways.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.520
It's pretty slick.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.520
That is pretty cool.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.720
I mean, you could do this, I bet you could build this with Android.

03:15.720 --> 03:19.520
If you use Tasker or you built, you know, you strung together several apps, you could

03:19.520 --> 03:22.640
have probably done this on Android like a year ago, two years ago.

03:22.640 --> 03:26.880
Yeah, but really, I mean, do you wanna build it with Android?

03:26.880 --> 03:29.520
No, it was so, I did it in five seconds, really.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.680
I just sit in here experimenting, like, oh, on shortcuts, I'll go to automations, oh,

03:32.680 --> 03:33.680
boop, boop, done.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.680
Oh, wow, that's nice.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.620
So yeah, I thought it was pretty great.

03:38.620 --> 03:45.400
We have more feedback this week regarding fair pay and the struggles with that and Apple

03:45.400 --> 03:46.960
has been in the news in this regard.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.940
That's how we got into this entire conversation to begin with.

03:49.940 --> 03:54.040
Right after the show last week, I think, Tim Cook had like a big workplace meeting, you

03:54.040 --> 03:57.280
know, where everybody was either, I don't know how many of them were actually in person,

03:57.280 --> 04:01.840
but you know, they all get on the Zoom call, or I guess it's WebEx in their case.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.760
And they have the senior vice president of retail there because that's something that

04:05.760 --> 04:09.320
doesn't come up in our conversation a lot, but a big part of this is actually coming

04:09.320 --> 04:11.480
from the retail space in Apple.

04:11.480 --> 04:15.800
That's where a lot of this fair pay pushback is coming from is retail workers.

04:15.800 --> 04:20.400
I'm sure it's true for people that are working at the UFO or that work in development areas

04:20.400 --> 04:25.520
too, but that's actually in terms of the large segment of the Apple population that's pissed

04:25.520 --> 04:26.700
off.

04:26.700 --> 04:31.880
And so they had the senior vice president of retail there and people and they addressed

04:31.880 --> 04:36.400
a range of subjects, even like political subjects, but according to the activist employees that

04:36.400 --> 04:41.520
have been leaking, they told various publications that Tim Cook answered only two out of a number

04:41.520 --> 04:44.280
of questions that they wanted to ask about fair pay.

04:44.280 --> 04:51.440
And then really, they said, just failed to deliver any details on what his answers were.

04:51.440 --> 04:56.040
And then of course, Apple said it was committed to pay equity, but you know, we got an email

04:56.040 --> 04:59.560
into the show and I think it kind of put it in a little more perspective for me.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.200
It seems like people are like exasperated.

05:02.200 --> 05:09.520
And I think that's why the tone of a lot of the feedback was so charged because people

05:09.520 --> 05:11.240
are at a breaking point with this.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.240
Yeah, I think that's fair.

05:12.240 --> 05:17.160
And also, you know, I don't understand what Apple thought they were going to accomplish

05:17.160 --> 05:18.160
with that.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.160
I know.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.160
It seems like they should do better.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.160
Yeah.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.760
Or it seems like they should just like give up, right?

05:23.760 --> 05:24.760
Like stop talking.

05:24.760 --> 05:31.880
Like if they really want to change things and you know, not have these problems, I think

05:31.880 --> 05:35.320
obviously and I forget her name, but I've interacted with her on Twitter, I feel like

05:35.320 --> 05:36.320
such a jerk.

05:36.320 --> 05:40.320
But like the cases where like they take employees phones, and like they make you put your personal

05:40.320 --> 05:43.120
stuff including photos.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.920
And that's like your work device.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.920
And there's a couple cases of this have been documented where it's like, very intimate,

05:48.920 --> 05:54.120
very personal data ends up just like, you know, all your data is mine, copyright Apple

05:54.120 --> 05:55.520
if you work for them, right?

05:55.520 --> 05:57.640
That probably needs to be a practice that doesn't exist.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.440
Yeah, the verge had a great article.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.620
And I thought this was common sense, but apparently it's not.

06:02.620 --> 06:07.920
Even if you're working from home, your employer's laptop is their laptop.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.320
Anything you put on it, they have every right to monitor blah, blah, blah, right?

06:11.320 --> 06:13.300
So buy a laptop.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.700
If we have time today, I grabbed a store you and I are on the same exact page.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.880
If we have time, I grabbed a series of studies about that.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.040
And anyways, I'd love to talk more about that.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.040
Yeah.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.040
That's a whole other thing, isn't it?

06:24.040 --> 06:25.040
You're on your land.

06:25.040 --> 06:28.040
And then you have to the question becomes like, what are they if they own them, if they

06:28.040 --> 06:32.240
own that network interface, well, then are they allowed to capture whatever they want

06:32.240 --> 06:33.240
from it?

06:33.240 --> 06:35.480
You know, there's a lot of there's a lot of questions I have about that.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.760
Yeah, I think that's a much murkier area.

06:37.760 --> 06:43.080
But they can certainly say, Hey, man, you're using your work laptop, and you put whatever

06:43.080 --> 06:45.800
things you didn't want us to see on there too bad, so sad.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.140
That's a common hammer that they can hit you with.

06:49.140 --> 06:52.080
And you got to think about it, especially too, if you're developing your own thing,

06:52.080 --> 06:55.360
like if you have a little side project, you got to make sure you're not using any work

06:55.360 --> 06:56.360
hardware for that.

06:56.360 --> 06:57.360
No work resources.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.520
Well, that was the plot of a season of Silicon Valley, right?

06:59.520 --> 07:04.680
Richard Hendricks accident spoilers for something that came out years ago, like his MacBook

07:04.680 --> 07:06.080
died and was in the Apple Store.

07:06.080 --> 07:11.440
So he used one of who leaves his his, you know, who he issued a laptop.

07:11.440 --> 07:15.360
And I mean, of course, as a dramatization, but that is a thing that happens to people

07:15.360 --> 07:17.040
like never all the time, man.

07:17.040 --> 07:21.280
I know, I know more than a few people that that has happened to.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.880
Like, I take this a lot further.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.320
I think everybody like if you want to have a blog, don't be on medium.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.360
Don't don't be any of these services.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.360
Yeah.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.360
Spin up your own domain.

07:30.360 --> 07:35.760
Have your own thing on only IP down to literally the IP address.

07:35.760 --> 07:36.760
Right.

07:36.760 --> 07:41.600
Like, you know, that is the thing is so many people that wrote in were exasperated because

07:41.600 --> 07:47.440
they feel like they are at the mercy of this employer, and they have no ownership.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.720
They have no say on what go is what going on, what's going on.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.620
And because their livelihood and their whole lifestyle and feeding their family all depends

07:54.620 --> 07:58.280
on it, it is it is extremely stressful for them.

07:58.280 --> 08:01.880
And a lot of these emails, I was reading it, I was starting to think to myself, yes, that's

08:01.880 --> 08:03.720
why I run my own business.

08:03.720 --> 08:07.720
Even though I was employed for a while, I went back to running my own business.

08:07.720 --> 08:11.240
Because it's the only it's the only way you really have control over the situation.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.000
And I don't think it's for everybody.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.440
And I'm not trying to advocate everybody quit their job.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.480
The opposite, actually.

08:16.480 --> 08:21.040
But that that that kind of control and that kind of ownership is, I think, what drives

08:21.040 --> 08:24.440
a lot of people to run their own business.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.840
And there's not an option for everybody.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.240
So I grok that it's a it's a really it's it's a real rock in a hard spot.

08:31.240 --> 08:35.640
And, you know, it's funny, too, with Apple in this particular case.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.200
They could quite literally pay to make this problem go away.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.360
And they could afford it like that's the wild thing here.

08:41.360 --> 08:45.680
And it really kind of shows you the core characteristic of Apple, the way we see it through their

08:45.680 --> 08:50.320
app store policies and their and their grifting on in-app purchases for stuff that they don't

08:50.320 --> 08:56.080
really even add value to that kind of culture also is pervasive in how they pay their staff,

08:56.080 --> 08:58.600
because they are so rich.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.840
They could truly just justify if I mean, be honest with yourself.

09:01.840 --> 09:06.440
If they gave everyone a 25 percent raise tomorrow.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.880
All these leaks go away.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.000
These problems all go away.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.040
And Apple could look at it as an investment in brand.

09:13.040 --> 09:17.760
They're not going to do it because they don't like the idea of increasing their ongoing

09:17.760 --> 09:18.760
costs like that.

09:18.760 --> 09:22.800
They're very, you know, they're very cutthroat when it comes to cost.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.380
And that's just too high of a cost.

09:24.380 --> 09:30.320
But they not only literally could afford to do it, but they could actually I mean, how

09:30.320 --> 09:34.880
often you have the you have the option of your problems go away if you just write a

09:34.880 --> 09:35.880
check.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.640
And that's exactly the position they're in.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.740
And they still refuse to write that check.

09:39.740 --> 09:43.960
And if you're Apple, you know, me or you have a problem that could be solved with the check.

09:43.960 --> 09:47.300
It's, you know, the cost benefits kind of kind of rough.

09:47.300 --> 09:51.480
But for them, it's like, I don't know, aren't they richer than most or almost every country?

09:51.480 --> 09:52.480
Yeah.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.600
So Ben thinks that we kind of missed connecting on the core issues as I work for an enterprise

09:55.600 --> 09:59.560
software company in a multibillion dollar market with fewer than five or major major

09:59.560 --> 10:03.480
players who doesn't want to give us too much information because he thinks he could actually

10:03.480 --> 10:05.600
kind of get fired for even talking to us about this.

10:05.600 --> 10:10.440
But he says the thing that I can't get away from is that my boss can fire me whenever

10:10.440 --> 10:11.940
they like for any reason.

10:11.940 --> 10:16.500
And they conclude with other huge corporations to limit the opportunities if we quit.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.640
But I can't make them bargain collectively.

10:18.640 --> 10:22.800
I can't even take them to court or really do anything other than individual arbitration.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.360
And good luck with that.

10:24.360 --> 10:28.440
I hope you can forgive me, but I'm a little exhausted by being asked to see these things

10:28.440 --> 10:31.360
from the business owner's point of view.

10:31.360 --> 10:38.480
He also joked that he was told by a by a younger dev recently that an iOS code base was so

10:38.480 --> 10:42.200
old because it contained Objective C code.

10:42.200 --> 10:49.800
Well if your younger dev needs a old, wrinkled, experienced hand, you know where to go.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.940
Let's just forget about the core issue you emailed about.

10:51.940 --> 10:56.160
Let's talk about that Objective C project.

10:56.160 --> 10:59.760
Charlie wrote in saying, you know, I actually appreciate the comments recently.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.480
The small business point of view needs to be heard.

11:02.480 --> 11:07.080
And I don't think you guys should be shy or apologize for doing it.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.440
I mean, I appreciate at least that as well.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.800
And like the point you made last week, too, is that you and I are such in a different

11:13.800 --> 11:17.480
world than, you know, these oil companies or these huge tech companies.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.720
It's just a totally different thing.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.680
You and I agonize over the purchase of a laptop.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.080
Well, OK, you agonize over the purchase of a laptop.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.880
I just simply accidentally destroy one and get a new one.

11:25.880 --> 11:30.080
All right, well, let's see if we can't help out a listener.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.120
So David is tempted to make a career jump, but wants to get our take first.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.560
He says, I'm based in Scotland, and it's horrible.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.400
And I've been working as a mixed sysadmin network engineer role in numerous companies

11:39.400 --> 11:41.280
over the past decade.

11:41.280 --> 11:45.200
Where I can, though, I've been moving to automate things as much as possible.

11:45.200 --> 11:48.840
And don't get me wrong, the current company I'm with is totally on board with me doing

11:48.840 --> 11:49.840
that.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.160
And they'll give me the time that they can, but eventually things always keep slipping

11:53.160 --> 11:56.600
back to the old ways of managing the infrastructure.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.040
And it very much is one of those the company views that is pay the bills first and then

12:00.040 --> 12:02.480
do the automation stuff secondly.

12:02.480 --> 12:07.560
However, reflecting on what I want these days and why I wrote this in, it's increasingly

12:07.560 --> 12:11.000
evident to me that I want to write automation and infrastructure to the point of doing it

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
full time.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.920
I've always been this way, and I guess this sits somewhere between the different roles

12:15.920 --> 12:18.040
that I have now, unfortunately.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.680
Do you think maybe there's just an element of me looking over at the grass and seeing

12:21.680 --> 12:23.320
it greener over there?

12:23.320 --> 12:26.820
Am I just going to enter into a whole other world of pain?

12:26.820 --> 12:30.320
Or maybe it's time to move into a role that ticks these boxes for me.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.320
What do you guys think?

12:31.320 --> 12:32.320
P.S.

12:32.320 --> 12:35.720
I didn't order a robe, and I'm sort of regretting it for the coming winter months.

12:35.720 --> 12:36.720
Cheers, David.

12:36.720 --> 12:37.720
Well, you should regret it.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.360
I just hate to break it to you, David.

12:39.360 --> 12:42.880
The robes is sometimes I just lay on the couch in my robe.

12:42.880 --> 12:43.880
It's glorious.

12:43.880 --> 12:48.560
Thinking about how I could ever have survived without my Coderradio limited edition robe.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.840
You weren't living until you had the robe, I understand.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.400
No, there was no life.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.440
So he has got a couple of questions in there.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.260
Yeah, you are just asking for another world of pain.

12:57.260 --> 12:58.720
No doubt about it.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.160
Doesn't necessarily mean it's bad pain.

13:00.160 --> 13:05.840
I mean, sometimes learning and just grinding through the process of doing things wrong

13:05.840 --> 13:09.840
and then figuring out the right way to do it is slightly painful, but I guess this is

13:09.840 --> 13:12.760
one of those times where no pain, no gain kind of applies.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.800
What do you think about this idea, though, of throwing out the perfectly good pain job

13:16.800 --> 13:21.760
that doesn't quite satisfy you and switching it up, going out into the job market and finding

13:21.760 --> 13:24.560
something in an area that you don't have much experience with?

13:24.560 --> 13:27.480
I would definitely find that new role first, right?

13:27.480 --> 13:29.080
But no, I don't know.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.560
Growth is painful, but growth is ultimately good.

13:31.560 --> 13:36.320
If David, you really feel strong about this and if you felt this way for some time, right,

13:36.320 --> 13:41.320
not like a weekend whim or something, then why don't you just, you know, poke around,

13:41.320 --> 13:42.320
see if you can get something.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.320
Yeah.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.760
Obviously, you need to make it work financially for you.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.920
So yeah, you don't want to take a huge pay cut, I get it.

13:48.920 --> 13:49.920
But who knows?

13:49.920 --> 13:50.920
Maybe you'll make more.

13:50.920 --> 13:51.920
Maybe.

13:51.920 --> 13:55.480
I don't know exactly what, you know, what your situation is, but I would at least do

13:55.480 --> 13:57.840
the research and dip my toe in a little.

13:57.840 --> 14:01.440
And I wonder if David, if you're not miserable, because, you know, sometimes people write

14:01.440 --> 14:05.760
us in and they're really at the point of they've already been burnt out for a really long time

14:05.760 --> 14:08.520
and so they need to take immediate action.

14:08.520 --> 14:14.480
If you are not feeling that way, if you could build yourself an off ramp, you might consider

14:14.480 --> 14:20.160
looking at like a year plan where you end up doing a little bit of this on the side

14:20.160 --> 14:21.300
as a project.

14:21.300 --> 14:27.500
Maybe you donate time to a local business, a local cause, a church, an open source project.

14:27.500 --> 14:32.640
You build something yourself and you get yourself in a position where you actually have a little

14:32.640 --> 14:36.880
bit of skin in that game where, you know, your mistakes actually matter a little bit,

14:36.880 --> 14:39.920
but you're not going to lose your job, obviously, because this is a side thing.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.880
And see if you can't build and cultivate that for a year, because not only will that give

14:43.880 --> 14:47.560
you an opportunity to scratch the edge immediately and let you test to see if you really like

14:47.560 --> 14:50.760
it, but you're also going to network during that time.

14:50.760 --> 14:56.960
And you may end up through that process finding a connection that secures you a job that allows

14:56.960 --> 15:01.060
you to transition cleanly without missing a paycheck.

15:01.060 --> 15:03.560
And that, I think, would be a real nice route to go.

15:03.560 --> 15:08.680
And infrastructure management is one of those things that's hard to get your foot in the

15:08.680 --> 15:11.320
door and say, hey, can I manage your infrastructure?

15:11.320 --> 15:13.200
But man, is it needed out there?

15:13.200 --> 15:19.160
David, it is desperately needed by so many developers who are so tapped out just keeping

15:19.160 --> 15:24.480
up with their project, responding to user requests, let alone managing their infrastructure.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.800
And both Mike and I are big advocates these days of bringing as much as your infrastructure

15:28.800 --> 15:33.480
in-house as you can, own as much of that as you can, because at the end of the day, you

15:33.480 --> 15:37.160
have to control that platform the best you can for the long-term sustainability of your

15:37.160 --> 15:38.220
product.

15:38.220 --> 15:40.320
And that means people need your help.

15:40.320 --> 15:44.040
Deploying infrastructure as code is absolutely the way people should be doing it now.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.560
And there's also a ton of people who need to transition.

15:46.560 --> 15:52.800
And it sounds like your traditional sysadmin background and your interest in automation

15:52.800 --> 15:59.200
means you may have a nice specialty in transitioning folks into new infrastructure as code.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.920
I don't know, setups.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.460
And that's actually a pretty nice specialty, because there's a ton of people interested

16:04.460 --> 16:06.300
in doing that right now.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.880
So I'd say play with the idea.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.240
Build yourself a year roadmap if you can.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.520
And if you can't, ask yourself if you're OK with six months.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.160
See if you can condense it.

16:14.160 --> 16:18.440
Set the time frame that makes sense for you, and perhaps go about it that route.

16:18.440 --> 16:22.840
And you may find that if you do a little side thing, that's enough that you can stay at

16:22.840 --> 16:24.000
the current job.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.800
Or you may find that you absolutely are consumed by it, and it builds into some serious momentum.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.600
Either way, David, let us know what happens.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.860
And if you out there have any questions or you want to get some free consulting or advice

16:34.860 --> 16:41.680
from the show, go to coder.show slash contact and tap Mr. Dominic's years of wisdom right

16:41.680 --> 16:44.660
here on the show and makes content for us.

16:44.660 --> 16:50.680
So you get a little, we get a little, and we like that.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.440
Linode.com slash coder.

16:52.440 --> 16:55.460
That's where I host my infrastructure.

16:55.460 --> 17:00.520
More than ever am I grateful for Linode because I've got one box on premise and it crashed

17:00.520 --> 17:01.520
recently.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.340
I knew it was looking a little shaky.

17:04.340 --> 17:08.880
So I built backup infrastructure on Linode and I just shut the box off and I thought,

17:08.880 --> 17:13.600
well, if it's necessary, I'll power it up, I'll point the DNS and I'll be good to go.

17:13.600 --> 17:17.180
And sure enough, that is exactly what happened while I was traveling.

17:17.180 --> 17:18.180
Go figure.

17:18.180 --> 17:23.120
And I am so grateful that Linode has a powerful DNS manager that makes it really simple for

17:23.120 --> 17:25.000
me to take care of this stuff.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.160
And they have a dashboard that really makes all these kinds of tasks quick and straightforward.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.760
When you pop in, you get to see a list of all your Linodes.

17:32.760 --> 17:36.740
You go in there, you get an overview of its performance, the kind of transfer it's doing.

17:36.740 --> 17:41.400
And also they set up some really sensible alerts to automatically ping you if things

17:41.400 --> 17:42.400
are a little odd.

17:42.400 --> 17:47.320
Like if one of our boxes is just like really busy network wise, sending a lot of traffic

17:47.320 --> 17:52.100
inbound or outbound that goes outside the norm, they'll generate an email alert to me.

17:52.100 --> 17:55.240
And man, I can't tell you how useful that is because that's usually a sign something

17:55.240 --> 17:56.720
is going on.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.720
And it's just a small thing, but it makes all of the difference.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.560
Plus, they have super fast networking.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.320
They have 11 data centers around the world.

18:03.320 --> 18:06.680
So you're going to pick something that's either close to you or close to your customer or

18:06.680 --> 18:08.540
whatever it is you're looking for.

18:08.540 --> 18:10.640
And they have Kubernetes support and Terraform support.

18:10.640 --> 18:14.480
So if you are doing infrastructure by code, you can absolutely make Linode and manage

18:14.480 --> 18:16.000
Linode with part of that.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.480
It's just fantastic.

18:17.480 --> 18:21.200
And then on top of all of that, they're now offering bare metal servers if your application

18:21.200 --> 18:23.320
load requires something like that.

18:23.320 --> 18:27.800
They have S3 compatible object storage, which is so great for back end storage for your

18:27.800 --> 18:32.400
application or like for us, we use it for Nextcloud, which allows our team to not worry

18:32.400 --> 18:36.320
about constantly checking the free space on the server all the time.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.320
It just grows with us.

18:37.320 --> 18:40.920
And then we go through about every six months and say, OK, what needs to stay?

18:40.920 --> 18:41.920
What needs to get archived?

18:41.920 --> 18:44.080
And it is so smooth.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.680
And the performance is fantastic, too.

18:45.680 --> 18:49.200
So really, it's just one of those things where you've got to go try it out for yourself.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.760
Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.680
If it runs on Linux, it's going to run great on Linode, but I'd like you to go experience

18:55.680 --> 18:56.680
for yourself.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.840
And Linode is pretty confident you're going to like it.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.320
That's why they're offering a hundred dollars.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.320
One hundies.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.360
So go to linode.com slash coder.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.160
Get that $100 60 day credit on your new Linode account.

19:07.160 --> 19:14.280
And of course, you support the gosh darn show, linode.com slash coder.

19:14.280 --> 19:18.800
So we have been on and off on the show talking about fast API.

19:18.800 --> 19:19.800
I don't know.

19:19.800 --> 19:23.200
Really, I mean, since you and Wes first talked about it a couple of years ago, it seems like

19:23.200 --> 19:26.640
at this point and it looks slick from what I understand.

19:26.640 --> 19:31.200
It's a modern fast, really, I guess, overall, though I have not experienced it personally,

19:31.200 --> 19:37.160
but they say high performance web framework for building APIs using Python, which of course

19:37.160 --> 19:38.400
puts it right up your alley.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.280
Yes, my snake charming continues.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.880
So a couple of points on fast API, right?

19:43.880 --> 19:49.880
So this new project I'm doing is in fast API and I've been writing just so much fast API

19:49.880 --> 19:53.540
code and I love it.

19:53.540 --> 19:56.480
It's got a couple of things going for it.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.160
It is, in fact, very, very fast.

19:59.160 --> 20:06.160
The author, who's Sebastian Tiaglo, I hope I got that right, sorry, is aiming for node

20:06.160 --> 20:08.000
JS and go like performance.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.640
And this has been used by all kinds of people like Microsoft, the Microsoft guy quoted there

20:11.640 --> 20:14.200
and Netflix, Uber, the whole bit.

20:14.200 --> 20:20.000
It automatically built into the box that generates documentation to your method calls or as Rails

20:20.000 --> 20:23.460
people might call them routes with open API.

20:23.460 --> 20:24.800
They're very good looking docs.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.500
If you've ever heard of Swagger, open API is the new name for Swagger.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.280
So that kind of thing.

20:29.280 --> 20:34.920
It is Python 3.6 and up only because it leans heavily on types, right?

20:34.920 --> 20:41.840
Python has optional typing and it became more robust than 3.6.

20:41.840 --> 20:45.120
This is the thing that really gets me.

20:45.120 --> 20:49.220
Out of the box, it is ready for async IO and asynchronous programming.

20:49.220 --> 20:53.880
So it's not like with Flask you can do async, but you kind of have to bolt it on.

20:53.880 --> 21:00.320
With this, it's right out of the box and that has made things just a lot easier to reason

21:00.320 --> 21:01.320
about, a lot simpler.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.360
I am loving it.

21:02.360 --> 21:07.840
Async IO is a great implementation of like the await, async await pattern and asynchronous

21:07.840 --> 21:08.840
programming in general.

21:08.840 --> 21:09.840
FastAPI does a great job.

21:09.840 --> 21:14.120
It's actually built on a framework called Starlet, which is another kind of web framework,

21:14.120 --> 21:18.920
but FastAPI, he describes it as Starlet on steroids.

21:18.920 --> 21:24.440
This data handling is also built on Pydantic, which I haven't done a lot of direct Pydantic

21:24.440 --> 21:30.080
without FastAPI, but it's basically ensuring your types are correct and a bunch of other

21:30.080 --> 21:31.080
more advanced stuff.

21:31.080 --> 21:33.800
I feel like I'm selling it short.

21:33.800 --> 21:40.760
For like quality of life stuff, great Visual Studio Code support via PyLance, great PyCharm

21:40.760 --> 21:41.760
support.

21:41.760 --> 21:46.100
I didn't put this in the doc, but the same author has something someone wrote in a couple

21:46.100 --> 21:52.440
of weeks ago, SQL model, which actually solves my problem of SQL alchemy models, not when

21:52.440 --> 21:56.280
you do the dot, not having the IntelliSense for the options.

21:56.280 --> 22:00.040
That's very nice because it's a kind of like an abstraction over SQL alchemy.

22:00.040 --> 22:03.200
I am not using that in this project because I just didn't want to change too many things

22:03.200 --> 22:09.860
at once, but you can intermingle it so I could see myself transitioning to it in the future.

22:09.860 --> 22:13.300
Also if you're now doing web development or service side development, but need a command

22:13.300 --> 22:19.720
line app, he wrote something called Typer, which is effectively FastAPI for the command

22:19.720 --> 22:20.720
line.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.720
Slick.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.600
Man, this sounds perfect for your kind of work.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.160
This is right up your alley.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.040
This is, yeah, this is really nice.

22:28.040 --> 22:34.400
I have to imagine this must make getting started a lot faster too because it seems like a lot

22:34.400 --> 22:36.960
of the things that you would bolt together are baked in.

22:36.960 --> 22:41.800
Some of it's by virtue of being just focusing on super modern Python features, it really

22:41.800 --> 22:46.000
is giving you a lot of the best practices of a modern Python developer right from the

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
jump.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.560
So when you start, you immediately have async IO and you don't have to worry about it.

22:50.560 --> 22:51.560
Right, I follow.

22:51.560 --> 22:56.520
Of course you could use it with other frameworks, but having this framework actually built to

22:56.520 --> 23:03.800
use it as a first class way of doing development asynchronous programming is a big difference

23:03.800 --> 23:06.120
than say bolting it on to a different framework.

23:06.120 --> 23:11.600
Yeah, especially when you're building a product on top of this, you're going to build something

23:11.600 --> 23:16.880
that you sell to customers and they're going to have expectations of maintainability, etc.

23:16.880 --> 23:17.880
Absolutely.

23:17.880 --> 23:25.760
And if you've done like a flask, it's very much in the flask kind of philosophy of giving

23:25.760 --> 23:29.120
you enough to get started, but you can kind of design your own project, right?

23:29.120 --> 23:33.640
I would say we're like Django for folks who know Ruby, Django was like the Ruby on Rails

23:33.640 --> 23:37.000
equivalent, very opinionated, very big.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.240
This is more like a Sinatra right on the Ruby side.

23:40.240 --> 23:44.520
So this is a new love, you know, this sounds like you've fallen in love with a new tool.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.640
Well, I've been using it on the DL a lot.

23:46.640 --> 23:52.080
I mean, if you follow me on Twitter, I've actually been tweeting my 100 days of code

23:52.080 --> 23:56.880
because I love annoying hashtags are almost all this fast API projects.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.920
So I did see some of that go by.

23:58.920 --> 24:03.020
That's why I kind of knew you were sniffing around in this stuff.

24:03.020 --> 24:08.000
But it seems like to me, like a unique opportunity for a guy like you to have a tool like this

24:08.000 --> 24:12.760
that this is just so already in the direction your business was going.

24:12.760 --> 24:18.400
And now you've kind of got this to build on top of for the product you're working on now,

24:18.400 --> 24:20.320
but also future products.

24:20.320 --> 24:23.160
You could kind of I guess where I'm going with this is you could kind of pivot a lot

24:23.160 --> 24:26.240
of a lot of your team to stuff like this.

24:26.240 --> 24:30.800
How have you have you thought about what it would be like to have other others or maybe

24:30.800 --> 24:31.800
you've already thought about this?

24:31.800 --> 24:35.600
Have others joined Mad Botter or have people on the team that would start developing with

24:35.600 --> 24:36.600
fast API?

24:36.600 --> 24:39.040
Is this something you've thought about like specializing in?

24:39.040 --> 24:41.080
Is this something you've thought about just you're working on?

24:41.080 --> 24:44.140
I'm curious to know what it looks like functionally from a business standpoint for how you guys

24:44.140 --> 24:45.140
are adopting it.

24:45.140 --> 24:50.080
Yeah, I mean, today, we were all working on the upcoming product and we were all working

24:50.080 --> 24:51.240
in fast API.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.560
So it's actually helped with standardization, right?

24:54.560 --> 24:55.960
Because it is Python.

24:55.960 --> 24:58.440
So we're all using VS code with the same plugins.

24:58.440 --> 25:02.960
We can do the VS code live share, which if anybody has it doesn't know what that is.

25:02.960 --> 25:07.440
It's like a super screen share for coding where you can like you have all your own setup.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.440
It's really nice.

25:08.440 --> 25:09.600
You should check it out.

25:09.600 --> 25:14.440
I would probably say to going forward any kind of client work that would be a new client

25:14.440 --> 25:19.240
or a new project that needs a back end, which is all of it, right?

25:19.240 --> 25:25.600
I would probably push pretty aggressively to have it done in fast API if it's in Python.

25:25.600 --> 25:29.600
Now can you give us a hint of what you're building now using fast API?

25:29.600 --> 25:30.600
Can you say?

25:30.600 --> 25:31.600
Do you want to say?

25:31.600 --> 25:33.360
Yeah, I can give a hint because I tweeted about it.

25:33.360 --> 25:39.120
I am using Slack and sockets with fast API and a lot of async goodness.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.520
Like a little messaging, something gets done, you send a message to Slack kind of thing,

25:42.520 --> 25:43.520
huh?

25:43.520 --> 25:45.200
There is a lot of messaging happening.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.200
Yeah.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.200
Yeah.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.200
Okay.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.200
That's great.

25:49.200 --> 25:52.920
Well, I look forward to hearing more about it.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.440
The mid-October can't come soon enough.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.440
Yeah.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.200
Well, I'm hoping to have it done that Monday before the 15th.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.760
But you know how that goes.

25:58.760 --> 25:59.760
Yeah, I do.

25:59.760 --> 26:00.760
Yeah, I do.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.240
Well, we'll have a link in the show notes.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.360
And then you know what we should do at some point is we should have Wes come back on.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.360
Yes.

26:06.360 --> 26:11.040
And you guys can geek out on fast API since I know he was an advocate of it early on.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.640
And then it's a good excuse to have Wes on too.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.360
Yeah, he's the one who turned me on to it.

26:14.360 --> 26:15.360
So thank you, Wes.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.360
Yeah, I'll twist his.

26:16.360 --> 26:19.440
I see him in the chat room right now, so I got my eye on you, Wes.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.440
Any other notes on that?

26:20.440 --> 26:21.440
No.

26:21.440 --> 26:25.800
I mean, I probably in the coming weeks will dive a little deeper into maybe SQL model.

26:25.800 --> 26:34.240
Let me know in the chat room plus in the feedback if people are interested in that, but yeah.

26:34.240 --> 26:37.480
Well then, this episode right here, yeah, it's brought to you by Datadog.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.720
Go to datadog.com slash coder radio.

26:40.720 --> 26:45.520
Datadog is the monitoring and security platform for developers, yes, security specialists,

26:45.520 --> 26:48.120
operation teams, anyone that's working in the cloud age.

26:48.120 --> 26:52.400
You can unify your metrics, your traces and logs all into one place and troubleshoot issues

26:52.400 --> 26:57.520
faster, and you can break down your silos and communicate better between teams.

26:57.520 --> 27:02.000
You create real time, beautiful dashboards with over 450 different technology integrations

27:02.000 --> 27:03.480
in just minutes.

27:03.480 --> 27:08.900
You can pivot from high level overviews of your environment to granular visualizations

27:08.900 --> 27:10.160
of metrics and events.

27:10.160 --> 27:14.960
I mean, I'd encourage you to go check it out because they nail these dashboards.

27:14.960 --> 27:15.960
They're beautiful.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.620
So go to datadog.com slash coder radio.

27:18.620 --> 27:19.620
Go sign up.

27:19.620 --> 27:22.760
They have a free trial, and if you create one dashboard, you're gonna get a free t-shirt

27:22.760 --> 27:24.300
as well, which is awesome.

27:24.300 --> 27:28.440
And Datadog has infrastructure monitoring, security monitoring, real user monitoring,

27:28.440 --> 27:30.720
and more all in one place.

27:30.720 --> 27:35.360
So go get started, datadog.com slash coder radio, and see what I've been talking about.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.680
They are the ultimate monitoring solution.

27:37.680 --> 27:42.320
Go see why thousands of companies and tons of people in the Coder Radio audience trust

27:42.320 --> 27:44.180
their monitoring to Datadog.

27:44.180 --> 27:48.120
And then, if you do create that free trial and one dashboard, they're gonna send you

27:48.120 --> 27:49.120
that free t-shirt.

27:49.120 --> 27:54.200
Go to datadog.com slash coder radio.

27:54.200 --> 27:58.600
So you found a book this week that is, I mean, it looks great.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.680
It's called Street Coder, and I like it already.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.080
I think it could have been our name.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.080
Could have been.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.080
You know, that could have, we should have thought of this.

28:05.080 --> 28:06.080
We should have thought of this, yeah.

28:06.080 --> 28:07.080
13 years ago.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.080
Yeah.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.080
Dang it.

28:09.080 --> 28:12.800
So, you know, we said we wouldn't answer, like, the basic, like, what should I learn

28:12.800 --> 28:13.800
first?

28:13.800 --> 28:14.800
Where should I study questions anymore?

28:14.800 --> 28:19.880
And I read this book, and I feel like it's time to reopen that.

28:19.880 --> 28:24.520
So I'm gonna butcher this guy's name, but it's Sadat Kapanoglu.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.520
Kapan-glue?

28:25.520 --> 28:26.520
We're gonna go with that.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.520
Sorry.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.520
Apologies.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.520
I can't.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.520
My pronunciations suck.

28:30.520 --> 28:34.680
It is basically a, you know, both Street Coder.

28:34.680 --> 28:40.360
It's like a field guide to the streets of coding, I guess, taking an extremely practical

28:40.360 --> 28:41.360
point of view.

28:41.360 --> 28:47.720
It's definitely a little opinionated, but I'm pretty impressed.

28:47.720 --> 28:51.760
So for long, long, long time listeners, you might remember that I always recommend to

28:51.760 --> 28:55.160
new developers, and still do, Mike Gunderloi's Coder to Developer.

28:55.160 --> 28:56.160
It's a classic.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.160
You can get it on Kindle.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.160
I think it's like 12 bucks.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.160
It's great.

28:59.160 --> 29:00.160
Enjoy.

29:00.160 --> 29:04.800
Like, seriously, if you're new to the industry or in college, whatever, high school even,

29:04.800 --> 29:05.800
you pick it up.

29:05.800 --> 29:12.120
It's a little dated, because it's, god, it's 20 or 30 years old, but no, it's not more

29:12.120 --> 29:13.840
than 20 years old.

29:13.840 --> 29:14.840
Whatever.

29:14.840 --> 29:15.840
It's a good read.

29:15.840 --> 29:21.280
This is more, if I would almost say a more, lack of a better term, aggressive, aggressively

29:21.280 --> 29:24.400
opinionated, and modern take on it.

29:24.400 --> 29:33.100
Now he uses C Sharp and.NET as his, you know, his, like, intro.

29:33.100 --> 29:40.060
But some of it's.NET specific, but more or less it's about how do you approach problems?

29:40.060 --> 29:42.000
What methodology should you be using?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.040
Should you adhere too harshly to methodologies?

29:44.040 --> 29:45.800
The answer's obviously no, right?

29:45.800 --> 29:52.840
You know, finding that right balance between pragmatism and, you know, white tower closure

29:52.840 --> 29:56.080
computer science that one was for US.

29:56.080 --> 29:59.920
I think I'm going to put it as number two on my list.

29:59.920 --> 30:03.320
Your new developer, recoder developer first.

30:03.320 --> 30:07.960
And when you have about maybe six months experience, maybe even a year, because it's a little more

30:07.960 --> 30:10.520
technical than coder to developer.

30:10.520 --> 30:15.040
He makes a very strong argument, I'll just give an example here, for understanding how

30:15.040 --> 30:18.960
like things like the CLR work at the low level.

30:18.960 --> 30:23.340
And obviously if you're like a Java person, you know, the JVM.

30:23.340 --> 30:27.380
I am kind of swayed by his argument.

30:27.380 --> 30:28.380
It's a powerful book.

30:28.380 --> 30:30.000
It'll have you thinking.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.080
I think I'm going to get it after the show.

30:32.080 --> 30:36.480
The description on the web page is quote, an incredible book to learn the craft of software

30:36.480 --> 30:38.960
development through a new perspective.

30:38.960 --> 30:43.000
One that is not fueled by religion or blind following of best practices, but one that

30:43.000 --> 30:48.280
actively challenges best practices and thus requires you to think about their pros and

30:48.280 --> 30:49.280
cons.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.280
That sounds great actually.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.280
I'm going to pick it up.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.640
They got an ebook for $27.99, that's probably money well spent.

30:55.640 --> 31:00.520
And you can get a print book for $34, but I think the ebook is probably fine.

31:00.520 --> 31:03.400
And the code, there's code samples.

31:03.400 --> 31:09.520
And again, the title was called Street Coder, which that's what we should call our members,

31:09.520 --> 31:10.520
the Street Coders.

31:10.520 --> 31:18.320
No, I like our QA team and we'll have a link in the show notes at coder.show slash 433

31:18.320 --> 31:20.260
if you want to grab that.

31:20.260 --> 31:25.160
So there has been several studies that Stanford just did one, Connect Solutions just did

31:25.160 --> 31:26.160
one.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.800
The Wall Street Journal just did one.

31:27.800 --> 31:34.380
And the studies pertain to does monitoring employee systems with like surveillance software

31:34.380 --> 31:36.760
actually make the staff more productive?

31:36.760 --> 31:39.340
Does it impact morale, et cetera, et cetera.

31:39.340 --> 31:45.700
So Stanford study of 16,000 workers over a nine month period showed there was some performance

31:45.700 --> 31:49.980
increase of around 13% when you monitor.

31:49.980 --> 31:54.000
But and this is interesting, it showed, and this I don't think is good for employees at

31:54.000 --> 31:55.640
all.

31:55.640 --> 32:01.560
The biggest boost in productivity was actually with remote workers, a 77% of the improvement

32:01.560 --> 32:08.120
was with remote workers, 30% indicated they do more work and less time when remote, and

32:08.120 --> 32:12.980
then 24% doing more work during their work hours, but overall, we're more productive

32:12.980 --> 32:14.540
while remote.

32:14.540 --> 32:18.440
But the old adage that actually says, if I can't see what you're doing, you're not being

32:18.440 --> 32:21.500
productive, I don't think actually holds up when you look at it.

32:21.500 --> 32:24.400
Going through all these studies, and I have a link in the show notes because there's like

32:24.400 --> 32:29.500
a page that sort of summarized them all, it really, all it does, it seems like employee

32:29.500 --> 32:34.520
productivity monitoring at best will discover some workflow issues.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.500
That's its best case scenario.

32:36.500 --> 32:42.100
But really, it's about, it's generally more about like getting on people for the time

32:42.100 --> 32:46.240
they're actually at work or the time they're working and not putting in a full eight hours

32:46.240 --> 32:51.680
is like, predominantly the way it ends up getting used, and that has horrible impacts

32:51.680 --> 32:58.240
on morale, it makes people view the company negatively, like, it's big impact.

32:58.240 --> 33:03.320
And so I thought I want to ask you what your thoughts were if there is a place for employee

33:03.320 --> 33:07.780
machine monitoring, because we already know employers feel where they, I guess, legally

33:07.780 --> 33:12.240
own the machines, they own all the content on there that gets created.

33:12.240 --> 33:18.040
It feels to me like it is a step too far to do any kind of monitoring on these systems

33:18.040 --> 33:19.040
at all.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.740
And I've always resisted this and a lot of places I've gone into recently have done some

33:22.740 --> 33:24.920
kind of mandatory monitoring.

33:24.920 --> 33:28.400
And I so far was able to avoid it always because my systems are running Linux.

33:28.400 --> 33:33.320
But even as like a client contractor, coming into a land, they'll have like this antivirus

33:33.320 --> 33:37.880
software that they would want me to install on my laptop that gives them full remote access

33:37.880 --> 33:40.560
to installing software in my system.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.680
Seems like a step too far, right?

33:41.680 --> 33:45.880
I think I think it's not only a step too far, I think it's kind of idiotic.

33:45.880 --> 33:50.300
If you are hiring people that you trust so little to actually do their job, you simply

33:50.300 --> 33:51.640
shouldn't hire them.

33:51.640 --> 33:54.920
And if you made the mistake of hiring someone like that, which happens, right, some, you

33:54.920 --> 33:58.880
know, you hire people don't fit, whatever, you should just, you know, let them go as

33:58.880 --> 34:01.580
quickly as possible and as humanely as possible.

34:01.580 --> 34:04.280
No one deserves to be treated like they're a prisoner at work.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.280
That's ridiculous.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.560
I mean, especially if they're working from home.

34:07.560 --> 34:10.400
I don't know, I hate all this stuff.

34:10.400 --> 34:13.000
Even you know, I could kind of see the antivirus thing.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.520
But even then, most of those antivirus programs, as you suggested, are not just antivirus,

34:17.520 --> 34:18.520
right?

34:18.520 --> 34:21.600
Like, I could see a thing that's like, hey, dude, you downloaded this XE that we know

34:21.600 --> 34:23.000
is bad.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.400
Someone from IT is gonna call you and be like, yo, you got to run the scan or something.

34:27.400 --> 34:36.160
But I really, really hate the idea of turning, you know, work into a surveillance state.

34:36.160 --> 34:41.460
I think you should hire people that you trust, that are good fits for your organization.

34:41.460 --> 34:45.000
And it doesn't mean if someone's a bad fit for you, like, lots of people, I think I can

34:45.000 --> 34:49.080
speak for you a little bit here are bad fits for JB and the Mad Botter, because we're super

34:49.080 --> 34:50.080
small.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.080
Yeah.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.080
Right.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.520
And that requires a certain type of personality, a certain type of person.

34:54.520 --> 34:57.580
Very much, you know, you need self motivators.

34:57.580 --> 34:59.900
But they might be great at Microsoft, right?

34:59.900 --> 35:02.720
So it's, it's, I hate this.

35:02.720 --> 35:03.720
I completely agree.

35:03.720 --> 35:05.520
But I'll just play devil's advocate.

35:05.520 --> 35:12.000
What about an employee whose job it is to monitor and adjust the chemicals that are

35:12.000 --> 35:15.760
going into the city water supply, I actually know the guy that does this here.

35:15.760 --> 35:22.360
And like, they had somebody compromise their machine with a PC anywhere, and actually get

35:22.360 --> 35:26.100
access and turn up the chemical solution.

35:26.100 --> 35:29.240
But they caught it quick enough, because the guy actually saw the mouse moving around on

35:29.240 --> 35:31.000
the screen.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.880
And they set everything back.

35:32.880 --> 35:37.680
And or I think about like, somebody who's working without some other hazardous material,

35:37.680 --> 35:41.520
or perhaps a young employee, it's their very first job.

35:41.520 --> 35:45.000
Is there a place for monitoring and tracking in those situations?

35:45.000 --> 35:49.960
So you you laid out like, a couple different scenarios, the easiest one is the young employee.

35:49.960 --> 35:50.960
The answer is no.

35:50.960 --> 35:51.960
Right?

35:51.960 --> 35:55.120
Like, if you're just hiring a young developer, and you know, it's no.

35:55.120 --> 35:59.720
But sure, if you were like working on a nuclear missile silo, then one, those jobs have always

35:59.720 --> 36:02.520
had monitoring, right?

36:02.520 --> 36:04.240
That's a public safety issue, right?

36:04.240 --> 36:09.440
So that, you know, going in that you're giving up certain, I mean, you're going to be monitored

36:09.440 --> 36:10.880
with that kind of thing.

36:10.880 --> 36:11.880
Yeah.

36:11.880 --> 36:15.640
But that's not kind of that's not really what this, what this was all about, right?

36:15.640 --> 36:17.120
This was about employers having anxiety.

36:17.120 --> 36:20.920
I mean, let's be honest, a lot of organizations, a lot of managers have anxiety that people

36:20.920 --> 36:25.440
working from home are just like walking their dogs and playing Uno with their kids, right?

36:25.440 --> 36:26.920
That's what this is about it.

36:26.920 --> 36:31.220
Although reviewing these different studies, it seems to show a pretty decent overall productivity

36:31.220 --> 36:32.220
boost for remote workers.

36:32.220 --> 36:33.760
Well, we've been talking about this for years, right?

36:33.760 --> 36:40.120
I mean, I've been remote for a long time now you've been doing the remote thing.

36:40.120 --> 36:45.720
You know, there's an initial cost to setting it up in terms of like, process and procedures.

36:45.720 --> 36:48.760
And having everybody agree that there will be standard hours that people need to be in

36:48.760 --> 36:51.240
slack or teams or whatever you're using.

36:51.240 --> 36:56.160
30% of respondents say that they did more work in less time when they work from home.

36:56.160 --> 36:59.200
Yeah, of course, because you don't know how easy it is in the middle of the night, if

36:59.200 --> 37:03.240
you work from home, that you were sleeping and like in your dreams, you know, Donald

37:03.240 --> 37:06.300
Knuth came to you and told you how to fix that bug.

37:06.300 --> 37:11.360
You just wake up, grab your MacBook Air, plug plug, or your system 76 Pangolin and you fix

37:11.360 --> 37:12.660
the bug.

37:12.660 --> 37:16.360
You're also cutting out for better for worse, the hallway conversations, the you know, drive

37:16.360 --> 37:20.480
by chats, like, for better or worse, you're cutting those out too and staying focused

37:20.480 --> 37:21.480
more.

37:21.480 --> 37:25.200
Yeah, and all that all that stuff, sure, camaraderie, team building, I kind of get that I think

37:25.200 --> 37:26.480
you are losing that.

37:26.480 --> 37:29.960
You know, how much time is wasted with like, gossip and

37:29.960 --> 37:31.440
Yeah, true.

37:31.440 --> 37:38.400
So back to the monitoring, I believe now that there are employee monitoring solutions for

37:38.400 --> 37:43.440
the Mac that are just as unbelievably invasive as the Windows ones.

37:43.440 --> 37:47.880
And it seems some of them even kind of try to capture information about your network,

37:47.880 --> 37:52.080
like, you know, look at look at the other machines, other IP addresses that your machine

37:52.080 --> 37:57.960
is aware of on the network, and kind of susses out like your overall network setup.

37:57.960 --> 38:02.840
To me, that seems like not only is this trend line going in the wrong direction, especially

38:02.840 --> 38:10.760
when you add in the context of fair pay, but the technology is going to enable just more

38:10.760 --> 38:11.960
and more and more.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.960
In fact, we recently had a story.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.080
I don't know if I can't remember if you and I decided to put in the show or not.

38:18.080 --> 38:23.760
But we recently had a story that was these employers were mandating, in fact, Apple contracts

38:23.760 --> 38:27.480
with one of them or was contracting with one of them until it went public, that the employers

38:27.480 --> 38:31.460
were mandating always on webcams when you're working from home.

38:31.460 --> 38:35.880
Always on webcam, you're always get you always not just in a meeting, you always have the

38:35.880 --> 38:42.680
video camera on, you're all up on a screen, the managers can check your video camera.

38:42.680 --> 38:46.800
And they had to do it because of COVID they said, you know, you have to work from home,

38:46.800 --> 38:47.960
but we have to be able to monitor you.

38:47.960 --> 38:50.440
So because of COVID, we're going to do this.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.440
It's literally their reasoning.

38:52.440 --> 38:55.120
And I find it completely overreaching.

38:55.120 --> 39:01.160
And it seems like when you look at things like I, for example, why not why not take

39:01.160 --> 39:06.320
it to one step further and have a companion app that not only is installed on your desktop,

39:06.320 --> 39:11.520
but the companion app that's on your mobile device that's tracking your steps and your

39:11.520 --> 39:12.520
location?

39:12.520 --> 39:13.520
Why not?

39:13.520 --> 39:16.960
Why not have them have you take a picture to check in in the morning with the front facing

39:16.960 --> 39:19.760
camera on your phone so they can make sure you're in your home office?

39:19.760 --> 39:20.760
Why not?

39:20.760 --> 39:22.520
I mean, where do they draw the line?

39:22.520 --> 39:25.200
Because it just seems like if they're going to do always on webcams, and they're going

39:25.200 --> 39:29.760
to start monitoring, like your ARP cache, like, where do we draw the line on this?

39:29.760 --> 39:35.560
They're just getting they have the argument that they're that they're, they own the machines.

39:35.560 --> 39:38.800
And you need to check in, you know, you got to punch the clock, and we're now using this

39:38.800 --> 39:42.200
new app to punch them on the clock, and you're going to get your picture taken at the same

39:42.200 --> 39:43.200
time.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.680
What's the difference if you're coming in and punching the clock on the wall?

39:46.680 --> 39:48.080
Same thing, they'd say.

39:48.080 --> 39:52.760
And I don't know how we even begin to fight back in this stuff.

39:52.760 --> 39:57.600
And so it helps me connect with the people who are really upset about the fair pay stuff.

39:57.600 --> 40:02.160
Because it just seems like people are completely powerless to stop a trend line that is not

40:02.160 --> 40:03.880
going in their direction.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.640
I guess I agree with you.

40:05.640 --> 40:10.000
But I mean, what is the problem these employers are solving?

40:10.000 --> 40:14.520
I feel like it's a really like, kind of sad insecurity thing.

40:14.520 --> 40:17.160
I'm not saying they're not doing it.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.600
I'm just saying it's bad, right?

40:18.600 --> 40:24.960
I haven't thought about it a lot from why I just assumed it would be a guaranteed accountability.

40:24.960 --> 40:25.960
Right.

40:25.960 --> 40:28.440
But isn't it more output that you should care about?

40:28.440 --> 40:31.560
Well, yeah, clearly, but it doesn't seem to be the way it works, does it?

40:31.560 --> 40:34.960
When we all had the office in New Jersey, it was be a problem.

40:34.960 --> 40:35.960
And it was a problem.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.520
If somebody is like blasting gangster rap, right?

40:37.520 --> 40:40.120
You have neighbors, the language is inappropriate.

40:40.120 --> 40:41.120
People could get offended.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.940
I don't want to get sued, right?

40:42.940 --> 40:46.840
You can see me in or, you know, an employer intervening in that.

40:46.840 --> 40:52.700
But if they're at home, and blasting, I know very little about rap, but blasting like Tupac

40:52.700 --> 40:56.020
makes them a better developer.

40:56.020 --> 40:58.240
Maybe I want to buy them some Tupac albums, right?

40:58.240 --> 40:59.240
I don't know.

40:59.240 --> 41:03.760
Like, you know, I hear you if I can get 5% more output, because we're listening to NWA,

41:03.760 --> 41:08.620
then I'm, I'm probably going to be totally cool with that, because one, they're not disrupting

41:08.620 --> 41:09.620
their co workers.

41:09.620 --> 41:11.420
You know, they're doing it in the privacy of their home.

41:11.420 --> 41:13.600
And if they get a noise complaint, it's their problem.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.240
And that's just a dumb example watching TV, right?

41:16.240 --> 41:17.240
Watching something on an iPad.

41:17.240 --> 41:22.300
Well, actually, no, the very first time I don't remember what job it was, it was so

41:22.300 --> 41:23.300
long ago now.

41:23.300 --> 41:27.380
But the very first time I had the opportunity to work from home, the first thing I did was

41:27.380 --> 41:30.580
blast my effing music, I rocked out while I work.

41:30.580 --> 41:31.760
So that's actually a good example.

41:31.760 --> 41:37.420
Wes in the chat room says, check this out, Mike, he says that he had a buddy run nmap,

41:37.420 --> 41:39.820
you know, the port scanner on his home network.

41:39.820 --> 41:43.460
And then he had it check in with him to ask him if things were okay.

41:43.460 --> 41:47.900
He triggered it back at the corporate office by running nmap on his home network.

41:47.900 --> 41:48.900
Wow.

41:48.900 --> 41:49.900
Whoo.

41:49.900 --> 41:55.180
You know, like, that's, and I just wonder, I think, like, in a way, I think maybe we

41:55.180 --> 41:57.740
should tell people how to avoid this kind of stuff.

41:57.740 --> 42:01.480
Optimus Grace says he sets up a VLAN for his work laptop.

42:01.480 --> 42:05.120
What I advise people do is they put their work laptops on guest Wi Fi.

42:05.120 --> 42:10.020
If your wireless access point supports creating a guest AP, that's that's a good tip.

42:10.020 --> 42:11.020
Yeah.

42:11.020 --> 42:14.340
Or set up a second, you know, access point, you and I are in a weird position, right?

42:14.340 --> 42:19.420
I can't imagine a scenario unless it was like something crazy, like the government, right?

42:19.420 --> 42:24.300
Where I would accept the job where part of the condition is, you get to spy on not just

42:24.300 --> 42:30.620
my, but like my whole family's network and traffic that seems, you know, right?

42:30.620 --> 42:34.700
Just, yeah, that's the thing at home, you know, wow, I hadn't even thought of that stupid

42:34.700 --> 42:35.700
me.

42:35.700 --> 42:36.700
Well, we both have kids, right?

42:36.700 --> 42:42.140
I mean, my, my son's very young, but I could see a world where there's some, you know, teenagers,

42:42.140 --> 42:43.140
right?

42:43.140 --> 42:48.060
Like some uncomfortable conversations with, with ID or HR because of that kind of thing.

42:48.060 --> 42:49.060
So.

42:49.060 --> 42:52.200
And then you have the, you have the employers who actually provide the entire router too,

42:52.200 --> 42:55.660
because that's how their VPN solution works and that's how they have to have it.

42:55.660 --> 43:00.500
And oh man, yeah, it tell you what, I tell you what.

43:00.500 --> 43:06.860
You know, if that's you, then run a, run a VM and in that VM run a VPN, like do what

43:06.860 --> 43:07.860
you can.

43:07.860 --> 43:11.620
They're like, we've got to, I think we've got to push back in a way and, and, and break

43:11.620 --> 43:12.620
it technologically.

43:12.620 --> 43:14.620
Cause otherwise it's just, it's going to keep going and keep going.

43:14.620 --> 43:17.900
Well, and if your employer is going to spy on your internet traffic, shouldn't they pay

43:17.900 --> 43:19.220
for the connection?

43:19.220 --> 43:22.980
So at that point you could just, you buy your own laptop, you call spectrum or whoever your

43:22.980 --> 43:27.180
carrier is or your ISP is rather, and you just say, listen, I have one from my employer,

43:27.180 --> 43:28.180
but I want a second line.

43:28.180 --> 43:31.780
Well, I don't really want them burning my internet connection up with this extra metric

43:31.780 --> 43:32.780
stuff either.

43:32.780 --> 43:34.980
Like, yeah, that's, that's an interesting argument.

43:34.980 --> 43:35.980
Should they have to pay for that?

43:35.980 --> 43:41.140
I mean, yeah, especially when I'm on like mobile internet, like every bite counts literally.

43:41.140 --> 43:43.460
So just don't know about it.

43:43.460 --> 43:45.780
I would, I would probably try to firewall it off and stuff.

43:45.780 --> 43:48.620
I mean, it's all solvable between DNS and IP rules.

43:48.620 --> 43:52.600
You can probably block a lot of it, but you have to be, you have to be familiar with how

43:52.600 --> 43:54.020
to do that kind of stuff.

43:54.020 --> 43:58.140
And most people probably, you have to imagine all the people that got sent to do work from

43:58.140 --> 44:03.160
home, the vast, vast majority of them aren't even thinking about this kind of stuff.

44:03.160 --> 44:07.140
And it, you know, bringing it back to what you said at the beginning of the show, I have

44:07.140 --> 44:12.140
friends who have been bitten by this over and over and over again when they start a

44:12.140 --> 44:16.100
project or some night they decide to work on the work laptop because their home machine

44:16.100 --> 44:17.660
isn't working.

44:17.660 --> 44:22.060
And even if it's just a small part of a project that they spent using company resources to

44:22.060 --> 44:24.920
build, they'll come after you for it.

44:24.920 --> 44:27.620
And now they have more evidence than ever.

44:27.620 --> 44:31.780
Like they have such, they have so many different ways to track activity.

44:31.780 --> 44:34.780
It's just so, so dangerous and so risky.

44:34.780 --> 44:39.140
And so it really, it really is important that if you're going to ever work on a side project

44:39.140 --> 44:43.300
that you ever want to do outside the company and you don't want them to own it, you have,

44:43.300 --> 44:45.540
and I'm not advocating, maybe it's, maybe you're fine with them owning it.

44:45.540 --> 44:46.540
That's, that's great.

44:46.540 --> 44:47.900
That's maybe a good way to get ahead.

44:47.900 --> 44:51.540
But if you want to build something that they don't have any hooks into, you got to do it

44:51.540 --> 44:55.540
on your own time and on your own resources, no company resources.

44:55.540 --> 44:56.740
It's very, it's just critical.

44:56.740 --> 44:59.500
I have so many friends that have been burned by it.

44:59.500 --> 45:03.420
And you know what, the nice boss, one may not be your ultimate boss, but when there's

45:03.420 --> 45:05.420
money on the table, people get different.

45:05.420 --> 45:07.820
It's business, you know, for them.

45:07.820 --> 45:10.140
I want to thank our Coder QA team.

45:10.140 --> 45:14.020
You know, you are our core that keeps the show truly independent, that lets us be picky

45:14.020 --> 45:15.020
about our advertisers.

45:15.020 --> 45:20.680
And as a thank you, you get a limited ad feed, it's the same production, just limited ads.

45:20.680 --> 45:25.960
And you also get the Coderly that comes out every quarter.

45:25.960 --> 45:29.580
So you can always look forward to that around the new quarter, you'll get a new Coderly

45:29.580 --> 45:30.580
report.

45:30.580 --> 45:33.940
You can sign up and support the show at coderqa.co.

45:33.940 --> 45:37.820
Also you can find our friends at a cloud guru on most social media sites that just slash

45:37.820 --> 45:38.820
a cloud guru.

45:38.820 --> 45:42.180
It's like YouTube or Twitter, it's really easy to find them, they're just slash a cloud

45:42.180 --> 45:43.180
guru.

45:43.180 --> 45:44.180
What about you, Mr. Dominic?

45:44.180 --> 45:45.460
Can people find you on the Twitter?

Yeah, at Dumanuco on Twitter, and I'm going to be doing some crazy Python stuff.

45:51.380 --> 45:53.180

45:53.180 --> 45:54.180
Nice.

45:54.180 --> 45:55.720
I do love the crazy Python.

45:55.720 --> 45:57.780
You get out there and charm that snake.
