This is Koto Radio, episode 331 for October 29th, 2018.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.560
Hi everybody and welcome to Koto Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:34.560 --> 00:40.080
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

00:40.080 --> 00:45.360
I'm over here in the now forever grey Pacific Northwest. My name is Chris and joining us

00:45.360 --> 00:51.840
is our host, established in the always sunny, always temperate conditions of the beautiful

00:51.840 --> 00:56.000
Florida, it's our host, the one and only, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike!

00:56.000 --> 01:02.160
How's it you, sir? Oh, it's been a while, Jar Jar. Oh, it's been a while, Jar Jar. Oh,

01:02.160 --> 01:07.440
I've missed you so much, Jar Jar, so much. Why don't you get the hell out of here and get Mike

01:07.440 --> 01:16.000
on because we've got a show to do, all right? Bye, sir. Yeah, yeah. What an attention seeker.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.880
I tell you what, I was going to say something worse, but I'll just keep it PG here at the

01:18.880 --> 01:23.840
intro. You know what I mean? But that Jar Jar, I don't trust him. A bit of an attention seeker.

01:23.840 --> 01:29.040
Don't trust him. Yeah, you know, he's just a bad guy doing bad things. I agree. You got to get him

01:29.040 --> 01:32.320
out of there. Get out of here. You got to get him out of there. Hey, you know, since I didn't want

01:32.320 --> 01:37.520
to curse for Jar Jar's sake at the top of the show, how about right here at the top of the show,

01:37.520 --> 01:45.120
I just give a real quick fuck you to the Twitters. I am so sick of Twitter. You just casually say

01:45.120 --> 01:50.480
something the other day and now I've got three days worth of crap in my feed. That's my bad.

01:50.480 --> 01:56.160
I ended up deleting the original tweet because I was like, OK, I don't know how we got here,

01:56.160 --> 02:00.160
but it's not what I like. Bail, bail, bail. Yeah, I'm just like, you know, I can't reason with you

02:00.160 --> 02:08.320
guys. You know, it's funny how like a just slightly incorrectly stated tweet, which is easy to do in

02:08.320 --> 02:12.880
a super short format or like somebody who's just not even familiar with a certain knowledge domain

02:12.880 --> 02:19.040
asks a question because they've just discovered this domain exists and the and the crap storm

02:19.040 --> 02:25.120
that it will generate four days on Twitter. Whoo. I got to tell you, that was that was like Mike

02:25.120 --> 02:30.320
stepped in it. So, you know, we know we have to retreat to the show. That's all I was going to

02:30.320 --> 02:34.640
say. That's what we do. We retreat to the show. We got a good batch of feedback up in here.

02:34.640 --> 02:40.080
Got some cute follow up. This little company, this little upstart called IBM just purchased

02:40.080 --> 02:43.920
this other little upstart you may have heard of called Red Hat. Let's pour one out for Red Hat.

02:43.920 --> 02:49.680
Yeah, we got some GitHub news. And then if we have time, I'm going to take one more crack

02:49.680 --> 02:55.120
at a golden topic here in the Coder Radio show, the remote workers. New study out showing remote

02:55.120 --> 02:59.680
workers are outperforming office workers. And I know we've talked about this over the whole

02:59.680 --> 03:05.280
history of this show, but now here I am finding myself an employee of a company based out of Texas

03:05.840 --> 03:12.240
and I am now a remote employee and no longer. See, when we've talked about this before on the show,

03:12.240 --> 03:17.040
I've been the boss and everybody's been working remotely for me. Now I'm working remotely for

03:17.040 --> 03:22.320
somebody else. Whole other side of the coin, my friend. Totally different set of experiences,

03:22.320 --> 03:25.760
let me tell you. So if we have a chance, I'll get to that in the show, too. Now we probably should

03:25.760 --> 03:30.000
know that I know that I set it up so much. I'm sorry about that. I just got carried away.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.240
Let's start with Jacob's feedback. He's the Marine that wrote in a while ago on the show.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.720
He says, hey, guys, I'm the Marine that asked for advice with zero experience

03:38.720 --> 03:43.120
after listening to up hold on hamburger menus in the way after listening to your advice.

03:43.120 --> 03:47.920
I put myself out there and I applied. I'm currently relocating to Florida to a government

03:47.920 --> 03:53.520
contracting company as a C sharp and Russ developer. Thank you again. Well, now that's

03:53.520 --> 03:58.880
a success story. Congratulations, Jacob. It's great to hear that. Maybe maybe go look up.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.920
Mike, I hear Florida is just all one really small. Everybody down there knows each other.

04:01.920 --> 04:05.040
It's really we all just know each other. Yeah, I didn't. You know, we all have alligators.

04:05.040 --> 04:10.240
It's a good time. But yeah, I think we need a bell for this one. It's code radio success.

04:11.280 --> 04:18.800
I agree. Yeah, everybody under 40 and code radio has to in Florida has to stick together. I believe

04:18.800 --> 04:24.480
otherwise. You know what? There's so few of us. Oh, I know. I know. Hey, wait a minute now. Hold

04:24.480 --> 04:30.320
on. My this pastebin link says no good. This one from Robin about setting you straight on WPF.

04:30.320 --> 04:37.360
Did this go away? It says no good. Did it go away? Well, I can give you the gist. So I last week I

04:37.360 --> 04:44.640
had stated that dotnet core did not work with WPF on windows, which it turns out is not true. It

04:44.640 --> 04:50.800
works with WPF only on windows. So the deal is basically this. And this is kind of what Robin

04:50.800 --> 04:58.880
wrote in to tell us. WPF does not work on other platforms, but it does work on windows. But you

04:58.880 --> 05:07.840
can have dotnet core in a WPF app. Oh, okay. So nuance. There's like a lot of nuance. So

05:09.840 --> 05:15.600
basically, that's how things like Avalonia work. Avalonia UI, which is a cross platform framework.

05:16.720 --> 05:24.160
It will under the hood use WPF controls on windows, but still use dotnet core or it can

05:24.160 --> 05:29.120
still use dotnet core. And Robin shared some good links that I will throw in the show notes

05:29.120 --> 05:37.360
about kind of where Microsoft says dotnet core is going. All in all, it is going to be the future,

05:37.360 --> 05:44.000
or that is their stated goal. The area of error in this case on my part was

05:44.640 --> 05:49.760
stating that dotnet core could not be used with WPF on windows. That's not the case. It can,

05:49.760 --> 05:55.200
but it can only be used with WPF on windows, which I still think is ridiculously confusing, but

05:55.200 --> 06:00.720
it is a little, you know, basically the UI framework of WPF does not exist on any of the

06:00.720 --> 06:06.400
platforms. Right. That's okay. That's what I'm rocking. All right. Well, so it's good to get

06:06.400 --> 06:11.600
the clarification, I suppose. Boy, that seems sort of limited, but I actually kind of make sense.

06:11.600 --> 06:15.200
That's how it would be. So thank you, Robin, for writing. And if you want to give us some feedback,

06:15.200 --> 06:20.640
there's a couple of ways. The most official channel is the contact page at coder.show

06:20.640 --> 06:25.840
slash contact. There's also the subreddit, which I try to check before each show. And I know Mike's

06:25.840 --> 06:29.760
in there several times during the week too. And of course, when Twitter isn't blowing up,

06:30.480 --> 06:37.440
you can also add Domenico and I'm at Chris LAS if you want to tag us on there. So I wasn't going

06:37.440 --> 06:42.160
to bring this up, but you put this in the show and I didn't want to trigger you, but we do have

06:42.160 --> 06:48.560
a new release from the cute folks. It's Design Studio 1.0. Big release. And they're hyping it,

06:48.560 --> 06:54.000
man. They're hyping it hard. And to me, the cute outsider, it does look pretty good for building

06:54.000 --> 06:58.720
some effective workflows for Qt and QML. I mean, it looks good, but obviously I haven't tried it.

06:58.720 --> 07:03.840
Yeah. It looks interesting. Basically, it's a design tool that runs on Windows and I believe

07:03.840 --> 07:10.240
Mac. I mean, they have a lot of talk about taking Photoshop files and generating QML.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.440
Yeah. It's pretty interesting. Basically,

07:13.440 --> 07:18.880
you have designers who might design your interface and you want to kind of create a,

07:18.880 --> 07:23.200
I don't even know what to call it, not an asset pipeline, but kind of like a UX pipeline for them

07:23.200 --> 07:25.200
to generate some layouts for you. Right.

07:25.200 --> 07:30.240
For you to kind of use as a baseline. And then it does live previews and it'll do like,

07:30.240 --> 07:33.840
it'll frame rate counter to give you an idea of how it's actually going to perform. It'll zoom in.

07:33.840 --> 07:40.720
Yeah. Yeah. I have not gotten my hands on it yet, but certainly if this works,

07:40.720 --> 07:45.120
this would be pretty cool. Anything that makes the development process faster,

07:45.120 --> 07:49.280
particularly when somebody hands you a giant Photoshop file with a million layers

07:49.280 --> 07:53.680
and you just like want to get a baseline layout template to work with.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.360
The other aspect that's interesting is the timeline-based animations,

07:57.360 --> 08:03.600
which is a timeline or a keyframe-based editor that lets designers create animations without

08:03.600 --> 08:09.600
having to write any code. That's pretty nice because you could see how if you want just even

08:09.600 --> 08:14.720
a basic proof of concept animation, this would be a useful tool. It might not be super sophisticated,

08:14.720 --> 08:20.240
but relaying an idea before you start spending tons of time building something is extremely

08:20.240 --> 08:24.720
valuable. And this thing has a lot of new features they're adding to the timeline-based animations.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.960
Yeah. I think at worst, this is going to be a pretty good prototyping tool to say,

08:28.960 --> 08:32.160
well, this is something like we could do. And then maybe you have to go back and

08:32.160 --> 08:32.640
Yeah.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.280
do the animations for real.

08:35.280 --> 08:41.840
But in the meantime, you're building Qt and QML. I don't know about this Photoshop bridge. That's

08:41.840 --> 08:46.560
the part that seems the most dicey to me. They label it as import your graphics designs from

08:46.560 --> 08:53.840
Photoshop, create reusable components directly from Photoshop. Okay. Maybe if they're providing

08:53.840 --> 08:58.080
very specific templates that you start with in Photoshop, I could buy that. I could see that

08:58.080 --> 09:02.800
working. Maybe it's a pretty cool feature. If it does work kind of makes me wish like I could have

09:02.800 --> 09:07.040
like a research team that I would be like, Hey, go try this. Come back, report back to the show.

09:07.040 --> 09:11.680
But if anybody out there has a chance to let us know, do contact us because the Photoshop bridge

09:11.680 --> 09:18.720
and the time-based animations and the Qt live preview stuff really seems pretty slick. Is there

09:18.720 --> 09:24.800
anything else that jumped out at you about it? You know, not really. I mean, there's a level

09:24.800 --> 09:28.800
of magicalness going on here that we've seen lots of these tools over the years. We've been doing

09:28.800 --> 09:32.960
these shows for different platforms. I would be very curious to see how it actually performs.

09:34.160 --> 09:42.160
But certainly I think there's particularly in the Qt space an opportunity for this to be

09:42.160 --> 09:46.800
very useful. Yeah. Yeah. And for prototyping could be particularly invaluable. All right.

09:46.800 --> 09:55.200
Well, moving on to a little breaking news here. This is a release on the Swift announcements

09:55.200 --> 10:00.160
forms. We at Apple are making it a priority to support high quality tooling for all Swift

10:00.160 --> 10:06.080
developers, including those working on non-Apple platforms. We want to collaborate with the open

10:06.080 --> 10:10.800
source community and focus our efforts on building common infrastructure that can be

10:10.800 --> 10:18.080
shared by Xcode and other editors and other platforms. To that end, I am excited to announce

10:18.080 --> 10:23.840
that we are going to start a new open source project for Swift and C family language services

10:23.840 --> 10:29.120
based on the language server protocol. We have chosen to adopt Lisp so we can benefit

10:29.120 --> 10:34.480
from its active community and wide adoption across other editors and platforms. This means

10:34.480 --> 10:41.200
that Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text or whatever your favorite editor happens to be

10:41.200 --> 10:46.320
can use the same service as Xcode and any improvements we make to the service will

10:46.320 --> 10:55.200
benefit them all. Wow. That's great. That happened. This announcement came out,

10:55.200 --> 10:59.360
I think because of the delay, about 10 days ago or so, 14 days ago when we were recording this.

10:59.360 --> 11:04.240
Have you had a chance to sit with this? Have you sat with this monumental announcement?

11:05.520 --> 11:12.880
I've been trying to get more context for it and it seems pretty straightforward. They are trying

11:12.880 --> 11:20.240
to make sure that Swift and basically the Apple development ecosystem are not completely locked

11:20.240 --> 11:27.680
down, which feels weird and shocking. There are lots of people, if you read around about this,

11:27.680 --> 11:32.480
who have been trying to implement their own LSP language service because they just can't,

11:34.080 --> 11:38.960
whatever, they want to work in Vim, they want to work in some other tool. Whatever the tool is,

11:38.960 --> 11:47.840
everybody can teach his own. I find this weirdly surprising, but good in a happy way.

11:48.960 --> 11:54.800
Like certain other surprises we'll talk about. You're getting ahead of yourself there.

11:54.800 --> 12:00.240
To be super clear, if you just develop an Xcode, this will actually end up benefiting

12:00.240 --> 12:04.560
you in the long term as well, but the immediate benefits are probably going to be for folks who

12:04.560 --> 12:10.080
are trying to write Swift in Vim. If that sounds weird to you, keep in mind that there's things

12:10.080 --> 12:18.400
like Vapor and even IBM, I forgot the name of their solution, but IBM has a Swift, don't call

12:18.400 --> 12:24.800
it Rails, but Swift-like backend solution that you can run on Linux. It's completely possible.

12:24.800 --> 12:30.320
So a couple of points of clarification. The LSP service will use source kit D to get Swift-specific

12:30.320 --> 12:33.280
highlighting support or code completion support, those kinds of things.

12:35.600 --> 12:39.680
There was a question asked in the forum if the developers would be using lib syntax

12:39.680 --> 12:45.280
X to implement highlighting, but that would be, it looks like probably not. It looks like what

12:45.280 --> 12:50.560
they're going to do is they'll essentially be a library that you can grab. The intention is for

12:50.560 --> 13:00.800
part of this to replace the existing library they're using today and really make it available

13:00.800 --> 13:04.560
to all editors. Really, truly make something that's available to all editors so you could

13:04.560 --> 13:11.120
have syntax highlighting in Visual Studio Code or Atom or like Mike uses Emacs all the time.

13:11.120 --> 13:15.200
I'm like, yeah, they could be making, oh yeah.

13:16.960 --> 13:21.040
There's some Google developers that are jumping in on this too and they look like they're pretty

13:21.040 --> 13:24.160
pumped about this. They say, Google is also very interested in contributing.

13:24.720 --> 13:28.000
We have a fair amount of work in this area to meet some of our internal needs.

13:29.040 --> 13:35.840
We're excited to see this moving forward. Isn't that interesting? Well, I'll be one to watch,

13:35.840 --> 13:43.040
but if it pales in comparison to what feels like maybe one of the largest stories

13:44.080 --> 13:48.080
of the year, not just an open source, but of the year, some breaking news on Sunday.

13:50.240 --> 13:54.240
Got all the breaking news in the Coder Radio program today. IBM announces they're going to

13:54.240 --> 14:03.520
acquire Red Hat for just a small amount of money. Nothing that much, just a few billions, like 34

14:03.520 --> 14:11.360
of them, which works out to be about $190 per share, which is a 60% premium over their Friday

14:11.360 --> 14:18.560
closing price before the announcement. Red Hat will become part of IBM's hybrid cloud division,

14:18.560 --> 14:22.960
with Jim Whitehurst, the CEO of Red Hat, reporting directly to IBM's CEO.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.560
I don't know. You kind of went through the gamut of reactions through Twitter,

14:28.560 --> 14:33.120
and I think one of your reactions was I really didn't think it would be Red Hat first. In fact,

14:33.120 --> 14:35.520
I think the implication was you thought it'd be Canonical that sold first.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.200
Yeah, I sort of did. Yeah.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.720
Isn't this something? And you got to wonder if it does mean that maybe Canonical is going to be

14:42.720 --> 14:47.920
more likely to be an interesting purchase for maybe companies like Microsoft or Amazon.

14:47.920 --> 14:54.160
Amazon, yeah. So what was your initial take on this? Like your first raw reaction when you saw

14:54.160 --> 14:58.080
this? Well, you know, I mean, full disclosure, I think this is pretty common, but it was a little

14:58.080 --> 15:05.520
bit of dread. It was a little bit of, oh no, this is, I mean, and I got to be clear, I do not have

15:05.520 --> 15:13.120
that reaction to all acquisitions. Like the GitHub Microsoft acquisition, I was more like, well,

15:13.120 --> 15:16.800
this is interesting because there's a lot of rumors that GitHub was falling apart at the top

15:16.800 --> 15:20.400
and they needed new leadership. They weren't like making enough money.

15:20.400 --> 15:27.200
Right. But when the Red Hat one gets announced, I try to, here's the game I've tried to play.

15:27.200 --> 15:32.640
There's two things I've asked myself. Number one, who else would I rather it be? And number two,

15:33.440 --> 15:37.280
is the new owner better than the old owner for some of their various things that they have?

15:38.400 --> 15:44.800
And my sense to the second question is no, but my sense to the first question is,

15:44.800 --> 15:50.720
I'm not sure who else I'd rather have buy them. Let's say, I mean,

15:50.720 --> 15:53.520
who else would have the money to buy Red Hat? I guess, you know, 30-

15:53.520 --> 15:58.960
They had Amazon, Microsoft, I mean, all the big boys, but who would want to would be an interesting,

15:58.960 --> 16:03.920
maybe Amazon, but you know, the canonical Amazon marriage would make a lot more sense.

16:04.960 --> 16:05.440
Right.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.240
I think.

16:06.240 --> 16:06.480
Right.

16:06.480 --> 16:07.760
And still be terrible, but-

16:07.760 --> 16:10.960
Although Red Hat's pretty big on there. I think, you know, I think Ubuntu may have it

16:10.960 --> 16:13.680
beat, but they don't release specifics. So it's hard to say.

16:13.680 --> 16:18.800
Red Hat's already public too. Right, Red Hat was already a public company on like GitHub. It was,

16:20.000 --> 16:20.800
yeah.

16:20.800 --> 16:24.720
You know, there's one thing, because I know, I know a handful of people who work at Red Hat.

16:24.720 --> 16:28.640
And there's one thing that I would say is consistent about a lot of people who work there

16:28.640 --> 16:33.680
is they went to go work at Red Hat because it was Red Hat and they wanted to contribute to

16:33.680 --> 16:37.840
open source in a way that would actually make a difference. Because working at Red Hat,

16:37.840 --> 16:44.560
you were working on projects that would ship. And I just, I know a lot of people who are

16:44.560 --> 16:48.000
working there because it's Red Hat, not because it's IBM. And I don't know what that means for

16:48.000 --> 16:55.440
those engineers, what they're going to do. And I feel for them, put yourself in their shoes just

16:55.440 --> 17:02.720
for a moment. A lot of them, the majority of them found out about this via Twitter, the news,

17:03.600 --> 17:08.960
Linux action news, a couple of them found out via Linux action news. It was not well communicated.

17:09.520 --> 17:14.880
And so when you have a bunch of employees there that are super passionate about your unique company

17:14.880 --> 17:18.000
culture, which they're very proud of, Jim Whitehurst has written a book about it.

17:19.920 --> 17:24.000
And they're working there because of open source and wanting to be a player in open

17:24.000 --> 17:27.680
source and make a difference and contribute to open source in a way that will actually go out

17:27.680 --> 17:32.240
and ship. You got to figure there's going to be a certain amount of talent train after an acquisition

17:32.240 --> 17:38.720
like this. You got to figure that's something given IBM's aggressive history of, you know,

17:38.720 --> 17:42.560
domestic layoffs and like aggressive offshoring with their consulting work, which is like,

17:42.560 --> 17:49.120
I read somewhere 70% of their business now. I don't even know if they'd see that as a problem.

17:50.080 --> 17:54.400
Yeah. So TechCrunch has an interesting take on this. Jonathan Schieber over there says that

17:55.200 --> 18:02.560
what the latest $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat really tells us is that IBM needs a way to

18:02.560 --> 18:07.920
save its failing Watson business. And this is an interesting take here. Watson, which is the

18:07.920 --> 18:11.760
business division focused on artificial intelligence, whose public claims were always

18:11.760 --> 18:17.040
really more marketing than actually market driven, has not performed as well as IBM had hoped. And

18:17.040 --> 18:21.600
investors are losing their patience. There's also some critics, including analysts at the

18:21.600 --> 18:25.920
investment bank, Jeffries, that have been skeptical about Watson's ability to deliver

18:25.920 --> 18:31.920
what IBM claims for over a year. And earlier this year, the online medical journal Stat reported

18:31.920 --> 18:36.160
that the Watson was giving clinicians recommendations for cancer treatments that

18:36.160 --> 18:41.120
were unsafe and incorrect based on the training data had received from the company's own engineers

18:41.120 --> 18:46.320
and doctors. All of those woes were reflected in the company's latest earning calls where it

18:46.320 --> 18:52.240
reported falling revenues primarily from the cognitive solutions business, which includes

18:52.240 --> 18:57.840
Watson's artificial intelligence supercomputing services. So there's a few folks out there that

18:57.840 --> 19:04.000
have their take on this is IBM made a big marketing bet on artificial intelligence and Watson. They

19:04.000 --> 19:10.640
did a whole blitz about Watson and it's not actually delivering real financial results.

19:10.640 --> 19:13.680
And so they need to get back to basics. They need to get back to the cloud. They need to

19:13.680 --> 19:18.160
get back to selling services. And of course, a lot of those services in the cloud are powered by

19:18.160 --> 19:26.240
Red Hat. What do you think of that? I mean, I think it's hard to say that this isn't a,

19:27.200 --> 19:31.440
you know, this is anything but a shot at the cloud business. I hadn't heard that Watson

19:31.440 --> 19:35.120
was struggling so much revenue wise. That's at least according to TechCrunch. I'll have a link

19:35.120 --> 19:45.600
in the show notes. I think there's a lot of areas that they've invested over the years. I am no

19:45.600 --> 19:53.360
expert on IBM, but having watched them just sort of tangentially since the PS2 was being sold by IBM

19:53.360 --> 20:04.640
since then, they've had my interest. I believe that they have lost their way. They became a sales

20:04.640 --> 20:10.400
and consulting company and they went too far. They got too hooked on that sauce and they didn't.

20:11.280 --> 20:15.840
What has IBM done recently? What have they done? You know, you can point to things that Amazon's

20:15.840 --> 20:20.240
done and Google's doing and Microsoft and Apple and even Oracle and the companies in that,

20:20.240 --> 20:26.400
even that outer tier of large tech companies, but IBM, they've sold a lot of services.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.320
But what else have they done? What comes to mind when you think of what IBM's done? All that comes

20:34.320 --> 20:39.760
to my mind is stuff they used to do. I mean, they're effectively a giant consultancy now.

20:39.760 --> 20:43.680
Right. My point is, and I'm not trying to take anything away from other than saying

20:44.560 --> 20:50.000
in that light, it seems obvious that this is a desperation play, a 60% premium.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.320
Huge mark. Yeah, that's crazy though. That's-

20:52.320 --> 20:56.400
34 billion. Now mind you, Red Hat is on track to make 3 billion this year.

20:57.600 --> 21:03.760
So they got 34 bill for the sale. The way this was rushed out and the fact that the

21:03.760 --> 21:08.720
employees weren't informed when the culture management issues are massive with IBM,

21:08.720 --> 21:14.240
this is a huge issue for, I mean, Red Hat and now IBM. The fact that they weren't properly warned,

21:14.800 --> 21:19.600
the fact that this is a $34 billion acquisition, it kind of makes me wonder if there wasn't another

21:19.600 --> 21:23.120
interested party. And announced on a weekend, by the way.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.720
A Sunday when I think they were planning-

21:24.720 --> 21:25.280
Sunday.

21:25.280 --> 21:30.480
They were planning to have a corporate meeting on Monday and then this came out on Sunday.

21:30.480 --> 21:33.760
And it started out as rumors. So then Red Hat just jumped on it on their Twitter account and

21:33.760 --> 21:37.840
confirmed it and posted the blog post. Seemed pretty rushed to me.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.000
Strange. So maybe there's other bidders.

21:42.880 --> 21:48.160
So do you see this as another step towards consolidation? Meaning,

21:48.160 --> 21:50.560
do you think that other dominoes are now going to fall?

21:51.920 --> 21:56.080
It does make me wonder what's next for Canonical as they're trying to go public,

21:56.080 --> 21:59.920
as they're trying to raise funding, maybe even look at selling. It makes me wonder,

21:59.920 --> 22:05.360
it makes me wonder what's the next move. And you have to figure that some of the platform

22:05.360 --> 22:10.640
providers that compete with IBM, but have Red Hat VMs on their platform are a little nervous

22:10.640 --> 22:15.120
right now. And you have to figure that Microsoft's looking around going, God, look at Azure.

22:15.680 --> 22:19.520
We've got like 30% of these things. I mean, who knows what it is. They don't really often say,

22:19.520 --> 22:23.440
but we've got like 30% of these things running Ubuntu. Especially if you count the containers.

22:23.440 --> 22:28.320
If you look at the containers we're running, they're like 70% Ubuntu. This is a platform

22:28.320 --> 22:33.520
that's obviously critical to Azure making money. And it's obvious they will spend money

22:34.800 --> 22:38.480
to make Azure a success. So you got to figure, somebody over there is talking about this right

22:38.480 --> 22:45.520
now. Okay. If Microsoft buys Canonical, all I am going to do is hang out in Telegram and on

22:45.520 --> 22:55.120
r slash Linux for about a week and just watch. Well, what's worse? IBM buying Red Hat or Microsoft

22:55.120 --> 23:01.360
buying Canonical. I would argue that Microsoft buying Canonical would be less of a threat to

23:01.360 --> 23:10.000
Linux in general. Red Hat is responsible for the gnome shell. They are the primary stewards of GTK,

23:10.000 --> 23:17.520
SystemD, PulseAudio, Fedora. Oh, who uses Fedora? Not that Canonical doesn't make genuine

23:17.520 --> 23:22.160
contributions, but I actually have more faith that Microsoft would run them properly and the

23:22.160 --> 23:26.160
contributions they do make would continue. In fact, perhaps Microsoft would even resource them

23:26.160 --> 23:34.240
better. But in the case of IBM, what's the argument for IBM to continue developing Pipewire to create

23:34.240 --> 23:39.360
a unified audio and video pipeline for the Linux desktop? What's the point? Why does IBM care about

23:39.360 --> 23:43.440
that if this is part of their hybrid cloud division? See Red Hat did, and that's something

23:43.440 --> 23:47.840
Red Hat is working on. I don't really see IBM being too fired up about that.

23:47.840 --> 23:53.680
Yeah, I mean, maybe it's a little unfair to characterize IBM this way, but they really do

23:53.680 --> 23:58.640
feel like they've been focused on basically pumping up their consulting business and not

23:58.640 --> 24:07.680
developing products or projects in quite the same way as, since we're comparing apples to apples,

24:07.680 --> 24:14.400
a Microsoft who every week there's a new major Microsoft product or announcement or open source

24:14.400 --> 24:20.000
thing or, I mean, not that this is the Microsoft action show, but they're really doing a lot in

24:20.000 --> 24:25.120
the space right now. Yeah, IBM, yeah. I mean, they've ran some commercials, they've contributed

24:25.120 --> 24:30.400
code for sure, but yeah. And the other thing about it, about this whole, about this whole,

24:30.400 --> 24:39.040
like Microsoft or whoever would buy Canonical, you have to figure with Canonical, with Canonical,

24:39.040 --> 24:46.960
with Canonical, their business really is selling that server support and the server side.

24:46.960 --> 24:52.000
The desktop is almost kind of, the desktop components on a bit are, I don't want to say

24:52.000 --> 24:59.440
autopilot because that sells short the work that they do put into it, but they're based on upstream

24:59.440 --> 25:04.320
projects for the most part, right? So there's not a same required, like they don't have to have a

25:04.320 --> 25:10.880
huge desktop division. They can have a sustainable desktop division. So Canonical, you could acquire

25:10.880 --> 25:16.160
Canonical and it would still make financial sense to run the desktop side of the shop.

25:16.720 --> 25:24.560
Red Hat has all of these really long-term investments that are like foundational

25:24.560 --> 25:29.280
technologies. Like I said, GTK, but also others like Stratus storage is something they're working

25:29.280 --> 25:33.680
on right now. There's these big ones in there that, I don't know, we'll see. The claim is that

25:33.680 --> 25:41.520
they're going to run as an independent operator for a while at least. Yeah, that always happens.

25:42.480 --> 25:48.720
So is this just how, this is how it always was going to go? Is this it? I mean, is this what

25:48.720 --> 25:54.640
this was all about? Like in the 90s, what Red Hat represented and what Microsoft represented

25:55.360 --> 26:01.600
were so cornerstone to how I experienced technology. Microsoft was the bad guy and Red Hat

26:01.600 --> 26:08.320
was the rebels and now Microsoft is an open source citizen and Red Hat is going to be owned by

26:08.960 --> 26:16.960
the original establishment in technology. It's just really, it's really, it's kind of a,

26:17.680 --> 26:21.360
it's kind of a whomp whomp into a story. I mean, I realize the story's not over yet, but

26:23.680 --> 26:28.320
I don't know, all this fuss and then this is what we end up with. Is Red Hat's gone?

26:28.320 --> 26:35.120
Marc Andreessen had a good post that came out this morning about how Red Hat was really one of the

26:35.120 --> 26:41.200
only successful truly open source companies. And with them basically going, I mean, not basically,

26:41.200 --> 26:47.280
they are in fact being acquired by IBM, right? The only one other than them was Sun. And honestly,

26:47.280 --> 26:54.000
my initial reaction to this news was to pour one out for Javaduke because it's the same thing.

26:54.000 --> 27:02.480
I mean, I'm not going to say if like IBM is worse than Oracle, but it's not good. I mean,

27:02.480 --> 27:06.320
we already see some of the shenanigans with the Java SDK agreement on the Oracle side.

27:07.040 --> 27:11.440
I can imagine Red Hat's contributions after a couple of years, eventually starting to be much

27:11.440 --> 27:17.600
more focused on cloud, whatever that cloud, but whatever it is that would actually like generate

27:17.600 --> 27:21.760
revenue for IBM. No, I don't know. They are consulting, you know, who knows what their

27:21.760 --> 27:28.000
actual plan is, but I'm trying to think of another major company that is, you know,

27:28.000 --> 27:36.160
of that late nineties, mid nineties, actually kind of open sourcey generation that is still around

27:36.160 --> 27:42.400
and independent. Yeah. Hmm. I bet you, I bet you there's a couple, but I just, I'm not,

27:42.400 --> 27:46.960
I'm not, they're not coming to mind. Like not as much as blender blend. Yeah. Blender is not.

27:46.960 --> 27:53.840
Not at the scale. Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I really, the more I think about it, the sadder I get,

27:53.840 --> 27:58.240
and I don't want to be, I keep trying to remind myself that IBM does have a great sales team

27:58.960 --> 28:05.200
and IBM is going to bring enterprise credibility to Red Hat's offerings even more.

28:06.080 --> 28:11.760
And the bill to sell it is parts of huge packages. Red Hat believes that they are sitting on top of

28:11.760 --> 28:18.320
a $1 trillion market that they just can't address and that they need the resources of IBM to fully

28:18.320 --> 28:22.480
address that market. This is, this is what they think. So Jim Whitehurst thinks at least.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.360
Yeah, that's a very convenient thing to think.

28:30.160 --> 28:35.200
So in other news, get hubs now officially part of Microsoft, Chris. Yeah. Yeah. Ooh. Yeah. Good.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.840
Yeah. With government approvals received, the acquisition announced in June is officially

28:39.840 --> 28:46.400
complete and get hub is now part of Microsoft. How do you, you know, how do you even follow any

28:46.400 --> 28:51.840
of this up? Like we're just at a place now where this consolidation. Yeah. We're in a phase of

28:51.840 --> 29:00.160
consolidation. Maybe, maybe it'll leave fertile ground for new upstarts. I don't think so though.

29:00.160 --> 29:05.120
I don't think so. Yeah. I think we're, I think what's happening is an entire business cycle is

29:05.120 --> 29:11.680
basically coming to its end. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And I feel a bit of mourning. I don't know what it is,

29:11.680 --> 29:15.920
but there's a bit, there's a touch of sadness for it, which doesn't feel like an appropriate

29:15.920 --> 29:19.840
response. It feels like this doesn't really affect me. I shouldn't feel sad, but at the same time,

29:19.840 --> 29:25.520
it's, I feel like there, it's an era that's passing and a special company that was unique

29:25.520 --> 29:32.480
is getting absorbed into a larger organization that, that quite frankly has failed to impress

29:32.480 --> 29:36.320
for the last few years. I think their Watson stuff has smelled like bullshit from afar.

29:36.880 --> 29:40.640
A lot of us have kind of thought that, I mean, I think you and I've talked about it, how it just,

29:40.640 --> 29:46.640
it's marketing hype. I think we've talked about that on this show and so I just, they kind of,

29:47.680 --> 29:53.360
you know, I kind of lost faith in IBM. And now to see this, we'll see, we'll see where it goes.

29:53.360 --> 29:57.520
Just, just don't know. And you know, time will tell, as they say on these things could take

29:57.520 --> 30:02.720
years before anything major changes, to be honest. Oh, I would hope that they would be,

30:02.720 --> 30:07.120
you know, respectful of the community and, and red and indeed red hat was making money.

30:07.120 --> 30:10.400
Right. So it's not like, it's not like this is a ship that's on fire.

30:11.200 --> 30:17.840
Right. 30, $34 billion though, that, that took some serious effort on their part. That's IBM's

30:18.960 --> 30:24.080
very serious about this move. You know, you want to make sure you get a return on investment on

30:24.080 --> 30:30.160
34 billion. Can I make, can I make, can I make a coder prediction? Yeah. I say canonical Amazon.

30:32.480 --> 30:37.920
If canonical gets acquired, it'll be Amazon. If they try, if they treated them like a Zappos,

30:37.920 --> 30:43.360
that would be okay by me. That's not going to happen. No, it wouldn't. No, no, it wouldn't.

30:43.920 --> 30:49.280
They might let them work remote though. Yeah. So, uh, remote workers, according to an article over

30:49.280 --> 30:56.720
at inc.com are outperforming office workers and research shows that, uh, the real issue comes

30:56.720 --> 31:01.520
down to employees being able to, unable to concentrate at their desk, uh, which is, uh,

31:01.520 --> 31:07.120
that's an interesting reason. I'll tell you, um, that I'll go through their reasons and then I'll,

31:07.120 --> 31:11.520
I'll, I'll give you my thoughts here. They say productivity, uh, with no office distractions

31:11.520 --> 31:15.760
and greater autonomy, remote workers have the freedom to get more done. In fact, according to

31:15.760 --> 31:20.160
a nationwide survey, 65% of workers said the remote work would give their productivity a

31:20.160 --> 31:27.280
boost. Another 86% said that working alone allows them to hit maximum productivity. Despite the

31:27.280 --> 31:31.200
distance though, remote workers are actually sometimes the best teammates. This is another

31:31.200 --> 31:36.880
reason why productivity goes up. This is because the distance demands more communication and

31:36.880 --> 31:41.360
without being able to lean on physical proximity, remote workers must reach out to another frequently

31:41.360 --> 31:49.760
and with purpose leads to stronger collaboration. And then there's presence. Often office life is

31:49.760 --> 31:54.160
littered with absences, workers who are calling six, sneaking out early to run an errand or even

31:54.160 --> 31:59.040
go to an event on time. But remote workers don't really need to make excuses since they're not tied

31:59.040 --> 32:03.520
to any office. They can design their workday to meet the demands of their lives. If they have a

32:03.520 --> 32:07.520
cold, they can work from home without spreading the germs to the office too. There's just a,

32:07.520 --> 32:14.160
these are just a few reasons. No beard taps or hammocks are necessary. You're right in the

32:14.160 --> 32:22.640
article. But I'll tell you. So my experience is sort of a mixed bag with remote work.

32:22.640 --> 32:29.760
So the first part is when I do go down to the Keller office, I can not work in a cubicle there.

32:29.760 --> 32:35.360
I can't, like they have a few like open desks with like keyboard stands and second monitors

32:35.360 --> 32:39.200
and phones and all that kind of stuff. And I was like, oh, I got a power cord, USB-C,

32:39.200 --> 32:44.320
I'll just sit down and hook up. I just can't work like that. People be talking. Like they're all

32:44.320 --> 32:49.200
talking. They're just talking, talk, talk, talk, bitching, mostly bitching. Sometimes you'll hear

32:49.200 --> 32:52.080
somebody on the phone bitching, they're bitching. I don't want to hear any of that when I'm trying

32:52.080 --> 32:57.040
to work. They're talking and I need to focus. So I had to go lock myself in a sound booth to go

32:57.040 --> 33:08.320
work. But here remotely, there are certain things that you just don't get to participate in like a

33:08.320 --> 33:14.720
group lunch in the office. You're kind of left out of that kind of stuff. Or another example that

33:14.720 --> 33:23.120
drives me crazy right now is they have a small packet loss about every 10 seconds on their

33:23.120 --> 33:29.040
network that mostly doesn't affect anything except for VoIP calls. Like web browsing,

33:29.040 --> 33:33.520
even watching video doesn't impact it because everything buffers, everything pretty much sorts

33:33.520 --> 33:39.120
it out, TCP retransmits. But VoIP calls, which are not only UDP, so they don't retransmit,

33:39.120 --> 33:45.360
but also highly susceptible to packet loss. So remote workers, things get cut out. You can't

33:45.360 --> 33:50.960
hear every 10 seconds or so what people at the office are saying, but they don't hear it because

33:50.960 --> 33:54.800
they're not on the side of the call against the dropout, so it doesn't get fixed. It's not a

33:54.800 --> 34:00.560
concern. So there's small things to it. But then on the plus side, I today decided I'm going to

34:00.560 --> 34:05.040
start working at 5 AM. I came in, I started working at 5 AM today, and I just have the office to

34:05.040 --> 34:10.560
myself. Nobody's here to steal that perfect morning productivity that I managed to achieve,

34:11.200 --> 34:15.680
which is rare and prescient. And I was able to come in and have the morning to myself

34:15.680 --> 34:22.720
and sip on my caffeinated beverage and get some work done with no interruptions for hours,

34:22.720 --> 34:29.440
which just wouldn't be possible in an office. So there's definitely those kinds of mixes and

34:29.440 --> 34:38.640
minuses, but the tools today, Zoom meetings, Slack, Dropbox paper, Google Docs, they are so common

34:38.640 --> 34:44.000
and effective that everybody's using those same core tools, rather you're on the land at the

34:44.000 --> 34:48.640
land at the office or you're remote working in Alaska. Everybody's on the same tool set now.

34:48.640 --> 34:52.960
Everybody's using the same exact tools and applications to do everything. And that

34:52.960 --> 34:57.680
consistency has made a huge difference, especially when you're dealing with applications that don't

34:57.680 --> 35:04.560
require a VPN or don't require special crazy network security, because these are services

35:04.560 --> 35:11.440
like Slack and Google Docs. And removing those barriers has made remote work as a remote employee

35:11.440 --> 35:16.400
much simpler, much easier. And I think it makes a big difference if you have a large percentage of

35:16.400 --> 35:21.920
your work base that's remote. If you're one person who's remote, or there's two or three people that

35:21.920 --> 35:26.720
are remote and everybody else is local, you're really the odd person out. And so if you have

35:26.720 --> 35:30.560
a large percentage that are remote, then there are certain accommodations that the company makes,

35:32.160 --> 35:37.040
like putting HR files online in a secured location instead of paperwork that you have to go in and

35:37.040 --> 35:41.040
fill out and then hand to them. There's little accommodations that can be made for employers

35:41.040 --> 35:47.200
for employees to make that stuff smoother, to give them resources through a web portals or whatnot

35:47.200 --> 35:53.840
that don't require physically going to somebody's office or doing an inner office mail. Anyways,

35:53.840 --> 36:02.640
so I'd say on the flip side of remote work now, I think my overall takeaway is as an employee,

36:03.440 --> 36:08.800
I am definitely more effective remote, definitely considerably more effective. When I go into the

36:08.800 --> 36:14.720
office, I'm effective in a different way. So what I do is I batch. So when I go down into Texas,

36:14.720 --> 36:21.840
I batch meetings or certain types of conversations that I'd rather have in person or something that

36:21.840 --> 36:27.120
needed like a group of people at a table, I'll batch that stuff up. So it's a good kind of

36:27.120 --> 36:31.120
hybrid approach, I think, to remote work. And when I kind of came to that conclusion and making it

36:31.120 --> 36:36.800
really easy by following some of the travel hacks that have been sent into the show and by keeping

36:36.800 --> 36:41.600
a go bag down at the Linux Academy office, I can jump on a plane, it's a four-hour flight max,

36:42.480 --> 36:48.000
and if I leave here in the morning, I can get down there mid-afternoon and actually get

36:48.000 --> 36:53.440
worked on that day. And that works pretty effectively. And that kind of flexibility

36:53.440 --> 36:59.840
is really nice to have. But it's still not a perfect arrangement, I'd say, just because of

36:59.840 --> 37:06.080
things like VoIP calls sometimes can be a little crappy. If you have a room full of people that are

37:06.080 --> 37:09.280
having a meeting and you're the one remote worker who's joining that meeting, you kind of have to

37:09.280 --> 37:14.800
sit there and wait till they remember to connect to you and that kind of stuff. But overall,

37:14.800 --> 37:22.800
it's nice to have the flexibility. Yeah, I'm still not sure what I think about it.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.880
Really? This article didn't change your mind at all or anything?

37:24.880 --> 37:33.040
It didn't change it. I think it's what I'm doing because it's the best of all bad solutions,

37:33.040 --> 37:40.080
but I think remote work can... I'm not sure. I'm not sure if it either creates new issues or it

37:40.080 --> 37:43.440
can exacerbate issues that are already there. Well, let me tell you what I was struggling

37:43.440 --> 37:47.360
with. And I wonder if you've tried this when you're doing remote work. The biggest struggle

37:47.360 --> 37:52.800
for me was a drop in my energy level because I'm sitting around this place all day long in my office

37:52.800 --> 37:58.640
chair, going upstairs, going downstairs, just in this building all day. It's quiet. There's nobody

37:58.640 --> 38:03.600
I'm interacting with. And by the afternoon, or sometimes even in the morning, if I start really

38:03.600 --> 38:10.480
early, my energy starts to drop off. And one of the things I've been experimenting with is going

38:10.480 --> 38:18.000
to these various locations to work that are more public. This sounds very basic of me, but to be

38:18.000 --> 38:23.840
honest, I've found it's working really well. I got the Starbucks app, which I've never done this

38:23.840 --> 38:31.200
before. I got the Starbucks app on my phone and I order up some egg bites and some caffeine,

38:31.840 --> 38:34.800
and I walk into the Starbucks, I grab it, and I sit there and I work on their Google

38:34.800 --> 38:44.160
wifi for like 45 minutes in a public space, like a regular person. It's weird. You ever tried this?

38:44.160 --> 38:47.360
It is weird. It keeps the energy level up though, is what I'm trying to get. Like changing it up.

38:47.360 --> 38:52.720
I'll have to try it. Yeah. I find that if I do the right kind of work there, I can't be like

38:52.720 --> 38:58.080
super focused. It has to be kind of light work, but I do a certain amount of light work there.

38:58.800 --> 39:05.440
And just the change of vibe and location and all of that. And just really the ability that I can

39:06.480 --> 39:11.440
actually legitimately work at a Starbucks is, I don't know, it just feels cool. And it doesn't

39:11.440 --> 39:19.920
have to be a Starbucks. It could be Joe's Coffee. Wes likes to go to a local brew pub and he just

39:19.920 --> 39:25.360
hangs out. That's more my- I know, right? And it's down on the waterfront, the Seattle waterfront,

39:25.360 --> 39:29.200
too. So he gets a table where he can look out at the water. They got wifi. I mean, the guy's got it

39:29.200 --> 39:35.120
and he can walk there from his place. That's the setup. I mean, that Wes Payne, he knows what he's

39:35.120 --> 39:40.800
doing. Now me, I'm just going to basic Starbucks here, but it's worked for me for a little bit now.

39:40.800 --> 39:47.120
And when I added this semi-recently to my remote work regime, when I sat here, I'm thinking to

39:47.120 --> 39:53.680
myself, why am I at this desk? I'm getting sleepy. And I could take the same exact laptop and I could

39:53.680 --> 39:59.440
go work somewhere else. And the thing about that app on the Starbucks thing, and there's probably

39:59.440 --> 40:04.960
other places that do this, is there's no waiting. There's no lines. There's none of that fuss that

40:04.960 --> 40:09.440
I'm not a big fan of. Like when you order food with this app, you walk in and it's just right

40:09.440 --> 40:14.160
there on a hot plate waiting for you. And you just grab it, you say, thank you. And they say,

40:14.160 --> 40:19.200
thank you. And you go sit down and you leave. It's the best thing ever. Yeah. Isn't that great?

40:19.200 --> 40:26.320
So it's, I have found that tweaking my remote work by about every other day or so, I'll go

40:26.320 --> 40:31.040
do this. And I've been doing it for about two weeks. I found that working outside can sometimes

40:31.040 --> 40:37.520
help going on if you have a backyard or a porch. Sure. Sure. I'm also one last thing I'm trying

40:37.520 --> 40:44.240
to do. And then I'm also trying to leverage a few more of the Google tools, which I've resisted

40:44.240 --> 40:50.400
because it, you know, it's, you know what the thing is, is like, I'm already in on Google

40:50.400 --> 40:55.840
apps because Linux Academy and Jupiter broadcasting use Google apps and we use Google docs to do this

40:55.840 --> 41:02.480
show. Right. And the other thing is, is it's getting ubiquitous. Everybody has a Google account,

41:03.040 --> 41:07.200
family members. Like when I go to a family thing or, you know, for Hadia, my fiance,

41:07.200 --> 41:10.320
she has a, everybody has a Google account, everybody. So if I want to share something with

41:10.320 --> 41:16.000
them, it's almost guaranteed I can share a doc or a photo or whatever. So yeah, I have,

41:16.000 --> 41:18.800
I have bit the bullet and I ordered myself one of those Google home hubs.

41:20.320 --> 41:25.200
Going to try that out. It's got the little calendar on there, you know? Now, will that and your home

41:25.200 --> 41:30.080
pods could have like a battle royale to death? I hope so. I hope that would be so amazing if

41:30.080 --> 41:34.000
when I'm not around, they're like, they're like fighting it out, like packet wars,

41:34.000 --> 41:40.080
the sending, trying to send like ping of death to each other. Yeah. I'm going to give it a go.

41:40.080 --> 41:43.600
We'll see how it works, you know, and I'm going to use the integration with Todoist,

41:43.600 --> 41:50.320
which is my to do app of choice. So can we talk about our least favorite topic again? Sure.

41:51.360 --> 41:56.720
I am, as you know, in the market for a workstation. Oh my goodness. This again. Yes. This again,

41:57.440 --> 42:03.600
there is an Apple event tomorrow and system 76 is doing some very pretty videos while telling

42:03.600 --> 42:08.960
you nothing about the product they're going to ship, which is a interesting marketing strategy.

42:08.960 --> 42:14.160
Classic. Classic. I don't even want to know what these videos cost.

42:16.160 --> 42:26.880
So tomorrow, supposedly there may be new iMacs and the new quote unquote pro Mac mini.

42:26.880 --> 42:33.520
And I have been seeing a lot of excitement about the pro Mac mini and I just want to maybe lower

42:33.520 --> 42:43.760
some expectations. Okay. Because if this computer indeed is, you know, announced and like released

42:43.760 --> 42:50.960
within a reasonable timeframe after tomorrow, all it's going to probably be is a MacBook Pro

42:50.960 --> 43:02.320
high end 13 low end 15 in a little box. Right. So it's really not, I, my guess is that it's just

43:02.320 --> 43:06.800
given history and that they're coming out with a Mac pro and that the iMac pro exists. It's not

43:06.800 --> 43:12.560
going to hit that sweet spot for most people, I think listening to the show.

43:14.240 --> 43:18.960
Why not? I mean, you know, you put an I seven in that thing. You put a MVME SSE,

43:18.960 --> 43:24.320
SSD in there. I think you want a GPU, right? Cause I think otherwise you may as well just go with

43:24.320 --> 43:28.480
the laptop. Although I will say that I have come to the conclusion that laptops make terrible

43:28.480 --> 43:34.640
desktop replacements for the most part for me, I don't know that it's a big enough Delta to,

43:35.840 --> 43:41.600
to have that make sense. I don't know. I mean, I could almost see what you're saying.

43:42.880 --> 43:46.240
I guess I could see what you're saying on the GPU, but it seems like with, with Thunderbolt

43:46.240 --> 43:53.680
and all of that stuff, there's other methods now to get the USBC stuff. The USBC, the whole

43:53.680 --> 44:02.080
ecosystem is so flaky and crappy right now. Like what's the point? So then you have the idea of a

44:02.080 --> 44:09.600
bumped iMac, right? Which I think is maybe the more viable option. Cause you can get like an

44:09.600 --> 44:18.480
NVIDIA card, hopefully. And it's, you know, a very nice 27 inch monitor. What if that doesn't

44:18.480 --> 44:23.440
exist, right? Apple has been super stingy with their hardware upgrades, unless you're willing

44:23.440 --> 44:31.040
to spend like $5,000. Sure. Am I, am I overly pessimistic because I've been responding to

44:31.040 --> 44:38.160
people with, I don't think the event is going to be what you want it to be.

44:38.160 --> 44:43.040
I thought this was going to be an iPad event. And I would say it is an iPad event, but they also have

44:43.040 --> 44:49.840
Macs. Yeah. I'd say it's a safe bet to keep lowered expectations. If they don't update the Mac mini,

44:49.840 --> 44:55.760
that is a tragedy. That's a tragedy. It's a travesty and a tragedy. And I wouldn't expect

44:55.760 --> 45:02.560
a lot on the iMac. For me, I feel like the iMac is fairly competitive. You just recently got the

45:02.560 --> 45:09.680
iMac pro. We had the iMac pro ship recently and the iMac 5k isn't really that competitive. So you

45:09.680 --> 45:16.000
could see some updates there. You're not going to see any teasing for the Mac pro. I disagree on the

45:16.000 --> 45:19.200
Mac mini. I don't think they need to make that much of an update to it. I think if they just

45:19.200 --> 45:24.960
basically ripped off the Intel NUC, people would be happy. The mini is a glue machine. It's not a,

45:24.960 --> 45:30.640
not a performance desktop. You stick it all together with the mini. You know what I mean?

45:30.640 --> 45:35.520
And yeah, it's, well, it's a media server from a lot of people, right? And you know,

45:35.520 --> 45:40.160
the iPad pros, I'll be curious to see what they do there. Be curious to see. Again.

45:40.160 --> 45:46.400
Well, those have already leaked completely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. USB-C they say, but that really could

45:46.400 --> 45:51.120
just be a USB-C dongle in the box for all we know. We don't really know. We'll have to wait

45:51.120 --> 45:56.400
and see tomorrow. You know, all will be revealed, right? Because like we can speculate now, but

45:56.400 --> 46:02.240
really it's like literally tomorrow. This show will be already stale. Yeah. In two days, whatever

46:02.240 --> 46:05.680
the hell Thelio is probably would know to probably be today when the show's coming out. Well,

46:05.680 --> 46:09.840
anyways, that has been, that has been, I was good. I liked that. You know, we should, we should,

46:09.840 --> 46:15.440
we should actually make this an official segment. Don't you think? Like we could call this,

46:15.440 --> 46:27.040
we could call this a lowered expectations with Mike. Yeah. Is that going to be the, I like it.

46:27.040 --> 46:32.400
You know what? I love it. There's all kinds of things I can. That'd be great dude. Next week, Rust.

46:32.400 --> 46:38.160
Yeah. All right. Well, anything else you want to fire bomb before we get out of here? You good?

46:40.400 --> 46:43.840
I hope Twitter goes bankrupt. I don't know. Oh, oh. In the meantime,

46:43.840 --> 46:50.880
where can people find you on Twitter? We are the worst. I'm at Chris LAS.

46:50.880 --> 46:54.640
The whole show and all its links is over at coder.show. Everything we talked about today,

46:55.280 --> 47:00.880
news items, things like that. Coder.show slash 331. You can also go to coder.show slash subscribe

47:00.880 --> 47:05.120
for all the links to subscribe. You're catching the theme here, right? It's all over on our site.

47:05.120 --> 47:10.160
Like say you want to send us some contact. Guess what? Coder.show slash contact. It's pretty fancy

47:10.160 --> 47:13.680
how that works, huh? Anyways, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the show. We'd love

47:13.680 --> 47:19.600
to see you live next time. Check the calendar. We may be recording next week's episode later

47:19.600 --> 47:41.120
this week. How does that work? I don't know. See you then.
