9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,060
My name is Chris and joining us stationed in his podcasting bunker in the heart of Florida,

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,640
it is our host, Mr. Dominic.

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
Hello, Mike.

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
Hello, Chris.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
How are you today?

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm all right.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
How are you doing?

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
I am.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, I was OK.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,660
Yeah, then NASA made an announcement.

19
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,140
They found water on the moon.

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,720
I'm not saying it's aliens, but you know, if you were an alien, where would you stash

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,200
your ice on the moon?

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Right.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Because otherwise, those dirty humans are going to get to it.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
But hey, hey, Chris, moon teenies.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Exactly.

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,760
That's what I'm thinking.

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,940
Now we know we're going to go work on the moon one day.

28
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,240
It's just a matter of when work from home.

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,240
Work from the moon.

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,240
Is it working if the aliens have us in prison camps?

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
I'm just saying.

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Right.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,520
Actually, you know, I think the low gravity situation might be better on my RSI.

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,400
So, you know, write off.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
True.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,520
How will it affect mechanical keyboards?

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,280
Like will the cherry blue still be?

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Yeah.

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
Yeah.

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Will they have that same kind of clack?

41
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
I'm not so sure they would.

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,360
So just a little bit of a Martian bacon real quick.

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
Sure.

44
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,040
I mean, you know, I always prepare the bacon here for you.

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,600
I've got it all ready to go.

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,640
Those who don't listen to unfilter should go listen to unfilter.

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,440
But he's not even this conspiratorial.

48
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,120
So within the last year, let's see.

49
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,720
We've had several announcements from NASA regarding Mars, now the moon, and we very

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,080
quickly ramped up something called Space Force.

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Sure.

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,720
Let me tell you Mike's crazy thing.

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
Here's what happened.

54
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,360
Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump were in a hotel room, right?

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
They thought they were meeting someone to quote, interview them.

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
Sure.

57
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,000
They thought that person ripped off their meat suit and was an alien.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,240
What are you going to do when that happens?

60
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,180
They promptly crapped their pants.

61
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
That's what I would do.

62
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,640
And Trump formed Space Force, which he did correctly because this is going to be the

63
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,440
craziest episode of Quota Radio.

64
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,840
I am a firm believer that there will be alien contact within my life.

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,880
Oh, that would be so amazing.

66
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
It's gotta be.

67
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,920
Why are all of a sudden all this stuff is coming out?

68
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,200
I like your crap the pants theory, but I feel like you could work in Elon somehow, you know,

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
with SpaceX and Starlink.

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,280
So how do we know Elon is himself not an alien?

71
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Right.

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
Of course.

73
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
You know what?

74
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
He seems-

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
He has this technology nobody else does.

76
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
I'm just saying.

77
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
Mm-hmm.

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
He's talking about tunnels all the time.

79
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
You know, aliens love to live on the ground.

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,360
I mean, if you haven't played Resistance on the PS3, it's basically what I believe.

81
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Right.

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
So this doesn't have anything to do with your new coffee club subscription, does it?

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,360
No, but maybe wrong choice starting a coffee club now when going to be on the verge for

84
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,880
perpetual panic attack.

85
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
Right.

86
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,360
Well, you want to be caffeinated when the aliens arrive.

87
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,480
You do want to put up some form of fight, right?

88
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,680
Like, you know, I was just kind of thinking to myself, I've got a pretty high rate of

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,720
caffeine intake still these days, and mostly it comes in chilled forms, and that just sucks

90
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
in the winter.

91
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,300
You know, just it's below freezing outside, and I'm walking out the door with a sugar-free

92
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,080
Red Bull or, God forbid, sparkling water with a caffeine pill.

93
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,600
I mean, I'm an animal these days, and I got to get my act together.

94
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,560
I really got to... If I'm going to caffeinate, I need to caffeinate like a gentleman.

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,920
You could still drink Red Bull?

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,480
I do the sugar-free Red Bull, yeah.

97
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Oh, yeah.

98
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
I drink Red Bull.

99
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
I'm shaking like a crack fiend.

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
Like, it's... Yeah.

101
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,160
I'd have to have like four of those suckers.

102
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Wow, man.

103
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
You're... Okay.

104
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Yeah.

105
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,280
Yeah, the caffeine pills are like 200 milligrams when I pop a caffeine pill.

106
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,200
You know, I developed an intense caffeine tolerance when I had sleep apnea, and I've

107
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,280
actually backed off for the last year since I got a CPAP, but, you know, for 10 years,

108
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,960
I developed a Medicaid-through-caffeine approach to the first half of my day.

109
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,240
You know, it's tough.

110
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
That kind of habit.

111
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Cold turkey, you know?

112
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
No.

113
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
The withdrawals would be intense, I'm sure.

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Yeah.

115
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,820
See, now I'm just trying to find ways that are like a little more healthy to get that

116
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,080
caffeine fix, and so I've tapered way back on the Red Bull.

117
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,200
What I actually have done, for the most part, is a regime that I take in the morning with

118
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,200
a SodaStream and some bubbly water and a caffeine pill and a B12 supplement and little Mooshrooms

119
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,520
in there, too, to help me get the brain cognitive going, and that's kind of my go-out-the-door

120
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
solution.

121
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,920
But in the winter, a cold glass of bubbly water in the morning is not as refreshing

122
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,780
as it is in the summer.

123
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,320
So when you said a coffee club, I was like, well, son of a bitch, that's actually kind

124
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
of a good idea.

125
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
I don't know.

126
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
I'm tempted.

127
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,240
Have you got your first bag yet, or is it too early?

128
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,560
It's too early, although they said they shipped it, so in theory, I could have it before next

129
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
week.

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
But it's a weird deal.

131
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
They do single-origin coffee from different regions.

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,440
You get to pick the roast and all of that before they ship it to you, which I think

133
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
is kind of cool.

134
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Yeah.

135
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
Yeah.

136
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,280
So I'm in love with my AeroPress because...

137
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
It does make the best cup of coffee.

138
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,720
Like any other addict, I quit coffee briefly, and then when I went back, I...

139
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
You went hard.

140
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Went super hard.

141
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Yeah.

142
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Right.

143
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
I have burned myself several times.

144
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Yeah?

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
So...

146
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,880
I think I actually damaged my countertop a little bit in the RV.

147
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
I have stains, yeah.

148
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,240
Because they're not built super well, so I'm sitting there wrenching on the AeroPress.

149
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,960
For those of you who don't know, you press down on it, and that pressing down motion

150
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,320
every morning on your countertop does damage after a while.

151
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
So I gave it up.

152
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm frequently tempted to just go back to the traditional French press and not burn

153
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
myself, but...

154
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,860
There's got to be some listeners out there that have a pretty solid caffeine regime that

155
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,800
doesn't leave them feeling strung out at the end of the day, so you've got to go to coder.show

156
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,440
slash contact, peanut42 in the chat room says he suggests mate tea or mix the caffeine.

157
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,160
You start with coffee, then you transition to green tea, and then you finish off with

158
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
mate.

159
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
See, he does...

160
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
He has a bit of a regime there.

161
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
That's basically what I do.

162
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,400
I literally wean myself.

163
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,120
In the morning, it's a cup of coffee, then it's black tea, then green tea, and by the

164
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,800
end of the day, I'm down to dandelion tea because I'm a hippie, and I believe that...

165
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Right.

166
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,240
Because if you blow it, you mess your sleep up.

167
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Right.

168
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,240
You can't Captain Picard it and have two Earl Grey hot at like 10.30 at night.

169
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
No.

170
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,120
If there is anything fake about Star Trek, anything, it's that, that Captain Picard's

171
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
drinking tea.

172
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Yes.

173
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,880
That is the one thing that makes no sense.

174
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
It's the one thing.

175
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Otherwise, everything's totally explainable.

176
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,080
Well, we got a whole bunch of feedback, a few more on the Dark Matter developer subject,

177
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,200
and we had a reflective Dark Matter dev.

178
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,960
All of these guys, totally understandable and we are happy to accommodate, have asked

179
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,960
to just remain anonymous for, I think, pretty understandable reasons.

180
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,960
So we're leaving everyone anonymous who is a Dark Matter developer that writes in, but

181
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,600
they write, in response to the Dark Matter developer, I worked at a large retailer in

182
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,960
the US on a specific applications team.

183
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,200
It was about 150 people on this development team.

184
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:31,160
I was the lead DevOps engineer for the team managing 2000 plus VM deployments of Sousa

185
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
10.

186
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Yes.

187
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,160
And eventually Sles 11.

188
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Yes.

189
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Although then he quit.

190
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,920
We were doing so well.

191
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,640
That's true.

192
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,360
The company had a strong push to use Java and Angular.

193
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,680
They had an architecture review board.

194
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,000
This is what I thought was fascinating, Mike, is getting some insights into how this actually

195
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,920
works in these large companies.

196
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,960
They had an architecture review board that would approve languages and deployment platforms

197
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,040
that could be used within the company.

198
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,300
Half the company was stuck in the legacy IBM web sphere world, while the other half was

199
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,880
migrating to an on-premises pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment.

200
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,600
The platform team even went to the extent of writing internal Spring Boot initializer

201
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,720
sites that would set up everything from the Maven module all the way to the repo provisioning,

202
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,160
security counts, load balancers, et cetera.

203
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,520
He goes on to say, they limit a lot more than the programming languages, but it does make

204
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,600
shopping for Java devs easy.

205
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,480
So from a hiring standpoint, it works really well for them.

206
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,520
The role I was in somehow allowed for me to bring in some new software, Prometheus, Ansible,

207
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:42,880
Docker, Node.js, and some Go, but mainstream adoption inside the company was extremely

208
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,640
hard and ruffled a lot of feathers.

209
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,080
But since COVID, the team is looking to move to a full hybrid model, allowing employees

210
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,480
to work remotely permanently.

211
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,960
In short, the company was clear trying to make its strides to be more cloud-native,

212
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,800
but they ended up having a long road in politics that finally beat me down, and that's why

213
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,080
he left, because they were trying to get to cloud-native.

214
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,280
They were trying to get there, but there was just this cult of the old way of doing things.

215
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,880
And you got architecture review boards and platform teams that said all these things,

216
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,200
and you may have some crazy new idea, but they're just not having it.

217
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,680
And he found it extremely frustrating, which is totally understandable.

218
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,320
But thanks for the reflections on that.

219
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,960
I thought that was interesting.

220
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,120
And yet another email where the full-time working at the desk staff are transitioning

221
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,940
to this hybrid work from home work at the office again.

222
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,040
That is a trend we keep seeing in these emails.

223
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
You know my bet.

224
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,560
I think there's no going back to the way things were.

225
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,680
We're not going back to 19, right, 21, 22, so forth.

226
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,940
Couldn't smart employers spin this as a benefit, too?

227
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,940
It's a perk.

228
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,200
It's great for you.

229
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,000
It's good for the environment because it means less people are commuting, so now your company

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,180
is more green because they're reducing carbon emissions of their employee, and it saves

231
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,180
them on cleaning.

232
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,360
It saves them on office space.

233
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,600
It saves them on cooling costs.

234
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,700
It saves them on snack costs.

235
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,040
It saves them on parking, I mean, just all these areas.

236
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,160
And salary, right?

237
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,720
We didn't cover it on this show, but there was a story, a bunch of the tech companies

238
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,160
who are allowing remote work are, I don't know what the right word, reducing, nerfing,

239
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
prorating?

240
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,440
I don't know what should be the right word.

241
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,600
Your salary, if you happen to live in a, I don't know, if you live in Florida, they're

242
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,580
going to pay you a lower wage than they would pay someone in New York or San Francisco.

243
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,600
So that's interesting for the remote team.

244
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
There's that, right?

245
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
So they can work that angle.

246
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,600
I've also worked with companies where being remote meant we might be based out of Texas

247
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,120
or we might be based out of Utah, but we can hire worldwide.

248
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,160
It opened their options up to a much wider range of developers and skill sets, and it

249
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,640
also meant they could poach people that, say, had moved to California to work for Google

250
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,940
or work for Amazon here in Washington, they could poach those people and just have them

251
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
stay there.

252
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,520
They didn't have to relocate, and that was a huge perk for them.

253
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,400
And in a way, I think they had to pay according to the location they live at.

254
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,480
So if they, say, lived in Montana, they'd probably pay them one rate.

255
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,680
And if they lived, say, in San Francisco, they'd pay a different rate.

256
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,620
So they did scale it based on their location, from my recollection.

257
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,520
But it gave them just a much larger pool than just the local folks, for better or for worse.

258
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,640
Yeah, I mean, especially for technical work, I kind of don't see a reason not to.

259
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,280
I really do think the hybrid model of having some sort of HQ where people can get together

260
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,960
if needed, or for more sales-y reasons, right?

261
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,200
But why would you need to house 30 developers in an expensive office and then have to feed

262
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
them candy and...

263
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Red Bull.

264
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
You know, moon-teenies?

265
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,180
I remember when I first joined, and I'm 100% serious about this, just to give you an idea

266
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,180
of the scale, right?

267
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:02,080
When I joined Linux Academy, I worked a lot for like four months out of their main office.

268
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,680
And I think their food and snack budget, because they had this always like refilling the fridge

269
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,280
policy and lunches were brought in on Friday, I'm pretty sure they had more money just invested

270
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,000
in doing that than Jupyter Broadcasting made every year.

271
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,840
You know, just that line item expense for them, the snacks and the free lunch week Fridays,

272
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,480
I think probably cost them more in total than all the revenue Jupyter Broadcasting would

273
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
earn in a year.

274
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,520
I mean, it was really...

275
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,820
We joke about it, right?

276
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,520
But when you think about how you actually execute that, there is someone in charge of

277
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:41,040
the office, and she was running to Costco on company time, expensing her gas, using

278
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,540
a company credit card to buy food, and then she was driving it back, she was stocking,

279
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,800
and doing that every single day.

280
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,160
You know, hundreds of dollars each time, every single day.

281
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,440
It is really expensive, and to be able to cut that back matters.

282
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,440
The issue is really here in the States is broadband, and Benny writes in to really make

283
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
us feel bad about it.

284
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,000
He says, hey guys, I've been listening from episode one, and just a couple days ago, fan

285
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,600
out your back, so I've been binging all of the episodes.

286
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,660
That's the way to do it, right?

287
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,660
That's right.

288
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,660
And now he's writing in.

289
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,720
He says, I wanted to comment on your data plan issues in the U.S. and brag about mine.

290
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,880
Here in Israel, my plan, which is LTE, I get 500 gigs a month with no limitations.

291
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,400
I can stream PornHub all day long if that floats your boat, and I get free eSIM support

292
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
for my Apple Watch.

293
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
God damn it.

294
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
I know.

295
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,440
For roughly the equivalent of 17 USD.

296
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,360
Other providers might give you like 150 gigs with no eSIM support for just $8, but hey,

297
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,200
you guys got Trump, so it's all good.

298
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,960
Keep being the masters of podcasting while slaying lizards, Benny.

299
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Thank you, Benny.

300
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
I agree on the lizards part at least.

301
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,480
I hate everything about that email.

302
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,520
Why can't we have good broadband?

303
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,400
Monopolies, I guess.

304
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
I know.

305
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
I know.

306
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
I know.

307
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,840
It's a bad situation because now we're getting 5G and there's still these caps and limits

308
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
on 5G.

309
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,640
I have to believe at some point things have to shift.

310
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,560
When it becomes more common that your home broadband connection is provided by wireless

311
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,020
than it is wired, something's going to have to shift.

312
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,580
It's going to be schooling, right?

313
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,680
That's going to have to push it.

314
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:20,360
Or maybe your buddy Space Alien Elon comes in with his Starlink and there's a tribe here

315
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,860
in Washington, not far from the studio, that is demoing Starlink right now and had no connectivity

316
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,120
before this.

317
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,200
Now they have Starlink and they're getting around 20 millisecond response times in pinging

318
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,380
to Google and they're getting 80 megabits on some of their download speeds.

319
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,380
That's not bad at all.

320
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,380
From Starlink.

321
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,380
No.

322
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,580
I mean, it's not Israel good, but we'll take it.

323
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,240
So horrible, horrible story.

324
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,720
I called Spectrum, otherwise known as Bright House, who is Mad Botter's ISP.

325
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
We actually have two.

326
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,880
The other one's Frontier, who's in bankruptcy right now because, yes.

327
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,580
So good.

328
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,280
And I said, hey, I would like to upgrade our broadband.

329
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Yeah.

330
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
I was like, sure.

331
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
All right.

332
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Yeah.

333
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
We could definitely get that up for you.

334
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
We can get 500 down.

335
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,160
I'm like, yes, I like this.

336
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
And wow.

337
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Are you sure you want the top rate?

338
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Yes, I do.

339
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
35 up.

340
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,520
I'm just, no, I want the top rate.

341
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Yep.

342
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Yeah.

343
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
That is the top rate.

344
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Uh-huh.

345
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
You want to know something?

346
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
No joke.

347
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,280
Right before this show, I got a call from my Comcast rep.

348
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Oh, God.

349
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,600
My business package, which is $200 a month, expires next month.

350
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,560
It goes up $150.

351
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,960
It's nice when you have a captive market, isn't it?

352
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Yeah.

353
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
It sure is.

354
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,160
They're offering me a new bundle, which will cost me $100 more.

355
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,080
I'll get 600 down and 35 up.

356
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,640
That's the best I can get.

357
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
35 up.

358
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Same thing.

359
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,240
So if you're Mike and you're insane, what would your next phone call be?

360
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,960
I mean, I don't know if there's many choices when you want steady, reliable broadband,

361
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,560
especially if you're self-hosting stuff.

362
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,240
I mean, I think I'm going to do it.

363
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,520
Here's the funny thing, man.

364
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,280
They're making me take, I think, two phone lines or something, which I told them I'm

365
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,240
not even going to use, but to get the bundle discount.

366
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,720
Actual phone lines?

367
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Yeah.

368
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Yeah.

369
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Okay.

370
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
And they have to install them.

371
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Oh, God.

372
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
So they have to show the install.

373
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,160
So in order to get around that system, what the guy's going to do is he's going to discount

374
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,000
me a month to cover the install fees, which they have to do with the phone lines that

375
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,440
they have to bundle in order to get me the internet discount that I want.

376
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,880
So stupid.

377
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
It's really something.

378
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
That is the dumbest.

379
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
I know.

380
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,920
I mean, what I'm doing, which is not really feasible, I don't think, for a team, I mean,

381
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,360
maybe four or five people.

382
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,800
I'm investing in LadyJuice.

383
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,320
I'm investing in an industrial grade LTE router.

384
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
I received it.

385
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,320
I've just started setting it up, and I'll have an AT&T and a Verizon SIM, and I will

386
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:53,640
pay out the nose for that, but it is industrial grade reliable LTE as you're going to get.

387
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,200
But in a building, in an office space where you're thinking about running a chat server

388
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,560
and what else, it seems like you got to have an actual wired broadband.

389
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,800
There's just not a lot of other options.

390
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,000
They got us, Mike.

391
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,440
Or you host somewhere else, you know?

392
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,840
Or you go insane.

393
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,480
You call up the ISP, ask to speak to their fiber department.

394
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,040
Oh, they have one?

395
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,920
They have one.

396
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
And then you order fiber.

397
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,320
Oh, my goodness.

398
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,640
That's going to be a cost.

399
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,280
It is a cost.

400
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,680
The city permits willing, we are going to have fiber in our plant city facility space.

401
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,560
Man, you could double as a data center now.

402
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
That's kind of the plan.

403
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Wow.

404
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Wow, yeah.

405
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
That's super reliable.

406
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,520
And of course, exclusively hosting on the premier Linux option.

407
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Right.

408
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Right.

409
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Of course.

410
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
SUSE.

411
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
Oh, God.

412
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
God.

413
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
Really?

414
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
Yes.

415
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
Actually.

416
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
It's every time.

417
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,800
Do you know how fast they could possibly get it?

418
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Yeah.

419
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,600
It's a gigabit fiber, so it's, yeah.

420
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,640
And they're running it directly into the space through like a wall.

421
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Potential hiccup, right?

422
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,480
This requires permits.

423
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,000
So hopefully, you know, we don't get nimbied to hell.

424
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,720
But you know, we are going to here look into our other options, but I don't think there

425
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
is any other options.

426
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
I think it's only Comcast here.

427
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
And I don't think they offer fiber.

428
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,200
I think it's just business cable or regular cable.

429
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Yeah.

430
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,160
Well, I was kind of surprised at like, because like, obviously, I didn't wake up and be like,

431
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,400
I'm going to install a fiber line, right?

432
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Yeah.

433
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Right.

434
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
But there was no other option.

435
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,480
It's bad.

436
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,600
It's so we talk about work from home, but this is I mean, I guess you don't need.

437
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,720
It's incredible bandwidth, but you need a reliable, solid connection with low latency,

438
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,440
especially for all the video chats.

439
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,580
And then if you're actually getting into hosting services, it's a whole nother level.

440
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,460
So I say good for you.

441
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,200
It's going to be a massive investment, but it'll be reliable as heck.

442
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,920
Do they lock you into a contract like they do with Comcast?

443
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Three years, baby.

444
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Yep.

445
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
Yeah.

446
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,920
Yeah.

447
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
Yeah.

448
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,520
I think mine's a two year with Comcast.

449
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,460
I'm seriously thinking that if they forced me to get a phone line, I might just see if

450
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,400
I can build like a Raspberry Pi voicemail machine and then just give out the number and say,

451
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,040
call the phone number Comcast made me get and leave a voicemail.

452
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,120
That's actually not a bad idea for the shows you could do like the unfiltered tip line brought

453
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,120
to you by Comcast.

454
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Yeah.

455
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
They'll love that.

456
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Yeah.

457
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,040
I mean, maybe that'll get them to stop bundling this stuff is if you just publicly shame them.

458
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
It's Comcast.

459
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
I know.

460
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
Yeah.

461
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,640
I don't think their brand is publicly shamed and they continue on.

462
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
All right.

463
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,400
So now we have some follow up from Dinesh who had wrote in about going in the couple

464
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
episodes ago.

465
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,200
He says, Hey, Michael and Chris, greetings.

466
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,560
A couple of weeks ago, I asked about you, you gentlemen to share your wisdom on whether

467
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,600
it would be a good idea to go as an independent developer.

468
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,400
Thanks a lot for your comments and guidance on the topic.

469
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,880
I really reconsidered what I was thinking and made me think of new angles and realized

470
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,760
I was turning a blind eye to a couple of items and taking them for granted.

471
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,520
So I think it was a rookie mistake.

472
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,080
I've decided to push back my challenge to go into until a later date.

473
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm not completely scrapping the idea.

474
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,520
I think I'm going to work on improving my existing network and build up a small fund

475
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,240
as a safety net and then reassess my situation next year.

476
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,760
Interestingly, I had someone approached me, though, for a side gig just a few weeks ago.

477
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,880
I turned it down due to work commitments, but that would have been a great first bug,

478
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,520
as Mike put it.

479
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,240
So we talked him out of it, which I feel a little bad about.

480
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,600
But at the same time, I think he's got a really solid plan about building a little bit of

481
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,160
a nest egg, building out contact network and taking like a 12-year view with setting an

482
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,480
end goal of by, you know, 12 months, I'm going to try to have these things in place.

483
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,280
That's the way to go if you can.

484
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,120
If you have that luxury, that seems like the ideal way to go.

485
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
I like it.

486
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Yeah.

487
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,760
He also had some thoughts on your Vim experience.

488
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,800
He says, I used to be a Vim user and I spent countless days configuring my Vim RC, way

489
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,080
more than I'd like to admit.

490
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,040
He said, I could feel the pain in Michael's voice when he was explaining the trauma he

491
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,640
had been through setting up Vim.

492
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,880
As a fellow Vim user, I understand your pain and I'd like you to consider an alternative.

493
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,760
I'd like to introduce you to Neo Vim or N Vim.

494
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,060
N Vim is still Vim under the hood to some extent, but I'd like to consider it as a separate

495
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,060
text editor.

496
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,200
I've set it up with all the useful functionalities like VS code completions, syntax checking

497
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,600
with alerts, automatic markdown preview, automatic JSON formatting and more.

498
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,560
And what I really love about N Vim or new Vim or Neo Vim is how well it integrates with

499
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,600
Conqueror, a Conqueror of completion, CoC, which provides an ID like experience for me.

500
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,200
Feel free to go through my N Vim config file.

501
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
He'll link it for you.

502
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,920
So check out Neo Vim at neo vim.io and conqueror of completion CoC on GitHub.

503
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,600
I mean, you know, I'm so happy with VS code on the command line.

504
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,720
I can understand it, but in the, on the desktop, well, I'll save my thoughts for later.

505
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,400
I think we're going to talk about VS code.

506
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,440
Yeah, I did not unfortunately get an opportunity to try Neo Vim yet, but I will definitely

507
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
check it out.

508
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,080
I'm sort of, yeah, we're going to talk about VS code in a little bit.

509
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
Yeah.

510
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
We've got one last email.

511
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,840
This is from Alex and I wanted to hold it to the end because he's a long time listener

512
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,240
and he wants to challenge our definition of dark matter developer, which I think would

513
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,520
be good because we're still on this.

514
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,720
So if you are out there as a dark matter developer and would like to share your insights on what

515
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
it's like.

516
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Come into the light.

517
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Yeah, let us know.

518
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,000
You can come into the light, but we'll keep you anonymous.

519
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,280
We won't, we won't say where you work or what your name is.

520
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
It's all private.

521
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,720
And if you use Sue's, you have to mention it.

522
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,480
Really, we're just kind of conducting a bit of a, of a survey in a sense to kind of get

523
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,520
an idea of what it's like to work out there in a nine to five job and have a better understanding

524
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
of it.

525
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,360
So if you want to participate that coder.show slash contact and Alex writes in, he says,

526
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,200
I've been listening to the recent episodes with all the talk about dark matter developers.

527
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,600
And I think something has changed since I started hearing the term some years ago.

528
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,040
My understanding is a dark matter developer is someone who doesn't follow the blogs, podcasts,

529
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,260
new technologies and trends, or keep up with online communities.

530
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,800
Instead they just show up and do their job, not trying to push the envelope or learn new

531
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,920
things.

532
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,160
On the show, however, I think people think anyone locked into a legacy technology is

533
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,840
now a dark matter developer.

534
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,480
I think it's completely possible to be locked into say using Java aid or cobalt for certain

535
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,960
projects and still keep your skills sharp and keep up with the broader industry.

536
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,240
Longtime listener here since last 2010, I think thanks for all the work and wonderful

537
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
network.

538
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
Well, thank you, Alex.

539
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,240
I think what it is, Mike, and then I'll let you jump in on this is I think when we started

540
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,240
the show, that would be how you might define the dark matter developer, more of your cobalt

541
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,160
and old school developers who, who grew up really before there were online communities

542
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,320
and got into the industry and started working and became professionals before there was

543
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,280
podcasts or YouTube.

544
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,280
And so they don't really use those as primary sources of information.

545
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,480
I think that when we started the show over a decade ago, that was, right, has it been

546
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
a decade?

547
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
I don't know, eight, nine years ago.

548
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,580
I think that was what defined a dark matter developer.

549
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:59,440
But I think now there's not many developers that I've met who aren't keeping up to date

550
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,440
in some way.

551
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,040
I think it now just, if you're into this area of technology, especially if you're developing

552
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,760
for web technologies or mobile technologies, you kind of automatically have to stay up

553
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,120
to date with what's going on.

554
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,240
You have to keep your operating system up to date to continue to target those platforms.

555
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,080
You have to keep your browsers up to date to target the new browsers.

556
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,760
It's one hand, it's like hand in glove.

557
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
You have no choice now.

558
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,680
And so I think we've sort of in a sense updated the term to just mean people who are working

559
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,040
heads down at essentially a nine to five job who don't get any recognition, who maybe don't

560
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,360
get to work on the fancy, shiniest new technologies or toolkits, but they're cranking out reliable

561
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,440
software that an enterprise or a business or a point of sale machine or something that

562
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,560
just gets the job done, doesn't get a lot of credit, doesn't get a lot of notoriety,

563
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,600
but it's what actually makes the world tick.

564
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,880
That's what I kind of see a dark matter developer as these days.

565
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,160
Yeah, it's interesting.

566
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,760
So this email really made me think, because I think you're right that there's been, and

567
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,600
so we see that there's been like creep in the definition, because I'm trying to think

568
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,760
of any developer that I could realistically conjure in my mind that isn't somehow like

569
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,480
on using Stack Overflow or like involved in the wider community, maybe not contributing

570
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,160
and probably not contributing, right?

571
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:22,560
But you know, it's like, like you said, web development, JavaScript is just such a warp

572
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,640
speed cluster that how can you not follow the blogs and actually be able to do it?

573
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,920
So you accept my modern definition of the dark matter developer?

574
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,160
I think I do.

575
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,960
It's definitely different than the original definition.

576
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,920
But I think you're right that that original definition is simply just not possible anymore.

577
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Right?

578
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Yeah.

579
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,120
I mean, I suppose somebody could still be in a data center writing for a mainframe,

580
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,680
a system 390 somewhere that never has to get up to date.

581
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,080
But I don't even think that's a possible scenario anymore.

582
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,640
I don't even think so.

583
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,920
There's probably a couple of guys in a bunker in Kansas with some nukes that they're writing

584
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,440
Fortran and God hope they have no bugs.

585
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
We'll never know.

586
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,560
We'll never know because they're not listening.

587
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,400
So they're not going to write in.

588
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,680
Yeah, but if you are listening and you want to let us know coder.show slash contact.

589
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,960
Thanks to Linode for supporting the Coder radio program.

590
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,760
And remember, visit linode.com slash coder and receive a $100 60 day credit towards your

591
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
new account.

592
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,280
Linode started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing, three years

593
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,640
before AWS and the other cloud providers.

594
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,820
So they really know what they're doing.

595
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,680
And the fantastic thing that gives me confidence to use them for my small business is they're

596
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,280
independently owned.

597
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,440
And they're just founded on a passion of Linux and an understanding, a core understanding

598
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,840
of how the technology works.

599
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,840
And if you've worked in a company before that ships a technology product, you know how important

600
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,920
it is that the people in that company understand what it is they're shipping and making.

601
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
That's Linode.

602
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,880
And that's why it matters to me that they're independently owned.

603
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,680
That's why it matters to me they've been around since 2003.

604
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,120
And that's why I deploy my infrastructure for the last two years now.

605
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,720
For two years, I've been deploying my infrastructure on Linode.

606
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,720
As a Linux user and a participant in that community, though, I really appreciate Linode's

607
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,160
support of open source initiatives like Kibun2, like Linux Fest Northwest.

608
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,760
But as a businessman who's doing fancy business, deploying websites and whatnot, and playing

609
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,600
clips and whatnot, I really appreciate the other aspects of Linode too, beyond just hosting

610
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,280
servers at 35% to 50% less than the rest of the industry would cost.

611
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,600
They also offer features like S3 compatible object storage, which is an easy way for you

612
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
to store and access data without the need for running a front end server.

613
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,320
It's perfect for data that doesn't regularly change like images or other multimedia files.

614
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,800
I use it for clips all the time.

615
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,440
I use it for offsite backups of databases constantly.

616
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,720
And there's an API to manage all of this as well.

617
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,080
And it plugs right in with Kubernetes and Terraform if that's what you're using to deploy

618
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,600
infrastructure as code, which is probably worth considering.

619
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,920
And if you want to learn a subject like cybersecurity, well, you're going to need to be familiar

620
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,680
with all the Linux based operating systems.

621
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,600
And Linode has just about any distribution you'd want to run.

622
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,320
Even OpenSUSE is out there.

623
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,920
I mean, I don't know why, but they even have a couple of versions of OpenSUSE.

624
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,360
I won't hold it against them.

625
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,360
It's a commitment to quality.

626
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,880
They've also got the Appuntus and the Devians and the Fedoras and the Arches, even Alpine.

627
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,440
So really what Linode does is they provide virtual servers that make it easy and affordable

628
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,240
for you to host anything in the cloud.

629
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,080
I set up a Minecraft server for my kids and I run the Jupiter broadcasting matrix server

630
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,480
and encoding servers and show node servers.

631
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,560
All of that is on Linode.

632
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,720
Also my jump hosts, my VPN servers, I run it all on there.

633
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,920
You can start at $5 a month or you can go up to rigs that have multiple CPUs and GPUs

634
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,240
and really pretty powerful.

635
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,480
They're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

636
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,840
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode and you can get a $100 60-day credit when you

637
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,000
go to linode.com slash coder.

638
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,800
That supports the show, lets them know you heard about it here and gives you a $100 60-day

639
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,500
credit towards a new account.

640
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,000
That's linode.com slash coder and a big thank you to Linode for sponsoring the Coder radio

641
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
program.

642
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,720
Linode.com slash coder.

643
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,400
Let's move into the hoopla, sir.

644
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,520
And let's talk about the trouble with Gnomes because you and I have recently upgraded to

645
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,120
the latest and greatest and freshest Gnome 3.38 which comes with a lot of nice new features.

646
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Always a mistake.

647
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,240
But it does sometimes come with some downsides.

648
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,640
And sometimes they can be trivial little things that really wreck the Gnome shell experience

649
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,240
and I keep hoping one day to have the ultimate workstation OS powered by Gnome running on

650
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,800
top of a very powerful operating system like Linux and it's so close, Mike.

651
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,320
How's your initial experience gone?

652
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,640
I saw in Slack you ran into some issues.

653
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
So let's talk about it.

654
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Okay.

655
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,040
This is going to be a bit of a therapy session, I think, for us.

656
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:59,600
When designing something called extensions, it's super important that an extension not

657
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,760
be able to cripple your whole system.

658
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
Yes.

659
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,600
You might say a fundamental.

660
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,440
But that's just not the case in Gnome.

661
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,240
So I use a very popular extension called Backslide.

662
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,520
I am willing to bet many people listening also use it.

663
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:22,240
If you don't know what it is, weirdly enough, in Gnome, you cannot have like rotating wallpapers

664
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,240
by default, which I think is insane, but I can't seem to convince anybody to like modify

665
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Pop!

666
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,240
OS to just do that.

667
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,480
Mike, they just added support for being able to even set what folder your pictures reside

668
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
in.

669
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
Just recently.

670
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Okay.

671
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,200
So this is like a McDonald's parfait of problems here.

672
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,940
That's like a basic feature.

673
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:50,520
When Windows 7 is dunking on you, you have to just rethink things.

674
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,080
It's one of those many things that existed at one point, and then they took it out to

675
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,860
reimagine, redevelop it, and it just took a while to land.

676
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,760
So like a decade ago, when I ran Gnome 2, my first adventure with Linux in college,

677
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:08,960
you could in fact, right, have rotating wallpapers, just like on every other desktop operating

678
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
system.

679
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,960
And it's worth noting, if you're looking at Linux desktops here, Plasma handles this like

680
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
a champ.

681
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,100
It's got a dozen different options with sub options to choose from.

682
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,320
And I think elementary does it too.

683
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
I forgot the name of their environment, Pantheon.

684
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,320
Is that right?

685
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
Yeah.

686
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,320
Yeah.

687
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
All right.

688
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,020
So like it's not that this is like a not solved problem in other places, but okay.

689
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,680
And you got these nice screens now.

690
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,400
You want to put some nice wallpapers up there to really kind of make your screen pop.

691
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
I get it.

692
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
You want to rotate them sometimes.

693
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
You want to rotate them.

694
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
All right.

695
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
So whatever.

696
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,040
You have to install an extension to do that.

697
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,500
I think that's insane, but I understand that I can't have what I want because I'm a bad

698
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,480
person and this is what I deserve.

699
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,880
One wallpaper by default never changes, but extensions can literally bring down the desktop

700
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
environment.

701
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
Yes.

702
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,200
So I updated my lemur because one, I'm in plant city all week, so I had to do it over

703
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,440
the weekend if I wanted to do it.

704
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,280
And I wanted some of the new features because I'm, I don't know, I just do, right?

705
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
I'm a computer enthusiast.

706
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
What do you want?

707
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,240
Well, and also Gnome is in this development phase of hyperdevelopment right now where

708
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,520
each release of Gnome Shell brings usability and performance improvements.

709
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
Yeah.

710
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
And there's like pop because I run pop.

711
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,240
So like I wanted to see how like the new stacking feature that I didn't know about, you know,

712
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,320
works with the new Gnome feature.

713
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,680
So like there are reasons I want the things I want that maybe other people don't care

714
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
about.

715
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Right?

716
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Yeah.

717
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,000
But so the up, you know, it does the dist upgrade thing.

718
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It's fine.

719
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Whatever.

720
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,080
It takes a little while longer than I thought it should, but it's fine.

721
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,520
Boot back into pop, do the decrypt thing, log in all my function keys that have anything

722
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,240
to do with screen brightness or audio all of a sudden don't work.

723
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Oh.

724
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,120
And I'm just like, oh my God, it is pop.

725
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,600
I thought it really thought it was pop.

726
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,760
I'm like, son of a bitch, it's broken.

727
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Of course.

728
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
You just did an OS upgrade.

729
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
Yeah.

730
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
Right.

731
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,480
Then I remembered literally like two years ago, we had basically the same conversation.

732
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,440
I mean, it was only a year ago about I had done a Gnome update and it broke all my stuff

733
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,040
and I like a rage quit and went back to Mac.

734
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,800
It's one of the many times I've done that.

735
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Right?

736
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Yeah.

737
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,560
So I'm like, hang on, let me disable my Pomodoro timer, which it turned out wasn't the culprit

738
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
and backslide.

739
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,040
Son of a bear.

740
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
It was backslide.

741
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,280
And then I got sass on Twitter like, well, you know, the extension isn't updated to the

742
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
new dome.

743
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,080
Like that is not my fault.

744
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:38,520
I know that the extension shaming that happens that whenever you have a bad experience with

745
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:43,600
either Firefox extensions or Gnome shell extensions, you get extension shamed and you get everything

746
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,480
from you use the wrong one.

747
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,080
You're holding it wrong.

748
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,960
You shouldn't use extensions at all or hey, don't, you know, you have to update that manually.

749
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,880
All these all these like, well, yeah, maybe gotcha kind of things when really you just

750
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,600
want a workstation that has some basic functionality and you're forced to use extensions to get

751
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,560
it there and then you're shamed for it.

752
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
It drives me crazy.

753
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,160
Well, and like, OK, another completely reasonable way you could handle this if you were sane

754
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,200
and cared about user experience.

755
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,720
When you update Gnome and you reboot into the new version, it could be like, hey, dog,

756
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,440
you're running this extension that's not compatible.

757
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,040
I disabled it for you.

758
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
Sorry, buddy.

759
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,260
Go figure that out on your own, which is still a bad experience.

760
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,440
But yeah, it's better than me spending forty five minutes in a frickin rage.

761
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,560
I think there used to be code checking in Gnome shell that would automatically disable

762
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,600
extensions, but then sort of aspirationally they thought, well, we're getting to the point

763
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,800
where we're not making as many breaking changes, so we're going to stop forcibly disabling

764
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
them.

765
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
That is bullshit.

766
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
It breaks every time.

767
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,360
Well, I had the experience.

768
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,720
This has been a while now and I've been very cautious.

769
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,040
I have a very minimal Gnome shell extensions approach now.

770
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,840
I still have probably four enabled, which is maybe five even.

771
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:08,040
I'm not sure I I have learned the hard way that the most innocent thing can really mess

772
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,400
up your Gnome shell experience.

773
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,040
I had something that I do every time I'm on a Mac, I install I stat menus and any time

774
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,820
since and I'm not joking here, probably the late 90s that I've set up a Linux desktop.

775
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:25,720
I've had something on my screen that displays my CPU, RAM and network usage.

776
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:33,680
I grew up in a time when I could I could physically sense via sound or sight how my computer was

777
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,680
performing.

778
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,000
There would be lights that would actually flash on the front of the case that represented

779
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,760
disk access and you could hear the disk clicking as it access and I could translate that to

780
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
the load.

781
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,240
And so when computers started to get silent and more and more like cores and faster CPUs

782
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,700
and faster disk and quieter disk, I very happily adopted things like GK realm and other tools

783
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,980
that would visualize my computer load.

784
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,980
So I had an analogy for that.

785
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:07,760
So when Gnome shell came along and it was something I extensively used in Gnome 2 and

786
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,600
I use I still continue to use in plasma, I added an extension to monitor my CPU, my memory

787
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
and my network.

788
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,760
Oh, you know, you should know you can't have that extension still available in the extensions

789
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
website.

790
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,280
It took me a while to realize it because it didn't happen right away.

791
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,880
I don't know exactly the order of events, but eventually Gnome shell would sort of pause

792
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
every now and then.

793
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Yeah.

794
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,120
Like if I would say hit the super key and start a search, it would pause and then go

795
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,760
back and then pause and then go and my mouse would pause with it.

796
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,360
And what was happening is every time the extension called to have the CPU graph and the memory

797
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:48,100
graph and the network graph call updated because the single threaded nature of Gnome shell,

798
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:55,280
the entire shell would pause while it addressed that update, while it drew that graph and

799
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,940
then it would resume.

800
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,100
And every now and then it would take literally a perceivable moment where I could see my

801
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:06,840
entire workstation completely freeze for, say, half a second, and it took me forever

802
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,560
to track it down to that.

803
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,440
It took me forever.

804
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,600
I thought for sure at first I had a hardware problem.

805
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,720
This must be some sort of CPU issue or something.

806
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,280
I was convinced it must be a hardware problem until I tried other desktops.

807
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,400
Oh, it's just so intriguing.

808
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
I know.

809
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,180
So right now, funny enough, I'm talking to you on a plasma system, the machine I'm live

810
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:32,880
streaming on, plasma, the machine I record on, XFCE, but I'll tell you what, still out

811
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,200
of all of them I think I prefer Gnome shell just the way my brain works.

812
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Yeah, I know.

813
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,600
And people were like, dude, you can just install KDE.

814
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
I get it.

815
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Right.

816
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
And it's good.

817
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
It's solid.

818
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Right.

819
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
But I lose all my pop stuff, don't I?

820
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Don't I lose like my...

821
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Yeah.

822
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Yeah.

823
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
So I like my tiling windows and stuff.

824
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
That's the thing.

825
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
So right now I'm running Fedora 33.

826
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,000
Ooh, how's that?

827
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,360
You know, there's more hoops, but like if you're comfortable pulling down the pop repo

828
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,240
for pop icons and pop theme, you can pull them down and then they have like this Ninja

829
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,560
build system that just builds and installs the pop theme on Fedora 33.

830
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,680
So I'm using pop icons and pop theme.

831
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
Oh, nice.

832
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,680
Yeah.

833
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,680
So that makes it feel a little more at home.

834
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,660
And I feel like I got to tweak the terminal more than I do in pop and it's a simpler Gnome

835
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,680
Shell experience and more upstream Gnome Shell, so you have to add the extensions.

836
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:33,440
But the clever thing that Fedora does is they put the extensions for Gnome Shell in the

837
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
repo.

838
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,600
So you can go into Gnome software and search for extensions and then when they're updated,

839
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,080
it will update them via your package updates.

840
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,880
Are you from the future?

841
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
Isn't that obvious?

842
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,640
That's such a great way to solve the problem and Fedora thought of it.

843
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,120
And so it's one of the things I love about Fedora.

844
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:55,960
The other thing, honestly, that I like is you can really easily add Flathub to Fedora

845
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,920
and then you have all of the software on Flathub is available in Gnome software, Slack, Telegram.

846
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,620
And I personally think Flatpaks for desktop software launch faster.

847
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:10,280
They start up faster and it also works with the pop theme.

848
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,240
Relative to Snaps or relative to...

849
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Yeah, yeah.

850
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,460
Like when I install a Snap version of Slack, I feel like I have to wait a little bit longer

851
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,040
for Slack to start in the morning and Telegram as well, whereas I feel like Flatpak, they

852
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
just fire right up.

853
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,160
Have you noticed, and I don't know if this is just Telegram, so pop complains if you

854
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,920
don't use the Flatpak version of things for reasons I don't understand.

855
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,480
So I deleted it and I installed the Flatpak version.

856
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,960
It didn't adopt the theming for like the window bar.

857
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,180
Yeah, that in theory would be a problem because I don't quite understand how Flatpak has access

858
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,680
to the pop theme technically unless there is a Flatpak layer for it.

859
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:53,920
But I also, like you may have noticed, which we could talk about here in a moment, is Edge.

860
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,400
Edge uses its own title bar, it doesn't use the native title bar.

861
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,200
So that's still a bit of a problem on Linux in general.

862
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Before we dive into Edge though, right, before we do that, I have had and I'm pretty sure

863
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,600
you have had conversations with people from Gnome and my understanding is like they can't

864
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
fix this.

865
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,140
Yeah, not without a massive retooling.

866
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,140
So right.

867
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,600
I'm curious to know what your thoughts are on this.

868
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:23,520
On September 16th, they announced the Gnome Extensions Rebooted initiative.

869
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,660
So at the sort of completion of Gnome 3.3.8, which you and I are just now getting but has

870
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:34,700
been done since September, they launched an initiative that is what they say a quote collaborative

871
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,240
effort to address the issues around Gnome shell extensions.

872
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,120
We want to start addressing them by making a number of policy changes and technological

873
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,160
improvements while building a sustainable community.

874
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
And here's the problem.

875
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,360
I don't see a lot here that's going to make a difference.

876
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,920
So this is the part I want to get your take on.

877
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,200
They say, number one, proper documentations of how extensions work and reasonable expectations

878
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,120
for an extension developer, build a CI pipeline for extension writers to test their extensions

879
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:05,200
prior to Gnome shell releases, centralize extensions for break testing on Gnome Git

880
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,780
lab space, and create a forum for extension developers and extension writers to work together

881
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,280
on Gnome releases.

882
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,000
I mean, that doesn't do anything.

883
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It's a good idea, right?

884
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,680
To help the extension community, but just using my specific case, it's completely unreasonable

885
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,920
for me to be annoyed with the backslide developer.

886
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,400
He's made this cool thing for free and great, but the problem is the fundamental design

887
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,480
of the Gnome system.

888
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,720
What I didn't see on this list was an API.

889
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,560
Or like, we will sandbox extensions so that if they crash or have an issue, which isn't

890
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,600
just a nuclear test environment.

891
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Right.

892
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Yeah.

893
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,160
Even if extensions just have their own thread, separate process, even if it just had to be

894
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,960
one process for all of the extensions, I could live with that.

895
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,400
But because it's all integrated in one and they cite security issues that you don't have

896
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,900
to fight if you don't break the Gnome shell up.

897
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,960
They cite memory efficiencies.

898
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,280
I mean, they have some reasons and stuff, and there have been significant improvements

899
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,280
on how it all operates over the last couple of years.

900
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,080
The extension problem you're running into now used to happen every single release for

901
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,680
all of the extensions.

902
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,760
So it has actually gotten better.

903
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,640
So maybe this sort of halfway measure, which I don't mean to talk it down because I'm like

904
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,600
just super grateful for anything they can do to solve the problem.

905
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,440
And I kind of appreciate the technical hard spot they're in, but this feels like a halfway

906
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,860
measure to me.

907
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:37,400
But even if it's this, I could see just making it possible for developers of extensions to

908
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:43,640
communicate more efficiently, to give them a spot to go to communicate and to create

909
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:50,160
some documentation that says, this is what we as a community will expect.

910
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,920
You update within this amount of time.

911
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,560
You participate in the release cycles.

912
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,680
Maybe to put some rails on this process that's right now is a Wild West.

913
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,280
I mean, you have to appreciate, because there really are kind of Kobayashi Marud here, right?

914
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:08,800
Because if they were to magically go back and fix the actual technical problem, they

915
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,320
will probably break all the existing extensions anyway because it'd be too different, right?

916
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,320
Yep.

917
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
They'd have to, right?

918
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,320
But let's...

919
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,880
I mean, I know everybody's going to hate this because it's a performance hit, but a thing

920
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,000
you could do, I think, and I don't know under the hood of GNOME, couldn't you, when the

921
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,280
extensions are loading, check them by version for compatibility with the version of GNOME

922
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,280
Shell you're on?

923
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,520
There was some system in place.

924
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,160
Because then you could just not load that extension and just throw up even an ugly error

925
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,040
alert to the user.

926
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,660
One thing that helps now, but it's not...

927
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,760
You have to know to go look for it, is with GNOME 3.3.8, or maybe that was the release

928
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
before...

929
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,000
I think it's actually the release prior, they launched an extensions app that is a GNOME

930
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,200
Shell dedicated app just to see what the...

931
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,040
To turn extensions on or off or to see if they have an error.

932
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,440
You have to know that it exists, and it's relatively new, so it's not like many people

933
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,800
do know, and you have to go there to get the information.

934
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,080
It doesn't give you, as far as I know, it doesn't give you a notification using the

935
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,800
built-in notification system saying, hey, extension XYZ is out of date.

936
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,040
Now, there is an extension to check for updates for extensions.

937
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,040
Hang on.

938
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,520
Let me consult Leonardo DiCaprio.

939
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,520
Hey, dog.

940
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,520
I heard you like extensions.

941
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,640
Yeah.

942
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,640
Extension inception.

943
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,640
I don't know.

944
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,440
So they called the extensions rebooted initiative.

945
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,280
They say their ultimate goal is to get the community to work with each other, have closer

946
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,040
ties with GNOME Shell developers and provide documentation and tools.

947
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,440
And my ultimate takeaway is, I think what we're seeing is a change in attitude towards

948
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,760
extensions from GNOME Shell developers, which before was, we don't really like extensions.

949
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,000
We'd like to build the necessary functionality in, and extensions are just kind of a temporary

950
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,240
measure until we've got it to the point that everybody's happy.

951
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,520
But that day has not arrived.

952
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:03,120
And I think as time has gone on, they've realized the role that extensions play in the GNOME

953
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:09,080
Shell ecosystem, not just from like users like you and I, right, but vendors like Canonical

954
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:14,080
or Red Hat or SUSE who want to ship a experience to customers.

955
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,680
They want these facilities available to them.

956
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,240
Canonical has a curated GNOME experience.

957
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,680
They have like an OEM vendor version that you can do.

958
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,240
It's totally all built into GNOME where you can apply your own set of extensions and that

959
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,620
becomes the base GNOME Shell.

960
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,300
And then Canonical updates those via the repo as well.

961
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,240
They just don't have all the other ones in there.

962
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,820
And so this is something that downstream quote unquote customers of GNOME Shell clearly want.

963
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,480
And I think the project has recognized users are still finding use cases for them.

964
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,120
The downstream quote unquote customers are finding uses for them.

965
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,200
And now as a project, they're coming to the reality that they've got to support these

966
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,200
in some way.

967
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,200
But the cat's out of the bag.

968
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,520
The technical challenge exists.

969
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,960
There's no going back now.

970
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,360
So this is their measure.

971
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,440
Wouldn't the ultimate answer, and we should probably get off this because I'm sure GNOME

972
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,760
folks feel like we're beating up on them.

973
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,560
The ultimate answer is like basic functionality such as switching your background should not

974
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,960
need an extension, right?

975
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,960
I know that's like saying do your homework and eat your vegetables.

976
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,200
I feel like what we have right now is a kind of interesting trifecta of you have a lot

977
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:26,040
of the just hardcore grueling GNOME Shell development happening upstream with the Fedora

978
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,040
and Red Hat developers.

979
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,080
A lot of them are GNOME Shell developers as well.

980
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,360
And there's a lot of crossover there.

981
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:37,880
Then you have Canonical who is creating a very curated GNOME Shell experience and adding

982
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,960
value to like the settings panels and stuff like that, that upstream notices and thinks

983
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,320
maybe we should have that.

984
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,120
And then on top of that, you have System76 laying down their improvements to Pop OS,

985
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,600
which is building on top of all of these layers.

986
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,680
And they're adding really interesting things.

987
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,440
And all of this is going into GNOME Shell in one form or another.

988
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,200
And all of its open source code that is available if GNOME Shell wants to integrate some of

989
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,520
this directly or at least get inspired by the idea.

990
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,920
So it will take a while to work its way out.

991
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:14,120
But if you look at it in that viewpoint, it seems like the desktop is really that that

992
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:19,680
GNOME Shell desktop is really well positioned for some serious innovation down the road

993
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:25,240
because you've got Fedora and Canonical and System76 and others out there.

994
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,720
I don't mean to like there's people at Endless, there's people at SUSE, I don't mean to count

995
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,720
anybody out.

996
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:35,080
But you have all of these high profile deployments that are adding different ideas to the experience.

997
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,480
It's going to result in, I think, rapid development.

998
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,480
So more is to come.

999
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,960
I hope so.

1000
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,120
Now, I wasn't sure if we were going to talk about this in the show.

1001
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,680
But you and I have both been running Microsoft Edge since they released it for Linux last

1002
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,680
week.

1003
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,600
I've run it on a Fedora machine, I've run it on an Ubuntu machine, and I've got some

1004
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,880
thoughts.

1005
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,240
But I'm curious to know what your takeaway experiences are with Edge, where you think

1006
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,240
it's at.

1007
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,840
I think one of the areas that they launched right out of the gate with is pretty decent

1008
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,840
developer tools.

1009
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,560
I'm sure you had a chance to look at those.

1010
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,560
Curious what you think.

1011
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,560
Yeah.

1012
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:16,280
So I really spent a lot of time with the VS Code Edge developer tie-in tools.

1013
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,800
And damn, that's compelling.

1014
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,800
So okay, wait, wait, wait.

1015
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,800
VS Code tie-in.

1016
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, what?

1017
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,640
Basically VS Code, if you have Edge installed, it can actually do a few things.

1018
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:35,440
But the one I think is particularly sexy is it can take like your HTML or whatever, your

1019
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,440
web assets, right?

1020
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,440
That's what's going on here.

1021
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,440
Yeah.

1022
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,280
And render it in VS Code, and you can do like inspections on it and a bunch of debugging

1023
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,280
stuff.

1024
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,960
I've only scratched the surface because I literally downloaded it this weekend.

1025
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,640
Oh, I'm looking at it right now.

1026
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,200
This is amazing.

1027
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,280
Yeah, it's very, especially like niggling front end issues.

1028
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,640
This is something I would use like all the time.

1029
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,920
It's like the Chrome developer tool where you can click through the elements of the

1030
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,080
site, and it highlights it in the code explorer.

1031
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,800
But instead, now it's happening in VS Code.

1032
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,120
It's your actual code, right?

1033
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,560
It's not that you have to then go back and like, you know, control F and find it whenever

1034
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,720
the div is called.

1035
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,880
And they do a live render so you can go through the site.

1036
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,720
This is brilliant.

1037
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,320
With this launching like this right now, I mean, this kind of just is the tell on what

1038
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,880
Microsoft strategy is here.

1039
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,880
It's developers.

1040
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,320
So go into that.

1041
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,320
What is this?

1042
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,960
Because this is obviously a ton of work, what they did here.

1043
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,680
Yeah, I mean, I look at this and I think there's clear, ones we've talked about before is there's

1044
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,960
enterprise use cases.

1045
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,680
And I heard a lot of that from the audience.

1046
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,880
But when I see this, what I see is Microsoft creating tools for developers who prefer to

1047
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,460
run Linux.

1048
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,360
They're creating a tool for them so that way they can test what they're building in Edge.

1049
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,920
And why not make it a great experience to debug and explore like, and they're leveraging

1050
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,680
VS Code in a way that's extremely clever.

1051
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,200
Well, it's so super weird right now because like I primarily work in Ruby, Python and

1052
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,680
you know, HTML, CSS because everybody has to, right?

1053
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:12,200
Like with, we talked about it a month or two ago, PyLance, their new like super duper Python

1054
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,040
tooling for VS Code is awesome.

1055
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:22,720
Like I am a over a decades long JetBrains user and I'm like, VS Code is certainly on

1056
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,920
par with PyCharm.

1057
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,840
And I think is actually becoming slightly better than a Ruby mine, which those are respectively

1058
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,600
the Python and Ruby IDs from JetBrains.

1059
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,900
It also doesn't make my laptop sound like a 747 when I boot it.

1060
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,900
So there's that.

1061
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,900
There's that.

1062
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,200
There is, that is a nice aspect of it.

1063
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,760
I didn't even mention it, but like the other thing they're doing is they're introducing

1064
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,840
something that should have existed as a standard a while ago.

1065
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:51,560
Their take on a storage access API, but they're doing it by like actually going through the

1066
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,880
W3C standards committee and all that kind of stuff.

1067
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,880
Isn't that refreshing?

1068
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,520
Yeah, but it's an awesome, like I looked at the API documentation, it is exactly what

1069
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,520
you need.

1070
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,440
There's a guide that allows the developer to determine whether they have access to browser

1071
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,440
based storage.

1072
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,000
And if it's restricted by the user's privacy settings to request storage access from the

1073
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,280
user, like kind of a pop up we're familiar with.

1074
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,960
And they say this capability can be used to create a graceful fallback experience in cases

1075
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,940
when storage access may be restricted by features such as tracking prevention.

1076
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:24,140
And they're creating an API there, which is great.

1077
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:29,720
And this is super important as more and more web based clients just make more sense than

1078
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,240
you know, whatever.

1079
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,400
And as more and more users, particularly sophisticated users, are running blockers and are unknowingly

1080
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:42,400
like getting crappy experiences on your PWA or whatever, because the blocker just automatically

1081
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,240
like denies you a bunch of permissions that you need.

1082
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:52,760
What if what we're about to witness is Microsoft create a kick ass browser that surpasses Chrome?

1083
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,440
Because when you think about Chrome, it's an operating system now.

1084
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,920
It's got remote desktop capabilities.

1085
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:04,360
It's got all of this incredible amount of technology that it's built on over the years.

1086
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:09,200
And my first impression when I launched Edge for the first time, after I went through their

1087
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,320
little wizard that said, we are protecting your privacy, which I'm kind of like, hmm.

1088
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,600
And then they asked for me to participate in metrics collection, which I actually decided

1089
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,600
to do.

1090
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:24,600
But once you get past that, first experience is, oh, this reminds me of Chrome when it

1091
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:29,360
was new and fast and lean with a couple of surprise features in there.

1092
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,040
Like, I think the way they lay out the settings is way better.

1093
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,600
I think collections is a really unique idea, especially for a guy like me who likes to

1094
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,960
document an article before it changes and suck the whole contents of a website offline.

1095
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,960
I miss that.

1096
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,560
I used to, funny enough, that was one of the things I used to play around with Internet

1097
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,160
Explorer way back in the day.

1098
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,840
But now they've brought it to Edge in collections.

1099
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:53,120
But then also, one of the things that I think is telling is this nod towards developers,

1100
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,560
this clear, like, this is an area they put emphasis in because they haven't even brought

1101
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,320
user sync over yet.

1102
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,740
I think that's very telling.

1103
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:03,600
And I could see this going in a direction where Edge becomes a serious contender and

1104
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,600
surpasses Firefox.

1105
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,640
Yeah, it's going to be tough to be Firefox with Chrome in kind of the cat bird seat and

1106
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:15,600
Microsoft's making a really aggressive play for second, effectively.

1107
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,600
So why, though?

1108
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,600
Right?

1109
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,600
Like, this is the thing I don't understand.

1110
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,600
I'm running Linux and Mac every day, all day, right, half and half, actually more and more

1111
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,320
favoring Linux.

1112
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,720
But the best tools I have are almost exclusively from Microsoft now.

1113
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,800
I mean, that's why they're doing this.

1114
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,080
You could run Edge on all three, Windows, Mac and Linux, all three major desktops.

1115
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,880
That's something right there.

1116
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:42,040
And it's a lot like, like I speculated on Linux Action is I think what they're doing

1117
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,960
here is they're saying to the enterprise and they're saying to the world, here's the grown

1118
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,240
up version of open source.

1119
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,240
Here's the, you know, the business class version of open source software.

1120
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,240
Now that's a spicy take.

1121
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,240
Yeah.

1122
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,000
I mean, you think about where they were when we started this show and now where they're

1123
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,960
at now, where they're making money off open source now, right?

1124
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,760
That's the position we're in now.

1125
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,760
Microsoft has figured out a way to make money by releasing things like VS code as open source,

1126
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,480
by leveraging things like Blink.

1127
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,520
I mean, one of their core products is based around an open source project now.

1128
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:21,000
And they're going to use that to drive developer adoption of their platforms in a very clever

1129
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
way.

1130
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,320
And I'm not a hundred percent sure if I'm okay with it.

1131
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,160
I'm just talking about from like an analyst strategic standpoint here.

1132
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,840
I'm not talking about it from, you know, save the web standpoint, but I could see them coming

1133
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:35,680
to the market with Edge, you know, in a really competitive way.

1134
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,180
Now, now that I've seen what it's capable of, it feels fast.

1135
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:42,760
The font rendering is I think some of the best on desktop Linux or if you've noticed,

1136
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,940
but I think the fonts look terrific.

1137
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,880
So I set it as my default browser.

1138
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,880
Did you?

1139
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,880
Yeah.

1140
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,880
I, you know, it's funny.

1141
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,260
Anytime I say like this kind of stuff about Microsoft, I get so much crap.

1142
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:58,880
People actually written like articles on open source news websites attacking me for talking

1143
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,160
positive about Microsoft.

1144
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,160
Just ridiculous.

1145
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,280
I'm just saying, I'm looking at the strategy here and I see it and I think it makes a lot

1146
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,280
of sense.

1147
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,960
And while Google kind of has this, we want the world to use Chrome.

1148
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,920
I think Microsoft very cleverly is targeting this at a set of users and they're going after

1149
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,280
it.

1150
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:23,520
And you got to wonder if maybe, especially as this DOJ case against Google moves forward,

1151
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,920
if maybe public opinion isn't going to start shifting a bit about Google, kind of like

1152
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,840
it did during the Microsoft trials.

1153
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:35,720
And if it does, Microsoft is right here with Edge saying, hey, we got the business, we

1154
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,280
got the business approved version of Chrome if you'd like to use it.

1155
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,280
That's true.

1156
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,280
That's true.

1157
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,240
And just, but just imagine when we started the show or world where we are like not trolling

1158
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:50,280
and seriously talking about Microsoft being an active participant in a standards community

1159
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,280
and not in like a creepy, like we're going to embrace extend extinguish thing, but like

1160
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,120
actively they seem like a good actor, right?

1161
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,120
They seem like a positive.

1162
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,600
I'll go a step further than that.

1163
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,920
They may be saving us from total Chrome domination.

1164
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:07,860
And I realize it's blink under the hood, but at least they are another player with leverage.

1165
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:14,640
It's another gorilla in that arena that can assert its opinion and advocate for standards.

1166
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,680
We were so, I mean, Firefox is done, man.

1167
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,300
It is, Mozilla is cooked.

1168
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,080
You're lighting up that hot take, huh?

1169
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:26,560
It's documented on Linux action news after just a year of, and it has gotten so bad that

1170
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:31,100
we've just sort of, we've sort of not decided to cover every Mozilla story because every

1171
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,700
week there's some new story about their decline.

1172
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:39,840
Firefox is ruined and it's such a shame because it's such at a good point, like they got that

1173
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:45,000
meteor shooting again back up into the sky, but the support team on the ground just isn't

1174
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
there.

1175
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,100
And Chrome is just dominating the market now, just absolutely dominating the market.

1176
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:55,560
So Microsoft may save us from a total Google web monopoly.

1177
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,880
Honestly, like what, and I've mentioned this before, one of my fears is that Chrome was

1178
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,000
becoming IE6, right?

1179
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,240
I guess I'm not as doom and gloom on Firefox as you, cause I sort of think there's a lot

1180
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,960
of smart people there that can.

1181
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,960
There were.

1182
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,640
Well, they, yeah, a lot of, they did have an Exodus.

1183
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,640
Yeah.

1184
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:14,800
So basically I can't have extensions and I can't have Firefox, is that where we're going?

1185
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,800
Right.

1186
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,480
Although Chrome extensions work great in Edge, so.

1187
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,520
By the way, what a move.

1188
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,800
Oh, you know that whole ecosystem of extensions?

1189
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,800
We got you.

1190
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,800
Yeah.

1191
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,800
Yeah.

1192
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,100
Well, you got to figure a lot of the heavy lifting to getting Edge on Linux and Mac

1193
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:32,200
OS is being done by the Chromium team, right?

1194
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,200
Yeah.

1195
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,720
I would think so.

1196
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,560
So Microsoft is leveraging the hard work of their competitor here and it's open source,

1197
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,280
although Edge itself is not open source.

1198
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:45,200
And I think that would actually be a decent move on their part, but maybe not.

1199
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,200
We'll see.

1200
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,980
I don't know.

1201
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:52,480
Sometimes I feel like they're going to wait like open source things after the fact.

1202
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,480
Maybe, or if they were going to do it, they probably would have done it.

1203
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,680
Well, I want to say thank you to our Coder QA team.

1204
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,020
You go get your quarterly report.

1205
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,780
It is out and you get one every quarter.

1206
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,780
You support the show.

1207
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:09,200
You also get a limited ad feed and we appreciate every single one of you to help not only cover

1208
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,720
the production of the show, but help us be picky and choosy about the sponsors we bring

1209
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,720
onto the show.

1210
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,460
That's a big part of it as well and keeping the show sustainable.

1211
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,920
So you can become a member at coderqa.co and you get a limited ad feed, you support the

1212
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,280
show and you get that Coder quarterly report.

1213
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,280
It's at coderqa.co.

1214
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:35,520
Now, before we get out of here, I wanted to mention that ISH has made it onto the App

1215
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,400
Store and it's actually completely free.

1216
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,900
I've been using it for over, I think I talked about it on the show, maybe even almost two

1217
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,160
years ago.

1218
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:51,200
It is a project to get a full Linux shell running on iOS using user mode x86 emulation

1219
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,880
and syscall translations.

1220
00:58:52,880 --> 00:59:00,160
So ISH is an app for iOS, it works great on the iPad or the phone, that emulates a 32-bit

1221
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,080
Alpine x86 Linux environment.

1222
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,680
You can install software from Alpine APKs.

1223
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:11,840
ISH also acts as a file provider so you can go to the files app in iOS and you can edit

1224
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:18,360
the sidebar and you can turn on ISH to mount, quote unquote, your ISH file system and you

1225
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:24,160
can drag stuff into it from iOS and get access to those files in ISH and you get a full Alpine

1226
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,880
x86 environment.

1227
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,920
It's brilliant on the iPad Pro, especially if you got the keyboard, you get a full screen,

1228
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,800
legitimate x86 Linux environment.

1229
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,800
I thought there was no way in hell Apple would let this on the App Store.

1230
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,960
So go get it now because they probably won't.

1231
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,860
Now that you told them it's on there, it won't be there for very long, when does the show

1232
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,860
come out?

1233
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,860
Wednesday?

1234
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:45,860
You better download it Tuesday.

1235
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,860
Yeah, you better get it soon.

1236
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:50,200
But I don't know if you had a chance to try this, but it still blows my mind when I bring

1237
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,240
up a full Linux environment on my iPad.

1238
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,240
Yeah, no.

1239
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:58,520
So assuming Apple doesn't rip this down, this will be on my iPad when we resume traveling

1240
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,520
if ever.

1241
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,520
Yep.

1242
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,520
Yeah.

1243
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,440
This, and I think it's, I don't remember the name exactly, but I think it's Termulus,

1244
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:09,480
which is a terminal app and it can sync your SSH favorites between devices.

1245
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,600
Man, do I use the crap out of that.

1246
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,360
Like if I got to just do a quick SSH into a server to reboot or something like that,

1247
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,280
I have it on both my devices and it's just lovely.

1248
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,940
So a little bonus pick there for you.

1249
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:24,240
But ISH is a full Alpine Linux environment and somehow, for some reason, it's on the

1250
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,240
app store.

1251
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:29,320
The guy, the developer that makes it, he had it up for like 70 bucks for the first day

1252
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,640
and they even let that on.

1253
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,680
They let it on at $70 and now it's free.

1254
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,440
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1255
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,160
Apple would never begrudge anybody for charging a premium.

1256
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,160
I mean, that's like...

1257
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,000
True, that's very true.

1258
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,600
That's probably why they let it on actually, like us, someone who finally understands.

1259
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,600
Right.

1260
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,600
The value.

1261
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,080
Well, there you have it.

1262
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:53,440
We'll have a link to ISH in the show notes, which will be at coder.show slash three eight

1263
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,440
five.

1264
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,800
Mr. Dominic, is there anything you'd like to plug this week or send the people somewhere?

1265
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,800
Something.

1266
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,800
Follow me on Twitter at Dumanuco.

1267
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,040
I will have some SUSE content out this week.

1268
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,040
I'm not trolling.

1269
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,040
Well, I am trolling Chris, but I really will.

1270
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,040
So.

1271
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,040
All right.

1272
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,040
Well, we'll be keeping an eye on that.

1273
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,640
I think the show is at Coder Radio Show, at Coder Show.

1274
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,840
You'll know if somebody yells at you, you got the wrong one.

1275
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,040
Yeah, I kind of just put a bookmark out there.

1276
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,840
I'm at Chris LAS.

1277
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,120
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1278
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,280
And hey, we'd love to have you join us live.

1279
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,280
We do this show on Mondays at noon Pacific, three p.m. Eastern over at jblive.tv.

1280
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,280
You can hang out in the chat room.

1281
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:30,840
There's a bit of a pre show, bit of a post show, all of that over at jblive.tv and makes

1282
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,840
the show a little bit better.

1283
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,840
And you help us title it too.

1284
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,480
We'd love to see you on a Monday.

1285
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,400
If not, show's out on Wednesdays.

1286
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,160
You can get it at Coder.show slash subscribe.

1287
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,160
Thanks for joining us.

1288
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:48,920
We'll see you back here next Monday.
