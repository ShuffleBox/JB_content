00:00.000 --> 00:15.680
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 457 for March 14th, 2022.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.380
Hello there and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.380 --> 00:25.520
at the earn and the business, the software development, and the world of technology.

00:25.520 --> 00:31.840
My name is Chris and joining me with his launch keyboard ready to go, it's my host, Mr. Dominic.

00:31.840 --> 00:32.840
Do you hear that?

00:32.840 --> 00:33.840
You hear that, don't you?

00:33.840 --> 00:34.840
Oh yeah.

00:34.840 --> 00:35.840
I did.

00:35.840 --> 00:36.840
I heard it when I was setting up to record.

00:36.840 --> 00:37.840
I hit the record button.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.240
I forgot to run a limbic upgrade head.

00:40.240 --> 00:44.200
I kind of feel like our keyboards have become the third host, you know?

00:44.200 --> 00:45.200
Yes.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.200
Are we using the same keyboard?

00:46.200 --> 00:47.200
Oh yeah, of course.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.200
Well, which key...

00:48.200 --> 00:51.160
I actually forgot which keycaps I have, which switches...

00:51.160 --> 00:52.160
I have...

00:52.160 --> 00:53.160
I got the...

00:53.160 --> 00:54.160
I got the louder ones, I think.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.600
I got the quieter ones, but they're just so damn loud, you know?

00:56.600 --> 00:57.600
I think.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.440
I can't remember anymore because of the old man.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.440
I think I got the quiet one too, but they're still like, damn.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.440
Yeah.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.440
Yeah.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.440
Hey, we're recording on Pi Day.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.440
Happy Pi Day to you.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.720
Happy Pi Day to you for all the mathematicians.

01:09.720 --> 01:13.600
I got myself a LaCroix to party, getting wild in the studio.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.600
We're both hipsters.

01:14.600 --> 01:18.440
I have a Spindrift, which is like fancy LaCroix.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.480
It's LaCroix if they use real juice.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.480
Oh, really?

01:21.480 --> 01:22.480
Yes.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.480
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:23.480 --> 01:24.480
It's LaCroix juice.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.600
It's funny because the name sounds like Spindrift, which makes me think of cheap.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.400
They are not cheap, but they were buy one get one free.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.020
I want to let everybody know the national emergency is over.

01:34.020 --> 01:35.360
We can stand down.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.720
We did get access to my son's Roblox account.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.720
Everybody stand down.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.720
We're good.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.720
We're good.

01:40.720 --> 01:45.960
I mean, it did take a week of emails back and forth by both me and his mother, but we

01:45.960 --> 01:46.960
got it back.

01:46.960 --> 01:51.120
And it's so obvious after this experiment that these quote unquote metaverse companies

01:51.120 --> 01:57.180
are so unprepared for the scale of scams that come to your game when you have an ecosystem

01:57.180 --> 01:59.160
that people assign real world value to.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.820
Oh, boy, it's bad.

02:01.820 --> 02:06.520
Like the guy still on the game that scammed him, the guy that scammed my kid's account

02:06.520 --> 02:09.820
still on the game, still scamming other people.

02:09.820 --> 02:11.200
You can report him.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.200
Nothing changes.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.200
It's a mess out there.

02:13.200 --> 02:19.880
It's the hard, hard streets of the metaverse, but I don't care because you know what?

02:19.880 --> 02:20.880
Happy anniversary, darling.

02:20.880 --> 02:25.000
Tomorrow, tomorrow is our domain name anniversary.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.600
Oh, yeah.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.160
Our domain auto renews.

02:28.160 --> 02:34.920
It's March 15th, 2018 is when we actually registered coder dot show.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.440
Oh, 2018.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.440
Yep.

02:37.440 --> 02:44.080
Now, our first episode of Coder was released in June the 11th of 2012, which works out

02:44.080 --> 02:46.840
to be nine years, nine months and three days ago.

02:46.840 --> 02:49.200
For some reason, we didn't do anything with the domain, right?

02:49.200 --> 02:51.840
It was all at Jupiter broadcasting dot com forever.

02:51.840 --> 02:52.840
It was all at JB.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.840
That's right.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.840
Yeah.

02:54.840 --> 02:55.840
Which is where a lot of people still get it.

02:55.840 --> 03:01.320
But then as the podcast landscape changed over the years, well, he needed its brand to

03:01.320 --> 03:02.320
see the brand.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.320
We got to adapt.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.320
You got to pivot.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.760
So I actually do have a proposal.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.080
Okay.

03:09.080 --> 03:12.760
Coder Radio Studio because pro is too cheap.

03:12.760 --> 03:16.600
You know, what about Coder Radio Ultra?

03:16.600 --> 03:20.160
Looks like we take two shows and fuse them together like Voltron.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.160
Yes.

03:21.160 --> 03:25.280
We've actually had this secret podcast connector all along where you could fuse.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.280
Yeah.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.280
Yeah.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.280
You didn't know.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.280
They didn't know.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.280
It's been, what, 10 years?

03:30.280 --> 03:31.280
You didn't know a damn thing.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.280
You can see it on Twitter.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.680
I swear to God, Mike and I were having a Twitter conversation during the Apple event.

03:35.680 --> 03:39.480
And I said to Mike, I'm like, well, at least they didn't announce that Mac Studio so far

03:39.480 --> 03:44.200
because that would be really hard to resist because I'm literally at the place where I

03:44.200 --> 03:46.480
need to replace all of the computers in the studio.

03:46.480 --> 03:47.600
They're all falling apart.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.920
And five minutes later, bam.

03:49.920 --> 03:50.920
Was it even five minutes?

03:50.920 --> 03:52.240
It might've been three minutes.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.240
Yeah.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.240
Boom.

03:54.240 --> 03:59.080
Mac Studio with the big old processor and multi-screen support.

03:59.080 --> 04:03.200
And we've actually gone to the trouble of putting a legitimate cooling system in this

04:03.200 --> 04:04.200
thing.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.640
Damn it.

04:05.640 --> 04:10.840
I know for a fact, I know for an absolute fact that Mac Studio could do the job of all

04:10.840 --> 04:17.320
three systems because I can do that on the M1 Mac mini right now.

04:17.320 --> 04:22.040
I have done an experiment where I replicated the functionality of three different studio

04:22.040 --> 04:29.880
systems in one box and I still had a little bit to spare, but it was just enough of a

04:29.880 --> 04:33.400
tight squeeze that I thought, it's not quite there yet.

04:33.400 --> 04:39.480
But with this machine, I could honestly take the three PCs that I have that are breaking

04:39.480 --> 04:43.560
down and put one Mac Studio on the table that would be silent and do the work of all of

04:43.560 --> 04:44.560
them.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.560
And that is tremendous.

04:45.560 --> 04:46.560
I'm not doing it.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.320
I'm not buying one.

04:49.320 --> 04:54.800
But if I were a shop that was a Mac-based production house, I'd probably be ordering

04:54.800 --> 04:56.840
at least a couple of these right now.

04:56.840 --> 05:02.680
I continue this journey of falling out of love with my iMac Pro.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.360
Well, it's dead now, man.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.360
Oh, it's dead, Jim.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.360
Yeah, that's it.

05:06.360 --> 05:12.800
Yeah, you've got to get yourself a $1,500, $1,700 monitor and this $4,000 Mac Studio

05:12.800 --> 05:13.800
now.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.280
How did they make it cost more money, son of a bitch?

05:16.280 --> 05:17.280
Oh, no.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.280
They're very good.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.280
Oh, baby.

05:19.280 --> 05:25.040
I'm going to try not to turn this into Apple Radio, but this is exactly the machine I've

05:25.040 --> 05:31.280
been wanting for literally, I used to lust after when I was too young and just didn't

05:31.280 --> 05:32.400
have the money.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.520
The last one, the one that John Siracusa just replaced, what is that, the G5?

05:36.520 --> 05:38.320
Yeah, the Power Mac or whatever.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.320
Yeah, whatever it was.

05:39.320 --> 05:43.840
You know, what I feel like is this is the machine that I thought they should make since

05:43.840 --> 05:46.520
they announced the Mac Mini forever ago.

05:46.520 --> 05:50.520
The original Mac Mini, it was like, wouldn't it be great to just take the Mac Mini one

05:50.520 --> 05:53.800
step further, make it a little more powerful?

05:53.800 --> 05:54.800
And they've done that now.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.640
It is a great machine.

05:56.640 --> 06:02.160
I still would love to see a Mac with PCI slots myself and removable storage and upgradable

06:02.160 --> 06:03.160
RAM.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.160
That would be...

06:04.160 --> 06:06.560
I don't know if we're ever going to get that in this new Apple Silicon era, but that to

06:06.560 --> 06:08.240
me would be the perfect studio machine.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.240
Yeah, you are.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.360
You're going to get the Mac Pro.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.600
It's going to cost like eight grand, but you're going to get it.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.600
Probably.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.600
Right?

06:15.600 --> 06:16.600
I don't know.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.600
This is...

06:17.600 --> 06:19.680
I mean, we're being a little funny about the pricing.

06:19.680 --> 06:27.840
It's honestly like if you are a shop or just, you know, looking at someone who actually

06:27.840 --> 06:34.080
makes money on this, $4,000 like this, plus a MacBook Air, if you're a Mac guy, you have

06:34.080 --> 06:35.680
covered all your bases.

06:35.680 --> 06:39.920
And you got a five, six year machine probably too, because they're going to be, these machines

06:39.920 --> 06:42.400
are going to be on the long tail of the support cycle.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.200
Yeah, it is nice.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.240
I actually like having multiple machines because it offers some redundancy.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.800
You know, if the OBS machine were to lock up and crash right now, it wouldn't impact

06:51.800 --> 06:54.320
our recording or vice versa.

06:54.320 --> 06:58.280
So it's nice to have some, I think, machine isolation of tasks there.

06:58.280 --> 07:02.200
And that's where the Mac situation starts getting prohibitively expensive.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.960
But I think Apple has completely reversed the situation that I originally complained

07:05.960 --> 07:07.740
about in the show so many years ago.

07:07.740 --> 07:10.840
They have completely turned it around from the butterfly keyboard days.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.120
It's a great time for Mac users right now.

07:13.120 --> 07:17.000
I think the rest of the people outside the Mac ecosystem are watching this thinking,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.840
oh, I know this is going to have ramifications for the rest of us, but I just don't know

07:20.840 --> 07:22.800
how that's going to materialize yet.

07:22.800 --> 07:29.720
And if they're at Intel, they are still recovering from the hangover from the night of solo drinking.

07:29.720 --> 07:33.600
I don't know if you've noticed, Intel's pivoted to making Bitcoin on their wires.

07:33.600 --> 07:34.600
They're like, we're out.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.840
Intel's like, all right, we can't.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.400
So can I fry some Applewood smoked bacon?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.600
Oh, I love it when you, oh man.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.600
You know what?

07:43.600 --> 07:46.360
I was just telling Wes, I said, Wes, he's not bringing bacon these days and I'm hungry.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.360
Yeah, bring it.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.360
Bring the bacon.

07:48.360 --> 07:52.680
Is this just like the lag time between Johnny Ive leaving?

07:52.680 --> 07:53.680
Think about it.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.280
They're not like coming out with weird products that nobody expects, I'm sure the M1 Ultra

07:57.280 --> 07:59.560
Magic Fusion thing.

07:59.560 --> 08:04.680
It's like they took a room of their actual like pro literally studio customers, which

08:04.680 --> 08:08.560
I'll get into a little bit because I'm pretty sure studio is like the new, no, you're an

08:08.560 --> 08:10.080
actual professional, right?

08:10.080 --> 08:11.520
Not just like the more expensive model.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.760
Right, because pro has pretty much lost all meaning.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.800
It's been diluted, right?

08:15.800 --> 08:19.000
And they said, what do you need to do your job?

08:19.000 --> 08:23.660
And they just decided to build it, which I know I sound like an idiot, but I don't know.

08:23.660 --> 08:24.660
This is great.

08:24.660 --> 08:25.660
They fixed the keyboards.

08:25.660 --> 08:27.380
They're bringing out hardware that makes sense.

08:27.380 --> 08:31.200
The price is high, but it's not like so crazy.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.520
I'll tell you what happened.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.520
It's clear as day Tim Cook listens to Koda radio.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.700
It's obvious.

08:36.700 --> 08:40.820
He heard our rants years ago that the problem with Apple is that it's machines were being

08:40.820 --> 08:45.460
built and designed by people who don't know how to use computers and that the Apple executive

08:45.460 --> 08:50.040
team was getting old and out of touch and they were directing products that they didn't

08:50.040 --> 08:52.680
actually understand how the market was going to use them.

08:52.680 --> 08:57.480
And then they created their pro group internally, which is producing a lot of their virtual

08:57.480 --> 09:03.080
event videos and commercials and doing all that kind of stuff and also interfacing with

09:03.080 --> 09:04.680
industry professionals.

09:04.680 --> 09:08.440
And now they've taken what that pro group recommends as sort of a source of truth.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.640
You know, like a lot of companies would hire a new department and have them work on this

09:11.640 --> 09:13.760
and then not listen to a damn thing they say.

09:13.760 --> 09:17.440
But to Apple's credit, the old out of touch management said we are we're old and out of

09:17.440 --> 09:20.920
touch and they defer to this new group now, I believe.

09:20.920 --> 09:24.720
And they're building exactly the machines that people that are using these to get work

09:24.720 --> 09:26.200
done want to see.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.200
It's no doubt about it.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.960
And holy how impressive is it that they're now sticking that M1 and everything from the

09:31.960 --> 09:36.160
frickin iPad frickin air all the way up to the Mac Studio flight?

09:36.160 --> 09:41.120
Whoa, man, let's see an x86 chip do that or the fact that your monitor has like an iPhone

09:41.120 --> 09:44.600
12 processor or 11 processor in it.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.600
It's crazy.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.600
That that part is crazy.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.920
I just can't even with that.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.920
They probably just have them.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.600
You know, the monitor has a lot of nice things going for it.

09:51.600 --> 09:56.060
The multiple mic array, the like 13 megapixel camera or whatever it is, you know, nicer

09:56.060 --> 10:00.160
camera with center stage, the six speaker array, which I bet knowing Apple's track record

10:00.160 --> 10:03.480
with speakers is actually legitimately pretty good.

10:03.480 --> 10:07.460
But the fact that it ships with a non height adjustable screen and it by default is very

10:07.460 --> 10:08.460
low down.

10:08.460 --> 10:11.880
What is their deal with like screwing you on stands all the time?

10:11.880 --> 10:12.880
I know.

10:12.880 --> 10:17.960
And it's not HDR when Apple sells all of these devices that have HDR screens.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.760
This one is an HDR, which is ridiculous.

10:19.760 --> 10:22.120
And it's also it's not a high refresh rate either.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.960
I heard a lot of people talking about the high refresh rate thing.

10:24.960 --> 10:29.840
And as per our other Twitter conversation earlier today, you don't need it on a Mac.

10:29.840 --> 10:33.820
I don't think because Apple has a religious aversion to triple A games.

10:33.820 --> 10:38.200
So it makes the UI smoother, scrolling smoother, animation smoother.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.000
It makes the system feel just slightly snappier.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.880
That's what I've appreciated about it.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.400
And it's not even really that, though.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.500
It's that if you're going to charge me more than a thousand dollars for a twenty seven

10:48.500 --> 10:53.640
inch monitor, then it should at least have a feature set of twenty twenty or twenty twenty

10:53.640 --> 10:54.640
one.

10:54.640 --> 10:55.640
Right.

10:55.640 --> 10:56.640
And it doesn't.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.400
It has a feature set of twenty nineteen monitors right now.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.200
So they probably started building this thing in twenty nineteen.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.200
Yeah.

11:01.200 --> 11:05.800
Which you know what, though, isn't that all of Apple's stuff and except for the processors

11:05.800 --> 11:09.080
where it's like it's a very conservative.

11:09.080 --> 11:15.240
They took a long time and they really, really don't like Intel for some reason.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.240
Like, I don't.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.720
I would imagine, too, that when you see the iMac get upgraded to a higher refresh rate,

11:19.720 --> 11:23.400
like they have the laptops now, then you'll see this next iteration of this monitor get

11:23.400 --> 11:24.400
the update as well.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.960
I'd also wager that they probably will still sell a lot more MacBook Pros, even the expensive

11:27.960 --> 11:29.480
ones than they will Max Studios.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.480
Oh, for sure.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.480
Absolutely.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.960
There will probably be more people that have that monitor, that new monitor connected to

11:34.960 --> 11:35.960
Linux.

11:35.960 --> 11:36.960
Yeah.

11:36.960 --> 11:37.960
Yeah.

11:37.960 --> 11:38.960
And it kind of makes sense because it can be a hub.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.720
It's got it's got USB-C and Thunderbolt ports.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.800
It can provide ninety six watts of power.

11:42.800 --> 11:43.800
It's got speakers.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.000
It's got a webcam.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.920
It kind of works as a bit of a low key Thunderbolt hub.

11:47.920 --> 11:48.920
Yeah.

11:48.920 --> 11:49.920
All right.

11:49.920 --> 11:53.940
Well, let's talk a little about Linux because Ethan wrote in to kill just absolutely eviscerate

11:53.940 --> 12:01.360
my Proton runtime dream to make a general compatibility layer to just lift and drop

12:01.360 --> 12:07.760
Windows applications on Linux for two reasons, primarily to help stop the slow bleed to electron

12:07.760 --> 12:13.100
and to help create a competitive moat against Mac apps, just because I feel like Linux has

12:13.100 --> 12:16.280
to do something, even though I don't know if it's really going to do anything.

12:16.280 --> 12:22.400
But Ethan points out that when you start using wine applications, the accessibility story

12:22.400 --> 12:24.340
drops off a cliff.

12:24.340 --> 12:29.840
It can be a hot mess with Windows apps under wine for various reasons, in part also because

12:29.840 --> 12:33.000
sometimes the situation just sucks on Windows proper.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.320
And then you bring it under wine where you've got the desktop environment, you've got wine,

12:37.320 --> 12:40.100
you've got maybe the application developers try to implement some accessibility and they're

12:40.100 --> 12:41.100
all fighting each other.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.760
It's just a hot mess.

12:42.760 --> 12:47.000
And so accessibility goes to die with wine apps on Linux.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.400
I just can't get behind a platform that cuts out a whole section of users like that.

12:52.400 --> 12:56.440
So I'm back on the native apps bandwagon, baby.

12:56.440 --> 13:03.160
Yeah, I mean, accessibility is tough, right?

13:03.160 --> 13:06.880
That's a tough one because that is already so bad.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.560
You don't want to make a decision that's going to make that worse.

13:09.560 --> 13:13.040
Like, we just can't afford to go backwards on that one.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.600
So that is what it is.

13:14.600 --> 13:18.080
But I wanted to get philosophical with you right here because remember to remember hit

13:18.080 --> 13:19.080
me up on Twitter.

13:19.080 --> 13:24.660
He says at Chris Lass, you sounded afraid to use the term lifestyle business last episode.

13:24.660 --> 13:26.560
Why let this be a bad word?

13:26.560 --> 13:29.120
I maintain that these are just businesses.

13:29.120 --> 13:33.840
It's hyperscalers struggling to pay back huge returns on VCs that are the problem.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.120
They're the ones that are doing something weird.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.420
Does scale really deliver value to customers?

13:40.420 --> 13:41.520
What a great question.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.240
And so I'm curious to know what you think.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.480
Two questions.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.440
Is lifestyle business a dirty word?

13:46.440 --> 13:50.640
Like would you be embarrassed to use that around business colleagues?

13:50.640 --> 13:55.520
And number two, if you're at a massive scale like a Microsoft or an Apple, does that have

13:55.520 --> 13:58.560
some sort of inherent value for customers that a small business doesn't?

13:58.560 --> 13:59.560
Okay.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.560
What do we think a lifestyle business is?

14:00.560 --> 14:06.440
Why don't we start there because I can tell you what it really is in practical terms.

14:06.440 --> 14:12.520
My thought when I said lifestyle business would be something that you set up and build

14:12.520 --> 14:14.520
a business that you set up and build.

14:14.520 --> 14:18.680
It makes enough revenue that you can live comfortably and take care of your family.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.560
But you're not going to become a billionaire.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.320
You're not going to do large acquisitions and mergers.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.960
You're probably never going to hire 100 people, right?

14:25.960 --> 14:29.720
You're just going to kind of stay focused, run your business, keep your friends and family

14:29.720 --> 14:33.000
paid, and serve your customers.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.920
I guess I would go with that.

14:34.920 --> 14:39.760
Part of the implication of lifestyle business is that you're actually making money, right?

14:39.760 --> 14:43.600
So to me, there's nothing wrong with the term.

14:43.600 --> 14:48.320
I might be concerned with more openly using it in sales conversations.

14:48.320 --> 14:52.720
Yeah, doesn't it feel like shorthand for lazy in some circles?

14:52.720 --> 14:58.200
I feel like it feels shorthand for maybe you're not super serious.

14:58.200 --> 15:02.860
But again, I don't feel that way, but I do have a visceral reaction that potential customers

15:02.860 --> 15:03.860
would.

15:03.860 --> 15:04.860
Right.

15:04.860 --> 15:05.860
Yeah.

15:05.860 --> 15:10.280
Like you're not really going to be up all night working late to solve my problems kind

15:10.280 --> 15:11.280
of vibe.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.280
It's weird.

15:12.280 --> 15:15.120
I also have a bunch of weird hangups that I don't think make sense, but I still have

15:15.120 --> 15:19.280
them from, you know, I've just been doing this a long time.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.280
Like this kind of thing, you think?

15:20.280 --> 15:21.280
Or what do you mean?

15:21.280 --> 15:23.880
I hate the word apps when I'm talking to potential customers.

15:23.880 --> 15:27.200
I won't use it or I duck, duck, duck.

15:27.200 --> 15:31.880
I tend to say just software or app, you know, I'll say application weirdly enough for the

15:31.880 --> 15:37.760
system or programs because I feel that when people think apps, they think they can just

15:37.760 --> 15:40.200
like go to Upwork and get it, you know what I mean?

15:40.200 --> 15:42.440
Buy a template and have somebody do it real quick.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.120
Even the word implies small, right?

15:44.120 --> 15:46.400
You're shortening the word application.

15:46.400 --> 15:49.240
Except for a few of my most like technically savvy customers.

15:49.240 --> 15:53.840
I tend to even avoid other than, oh, by the way, we're going to use this open source thing

15:53.840 --> 16:00.640
really talking about like what we're doing in terms of like, you know, I'm trying less

16:00.640 --> 16:04.680
and less to sell like development service.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.520
It's more like this is the solution.

16:06.520 --> 16:10.680
We're going to use software development as a way to solve your problem, but don't worry

16:10.680 --> 16:11.680
about it.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.600
You're not kind of a differentiation thing where you're not just going on Upwork and

16:15.600 --> 16:18.520
looking for a Python dev, right?

16:18.520 --> 16:23.840
You're we're giving you a complete system, build it, maintain it, and yeah, it's been

16:23.840 --> 16:24.840
working out better.

16:24.840 --> 16:25.840
You know what this might be?

16:25.840 --> 16:29.640
This might be a little bit of like hangover from the app store gold rush in the subsequent

16:29.640 --> 16:36.160
fall because I definitely did for a while take a hit on a lot of like the Upwork, the

16:36.160 --> 16:39.780
offshoring where people are just like buy my app template and for a thousand dollars

16:39.780 --> 16:44.800
will skin it for your, you know, you're a little, whatever your need, whatever your

16:44.800 --> 16:45.800
needs, right?

16:45.800 --> 16:46.800
Your restaurant, your bar here, whatever.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.320
Is that making any sense or am I way too deep into the?

16:50.320 --> 16:52.000
No, I feel the same way.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.280
I think in part it is like the legacy of watching the software business startup.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.840
I used to really resist calling our podcast podcast.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.440
I wouldn't use the word podcast on air.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.440
I wouldn't use it anywhere.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.440
I used to do that too.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.440
I used to call it radio internet radio.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.200
Yeah, it's a show.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.080
It's the Koda radio show, not the Koda radio podcast, right?

17:09.080 --> 17:13.040
At least that's how we used to talk about it, but it's because it felt like it didn't

17:13.040 --> 17:17.800
do justice to the amount of work and effort it goes into to actually produce the content.

17:17.800 --> 17:25.120
Just like apps feel like they kind of undercut how much damn work it takes to build an application

17:25.120 --> 17:26.120
these days.

17:26.120 --> 17:30.080
Even, you know, even now, like, well, the irony building an actual app, like a good

17:30.080 --> 17:34.000
item and I emphasis on good iPhone app, right?

17:34.000 --> 17:38.040
Is much more work than it was in let's say 20, you know, 20s.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.040
For sure.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.040
Yeah.

17:40.040 --> 17:43.520
I think when I see eye to eye on the lifestyle business thing, it's just like, it's always

17:43.520 --> 17:49.560
felt like I'm admitting that I don't have these huge ambitions to take over the podcast

17:49.560 --> 17:50.560
universe.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.320
I just want to do my thing.

17:53.320 --> 17:57.560
And so I felt, I felt embarrassed about that, especially when I'm, you know, at any kind

17:57.560 --> 18:01.800
of business function, it just feels embarrassing to admit it, but it's a good question.

18:01.800 --> 18:02.800
It is a good question.

18:02.800 --> 18:07.560
And if, Hey, if that floats your boat, if you like it, I think that's a, that's fine.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.960
I also wonder too, and see, now I'm thinking I'm getting a vision of a lifestyle business

18:10.960 --> 18:16.240
is like a dude with an M one Mac book pro who does, who like, honestly, he's like in

18:16.240 --> 18:21.880
an RV going around writing iOS like you, but hipster, like Apple hipster and he's got a

18:21.880 --> 18:23.920
flannel shirt and a beard, right?

18:23.920 --> 18:24.920
Right.

18:24.920 --> 18:25.920
Right.

18:25.920 --> 18:29.080
He only drinks craft beer and you put a Bud Light in front of him, he just throws it

18:29.080 --> 18:30.080
at you.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.080
So far, all this sounded actually pretty good.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.080
Actually.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.080
Yeah.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.080
I don't know.

18:34.080 --> 18:40.040
Yeah, I mean, I think there is that element of a hashtag van life and lifestyle, but there's,

18:40.040 --> 18:43.760
that's probably what it is, is that when I think of a lifestyle business, I think of

18:43.760 --> 18:48.760
my grandpa who ran advertising for the, Oh wow.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.800
He ran it for the local RV scene, which is funny.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.760
I never really put that, made that connection, but he ran, it's in your blood.

18:53.760 --> 18:54.760
It's in your blood.

18:54.760 --> 18:55.760
Wow.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.860
He did ads for the RV industry in Washington state, the whole bunch of them.

18:59.860 --> 19:00.860
And that was his fault.

19:00.860 --> 19:02.440
That was the industry he focused on.

19:02.440 --> 19:06.600
That was his niche and, uh, it was his lifestyle business.

19:06.600 --> 19:10.360
And he, I think he was a one-man, I think he was just back then and probably, probably

19:10.360 --> 19:12.200
wasn't so hard, but he was just a one-man show.

19:12.200 --> 19:15.440
I can't even imagine soloing a big iOS app today.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.440
I'm sorry.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.440
I'm like, yeah.

19:17.440 --> 19:20.800
And then like, or imagine a, yeah, it just, yeah, you gotta have accounting.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.240
You gotta have legal, you gotta have all this stuff.

19:23.240 --> 19:26.300
It's designers, developers.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.300
It's pretty crazy.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.300
Yeah.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.300
Well, thank you to remember to remember for sending that in.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.300
He hit me up on Twitter at Chris Ellis.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.440
You can always hit us up there too.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.960
The podcast is at Koda radio show on the Twitter.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.400
And we also have a new way you can get feedback into the show.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.300
You may have noticed some are already doing it.

19:40.300 --> 19:50.000
You can send us a boost new podcast app.com that's with an S new podcast apps.com.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.400
And you can go there and find one that supports boost and then you can send us in a little

19:53.400 --> 19:55.080
message and support the show.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.700
I won't go into my whole rant.

19:56.700 --> 20:00.600
I've talked before about how podcasting is changing.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.760
I've even said three to five years is my time estimation.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.240
I actually think it's probably one to two years.

20:05.240 --> 20:09.400
And I think these boost messages are going to play a role in wherever this is going.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.760
And I think it also has the same dynamics to support software development.

20:12.760 --> 20:16.640
And if you don't know what I'm talking about, go try it and you'll see what I mean.

20:16.640 --> 20:20.880
It's at new podcast apps.com and then you can filter for ones that support boosts and

20:20.880 --> 20:24.200
I'll have a link in the show notes for that.

20:24.200 --> 20:28.480
Also just a reminder, we have our East coast meetup coming up.

20:28.480 --> 20:35.840
Jupiter broadcasting is going to be in Raleigh, North Carolina on April 9th, 2022 at 3 p.m.

20:35.840 --> 20:36.840
Eastern.

20:36.840 --> 20:41.120
We'll be right next to Prime BBQ and then on the other side there's a brewery.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.600
We now have 50 people on the meetup page, Mike.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.120
And I think it's going to be probably even more than that.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.200
It's going to be a do not miss East Coast event.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.960
I will actually be there.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.000
Yeah, that's going to be exciting.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Wes is planning to go.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Brent's planning to go.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.720
Alex is planning to go from self-hosted.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.200
I'm going to be there.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.960
We're talking more and more people into it all the time.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.600
Details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

21:03.600 --> 21:09.600
We don't get out there too often, so we would love to see you.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.280
Linode.com slash coder.

21:11.280 --> 21:15.960
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

21:15.960 --> 21:16.960
show.

21:16.960 --> 21:17.960
You got to go try out Linode.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.620
You know, I've been talking about Linode for a little while and that's no accident.

21:21.620 --> 21:26.940
It's because Coder radio listeners keep signing up and becoming customers and that's because

21:26.940 --> 21:33.200
it's a great value to performance and really design API documentation support, like, etc,

21:33.200 --> 21:34.200
etc.

21:34.200 --> 21:37.280
But for me, it's really about the performance and the value because I got a small business

21:37.280 --> 21:40.080
to run and it's been resonating with Coder radio listeners.

21:40.080 --> 21:45.160
If you need a site for five or if you need a site for five million, Linode has the infrastructure

21:45.160 --> 21:46.560
that can handle this.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.640
They've been radically speeding up their infrastructure.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.460
Every opportunity they get, MVME, PCIe storage, yeah, they got that 40 gigabit connections

21:52.460 --> 21:53.460
coming to the hypervisor.

21:53.460 --> 21:54.600
Yeah, they got that.

21:54.600 --> 21:58.080
They are their own ISP with 11 data centers around the world.

21:58.080 --> 22:03.040
And man, I am so grateful that their interface is so much better than the hyperscalers that

22:03.040 --> 22:06.400
want to lock you into their craptastic platforms.

22:06.400 --> 22:10.600
And then of course, Linode has support they can't even touch, they can't even touch it.

22:10.600 --> 22:14.620
I think that's another reason why Coder radio listeners have been sticking with Linode.

22:14.620 --> 22:18.680
They've been really happy with when they get in a jam, they got that customer support.

22:18.680 --> 22:22.280
Linode's got that customer support and with 11 data centers around the world, you can

22:22.280 --> 22:27.000
choose from, you're going to find something near you or near your customers.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.840
And since Linode's been doing this for 19 years, they've worked the kinks out.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.580
They've got this figured out.

22:33.580 --> 22:38.400
So things like their object storage, cloud firewalls, all that kind of stuff.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.120
It just hums and works exactly like you'd expect.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.100
They have sensible alerting for when you have a problem with your system, maybe you got

22:44.100 --> 22:47.580
excessive bandwidth going on, maybe your CPU is going crazy.

22:47.580 --> 22:50.080
Those can always be signs that something's amok.

22:50.080 --> 22:53.080
And they've built some really sensible dashboard alerts and stuff like that that you can get

22:53.080 --> 22:54.080
going too.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.600
And they make it crazy easy to do backups, deploy applications with a single click.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.200
I could literally go on and on for the entire episode.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.040
So you better just go try it for yourself.

23:02.040 --> 23:10.180
Get that $100, kick the tires and support the show at linode.com slash coder.

23:10.180 --> 23:15.600
So Google, Microsoft, Apple, and of course a lot of others in the industry have all told

23:15.600 --> 23:20.800
their employees it is time to return to the office in either April or May, depending on

23:20.800 --> 23:23.080
which company you're looking at.

23:23.080 --> 23:26.700
Google told their workers that most of them should at least plan to return for three days

23:26.700 --> 23:28.400
a week, if not more.

23:28.400 --> 23:34.800
And they promised to study hybrid work further and collect data along the way.

23:34.800 --> 23:39.160
Microsoft has told all of their Washington state employees time to come back to the office

23:39.160 --> 23:41.400
effective February 28th.

23:41.400 --> 23:47.240
Employees have 30 days to adjust their routines and adopt the new working preferences that

23:47.240 --> 23:49.120
they've agreed upon with their manager.

23:49.120 --> 23:53.000
They also have committed to, even though we're asking for the bulk of you to come back, we're

23:53.000 --> 23:54.960
going to study hybrid work.

23:54.960 --> 23:59.760
And of course, Tim Cook over at Apple told employees they will begin to return to the

23:59.760 --> 24:06.160
office in Cupertino on April 11th with the completion by May 23rd.

24:06.160 --> 24:09.840
And he said, quote, while many of you have been coming in regularly for quite some time

24:09.840 --> 24:14.360
now, we are now looking forward to welcoming those of you who have shifted to working remotely

24:14.360 --> 24:16.480
back to our corporate offices.

24:16.480 --> 24:21.960
And then later he says, quote, we'll begin the phased approach to a hybrid pilot.

24:21.960 --> 24:26.460
They literally built a spaceship and called it their office.

24:26.460 --> 24:29.280
And now this is very culty.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.440
Great computer stuff.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.520
You know, each one of these companies is like, no, no, no, let's try to bring as much of

24:33.520 --> 24:34.520
you back.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.200
But we promise we're going to study this hybrid work thing.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.520
And there's different degrees here.

24:38.520 --> 24:42.600
Like, it looks like Microsoft and Google are going to allow for, you know, some work from

24:42.600 --> 24:45.620
home, some not, depending on their job.

24:45.620 --> 24:47.280
But it cracked the door.

24:47.280 --> 24:51.520
This whole two, two and a half years of a horrible pandemic cracked the door to remote

24:51.520 --> 24:54.360
work over the internet more than I expected.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.080
And I don't even like the term work from home.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.960
I think it's just work over the internet.

24:58.960 --> 25:05.520
But if the absolute gorillas in this industry, the industry titans, the ones who set the

25:05.520 --> 25:11.960
tone, the ones who lead everyone else, if they're not really making this adjustment

25:11.960 --> 25:17.400
and making this investment, which they are the best position to make these investments,

25:17.400 --> 25:22.320
then did corporate America learn anything from this?

25:22.320 --> 25:23.880
Is it at least a little better?

25:23.880 --> 25:26.420
And is that enough in your opinion?

25:26.420 --> 25:27.700
Maybe it's a good thing.

25:27.700 --> 25:30.840
All three of these companies are being very wishy washy, right?

25:30.840 --> 25:34.560
I mean, they're clear on what they want, but they're, it's been two years.

25:34.560 --> 25:37.720
One assumes they were doing like performance metrics the whole time.

25:37.720 --> 25:38.720
Exactly.

25:38.720 --> 25:39.720
Thank you.

25:39.720 --> 25:40.720
Right.

25:40.720 --> 25:41.720
We're going to now study it.

25:41.720 --> 25:42.720
What has the last two years been?

25:42.720 --> 25:47.080
I feel like what happened is, I don't know, I say I have conflicting feelings, right?

25:47.080 --> 25:52.460
Evil Mike, you know, Mike, after some Hendrix would say something like it's because they

25:52.460 --> 25:57.360
spent a crap ton of money on offices and yeah, especially for like a Google, right?

25:57.360 --> 26:01.520
Where it's, you know, the still one of the best lunches I've ever had was at Google in

26:01.520 --> 26:02.520
New York.

26:02.520 --> 26:03.520
Just incredible.

26:03.520 --> 26:08.360
And I don't know how everybody there is not 400 pounds, but it's just like, you know,

26:08.360 --> 26:10.480
they've made big investments.

26:10.480 --> 26:16.080
On the other hand, I have a sinking feeling that they're, you know, obviously very smart

26:16.080 --> 26:20.240
people and they all love them some analytics.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.720
There's probably a reason.

26:21.720 --> 26:28.840
What if it is just as stupid as corporate America has invested billions of dollars into

26:28.840 --> 26:34.040
these buildings and facilities and if all of a sudden their staff stopped using them

26:34.040 --> 26:40.160
and this happens at a scale across the entire industry, does the value of these buildings

26:40.160 --> 26:41.320
begin to drop?

26:41.320 --> 26:44.100
Does the value of their investments begin to drop?

26:44.100 --> 26:45.100
Is that a thing?

26:45.100 --> 26:50.520
If all of a sudden office real estate is no longer in demand, if there is an excessive

26:50.520 --> 26:53.640
supply of inventory of office real estate?

26:53.640 --> 26:59.760
You know, it's funny throughout this, I have looked at commercial real estate to just do

26:59.760 --> 27:04.800
some server hosting and some kind of a assembly stuff that's not really conducive to do in

27:04.800 --> 27:06.420
my house.

27:06.420 --> 27:09.040
And those prices have not gone down.

27:09.040 --> 27:15.800
I also feel like corporate real estate prices haven't quite ballooned like retail prices

27:15.800 --> 27:20.880
because we were looking at possibly selling at one point and relocating and, you know,

27:20.880 --> 27:24.720
just going by what we know the prices are of houses in the area that we were looking

27:24.720 --> 27:25.720
at buildings.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.760
The corporate building stuff, the corporate real estate stuff was still cheaper.

27:28.760 --> 27:33.800
It's all very expensive now, but it was still cheaper than like similar size building that

27:33.800 --> 27:34.800
would be retail.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.120
When you say retail, you mean a house?

27:36.120 --> 27:37.120
You mean like a...

27:37.120 --> 27:38.120
Yeah.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.320
Consumers like a house or apartment building.

27:40.320 --> 27:44.160
I wonder, that makes sense to me because I feel like people who are working from home,

27:44.160 --> 27:46.640
all of a sudden it's like, damn, I wish I had another room.

27:46.640 --> 27:49.320
It's their office and their, yeah, yeah.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.160
I don't know if that's really it, but you have to...

27:51.160 --> 27:55.080
There's also the, you know, butts in seats is how I manage my people mentality and all

27:55.080 --> 27:56.080
of that.

27:56.080 --> 27:58.960
And I think a lot of these businesses went into like, especially Apple, right?

27:58.960 --> 28:01.440
They went into remote work, kind of kicking and screaming.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.800
They had their hands forced.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.240
So it kind of makes sense.

28:04.240 --> 28:07.680
You could kind of see it like for certain things like Apple design, like, I don't know,

28:07.680 --> 28:08.680
there's some stuff I'm...

28:08.680 --> 28:13.480
I've been doing remote work for a long time and I'm kind of, one, I'm happy to see big

28:13.480 --> 28:17.680
companies go back to the office so that once again, working from home can be a competitive

28:17.680 --> 28:19.040
hiring advantage for me.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.040
Absolutely.

28:20.040 --> 28:25.560
I mean, if I had my brothers, I probably would have been more resistant to it.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.960
I mean, no doubt about it.

28:27.960 --> 28:34.080
There are certain kinds of work, even for what we do, that are just done better in person.

28:34.080 --> 28:37.560
There's some content we're planning right now for Linux Unplugged that we're planning...

28:37.560 --> 28:42.120
We're not planning to do until Brent and Wes are both here in studio for it.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.640
It's just no way around it.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.480
And so there's some stuff, some projects we wait on.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.480
So I get it.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.480
I do get it.

28:48.480 --> 28:51.280
But, you know, where I worked before was Linux Academy.

28:51.280 --> 28:57.200
They had a really good approach where it was remote work with an office that anyone was

28:57.200 --> 29:02.880
always allowed to come visit and there was always workspace available for people that

29:02.880 --> 29:06.080
wanted to come and work out of the office.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.720
And then at least twice a year, they probably would have gone to more, but at least twice

29:09.720 --> 29:14.000
a year, they did company events where they paid to fly everybody in and put them up in

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
a hotel.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.880
And that sounds horribly expensive until you think about the fact that they didn't have

29:18.880 --> 29:23.480
to have two or three offices staffed all the time and all the costs that associated with

29:23.480 --> 29:26.120
maintaining those buildings and workspaces.

29:26.120 --> 29:31.940
So they would essentially still end up on top and still have money left to hold these

29:31.940 --> 29:32.940
get togethers.

29:32.940 --> 29:36.760
And that was such a nice way to kind of tie that together with a team sprint.

29:36.760 --> 29:40.900
So if you knew you had these times together two or three times a year, you could also

29:40.900 --> 29:45.100
do some sprints in that time, and so a team would come in a week earlier and get together

29:45.100 --> 29:48.280
and kick ass on something before the big company meetup.

29:48.280 --> 29:50.080
It worked pretty well.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.000
Can I throw a Zuckerball at you?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.660
Yeah, I love Zuckerballs.

29:53.660 --> 30:02.240
I had a little fantasy of building a TMB office, like truly tripped the f**k out, like straight

30:02.240 --> 30:03.240
up.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.240
I would just mainline some Lewis Carroll and go for it.

30:06.240 --> 30:09.320
Do a little crib, MTV crib video if you ever set that place up.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.320
I'd love to see it.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.320
Right.

30:11.320 --> 30:12.320
In the metaverse.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.960
Seriously, like a private metaverse office.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.960
Well, that's where this is going, man.

30:16.960 --> 30:17.960
I'd have a J.B. studio.

30:17.960 --> 30:19.160
I've said it before.

30:19.160 --> 30:23.820
If I had a studio you guys could come hang out at, you know, so you just pop on your,

30:23.820 --> 30:27.020
you know, your metaverse wear and you show up and, you know, there's Wes and I hanging

30:27.020 --> 30:28.020
out in the studio.

30:28.020 --> 30:29.020
That would be awesome, right?

30:29.020 --> 30:30.880
I'm thinking about our North Carolina thing.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.560
A lot of people aren't going to want to travel, right?

30:32.560 --> 30:34.440
It's just the reality of life right now.

30:34.440 --> 30:39.640
And in general, even without the COVID, right, it's far, it costs money.

30:39.640 --> 30:44.760
What if we did, like, I hate the term, but metaverse events, meetups, metaverse meetups,

30:44.760 --> 30:45.760
right?

30:45.760 --> 30:46.760
Right.

30:46.760 --> 30:50.340
And we just hang out and it sounds crazy, but I remember when we first started talking

30:50.340 --> 30:55.880
about remote work when I remember I was a lot more kicking and screaming about it.

30:55.880 --> 30:59.920
And it just, you just have to kind of adapt and it does work.

30:59.920 --> 31:04.320
I mean, all hail Slack as it continues to monopolize my notifications.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.320
Right.

31:05.320 --> 31:10.560
Hey, did you see your buddy Michele DeCasa is leaving Microsoft, the former, uh, Xamarin?

31:10.560 --> 31:11.560
I did.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.200
Or is it Xamarian?

31:13.200 --> 31:14.200
It's Xamarin.

31:14.200 --> 31:15.200
It's not Xamarian.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.200
I promise you.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.200
Are you sure?

31:17.200 --> 31:18.200
110%.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.200
Okay.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.200
All right.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.920
I'm surprised it took this long.

31:22.920 --> 31:23.920
Yeah.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.500
They joined in 2016.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.480
He's a true startup foundry kind of guy.

31:27.480 --> 31:28.560
He's not, uh.

31:28.560 --> 31:33.840
Do you think it's a coincidence that Nat just left about a year ago when me Nat joined with

31:33.840 --> 31:34.840
Miguel?

31:34.840 --> 31:35.840
Yeah.

31:35.840 --> 31:36.840
Nat took over GitHub.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.680
And then we saw that whole transition happen.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.800
And then here we are just about a year later, not even quite.

31:42.800 --> 31:48.160
And Miguel stepping down, says he's going to spend the time with his kids, you know,

31:48.160 --> 31:49.640
spend time with family kind of thing.

31:49.640 --> 31:50.640
Yeah.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.440
Well, he said through the summer, he was very specific.

31:52.440 --> 31:53.440
Yeah.

31:53.440 --> 31:57.360
He says he does want to get back to work and he's about 99% sure it's going to be a startup

31:57.360 --> 31:58.360
scene that he gets into.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.360
Right.

31:59.360 --> 32:02.520
I mean, I feel like Miguel is, I mean, you know, he's a pretty straightforward dude.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.440
I'm sure he is going to like any, right.

32:04.440 --> 32:08.360
He's a, like you and I would, if we, you know, could, we would just take a month and hang

32:08.360 --> 32:13.720
out with our kids, but you know, he's going to be taking VC meetings too, right?

32:13.720 --> 32:15.840
This is, it's a, things take time.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.020
This is totally what this tweet thread's even about, right?

32:18.020 --> 32:21.680
This tweet thread's about, I'm on the market again.

32:21.680 --> 32:26.680
I would like to start, you know, let's call it Miguel Inc. and whatever, right?

32:26.680 --> 32:27.680
Who would like to fund me?

32:27.680 --> 32:28.680
I mean, which is fine.

32:28.680 --> 32:34.040
I mean, you used, you asked if it's a, if I think it's a coincidence, no, but I don't

32:34.040 --> 32:35.680
think there's anything evil here.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.280
These are two guys who are founders right now.

32:37.280 --> 32:42.560
Freedom very famously was like, let's put a rails GUI on top of get, I know it's not

32:42.560 --> 32:46.440
just a GUI, but you know, and he was like hanging out with his buddies in a pizzeria

32:46.440 --> 32:47.440
and did it.

32:47.440 --> 32:48.440
These guys are founders.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.440
They're true.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.440
Yeah.

32:50.440 --> 32:55.600
I think Miguel speaks positively of his experience at Microsoft in the thread and he makes it

32:55.600 --> 33:00.040
basically sound like if I wanted to stay with a big company, I would've just stayed at Microsoft.

33:00.040 --> 33:05.160
And so I think life was good enough that he wasn't under any immediate pressure to leave.

33:05.160 --> 33:09.560
And there's always the nicety of the public appearance that when Nat stepped down that,

33:09.560 --> 33:13.340
you know, maybe Miguel gave it some time to air and didn't want to jump in right behind

33:13.340 --> 33:15.520
Nat and make people really start talking.

33:15.520 --> 33:19.200
And since life wasn't so bad, why not wait a year, right?

33:19.200 --> 33:24.040
I watch with interest what he does next because Miguel has been a character that we have followed

33:24.040 --> 33:31.080
throughout the history of the GNOME desktop, Xamarin, Red Carpet, and Mono, and now Microsoft.

33:31.080 --> 33:34.800
And it's just been a fascinating journey to watch this guy go.

33:34.800 --> 33:38.920
And I hope he ends up in a start of this in the open source space again, because I feel

33:38.920 --> 33:42.880
like that's where his talents have been really, really beneficial for the whole industry,

33:42.880 --> 33:43.880
right?

33:43.880 --> 33:47.180
And if he goes to some company that's probably working on something cool, but it's all behind

33:47.180 --> 33:49.960
a closed wall, like I feel like the rest of the industry is not going to benefit from

33:49.960 --> 33:51.540
that guy as much, but we'll see.

33:51.540 --> 33:53.280
So I'm going to put my bet down.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.280
What do you think?

33:54.280 --> 33:59.320
Because I heard a very recent interview with him where he was talking a lot about ML.

33:59.320 --> 34:00.320
And it was funny.

34:00.320 --> 34:01.800
The guy in the room was like, is that what you're doing now?

34:01.800 --> 34:02.800
I was like, wait, what?

34:02.800 --> 34:07.000
I thought you were the Xamarin dude, which turns out he was doing like some stuff at

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Microsoft.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.240
Ah, I see where you're going.

34:09.240 --> 34:10.960
I think he's starting something.

34:10.960 --> 34:11.960
He's not going anywhere.

34:11.960 --> 34:12.960
Right.

34:12.960 --> 34:13.960
Right.

34:13.960 --> 34:14.960
Of course.

34:14.960 --> 34:15.960
And I'm good.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.020
I actually, he makes great stuff.

34:17.020 --> 34:20.400
Just walk into like Kleiner Perkins like, I would like to start a business.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.240
Please give me a check.

34:22.240 --> 34:24.280
And they'll do it because they would be stupid.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.280
Who's yeah.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.280
Oh, man.

34:26.280 --> 34:27.400
That's that's a nice spot to be in.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.800
Enjoy your vacation, Miguel.

34:28.800 --> 34:33.840
Can't wait to see what's up in the fall.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.780
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

34:35.780 --> 34:38.520
Go there, get a free trial and a free t-shirt.

34:38.520 --> 34:43.160
So Datadog is a software as a service monitoring and security platform.

34:43.160 --> 34:44.960
It takes care of so much stuff.

34:44.960 --> 34:50.320
It enables full stack observability for developers, IT operations, security individuals, your

34:50.320 --> 34:52.360
business is out there, they're just working in the cloud age.

34:52.360 --> 34:55.400
I mean, your stack, they can monitor it.

34:55.400 --> 34:59.480
Their platform has over 500 vendor backed integrations.

34:59.480 --> 35:02.880
So that means not only can you get all like the native built in stuff from the OS, but

35:02.880 --> 35:08.360
you can correlate all of your metrics from your applications, your logs, security signals,

35:08.360 --> 35:14.640
your infrastructure, your application stack, your third party services, everything in one

35:14.640 --> 35:17.800
beautiful single pane of glass.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.960
This is the promised land, my friends.

35:19.960 --> 35:23.800
These capabilities combined with the drag and drop dashboard customizability and the

35:23.800 --> 35:27.800
machine learning based alerts, that means your teams can troubleshoot and collaborate

35:27.800 --> 35:29.700
more effectively, right?

35:29.700 --> 35:34.360
You can prevent them down times and you get enhanced performance reliability and I will

35:34.360 --> 35:35.360
say communication.

35:35.360 --> 35:38.800
You see, and I don't just break into Accent for nothing, right?

35:38.800 --> 35:39.880
It has to be a big deal.

35:39.880 --> 35:43.160
So go get our exclusive offer for Coder Radio listeners.

That's where you do it.

35:57.600 --> 36:04.480
Go get that shirt, support the show and happy monitoring.

36:04.480 --> 36:08.440
This headline has me rolling.

36:08.440 --> 36:15.200
So all of the Android fan boys who wrote in and told me that it's all Apple's fault and

36:15.200 --> 36:20.800
that if only Apple supported RCS, the whole messaging situation would be solved.

36:20.800 --> 36:26.220
Google wouldn't need half a dozen different chat platforms and Apple would no longer be

36:26.220 --> 36:28.880
the bully of the messaging community.

36:28.880 --> 36:35.800
Well, AT&T has rolled out RCS messaging for certain select Android fans and it has been

36:35.800 --> 36:39.440
a complete dumpster fire.

36:39.440 --> 36:45.340
As you might not realize, but of course makes total sense with the RCS system, the carrier

36:45.340 --> 36:48.880
has complete control.

36:48.880 --> 36:54.840
And so AT&T thought it would be great to only enable RCS messaging on select devices like

36:54.840 --> 36:57.240
the new Galaxy devices.

36:57.240 --> 37:03.480
And that just created a huge problem when RCS systems phones were attempting to text

37:03.480 --> 37:10.320
phones that were not on this approved whitelist and AT&T boondoggle the entire transition.

37:10.320 --> 37:14.840
And so far, AT&T's response has been basically squat.

37:14.840 --> 37:20.800
They have completely crapped it up and RCS messaging has been a clown show.

37:20.800 --> 37:27.240
And depending on how you bought your Galaxy S22, you may or may not even get RCS.

37:27.240 --> 37:33.200
And what's remarkable is the feature is actually being enabled or disabled in Google's own

37:33.200 --> 37:36.680
chat app by the mother frickin carrier.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.040
You understand what I'm saying?

37:38.040 --> 37:43.760
The carrier is reaching into the chat app and flipping settings depending on their preferences

37:43.760 --> 37:45.520
on your phone.

37:45.520 --> 37:50.280
RCS has turned out to be a total dumpster fire.

37:50.280 --> 37:55.220
One more example of why Google screwed this thing up from the very beginning when they

37:55.220 --> 38:01.920
started with Android and why iMessage is now the blue bubble of all fame because they created

38:01.920 --> 38:07.320
a system that took the carriers out that focused on the experience for consumers and then they

38:07.320 --> 38:14.400
slowly iterated on that one singular messaging platform for a decade.

38:14.400 --> 38:22.120
What Google has done at every single turn is feed control to these monopolistic carriers

38:22.120 --> 38:27.080
who manage to crap it up every single time.

38:27.080 --> 38:33.920
And here we are now with RCS in the United States and it's made the situation even worse

38:33.920 --> 38:38.320
than text messages to iMessage situation that we had before.

38:38.320 --> 38:43.440
And this was supposedly the big savior that all the Android fanboys, all the Android techies

38:43.440 --> 38:45.400
were going to throw at our face constantly.

38:45.400 --> 38:50.680
It is such a great example of how our community screws this kind of stuff up all the time.

38:50.680 --> 38:56.120
We get so focused on the technicals, on the specs, and we completely cannot connect with

38:56.120 --> 39:00.060
the actual market realities that drive adoption.

39:00.060 --> 39:05.820
And so we argue from an almost moralistic standpoint like these are the moral arguments

39:05.820 --> 39:08.480
why this is the superior route that should be done.

39:08.480 --> 39:13.200
Meanwhile the market gives zero Fs about those arguments and does what it's going to do.

39:13.200 --> 39:18.180
And it seems like so many in our community are completely blind to this and so they make

39:18.180 --> 39:23.520
investments and bets and choose technology stacks based on this view that they have,

39:23.520 --> 39:25.880
this skewed technical view of the market.

39:25.880 --> 39:26.880
And it's embarrassing.

39:26.880 --> 39:30.280
And when you look at our inbox and you look at our mentions and how many people told us

39:30.280 --> 39:35.480
how dumb we are because RCS was going to solve all of this and here we are when it finally

39:35.480 --> 39:41.080
gets rolled out by a US carrier that's at scale and they just screw the whole thing

39:41.080 --> 39:42.080
up.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.080
Yeah, right.

39:43.080 --> 39:48.280
Anytime the carriers are involved in anything on your phone it's probably bad.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.760
I know.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.240
Your anger level is high.

39:51.240 --> 39:52.240
It is.

39:52.240 --> 39:59.920
It is because this, you know, I've been doing these doing podcasts for 15 years and this

39:59.920 --> 40:04.660
is this general problem that I just outlined about this is so rampant in the Linux community

40:04.660 --> 40:10.320
specifically where they get so focused on the specs, the text, right, the licenses and

40:10.320 --> 40:13.920
they completely lose all sense of what drives the market.

40:13.920 --> 40:18.840
And so that's how you see like people throwing millions at stupid, crazy Linux mobile phones

40:18.840 --> 40:21.640
that are never going to get more than 3000 users, right?

40:21.640 --> 40:25.020
That's why you see so many Linux users like jumping on board these projects that are never

40:25.020 --> 40:28.400
going to go anywhere because the market's already picked a horse.

40:28.400 --> 40:32.620
It's like already done three laps around the race and we're just getting saddled.

40:32.620 --> 40:35.240
Like we just do that kind of stuff all the time.

40:35.240 --> 40:39.080
And so we are constantly spending effort and resources in places that we're just going

40:39.080 --> 40:42.560
to spin our wheels instead of trying to figure out where the market's actually going and

40:42.560 --> 40:44.520
creating a product that fulfills that.

40:44.520 --> 40:48.080
And it just drives me crazy because it dogs the open source community to the point where

40:48.080 --> 40:50.600
they fail to execute over and over again.

40:50.600 --> 40:54.400
And you can see that pervasive thinking taking place here in the way people are analyzing

40:54.400 --> 40:55.800
this messaging situation.

40:55.800 --> 41:01.080
Well, it's even, you know, if you think about the history of successful open source, it's

41:01.080 --> 41:05.600
always when the open source community is ahead of the commercial community, right?

41:05.600 --> 41:09.320
And like they're going somewhere where the market wants them to go where like developers

41:09.320 --> 41:13.760
wanted the open source solved a lot of problems for a lot of developers.

41:13.760 --> 41:17.520
You could look at that as the community got way ahead of where commercial companies were

41:17.520 --> 41:19.440
going when it came to software licenses, right?

41:19.440 --> 41:20.680
They got that right.

41:20.680 --> 41:21.680
Yeah.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.200
I mean, we could keep taking this back, right?

41:23.200 --> 41:25.800
Web servers, web servers rather.

41:25.800 --> 41:26.800
Right?

41:26.800 --> 41:27.800
Yeah.

41:27.800 --> 41:28.800
Yeah.

41:28.800 --> 41:29.800
Mm hmm.

41:29.800 --> 41:30.800
I don't know.

41:30.800 --> 41:31.800
There's there's a there's 100 things.

41:31.800 --> 41:36.080
But anytime you take a successful commercial project or product even and say, we're going

41:36.080 --> 41:39.960
to do an open source version of this, you've already lost the game in a lot of ways.

41:39.960 --> 41:44.160
I can feel that situation quickly brewing for VR and AR too.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.680
Well, that's exactly what I was saying.

41:45.680 --> 41:51.000
My hope is that the term the thing I'm begrudgingly calling metaverse that we get some nice open

41:51.000 --> 41:53.320
standards, right?

41:53.320 --> 41:57.080
But I'm a little afraid that it's going to be whatever Apple puts out.

41:57.080 --> 42:02.720
So while I'm railing on silly things that happens in the open source community, this

42:02.720 --> 42:08.240
next story just seems so gutless, so meek that I just had to call it out on the air.

42:08.240 --> 42:13.100
I just, ah, Firefox has been disappointing me a lot.

42:13.100 --> 42:19.560
Today or yesterday, a bug was submitted that removed the Yandex search option, as well

42:19.560 --> 42:23.000
as a couple of other like mail dot are you related things?

42:23.000 --> 42:29.520
Essentially, you know, it was Firefox's participation in the canceling by code of Russia that we

42:29.520 --> 42:30.520
mentioned recently.

42:30.520 --> 42:35.440
You know, that's fine if enough people in that community project want to make that change,

42:35.440 --> 42:36.440
whatever.

42:36.440 --> 42:42.840
But what feels really meek about it is they totally used a misleading bug name to hide

42:42.840 --> 42:43.840
it.

42:43.840 --> 42:46.740
And the description of the bug is also just it feels so corporate.

42:46.740 --> 42:50.000
So the the the bug is now closed.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.440
Update distribution config.

42:51.440 --> 42:52.440
Wow.

42:52.440 --> 42:53.440
Yeah.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.700
Update distribution config is the name of the bug.

42:55.700 --> 42:59.560
And the description of the bug is also ridiculous.

42:59.560 --> 43:04.380
It's insured consistency among search configuration for Firefox.

43:04.380 --> 43:12.120
But that is a smokescreen for removing Russian Web services, anything related to Russia,

43:12.120 --> 43:14.360
from Firefox.

43:14.360 --> 43:20.600
And they use this essentially both smokescreen of update distribution config to hide the

43:20.600 --> 43:23.240
fact that they're doing cancelation by code.

43:23.240 --> 43:28.340
I actually think this is the time we should ask ourselves, how far do we take this kind

43:28.340 --> 43:29.340
of thing?

43:29.340 --> 43:35.780
How far do we alter our technological infrastructures, including the Internet, how the Internet routes

43:35.780 --> 43:39.120
and the applications that run on layer seven?

43:39.120 --> 43:42.080
How do we actually how far do we go in altering this?

43:42.080 --> 43:46.680
Because these scale events happen from time to time.

43:46.680 --> 43:52.820
Happened in 2014, happened in 2004 with Georgia, Crimea in 2014, right?

43:52.820 --> 43:57.840
This is actually the third time there's been some kind of situation happening in this general

43:57.840 --> 43:59.100
area of the world.

43:59.100 --> 44:03.360
So we've got to think about how we're going to do this and how far we extend this kind

44:03.360 --> 44:04.760
of group thing.

44:04.760 --> 44:06.600
Where are these ideas coming from?

44:06.600 --> 44:09.440
What is the technological justification for doing these?

44:09.440 --> 44:11.560
Is it just a social argument?

44:11.560 --> 44:13.760
Who's making those social arguments?

44:13.760 --> 44:15.960
How much influence should those people have?

44:15.960 --> 44:18.400
Those are all questions that are being completely bypassed right now.

44:18.400 --> 44:19.400
All right.

44:19.400 --> 44:26.760
The kind of problem I see with all this stuff is it's one, it's really weird to me how corporate

44:26.760 --> 44:32.480
I know Firefox, like whatever foundation corporations are acting like states.

44:32.480 --> 44:34.760
That's just blows my mind.

44:34.760 --> 44:40.600
But also, what about Russian community members, like just innocent folks who are like part

44:40.600 --> 44:45.900
of the, I'm not talking to Firefox specifically, but like general tech community.

44:45.900 --> 44:48.720
Or just people that are dissidents that are fighting against the government.

44:48.720 --> 44:49.720
Right.

44:49.720 --> 44:54.840
Is there some risk in cutting off Russian stuff that you will in fact aid the Russian

44:54.840 --> 44:55.840
state?

44:55.840 --> 45:01.280
I'm assuming they're doing this to undermine in some weird, completely ineffective way,

45:01.280 --> 45:03.800
the state government of Russia, right?

45:03.800 --> 45:06.680
I mean, isn't Yandex just like their Google?

45:06.680 --> 45:08.520
Or am I out of my mind?

45:08.520 --> 45:09.520
Yeah.

45:09.520 --> 45:14.560
Actually, I always think in these situations, and I know this is opposite thinking these

45:14.560 --> 45:19.840
days, but I often think in these kinds of situations, we should err on the side of more

45:19.840 --> 45:21.640
information in all cases.

45:21.640 --> 45:22.640
Get it all out on the table.

45:22.640 --> 45:24.880
Well, that's kind of what I'm getting to.

45:24.880 --> 45:30.120
Shouldn't we be like, hey, Russian folk, I don't know, shouldn't we, I mean, wouldn't

45:30.120 --> 45:33.000
it make more sense to give more information, more access?

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Yeah.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.480
As a wise man once said, the truth is the first casualty of war.

45:37.480 --> 45:40.040
And then we have just kind of doubled down on that.

45:40.040 --> 45:47.960
Also, this change, the way they've done this also affects Firefox ESR, because apparently

45:47.960 --> 45:51.400
sys admins love self-destructing software.

45:51.400 --> 45:55.680
It's just one of those things where like you have a product, and maybe for some reason

45:55.680 --> 45:59.040
you're using this aspect of it, and then overnight, the vendor turns it off.

45:59.040 --> 46:00.040
It's gone now.

46:00.040 --> 46:04.000
And it's not what you expect from free software, which is supposed to be sovereign software.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.300
I know this is a touchy issue, but we weren't willing to have the conversation when it was

46:08.300 --> 46:13.040
about social justice and we were making changes to code for social justice purposes.

46:13.040 --> 46:19.480
Are we willing to have the conversation now that it's over suppressing a specific state?

46:19.480 --> 46:21.080
You're not really suppressing the state.

46:21.080 --> 46:22.240
Well, you're trying to, right?

46:22.240 --> 46:23.240
I mean, what else?

46:23.240 --> 46:24.560
Are we shaming them?

46:24.560 --> 46:26.320
Are we canceling them from society by these changes?

46:26.320 --> 46:28.120
I mean, what are we doing here?

46:28.120 --> 46:29.120
There's so much here, right?

46:29.120 --> 46:32.360
There's because there's like the practical angle of don't you want more like access for

46:32.360 --> 46:37.000
Russian folk if you feel passionately about this, which like, you know, people pulling

46:37.000 --> 46:38.200
podcast apps.

46:38.200 --> 46:42.960
It's to me, that's even crazier, but it's like, how else are they going to get unbiased

46:42.960 --> 46:43.960
information?

46:43.960 --> 46:47.800
Like they're just all they have left is the government propaganda is the state media.

46:47.800 --> 46:48.800
Yeah.

46:48.800 --> 46:52.280
Also, like, I know we don't like RMS anymore.

46:52.280 --> 46:55.040
I get it fine.

46:55.040 --> 47:02.000
But one of the tenants of free software by design is that people can't do like this.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.200
This is why everything going to the cloud and mink services.

47:05.200 --> 47:13.800
It's real weird how just in what, 30 years, how you really don't quote unquote, own or

47:13.800 --> 47:17.280
control your software, even when it's free software.

47:17.280 --> 47:20.400
I think that is the part that got me I think you just nailed that I couldn't really put

47:20.400 --> 47:21.400
words to it.

47:21.400 --> 47:24.400
I mean, you could see a more sinister case where like,

47:24.400 --> 47:28.000
edge I could see Microsoft edge doing this or maybe even Google Chrome.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.560
Let's just not make it about, you know, the specific conflict.

47:31.560 --> 47:35.900
Let's say the Russian state, for example, does this themselves, right?

47:35.900 --> 47:39.520
They just take out the cloud services inside the board, which they do all the time, right?

47:39.520 --> 47:41.640
China does it all the time, too.

47:41.640 --> 47:42.720
Just go watch revolution OS.

47:42.720 --> 47:43.720
I don't even know what to say.

47:43.720 --> 47:44.720
Right?

47:44.720 --> 47:45.720
I like it.

47:45.720 --> 47:46.720
Yeah.

47:46.720 --> 47:49.000
It feels like what we're doing is so I was I was just extra I'm game theory in this a

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
little bit.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.880
Let's say China invades Taiwan.

47:52.880 --> 47:58.960
And does corporate America do this same voluntary voluntary sanctions, self sanctioning?

47:58.960 --> 48:03.280
Will that happen is are their economic ties to China too great?

48:03.280 --> 48:05.000
So now we're going to see a double standard.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.480
Either way, it's not a good scenario.

48:06.480 --> 48:11.280
And what we are doing is we are creating something is inherently opposite of the technology.

48:11.280 --> 48:14.920
TCP IP is designed to route around problems.

48:14.920 --> 48:17.060
The internet is designed to be self healing.

48:17.060 --> 48:21.760
And we are creating divisions at the human layer.

48:21.760 --> 48:23.660
It's not what the technology is built to do.

48:23.660 --> 48:28.520
So we are creating artificial boundaries around our different internets now.

48:28.520 --> 48:31.880
And pretty soon, we're going to have a Western internet, but it's already happening.

48:31.880 --> 48:32.880
Right.

48:32.880 --> 48:34.140
And we and we should not be encouraging this.

48:34.140 --> 48:38.460
This is why the federal government invested in services like tour to begin with.

48:38.460 --> 48:40.800
We should not be encouraging a balkanized internet.

48:40.800 --> 48:43.520
We do not want a split up internet like this.

48:43.520 --> 48:49.360
And it's not good for humanity long term when you just get down to nation states, different

48:49.360 --> 48:56.100
political parties, when you just get down to what is best long term for humanity.

48:56.100 --> 48:57.520
This ain't it chief.

48:57.520 --> 49:01.120
And I think we're gonna get a lot of comments, but I keep making a joke that the dream of

49:01.120 --> 49:02.560
the 90s is dead.

49:02.560 --> 49:03.560
It's really dead.

49:03.560 --> 49:07.320
Like, and for our listeners of a certain age, or maybe too young to understand what the

49:07.320 --> 49:09.320
hell we're talking about.

49:09.320 --> 49:12.160
This was not supposed to go this way.

49:12.160 --> 49:17.640
This whole centralization was the exact thing that we, in quotes, the open source community

49:17.640 --> 49:21.300
or not even, you know, not even just the open source people, right?

49:21.300 --> 49:24.680
Like the, the, the Mac guys were like all in it, too, right?

49:24.680 --> 49:29.920
There were some of the, really all the nerds with the one exception of Bill Gates rage

49:29.920 --> 49:30.920
you letters.

49:30.920 --> 49:32.440
I don't know.

49:32.440 --> 49:33.440
We didn't win.

49:33.440 --> 49:35.440
The next centralization is going to be the metaverse.

49:35.440 --> 49:36.440
Yeah.

49:36.440 --> 49:37.440
You know what you're getting though, right?

49:37.440 --> 49:39.040
You're going to get, so Russia has its own internet.

49:39.040 --> 49:40.280
Well, what else is Russia going to do?

49:40.280 --> 49:41.280
They're going to have their own Firefox.

49:41.280 --> 49:45.440
So now you're going to have the Russian fork of Firefox that keeps these Russian services.

49:45.440 --> 49:48.840
And now you're going to have multiple and what do you suppose the chances are that you

49:48.840 --> 49:53.100
extrapolate that over the next 20 to 30 years and that thing becomes behind and falls behind

49:53.100 --> 49:54.520
the primary project.

49:54.520 --> 49:57.440
And now you're exposing all those users to all kinds of vulnerabilities that aren't getting

49:57.440 --> 50:00.600
patched because it can't stay up with upstream.

50:00.600 --> 50:05.640
Like that's, that's exactly where this goes because you can fork these things.

50:05.640 --> 50:10.840
We are essentially introducing opportunity for all these divisions from financial divisions

50:10.840 --> 50:14.960
on how they purchase and trading goods to their internet and their software that they

50:14.960 --> 50:16.820
use in the services they use.

50:16.820 --> 50:23.520
We are essentially inviting a, a splitting up of services, a forking off a creation of

50:23.520 --> 50:24.560
their own thing.

50:24.560 --> 50:26.400
And we are diluting resources.

50:26.400 --> 50:31.360
We are diluting access to information and God, it just seems so short-sighted.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.360
I don't know.

50:32.360 --> 50:33.600
Do you want to start a BBS and cry with me?

50:33.600 --> 50:37.040
I mean, we've gotten nowhere to go, right?

50:37.040 --> 50:39.280
It's podcasts is all that remain, man.

50:39.280 --> 50:41.320
No, not for much longer.

50:41.320 --> 50:42.320
Sorry.

50:42.320 --> 50:44.080
Have you, have you met my friend, Joe Rogan?

50:44.080 --> 50:45.560
Oh, it's a tricky time, right?

50:45.560 --> 50:51.200
I mean, it is a really, I mean, I also, you know, I also feel like there should be a cost

50:51.200 --> 50:53.800
for invading another country and so we have to walk that line.

50:53.800 --> 50:54.800
So I do get it.

50:54.800 --> 50:58.760
I don't think either of us, like, I'm sure we're very like sympathetic and you know,

50:58.760 --> 51:00.800
God bless Ukrainians and all that.

51:00.800 --> 51:02.880
I just worry, right?

51:02.880 --> 51:05.140
The problem is it's like guns.

51:05.140 --> 51:08.000
Gun can be used by a good guy, gun can be used by a bad guy.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.480
Linux could be used to launch a Russian missile.

51:10.480 --> 51:12.880
It can be used to launch a Western missile.

51:12.880 --> 51:15.400
It can be used to run Alice.

51:15.400 --> 51:19.760
It could be used to run one of her horrible do not buy them competitors.

51:19.760 --> 51:21.320
See, capitalism.

51:21.320 --> 51:22.320
Yeah.

51:22.320 --> 51:25.200
And I get the argument too, like, you know, West is in the chat room too.

51:25.200 --> 51:28.040
It's like you could see the argument that, well, they created, they originally created

51:28.040 --> 51:29.160
the divisions.

51:29.160 --> 51:34.880
I think I take a longer like sort of meta anti-war, anti-conflict standpoint in this,

51:34.880 --> 51:35.880
right?

51:35.880 --> 51:38.440
Are we really going to go full utopian RMS line?

51:38.440 --> 51:39.500
Let's just do it.

51:39.500 --> 51:45.440
One of the ideas was that the technical community would be so interconnected that it would make

51:45.440 --> 51:49.920
stupid these little, these little, you know, nation state fights hard.

51:49.920 --> 51:51.960
Now that's not the case.

51:51.960 --> 51:54.040
It's not going to be the case, right?

51:54.040 --> 51:58.720
What happens when I'll fry some bacon, get me some, uh, I don't really know any Russian

51:58.720 --> 51:59.780
sausage names.

51:59.780 --> 52:02.120
I got something that just looks like it's written in Russian.

52:02.120 --> 52:05.240
I don't know what it, I don't know what flavor it is though.

52:05.240 --> 52:06.240
Okay.

52:06.240 --> 52:11.160
How many days are we away from a, uh, open source project throwing off like Russian board

52:11.160 --> 52:12.720
members who've been contributing?

52:12.720 --> 52:14.440
Oh, this is rat bacon.

52:14.440 --> 52:16.160
Oh God.

52:16.160 --> 52:18.200
Yeah, maybe.

52:18.200 --> 52:19.200
I hope not.

52:19.200 --> 52:20.560
I mean, I feel like it's going to happen.

52:20.560 --> 52:24.440
It's going to be the new kind of the new Scarlet letter.

52:24.440 --> 52:28.200
So I don't know as we're both canceled.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.200
It's tricky, right?

52:29.200 --> 52:33.960
Because it feels like engineers and developers, they're always kind of caught in the middle

52:33.960 --> 52:34.960
here, right?

52:34.960 --> 52:39.680
Cause they're so often are into, into it for the technology and that kind of stuff.

52:39.680 --> 52:45.680
And then world events happen and technology cannot avoid it.

52:45.680 --> 52:50.480
It's like, despite what we might prefer, there's a lot of big questions here and you know,

52:50.480 --> 52:51.480
maybe we're wrong.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.000
Maybe you and I are wrong on this.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.720
There is a really sensible reason to kind of balkanize our societies even more, create

52:57.720 --> 53:00.960
division and create people that are dependent on government propaganda.

53:00.960 --> 53:06.600
Perhaps I am too short-sighted and, uh, I don't see the long-term benefits of that,

53:06.600 --> 53:11.040
but my view on it is that long-term it's a bad thing and that we're kind of perpetuating

53:11.040 --> 53:14.640
it via something that could have remained neutral.

53:14.640 --> 53:19.200
So we're taking things that have the ability to remain neutral that would really have no

53:19.200 --> 53:22.000
large impact, right?

53:22.000 --> 53:24.540
Keeping these changes out of Firefox, right?

53:24.540 --> 53:30.340
These four or five changes they made really will have zero impact on this conflict.

53:30.340 --> 53:32.960
It only has the impact of hurting people.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.960
I mean, come on, even if that's what this particular one, I don't know.

53:35.960 --> 53:41.120
It's minor and there'll probably be forks and workarounds and extensions and other browsers.

53:41.120 --> 53:46.840
So it's, it really, you really, when you think about the impact it has, it's negative if

53:46.840 --> 53:48.920
anything and hardly anything.

53:48.920 --> 53:54.120
And yet we're still taking something that could have just stayed out of it.

53:54.120 --> 53:58.860
And of course the way they did it with this, you know, you know something's a little off

53:58.860 --> 54:02.840
when they're doing it with this stupid name like update distribution config as the title

54:02.840 --> 54:04.760
of the bug, right?

54:04.760 --> 54:09.180
With the description of ensure consistency among search configuration for Firefox.

54:09.180 --> 54:12.480
They're intentionally trying to just keep it a little low key.

54:12.480 --> 54:16.040
They didn't want this to bubble up, but people saw it.

54:16.040 --> 54:18.300
We're headed towards Star Wars, not Star Trek.

54:18.300 --> 54:19.300
That's the future.

54:19.300 --> 54:21.120
And that's really bad.

54:21.120 --> 54:22.120
You're right.

54:22.120 --> 54:25.660
What's funny is right now the people that are in charge would be the people that would

54:25.660 --> 54:30.720
be kind of, you'd think the people responsible for a Star Trek, like one world government

54:30.720 --> 54:33.280
that works out to a utopia where everybody gets along, right?

54:33.280 --> 54:37.400
You'd think that's a progressive future, but ironically I look at the people in charge

54:37.400 --> 54:41.440
that would probably label themselves as, you know, closer to progressives than the previous

54:41.440 --> 54:43.840
administration and they're running full head into this.

54:43.840 --> 54:44.840
You know, they haven't even attempted.

54:44.840 --> 54:47.200
I'm now, this is the last thing I'll have to say and then we're done.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.280
They haven't even attempted to stop this thing.

54:49.280 --> 54:53.840
They haven't even attempted to do negotiations and they are making sure to supply arms, but

54:53.840 --> 54:57.120
they have not been at a single one of the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.

54:57.120 --> 54:58.360
The US has not.

54:58.360 --> 54:59.360
They're welcome.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.360
They've been invited.

55:00.360 --> 55:01.360
Why aren't they there?

55:01.360 --> 55:03.360
Because they're not trying to stop the war.

55:03.360 --> 55:04.360
So yeah, you're right.

55:04.360 --> 55:07.000
We are going into Star Wars for sure, man.

55:07.000 --> 55:11.080
And like it's going to have long-term ramifications on our industry and a lot of ways and I, we

55:11.080 --> 55:14.280
don't need to make this a political show or I don't think this will be a recurring thing,

55:14.280 --> 55:17.040
but we've been doing a great job for the last month and a half.

55:17.040 --> 55:18.900
We're trying to, at least we save it to the end now.

55:18.900 --> 55:23.880
You know, we, we try that at least, but I guess we could talk more about the max studio.

55:23.880 --> 55:27.000
It's just like, when you look at what's going to have long-term impacts now, last couple

55:27.000 --> 55:28.040
of years it was COVID.

55:28.040 --> 55:30.520
We're still going to be dealing with that, but right now the most immediate thing, it's

55:30.520 --> 55:31.520
going to be this conflict.

55:31.520 --> 55:32.520
It's going to change things.

55:32.520 --> 55:35.840
You know, we should do it for one of the code or lose, maybe you guys should subscribe.

55:35.840 --> 55:39.880
We should do the, uh, the dream of the original tech revolution.

55:39.880 --> 55:42.600
Let's start in the seventies and do seventies, eighties, nineties.

55:42.600 --> 55:43.600
I could see that.

55:43.600 --> 55:45.920
I'll rewatch revolution OS to like refresh myself.

55:45.920 --> 55:46.920
And let's see where we landed.

55:46.920 --> 55:51.080
Cause I have a feeling you and I are both going to need a stiff cocktail.

55:51.080 --> 55:56.560
You know, it's bad when you and I politically are like coming aligned as the show goes on.

55:56.560 --> 55:58.240
It's not good yet.

55:58.240 --> 56:02.400
Like when it started, we were pretty far apart and this time has gone on where you were like,

56:02.400 --> 56:05.720
we're starting to like, oh crap, this is a problem, both from different sides, but seeing

56:05.720 --> 56:06.720
the same problem.

56:06.720 --> 56:09.600
And so, yeah, I think that I'd love to watch it, just a good movie in general, and you

56:09.600 --> 56:13.720
can become a coder member, support the show and get access to the code of the report by

56:13.720 --> 56:18.920
going to coder QA dot co, or you can get access to that by supporting all of the network shows

56:18.920 --> 56:20.400
at Jupiter dot party.

56:20.400 --> 56:24.520
You join the party, support the shows and get access to all of the special features.

56:24.520 --> 56:26.040
And we really appreciate it.

56:26.040 --> 56:29.840
Let's be picky about who we work with from a sponsor standpoint and let's us take our

56:29.840 --> 56:33.960
time to make sure those things work out in a way that's beneficial for you and us.

56:33.960 --> 56:35.520
That's a coder QA dot co.

56:35.520 --> 56:39.120
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send people this week now that we got them

56:39.120 --> 56:40.120
all fired up?

56:40.120 --> 56:44.040
Go to Alice dot dev and inquire about some automation goodness.

56:44.040 --> 56:47.640
Yeah, take something off your plate for goodness sake.

56:47.640 --> 56:49.200
Go to Alice dot dev.

56:49.200 --> 56:52.020
You can follow the show at Coder Radio Show on the Twitters.

56:52.020 --> 56:55.920
We also have the feedback and general discussion on our matrix.

56:55.920 --> 56:59.840
You can go find that at colony dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com if you got the element

56:59.840 --> 57:01.400
plan or however you matrix.

57:01.400 --> 57:04.080
It's blowing up over there, blowing up over there.

57:04.080 --> 57:05.080
Go participate.

57:05.080 --> 57:06.080
It's been a lot of fun.

57:06.080 --> 57:09.400
