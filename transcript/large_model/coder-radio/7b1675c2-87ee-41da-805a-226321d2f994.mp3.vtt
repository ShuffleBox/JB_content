00:00.000 --> 00:16.040
This is KOTORadio, episode 412 for May 3rd, 2021.

00:16.040 --> 00:19.940
Hello friend and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.940 --> 00:24.720
at the art and business of software development, and the whole world of technology around it.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.840
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

00:26.840 --> 00:32.320
A Cloud Guru now includes Cloud Playground, Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud Sandboxes on

00:32.320 --> 00:34.040
ACG's credit card.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.040
Not yours.

00:35.040 --> 00:39.720
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

00:39.720 --> 00:44.240
My name is Chris and this special edition of the KOTORadio program finds me all by myself

00:44.240 --> 00:47.080
because Mike is out on assignment, but fear not.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.960
I have a special, special episode for you.

00:48.960 --> 00:54.920
I have the privilege of sharing a wonderful chat between our very own Wes Payne and Brunch

00:54.920 --> 00:56.680
Master Brent.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.400
It is definitely a wide ranging conversation.

00:59.400 --> 01:06.400
It's a deep dive into a swath of life, including Wes's approach to learning new things and

01:06.400 --> 01:10.560
his definition of his kind of work, which I think is unique and different, as well as

01:10.560 --> 01:15.760
thoughts on meditation and improving productivity and the importance of context and comprehension

01:15.760 --> 01:19.760
to just entropy and the evolutions of routines and creativity.

01:19.760 --> 01:20.920
I'm not kidding you.

01:20.920 --> 01:25.780
It is a wide ranging conversation and it's a perfect one for our audience who has to

01:25.780 --> 01:28.600
think about work in multiple different ways.

01:28.600 --> 01:33.320
So before we go back in time to that conversation, I want to thank our sponsor, Linode.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.680
Linode.com slash KOTOR.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.080
Go there to receive a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.680
And of course you support the KOTORadio program.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.360
Simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.120
That's how we host everything now.

01:45.120 --> 01:49.800
They are our go to hosting provider and they give us the tools to develop, deploy and maintain

01:49.800 --> 01:54.080
all of the functions we need to operate at the scale we do with the size of the team

01:54.080 --> 01:55.080
that we have.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.240
And I cannot emphasize that point enough.

01:57.240 --> 02:01.240
Linode makes it possible for us to do things way beyond what a small team could normally

02:01.240 --> 02:02.240
grasp.

02:02.240 --> 02:07.320
That's what's great because their prices are 35 to 50% less than shops like AWS, like big

02:07.320 --> 02:09.580
cloud over there at AWS.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.640
And Linode's been around since 2003.

02:11.640 --> 02:16.080
They were the first in this game and they have focused on getting this right since then.

02:16.080 --> 02:19.160
And with 11 data centers worldwide, you're going to find just the right spot to deploy

02:19.160 --> 02:20.160
for you.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.400
And you're going to rest easily knowing that Linode's built in monitoring tools have you

02:23.400 --> 02:24.560
covered.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.980
Just simple things like that, like I get emails when a system reaches a certain threshold

02:28.980 --> 02:34.080
on memory usage or network usage, man, just watching that stuff is a fantastic indicator

02:34.080 --> 02:36.140
about what's going on with your system.

02:36.140 --> 02:42.360
But maybe you want something even simpler, like just beautiful, accessible S3 compatible

02:42.360 --> 02:43.960
object storage in the cloud.

02:43.960 --> 02:47.900
I love Linode's S3 compatible object storage.

02:47.900 --> 02:48.900
What is it?

02:48.900 --> 02:52.280
Well, if you don't know, object storage is an easy way for you to store and access data

02:52.280 --> 02:56.400
without the need of running an entire server, you know, with its whole OS and everything

02:56.400 --> 02:58.060
in front of that.

02:58.060 --> 03:02.160
You can get just URL accessible storage either for yourself or you can flip it public.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.120
It's a great way to run a static website or host some files.

03:05.120 --> 03:12.000
We use it internally as a dynamic way to automatically add storage for our PeerTube instance and

03:12.000 --> 03:13.400
for our next cloud instance.

03:13.400 --> 03:17.880
So we're not constantly battling with storage limitations and accidentally using too much

03:17.880 --> 03:21.000
for a project that we're going to have around for three months that throws everything into

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
whack.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.920
And this actually solves problems that have literally broken a next cloud deployment before

03:26.920 --> 03:29.160
when I just totally ran out of storage.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.360
It's embarrassing, but I just don't have the time to manage this stuff.

03:32.360 --> 03:36.400
And so using Linode's tools to monitor and manage this and take care of some of these

03:36.400 --> 03:39.080
things, it is such a time saver.

03:39.080 --> 03:42.260
At the price point that Linode is offering, it's just a no brainer.

03:42.260 --> 03:45.000
They're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.640
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

03:47.640 --> 03:53.800
To go to linode.com slash coder, receive that $100 60 day credit and support the show.

03:53.800 --> 03:58.040
And of course, of course, try out all the features I've been talking about forever.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.000
It's linode.com slash coder.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.840
All right, like I said, it really is a special privilege to introduce this conversation to

04:04.840 --> 04:05.840
you.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.720
I take you back in time to Brunch with Wes Payne.

04:08.720 --> 04:09.720
Hi, Wes.

04:09.720 --> 04:10.720
Hello, Brent.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.720
How are you today?

04:11.720 --> 04:12.720
I'm doing wonderful.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.720
I see your smiling face.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.720
Oh, well, come on.

04:14.720 --> 04:15.720
That's just because you're so nice.

04:15.720 --> 04:19.200
And it's not always smiling.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.680
That's why I appreciate it.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.240
I think I try to smile in the appropriate contexts.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.800
I hope I accomplish such things.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.320
You don't want a false smile.

04:27.320 --> 04:31.480
So we're doing brunch here and you actually did participate in some brunch.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.480
How was that?

04:32.480 --> 04:33.480
That was lovely.

04:33.480 --> 04:37.560
You made me an excellent, excellent frittata.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.600
I did.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.760
And Chris got a little bit of that down his gullet as well.

04:41.760 --> 04:42.760
It was it was good.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.480
I was a little picky about my eggs from time to time.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.480
But it was excellent.

04:47.480 --> 04:48.540
All right.

04:48.540 --> 04:52.280
Just to warm you up for our session here.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.800
This is kind of neat for me, Wes.

04:53.800 --> 04:57.480
I'm sitting in the hot seat here, which is Chris's seat.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.480
Yeah.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.480
You're sitting in your usual seat.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.480
So this is totally normal for you, right?

05:01.480 --> 05:02.880
But it's cool.

05:02.880 --> 05:06.720
We've had the opportunity this week to hang out with the crew.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.200
Oh, yeah, so much hanging out.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.800
And we had well, tell me, what were the things that kind of stood out for you?

05:13.800 --> 05:16.320
Some food, some some conversations and stuff?

05:16.320 --> 05:21.160
I really enjoyed the ad hoc collaboration and just sort of people mixing and mashing

05:21.160 --> 05:25.760
ideas and all being nerdy about like a ton of different topics, some of them show related,

05:25.760 --> 05:27.760
some of them just like life things.

05:27.760 --> 05:31.080
Lots of music being bounced around as well, I noticed.

05:31.080 --> 05:35.280
And Chris, I think did a good job of trying to show everyone the virtues of living in

05:35.280 --> 05:36.280
the Pacific Northwest.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.280
So well, I did not attend all of those.

05:38.280 --> 05:42.320
I was very glad that other people got to see the beautiful landscapes around here.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.320
Right.

05:43.320 --> 05:44.320
I mean, you're, you're a local.

05:44.320 --> 05:47.400
So you you've already been converted, right?

05:47.400 --> 05:49.760
Or converted by default, shall we say?

05:49.760 --> 05:50.760
Right.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.840
Have you ever lived anywhere else?

05:52.840 --> 05:56.720
Like you've you've been in Seattle, and I know you grew up a little bit further down.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.400
Yeah, I grew up in Olympia, slightly south.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.480
But have you lived in any other cities?

06:01.480 --> 06:03.800
I lived in Bellingham for a while.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.700
And I lived in Everett.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.120
So all sort of in this little corridor here?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.120
Yeah, the I-5 corridor.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.120
Nice.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.120
Yeah.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.000
And so, totally your backyard?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Very much so.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
What I-

06:16.000 --> 06:17.320
But there's still plenty to discover, let me tell you.

06:17.320 --> 06:22.740
Yeah, I was just about to say what I really appreciate is when you can sort of become

06:22.740 --> 06:24.280
a tourist in your own backyard.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.280
Yes.

06:25.280 --> 06:30.680
And so I know Chris, we ended up, well, he's never been to those ice caves.

06:30.680 --> 06:31.840
And I don't know if you've ever been?

06:31.840 --> 06:33.120
No, I have not.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.120
Okay.

06:34.120 --> 06:38.200
But that's always fun when you can, like, both be the tour guide and also the tourist

06:38.200 --> 06:39.200
at the same time.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.200
Yeah, right.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.200
Let's go check out this fun thing together.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.200
Well, maybe it's fun.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.200
We'll find out.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.200
Right.

06:44.200 --> 06:50.440
I have to say for myself, moving to a different city is totally eye opening in the sense that

06:50.440 --> 06:53.000
it breaks all your routines and you have to build them all back up.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.040
You got to find all your new places in this new city.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.040
Yeah.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.560
Was that the same for you when you moved, let's say to Bellingham?

06:58.560 --> 06:59.560
Yes.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.560
Yeah.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.040
You know, I really do like that sort of.

07:02.040 --> 07:07.320
You got to work out what new routines and there's whole different sections of the city.

07:07.320 --> 07:12.200
And there's something, I mean, I think about it more on the trail maybe, but it definitely

07:12.200 --> 07:17.360
applies in cities of that when you don't really know what's around the bend and all the like,

07:17.360 --> 07:18.360
it might be terrible, right?

07:18.360 --> 07:21.360
It might just be like a dump that's around the bend and you don't know until you walk

07:21.360 --> 07:22.360
around it.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.360
And that's a lot of the fun.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.080
But you also get all the enjoyment of before you know, all the things you imagine might

07:28.080 --> 07:29.840
be around the bend.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.540
And that's just fun as you continue finding more bends and you know, whatever eventually

07:33.540 --> 07:35.440
map out a new area.

07:35.440 --> 07:39.580
What you're describing also makes me think that you could be describing sort of a learning

07:39.580 --> 07:43.840
journey through, I don't know, some Linux or whatever, right?

07:43.840 --> 07:50.840
Almost any learning journey is if you're excited about what's around the bend or excited enough,

07:50.840 --> 07:54.780
it might take you around the bend and then you're onto a whole other adventure.

07:54.780 --> 07:59.500
That's one thing I like about living in a slightly larger city, living in Seattle, it's

07:59.500 --> 08:03.560
just that, I mean, I haven't been there that long, really.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.720
But there's still tons of places, you know, I mean, neighborhoods, I think I've probably

08:06.720 --> 08:10.720
been to all of them, at least in passing, but it doesn't mean I know anything about

08:10.720 --> 08:11.720
them.

08:11.720 --> 08:16.680
There's a gentleman I saw, it's actually a film that I watched on the way here.

08:16.680 --> 08:25.220
So perfect setup is it was a film that I shared with cheese about a gentleman who decided

08:25.220 --> 08:33.520
to walk every single street in New York, in every, I think he said the five boroughs.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.800
Now, I don't quite know New York that well.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.720
Right, some big subset.

08:37.720 --> 08:38.720
That's it.

08:38.720 --> 08:44.960
And so he decided to do this because he realized much like you that you can go to each neighborhood,

08:44.960 --> 08:48.880
but you kind of have these loop patterns that you follow.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.840
And you may live in a neighborhood, but only go down maybe, you know, 20% of those streets

08:52.840 --> 08:56.760
in your daily routine, right, because of course, we all have routines and that kind of stuff.

08:56.760 --> 09:00.480
So it's the way that I walk, yeah, partly because it's Seattle, and that's the flat

09:00.480 --> 09:05.740
white, but well, path of least resistance, right, right.

09:05.740 --> 09:10.440
But what was fascinating to me about that is, is how there could be a street one street

09:10.440 --> 09:16.160
over that, even though there's proximity, you just never spend any time on it.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.600
Yes, right.

09:17.600 --> 09:23.080
And so forcing yourself into adventure is, I think, a really good tool to open your eyes

09:23.080 --> 09:25.840
to some new ideas, even.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.560
It's funny, too, like you, you have to keep the mindset.

09:28.560 --> 09:33.300
I mean, so like, even just during this, this sprint, I discovered a nice little New Mexican

09:33.300 --> 09:37.200
joint right by the hotel where people were staying up, I've been to the grocery store

09:37.200 --> 09:41.640
in that same region, but I never even considered, you know, it was always either to or from

09:41.640 --> 09:46.120
the studio, I had a mission, I had a job to do, I never thought about just meandering

09:46.120 --> 09:48.880
around looking for goodies.

09:48.880 --> 09:49.920
And it pays off.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.380
It does pay off.

09:51.380 --> 09:54.840
The Mexican was pretty great, you, you grabbed it, and it was great.

09:54.840 --> 09:59.760
Tell me a little bit about how you do that adventuring journey through learning, because

09:59.760 --> 10:06.200
I know you are huge fan of learning new things, and you're, you seem to be okay with deep

10:06.200 --> 10:11.000
dives and just like, collecting knowledge, if you will.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.360
That's an interesting question.

10:12.360 --> 10:17.920
I mean, I probably should know more about how those processes work.

10:17.920 --> 10:22.960
Just in the conversation earlier, we kind of hit on something, something you said, think

10:22.960 --> 10:29.200
about thinking in systems that I think definitely applies to me.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.720
It's sometimes frustrating when you're learning something new, and you know how much there

10:32.720 --> 10:36.840
is to learn, and you know how much you don't know, but you don't know what the most efficient

10:36.840 --> 10:38.480
routes are going to be, right?

10:38.480 --> 10:42.560
And you don't, you don't yet have the systems, and I really struggle more than I think that

10:42.560 --> 10:46.640
I should sometimes to be like, well, I know I could just like follow that tutorial, and

10:46.640 --> 10:50.960
I could go like run the commands, but I'm going to be fighting myself the whole way

10:50.960 --> 10:54.560
through because each step, I'm going to want to go dig and dive around that.

10:54.560 --> 10:58.840
It won't get me near to the goal of what I'm trying to accomplish, but I really want to

10:58.840 --> 11:03.600
know all the theory as or before I'm like trying to do the practice, and that does not

11:03.600 --> 11:04.600
always work out well.

11:04.600 --> 11:08.760
Well, it doesn't work out well in the sense that it's time consuming, and also you might

11:08.760 --> 11:12.160
not have a good idea of where to head to get that knowledge.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.160
Yes.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.160
Right.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.160
Yeah, you're right.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.560
I mean, I would say generally the outcomes are good, it's just not always the most efficient

11:17.560 --> 11:19.040
for the task at hand.

11:19.040 --> 11:26.120
I do think the flip side of that is I'm going to put that much time into something, do generally

11:26.120 --> 11:31.560
learn it very well because I do focus so much on the systems and theory side that, you know,

11:31.560 --> 11:34.840
once you do have the practice, which you need, you can combine those very effectively.

11:34.840 --> 11:45.320
Yeah, you build like these really robust models that if you dedicate to that particular sphere,

11:45.320 --> 11:49.460
and it turns out to be a useful one for you long term, then you've got this amazing base

11:49.460 --> 11:51.680
to work off of.

11:51.680 --> 11:56.040
What I've sometimes run into is not catching myself soon enough, so I'll do these deep

11:56.040 --> 12:01.160
dives and build these really great systems for things I then decide are obsolete or not

12:01.160 --> 12:03.160
actually solving the problems I'm trying to solve, right.

12:03.160 --> 12:07.400
And it's hard to, you know, if you like what you're learning, if you're curious and you're

12:07.400 --> 12:12.440
having fun playing with it, it is really, it takes a lot of willpower sometimes to be

12:12.440 --> 12:17.080
like, no brain, this is not the track you need to be on right now, like go try this

12:17.080 --> 12:18.960
other boring thing that will probably work.

12:18.960 --> 12:24.840
A new rule I tried to implement for myself recently is to try to not learn something

12:24.840 --> 12:32.200
I'm not going to use immediately, which is easy to state and harder to implement.

12:32.200 --> 12:39.460
But for me, learning is such a driver for some of my sort of mental processes.

12:39.460 --> 12:40.720
What do you mean?

12:40.720 --> 12:46.120
In that if I get curious, then I'll want to dive in immediately.

12:46.120 --> 12:51.000
And every new piece of information makes me even more curious.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.240
So sort of compound.

12:52.240 --> 12:56.840
Yeah, which is, which is great, because I think a lifelong learning journey is sort

12:56.840 --> 12:59.160
of very useful.

12:59.160 --> 13:04.360
However, learning itself can be a sort of procrastination.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.360
Oh, yeah.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.360
Right.

13:06.360 --> 13:12.280
And so I can learn lots and be fascinated and very entertained by my learning.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.600
But it may not necessarily be relevant.

13:14.600 --> 13:21.240
You know so much about the Baroque period, I see that you've got it, you've got it.

13:21.240 --> 13:27.360
So how about for you developing models about learning things that you aren't jazzed about?

13:27.360 --> 13:32.920
Because sometimes we need to learn stuff that doesn't necessarily excite us to reach a goal

13:32.920 --> 13:33.920
that does.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.600
Yeah, that's true.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.600
That is true.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.240
You know, I could probably be better at that.

13:39.240 --> 13:43.960
Oftentimes, I've ended up dealing with that either by making it so that I don't have,

13:43.960 --> 13:48.840
you know, whatever my rule or the task at hand is changing so that I can get by with

13:48.840 --> 13:54.060
learning it in a shallow way and not committing myself, or working with people who are better

13:54.060 --> 13:56.720
at not over diving and having them do that part.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.360
So I've had some of the best collaborators I've had have been kind of in like a little

13:59.360 --> 14:00.360
more on the practical side.

14:00.360 --> 14:04.120
I mean, like, okay, Wes, like, you can do a lot of the like, you know, ideating on thinking

14:04.120 --> 14:08.840
and explore random paths and kind of find interesting things that we might want.

14:08.840 --> 14:12.840
And then I'll handle some more of the like, well, I'll test each of these things or you

14:12.840 --> 14:16.740
know, or like, just sort of the boring parts that make it all work, which I can certainly

14:16.740 --> 14:17.740
do as well.

14:17.740 --> 14:22.520
But I've encountered another class of individual who they don't care to this level, they just

14:22.520 --> 14:24.840
don't obsess about it in the same way that we're talking about.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.800
And I find that really nice to work with.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.800
Because they're complimenting.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.800
Right?

14:29.800 --> 14:30.800
Yeah.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.800
They can be like, well, yeah, whatever.

14:31.800 --> 14:35.360
I just like, read the docs and found the little piece that I needed and left it at that.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.360
And then left it.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.360
Yeah.

14:37.360 --> 14:38.360
And I'm like, okay, that's great.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.360
How can you do that?

14:39.360 --> 14:41.600
And then I stopped asking because I'm like, well, the whole point of this is I'm not going

14:41.600 --> 14:43.440
to ask.

14:43.440 --> 14:49.320
Could you then describe yourself as the really good support role in that sense?

14:49.320 --> 14:53.460
That if you have someone driving sort of the direction, then you can do the deep dives

14:53.460 --> 14:55.840
in the areas that are really obviously helpful?

14:55.840 --> 14:56.840
Yeah, kind of.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.640
It can be either side, I suppose.

14:59.640 --> 15:05.320
And it depends on, I guess, how interested I am in the overall because I can write if

15:05.320 --> 15:08.960
it's going to be something that I don't, if I don't have the vision for the overall whatever

15:08.960 --> 15:12.880
task project, right, then I am totally happy to be like, well, whatever, I'll take the

15:12.880 --> 15:18.080
corner that I'm interested in and learn that to the best of my ability.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.380
If I care about it a lot, then I have a more difficult role.

15:21.380 --> 15:25.760
If I really am interested in care, then I have a struggle to not be one, not necessarily

15:25.760 --> 15:30.560
in charge, but at least, let's say, consulted about major decisions that affect that.

15:30.560 --> 15:31.560
Yeah, fair enough.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.280
So it's not, there's not a lot in the middle, I guess.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.320
Interesting.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.880
It's so good to know, though, how you function, right?

15:38.880 --> 15:43.040
I think if, what a gift it would be if we all came with our own instruction manuals.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.840
Oh, man, that would be nice.

15:44.840 --> 15:51.120
It seems like most of our roles is simply to figure out how we function.

15:51.120 --> 15:54.280
Maybe you have really good people around you who are able to give you some feedback, but

15:54.280 --> 15:56.720
most of the time, that doesn't seem to be the case.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.840
Yeah, that's the real gift in some mentors, right?

15:59.840 --> 16:08.280
Some of the best mentors can see your best and your worst and use both of those as tools.

16:08.280 --> 16:12.160
Were there any mentors that did that for you or helped you learn more about yourself?

16:12.160 --> 16:13.640
Hmm, that's a good question.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.560
I mean, surely, yes, there are.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.800
I've stumped Wes.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.800
You're hearing it for here first.

16:18.800 --> 16:19.800
Yeah, you are.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.080
I might have to think about that one a little bit.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.080
Yeah, sure.

16:23.080 --> 16:28.320
I'd like to give a meaningful answer and I would need more reflection, I think.

16:28.320 --> 16:32.160
I was curious about something sort of related.

16:32.160 --> 16:36.040
I'm wondering if you were also afflicted sometimes, you're talking about not learning stuff.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.040
Trying.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.800
Trying, yeah.

16:38.800 --> 16:44.200
I sometimes find that difficult, too, where there's subjects that I am interested in and

16:44.200 --> 16:48.120
would like to know more about, but either worry I would spend too much time doing or

16:48.120 --> 16:54.520
just know what it would take to do it well and just doesn't seem, you know, it's like,

16:54.520 --> 17:00.240
so while I could probably dabble, I don't, and I'm wondering if that's maybe a net detriment

17:00.240 --> 17:01.240
to me.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.560
Like, there's probably areas that I could enjoy doing a little bit, but I don't let

17:04.560 --> 17:07.000
myself do because I think I should do them more.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.280
Is it linked to perfectionism in any way?

17:10.280 --> 17:12.000
Yeah, maybe.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
And do you find that to be a problem?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
I do have a little streak of that from time to time.

17:15.000 --> 17:22.960
Yeah, I would say actually that that has been both a real guide for me and a real detriment

17:22.960 --> 17:30.060
to me in the sense that a lesson I've learned recently that's very helpful is the B plus

17:30.060 --> 17:38.040
is generally my B plus, my self evaluation of a B plus generally is really good for most

17:38.040 --> 17:39.040
other people.

17:39.040 --> 17:44.160
And I'm not trying to put myself on some kind of pedestal, but having this, like, deeply

17:44.160 --> 17:51.400
set perfectionism can get me really caught up in trying to solve things that just don't

17:51.400 --> 17:52.400
matter for anybody else.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.400
Yeah, right.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.360
And it's hard to replace that in whatever activity, right?

17:56.360 --> 18:00.360
Like, if you don't really care about it, that won't be as good or the flip side, like you're

18:00.360 --> 18:03.920
saying that if you do really care about it, then you probably end up wasting some time

18:03.920 --> 18:08.120
on details that don't matter, but you also catch a lot of details that other people might

18:08.120 --> 18:09.120
miss.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.120
Yeah.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.840
For you, you describe not wanting to dabble in a specific project.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.560
Is there something that comes to mind for that?

18:14.560 --> 18:18.440
I've thought about doing more rock climbing, which is something I enjoy, but and have many

18:18.440 --> 18:23.880
friends who enjoy, but I have not dove in to any serious degree.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.720
That probably also applies to music.

18:26.720 --> 18:27.720
Right because you...

18:27.720 --> 18:32.840
I did music a lot in my youth, but I mean, I do a little music here and there now, but

18:32.840 --> 18:34.120
not really anything.

18:34.120 --> 18:37.720
Yeah, I know that you have a little bit of brass in you, right?

18:37.720 --> 18:39.800
Yeah, I played French horn and trumpet for...

18:39.800 --> 18:42.560
I was gonna say flugelhorn, but I knew that was wrong.

18:42.560 --> 18:43.560
Right.

18:43.560 --> 18:47.080
I did, in marching band, play the mellophone, which is...

18:47.080 --> 18:48.480
I don't know what this is.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.640
It's like a marching version of the French horn.

18:51.640 --> 18:52.640
Okay.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.640
Yeah.

18:53.640 --> 18:58.520
It has a different sound, but it still has that interesting sort of, not quite muted,

18:58.520 --> 19:03.560
but more mellow tone that you think of with the French horn.

19:03.560 --> 19:07.840
But instead of having the rotary valves of a French horn, it had valves like a trumpet

19:07.840 --> 19:08.840
does.

19:08.840 --> 19:09.840
Interesting.

19:09.840 --> 19:10.840
Yeah.

19:10.840 --> 19:11.840
It was fun to play.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.080
I'd never heard of it either, but it was a lot of fun, and it was kind of nice as like

19:14.080 --> 19:19.400
a big trumpet, but with just like a giant bell on the end, but still about the same

19:19.400 --> 19:22.840
holding size, and a lot of the fingerings were the same, so it was really easy to just

19:22.840 --> 19:26.080
pick up and play, and you could make a whole bunch of noise, which is really the best part

19:26.080 --> 19:27.680
about marching band.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.520
You just go out there and just make a bunch of noise.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.520
You're the loudest one, yeah, right.

19:33.520 --> 19:37.640
And so how do you perceive the link between music and math?

19:37.640 --> 19:41.080
Because I know you have a huge interest in math as well, and I've heard often that those

19:41.080 --> 19:44.160
two kind of go together, even though they don't seem that they should.

19:44.160 --> 19:54.000
Well, I mean, there's a lot of rhythms and periodicity in music, obviously, but in a

19:54.000 --> 19:59.800
more fundamental level, sort of belaying all the surface level details, there do seem to

19:59.800 --> 20:03.600
be some similar just sort of like ways about thinking, or maybe it's not even that they

20:03.600 --> 20:11.320
have to be similar, but some of the patterns or styles of creativity needed for music can

20:11.320 --> 20:15.840
apply well to math or tech-related things.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.720
Because I think, you know, obviously people see music as creative, even when it, and it

20:19.720 --> 20:26.340
is, but miss the side of being wrote and played back and recited, right?

20:26.340 --> 20:33.760
And then see that side to math or computing or whatever, and miss the more creative side,

20:33.760 --> 20:37.260
but often those are the more important role.

20:37.260 --> 20:43.600
It's interesting that you brought in tech there because that's often an area that is

20:43.600 --> 20:45.520
not necessarily seen as creative.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.680
Yeah, yeah, that's absolutely true.

20:47.680 --> 20:54.360
And yet with anyone who's doing some pretty deep problem solving in tech, it's a necessary,

20:54.360 --> 20:55.360
right?

20:55.360 --> 21:00.320
Yeah, I mean, there is a lot of value in being a practitioner and being a good, reliable,

21:00.320 --> 21:06.040
repeatable practitioner, but most of the things that end up, you know, at least at the upper

21:06.040 --> 21:09.260
echelons or the more interesting work is you're kind of at the edge.

21:09.260 --> 21:10.960
No one's done that specific thing.

21:10.960 --> 21:15.280
There's no pattern, or there might be some, you know, there are some patterns, but you're

21:15.280 --> 21:19.200
making that specific bespoke thing.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.200
It's a craft.

21:20.200 --> 21:23.320
It's up to you to combine all of the toolboxes you've gathered.

21:23.320 --> 21:28.560
And that's where like really caring about it matters, or I like to think so.

21:28.560 --> 21:32.560
You can totally not, you can just, you know, you can cookie cutter, you can work on some

21:32.560 --> 21:33.920
of the less interesting stuff.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.420
You can just apply techniques that you've learned and move on and solve the problem.

21:37.420 --> 21:41.280
And that's the right thing to do in many cases.

21:41.280 --> 21:45.280
I just can't, I can't operate that way, you know, like, if I'm not gonna really care about

21:45.280 --> 21:50.160
what it is that I'm doing, or like, at least be really interested in some aspects of it

21:50.160 --> 21:53.500
and think about it a lot, wouldn't want to do it.

21:53.500 --> 21:57.280
Since we're talking about mental models, I've built this model in my mind that there's a

21:57.280 --> 22:01.880
range between on one end, there's the technician.

22:01.880 --> 22:06.240
And on the other end, there's the artist or the creative.

22:06.240 --> 22:11.320
And while you can be on either end, there's often this scale.

22:11.320 --> 22:17.000
And that's, for me, easy to see in my own photography is that there are very artistic

22:17.000 --> 22:22.360
photographers who aren't necessarily technically sound, but if they can get to the point where

22:22.360 --> 22:27.520
their technical ability is enough, good enough, they can get the shot that they can get the

22:27.520 --> 22:33.120
artistry through, then that has a certain positive impact.

22:33.120 --> 22:39.520
And you can have technicians, which are really, they're fabulous at the nitty gritty of settings

22:39.520 --> 22:42.400
and, and lighting and things like this.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.600
But they don't necessarily have the artistry.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.880
And there's obviously the whole scale, everything in between there.

22:47.880 --> 22:52.520
Yeah, and I imagine that's much the same for what we were just discussing, which is that

22:52.520 --> 23:00.240
you can have very technical implementers of solutions in tech, and also the artists who

23:00.240 --> 23:06.480
tend to craft the initial projects or the initial solutions, and then someone else maintains

23:06.480 --> 23:07.480
it.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.480
Yes.

23:08.480 --> 23:09.480
Yeah, exactly.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.760
And maybe you can throw like the like research arm somewhere in here.

23:11.760 --> 23:17.080
So you have some ideas spinning out of this idea factory, and then there's like the middle

23:17.080 --> 23:20.960
layer of people that can find good ideas, maybe they don't come up with them out of

23:20.960 --> 23:26.380
whole cloth, but sort of steward, shepherd them, help them grow, evaluate them.

23:26.380 --> 23:30.100
And then maybe there's another few layers of people that you say, yeah, actually go

23:30.100 --> 23:34.840
operate the thing, you know, turn that into a repeatable pattern that gets standardized.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.760
Because there is a lot of value in that, right?

23:36.760 --> 23:40.840
Like you're saying, like you want people that are focused on repeatability and reliability

23:40.840 --> 23:42.720
and just smooth running.

23:42.720 --> 23:46.600
Yeah, I can play that role, but it's probably not my favorite.

23:46.600 --> 23:52.240
But for you, is it more interesting than to, to come in and build something and then hand

23:52.240 --> 23:53.240
that off to someone?

23:53.240 --> 23:57.920
Somewhere in the middle, I guess, I mean, I enjoy a lot of the different aspects.

23:57.920 --> 24:03.440
It can be neat, when you do a little bit of all the flip side.

24:03.440 --> 24:08.240
Challenge of that, of course, is you don't often get to control how what the relative

24:08.240 --> 24:11.840
amounts of each unit of those are fair enough.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.320
Yeah, kind of depends.

24:14.320 --> 24:21.000
But I don't, I don't think I could be happy long term in probably stuck on either extreme

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
of those, you know?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Too much of anything.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Yeah.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.360
And I think you also need some people, good people in the middle who can talk to both

24:26.360 --> 24:27.600
sides.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.960
Because there's a lot to learn.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.280
And that's been some of the problems, at least in the software side, we've seen that we're

24:31.280 --> 24:35.840
trying to get over as an industry is not having enough feedback between the people making

24:35.840 --> 24:38.160
the ideas and people actually using the ideas.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.160
Isn't that true?

24:39.160 --> 24:40.160
Yeah, for sure.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.160
We're seeing that on the desktop.

24:41.160 --> 24:44.440
And for you, you've seen that in a lot of the infrastructure that you've built throughout

24:44.440 --> 24:45.440
the years as well.

24:45.440 --> 24:50.000
And you just end up with, you know, perverse patterns, not good communication, angry people,

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
right?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Because you can make it work in lots of ways.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.960
You just need information and communication to flow.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.960
Right.

24:55.960 --> 24:59.440
You know, they say that for relationships, but I suppose that's true of most things is

24:59.440 --> 25:01.880
that communication is is key, right?

25:01.880 --> 25:06.040
If you're if you're working on the wrong problem, then it doesn't matter how fancy the solution

25:06.040 --> 25:07.040
you come up with.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.040
Right.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.680
And you have to constantly evaluate that because as we were talking about earlier, you know,

25:10.680 --> 25:15.640
like, yeah, there's these, there's inertia to some of these ideas to what you want to

25:15.640 --> 25:17.560
work on and what you are working on.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.560
Important to manage that.

25:19.560 --> 25:20.560
Yeah.

25:20.560 --> 25:26.680
For you and some of your previous roles outside of JB, were you working with really big teams

25:26.680 --> 25:31.840
and is moving to JB like a much smaller team or are you generally generally working in

25:31.840 --> 25:32.840
small groups?

25:32.840 --> 25:38.440
I have been part of some larger teams, although most of my previous experience have been about

25:38.440 --> 25:40.560
the JB size, maybe a little bit bigger.

25:40.560 --> 25:46.460
Really embedded in a larger sort of corporate structure, I'd say, or working with a larger

25:46.460 --> 25:49.320
array of other teams that I would work with closely.

25:49.320 --> 25:53.960
I've also been on the opposite side where I've had, you know, one of my longer term

25:53.960 --> 25:55.840
positions.

25:55.840 --> 25:59.800
I was just working basically with one other person most of the time.

25:59.800 --> 26:00.800
Right.

26:00.800 --> 26:01.800
Thankfully, I really enjoyed working with.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.840
Yeah, I was just about thinking that change that can change things.

26:04.840 --> 26:05.840
Yeah.

26:05.840 --> 26:10.120
That's kind of what we're talking about earlier is he really complimented me in that he was

26:10.120 --> 26:14.400
he was very practical, very much happy to just, you know, didn't didn't fuss was totally

26:14.400 --> 26:17.840
willing to just bang something out and not be a perfectionist about it at all.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.800
So we made a very effective pair, I think.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.360
And this was someone who was like, side by side on the hierarchy?

26:22.360 --> 26:23.360
Yeah, yeah.

26:23.360 --> 26:28.200
We were basically a two person team managing a bunch of internal tooling for a company.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.200
Okay.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.600
And was it someone who had the foresight to place both of you together because they saw

26:32.600 --> 26:35.960
the strengths and weaknesses of each or was it just happenstance?

26:35.960 --> 26:41.160
You know, it was organic survival, I think.

26:41.160 --> 26:44.400
You know, because we just kind of found he he did happen to be the person who trained

26:44.400 --> 26:45.400
me.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.400
Okay.

26:46.400 --> 26:49.160
But we worked different times after the training period.

26:49.160 --> 26:53.040
I think it just kind of came together that we both had a, you know, drive to do other

26:53.040 --> 26:54.040
things.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.400
So we wanted to move in from where we were at presently.

26:56.400 --> 27:02.200
And I think I value that he was very competent, you know, just like knew what was wrong, or

27:02.200 --> 27:07.640
if he was writing code that was sloppy, it was managed expectations with clear communication,

27:07.640 --> 27:09.360
like, look, I just did this thing.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.360
It's not perfect, whatever.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.600
Like, I did it to solve this problem.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.600
It's solved.

27:12.600 --> 27:13.600
Do you have input?

27:13.600 --> 27:14.920
And then move on.

27:14.920 --> 27:18.360
And then I think he liked in me that I was willing to spend a little more time with the

27:18.360 --> 27:24.480
ideas that that made sense to and would find, you know, optimizations or other ideas or

27:24.480 --> 27:27.360
total alternatives that he just wouldn't have spent the time to think about.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.360
Right.

27:28.360 --> 27:33.480
So he was more willing to invest in the projects to see them be smoother long term.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.480
So he would call it West work.

27:34.480 --> 27:38.440
You know, there'd be like, shares of stuff where it's like, oh, man, like, I don't know,

27:38.440 --> 27:39.440
like, you deal with that.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.320
And then there'd be the other share, we'd be like, well, that's West work.

27:41.320 --> 27:44.920
And you go research those topics and come back to me with what you think we should do.

27:44.920 --> 27:45.920
That's awesome.

27:45.920 --> 27:51.000
And there were no clashes during the training, because I have often experienced that when

27:51.000 --> 27:53.880
you're teaching someone something, you can have all these different styles.

27:53.880 --> 27:57.400
And I imagine for two people who sort of operate differently in their minds, that there would

27:57.400 --> 27:59.000
be a difference in style.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.680
Yeah, that is true that it can often be very difficult.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.680
Not that I remember.

28:03.680 --> 28:10.680
No, I think I think this individual in particular happens to be very direct.

28:10.680 --> 28:16.640
I think I think that helped and doesn't be I think because of the personality we're describing,

28:16.640 --> 28:20.000
doesn't have a lot of ego tied up in that knowledge.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.120
I mean, if you question his performance or something he was proud of, you know, whatever

28:23.120 --> 28:27.800
normal human operations there, but, you know, it didn't have to be this battle of like,

28:27.800 --> 28:28.800
well, do you know this or not?

28:28.800 --> 28:33.520
And there's no like, right, passive aggressiveness about what you knew or didn't knew.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.560
And yeah, just no, no games.

28:35.560 --> 28:36.560
Sounds like a great collaboration.

28:36.560 --> 28:37.560
Really?

28:37.560 --> 28:38.560
Yeah, it was it was right.

28:38.560 --> 28:41.400
It was time to move on from that job when I did, but that was the hardest part was there's

28:41.400 --> 28:45.800
just never worked with someone so closely because I don't like in school and things

28:45.800 --> 28:49.480
I enjoy collaboration I do and I mean, I suppose I'd have to work in here now.

28:49.480 --> 28:50.780
Fair enough.

28:50.780 --> 28:52.680
Sometimes you know what you're doing.

28:52.680 --> 28:53.680
I love teaching.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.680
Don't get me wrong.

28:54.680 --> 28:55.680
But sometimes you know what you're doing.

28:55.680 --> 29:02.000
I don't always enjoy the rocky road, like I don't mind check ins, you know.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.200
So like, I played around some ideas, come back after a couple hours, meet, discuss where

29:06.200 --> 29:11.200
everyone got but I really found I didn't enjoy more active collaboration, at least in some

29:11.200 --> 29:15.800
domains where I just wanted to be left alone and think and just do it by myself.

29:15.800 --> 29:20.000
So I would often find myself in roles of like on projects, I would just make myself the

29:20.000 --> 29:23.280
editor or whatever, you know, be like, right, you guys go do your things.

29:23.280 --> 29:26.320
I'll tie this up together and make it look nice at the end.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.560
Would you tie that into introvertedness for you?

29:28.560 --> 29:29.560
Hmm.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.800
That's a good question.

29:30.800 --> 29:36.080
You know, I read this really great book called Quiet, which the it's a very well known book

29:36.080 --> 29:38.760
and I forget the author now it's Susan Kane.

29:38.760 --> 29:39.760
Okay.

29:39.760 --> 29:44.720
This was a book that was recommended to me and when I read it, it taught me so much about

29:44.720 --> 29:46.720
my own inner workings.

29:46.720 --> 29:47.720
Oh, interesting.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.840
It's one of those books that enlighten you about yourself.

29:50.840 --> 29:51.840
That's useful.

29:51.840 --> 29:52.840
Which are some of my favorite books.

29:52.840 --> 29:53.840
Yeah.

29:53.840 --> 29:59.640
But it did so in a way that made me more aware of the methods I needed to use in teamwork

29:59.640 --> 30:04.080
to produce the best work because I know for myself if I'm constantly interrupted, or if

30:04.080 --> 30:09.300
I don't have the time to hyper focus, which takes me a long time to get into, then I can

30:09.300 --> 30:12.080
never create my best work.

30:12.080 --> 30:16.800
And it sounds at least I see similarities for you, even when you have a really good

30:16.800 --> 30:18.720
collaborations even with just one person.

30:18.720 --> 30:19.720
Yes.

30:19.720 --> 30:20.720
No, absolutely.

30:20.720 --> 30:24.560
Like, I guess I guess I get tired of sort of like, should we explore this idea or not

30:24.560 --> 30:27.360
and people have different notions.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.160
I don't I don't want to talk about it.

30:29.160 --> 30:32.840
We can talk about if it's right or not, but I'm just gonna explore the ideas I want to

30:32.840 --> 30:33.840
explore.

30:33.840 --> 30:34.840
Yeah.

30:34.840 --> 30:35.840
And it seems to work mostly.

30:35.840 --> 30:40.240
I mean, I find it honestly, I find it very different that the at least in that style,

30:40.240 --> 30:44.000
maybe it's just maybe it's age, maybe it's different subject matter, because a lot of

30:44.000 --> 30:49.520
those interactions around math and physics and a little more not not creative, but a

30:49.520 --> 30:54.560
little a little more right and wrong binary sort of things.

30:54.560 --> 30:59.360
I don't I don't have that experience really at all, I would say working JB at that may

30:59.360 --> 31:01.000
also be the people involved.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
There's a lot of variables.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Interesting.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.320
I hadn't thought about it that way.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.320
I do.

31:06.320 --> 31:07.320
I do agree with you, though.

31:07.320 --> 31:13.000
I find myself in the same boat, I do need time to think and while I can operate under

31:13.000 --> 31:17.240
pressure, you're right, I wouldn't do my best work that way, you know, it'd be much better

31:17.240 --> 31:21.360
to just go like, give me 20 minutes, I'm gonna go over here in the closet, and then I'll

31:21.360 --> 31:23.820
come back out and then we'll have your thing that you need.

31:23.820 --> 31:25.880
That sounds so familiar, right?

31:25.880 --> 31:30.560
I'm very impressed by people that can operate in other styles, you know, some, even some

31:30.560 --> 31:36.560
of our team members at JB, it's like, doing all number of tasks at the same time and multiplexing

31:36.560 --> 31:38.840
and I just doesn't make sense to me.

31:38.840 --> 31:43.160
Yeah, some of us can require pressure to perform.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.160
Yeah, that's true.

31:44.160 --> 31:50.160
It is, I found for myself that it is true that same as you, it's true that I can perform

31:50.160 --> 31:52.880
under pressure and quite well when I need to.

31:52.880 --> 31:56.400
But the level of exhaustion is quite high.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.540
So I can do that for a short period of time, right before you just burn out.

31:59.540 --> 32:00.540
That's it.

32:00.540 --> 32:06.960
Or, like you said, if you give me 20 minutes with headphones away from the world, and then

32:06.960 --> 32:09.200
I'll get it done faster.

32:09.200 --> 32:12.400
Nothing like being watched while you work too, you know, just makes it, everything goes

32:12.400 --> 32:13.400
slower.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.400
Someone over your shoulder, right?

32:14.400 --> 32:18.960
Depends on what you're doing, of course, and how well you know it, but there is probably

32:18.960 --> 32:22.240
an aspect to what you're asking, like with the introverted sense, probably some of that,

32:22.240 --> 32:31.480
at least is maybe not introvertedness, but not desiring excess conflict.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.960
I don't think I'm conflict averse necessarily.

32:33.960 --> 32:37.760
But like in that example, I just would get tired of like, I don't want to argue about

32:37.760 --> 32:38.760
this right now.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.760
You know, like, it's just not worth my time to debate this.

32:40.760 --> 32:45.560
Well, and I've picked up on you being quite agreeable as well.

32:45.560 --> 32:49.360
I suppose that's the flip side of saying that.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.360
Yeah.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.360
Right.

32:51.360 --> 32:54.720
So you can, which is a gift, because everybody likes you.

32:54.720 --> 32:59.200
And it can also be a bit of a challenge in that other people's ideas sometimes trump

32:59.200 --> 33:01.360
your own even in your own mind.

33:01.360 --> 33:04.600
I say that from personal experience, because I'm just I'm quite agreeable as well.

33:04.600 --> 33:09.320
And sometimes you put your own ideas on the back burner simply because someone else is

33:09.320 --> 33:11.000
willing to fight stronger for theirs.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Yeah, that is true.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Yeah.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.880
You know, there's a, the fight costs me more than it does to them.

33:16.880 --> 33:19.640
So I have to care more about the idea to make it worth it.

33:19.640 --> 33:20.640
Ah, that's fascinating.

33:20.640 --> 33:21.640
I like that.

33:21.640 --> 33:25.480
This compatriot that I really enjoyed work with, he complimented me there as well.

33:25.480 --> 33:28.680
He's happy to argue about anything just to just to argue about it.

33:28.680 --> 33:29.680
Okay.

33:29.680 --> 33:30.920
So that worked out nicely, too.

33:30.920 --> 33:32.840
Because you just give up sooner and he'd win.

33:32.840 --> 33:33.840
Right.

33:33.840 --> 33:34.840
Well, and I could just let him fight the battle.

33:34.840 --> 33:37.840
You know, I could back him up with with whatever research and as a team.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.280
Oh, that's fascinating.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.000
But he was willing to push a little bit more.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.920
And then I mean, if he's gonna do it, then I'm gonna support it.

33:43.920 --> 33:44.920
Yeah, of course.

33:44.920 --> 33:45.920
It's easy to support.

33:45.920 --> 33:46.920
It's easy to support.

33:46.920 --> 33:47.920
Yeah.

33:47.920 --> 33:48.920
Nice.

33:48.920 --> 33:52.600
So you're saying I just need to find myself someone who's willing to fight my fights?

33:52.600 --> 33:53.600
I think so.

33:53.600 --> 33:54.600
Yeah.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.600
Okay.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.680
Now, if I had them, I'd be willing to rent.

33:56.680 --> 34:01.440
But unfortunately, we no longer work together.

34:01.440 --> 34:02.440
Do you ever?

34:02.440 --> 34:04.520
I don't think we necessarily struggle for this.

34:04.520 --> 34:11.080
But sometimes if you have multiple agreeable people, decisions, they won't agree or won't

34:11.080 --> 34:14.200
be able to there's not enough care in one direction.

34:14.200 --> 34:17.600
Like if I said, Hey, Wes, what kind of pizza would you like to see that I think I could

34:17.600 --> 34:18.600
decide.

34:18.600 --> 34:19.600
Really?

34:19.600 --> 34:20.600
Yeah, it depends, too.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.620
You know, there's, um, there's sort of like an open and a closed agreeability.

34:24.620 --> 34:25.620
That's true.

34:25.620 --> 34:27.840
I don't worry about telling you what kind of pizza I want.

34:27.840 --> 34:32.480
Because I know that if you you're agreeable, but you're also open enough to the interaction

34:32.480 --> 34:36.600
we're having that you would tell me if you if you weren't interested in that pizza.

34:36.600 --> 34:39.640
But there's some types of agreeable, I think that that's not true.

34:39.640 --> 34:42.560
And then I worry more about that.

34:42.560 --> 34:46.600
And then might not want to suggest the thing because I don't you know, it just gets a little

34:46.600 --> 34:47.600
more complicated.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.800
These internal processes are just fascinating.

34:50.800 --> 34:56.840
And once you start picking up on them for yourself, and also for others, you those interactions,

34:56.840 --> 35:00.920
like those non language interactions that happen between two people trying to decide

35:00.920 --> 35:03.960
what kind of pizza to have can be fascinating.

35:03.960 --> 35:04.960
Yes.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.280
It's even harder when I mean, at least we're talking about pizza, I kind of know like what

35:08.280 --> 35:11.160
pizza like, it's even worse when you take it one layer up, like, what do you want to

35:11.160 --> 35:12.160
eat?

35:12.160 --> 35:15.080
Oh, that like one person's hungry, like, what do you want to eat?

35:15.080 --> 35:19.320
One trick I got from Tim Ferriss that really helped me from his book for our workweek was

35:19.320 --> 35:24.520
to, instead of asking, what does everyone want to eat, especially if you're in a group

35:24.520 --> 35:26.560
of like, three people or more, right?

35:26.560 --> 35:30.160
There basically will be no answer, no useful answer given.

35:30.160 --> 35:34.280
Or you won't even you'll just get on to a different topic entirely.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.280
Quickly derail.

35:35.280 --> 35:36.280
Oh, yeah.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.280
Oh, yeah.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.280
We saw we see that all the time.

35:38.280 --> 35:39.280
Right.

35:39.280 --> 35:42.980
But what I've been trying to implement, and I haven't thought about it in a while.

35:42.980 --> 35:48.600
So either I've succeeded or failed, I'm not sure if I is to instead of asking the question,

35:48.600 --> 35:54.440
what would you like to have is to put out a suggestion, right and ask if that works.

35:54.440 --> 36:02.240
And when I have practiced this, I've noticed a big difference in everyone's level of agreeing

36:02.240 --> 36:07.120
to ideas, and the speed at which these ideas can happen.

36:07.120 --> 36:10.040
So in working with in teams, right?

36:10.040 --> 36:14.600
This could save a lot of time, you know, you're coming to it with solutions instead of just

36:14.600 --> 36:15.600
questions.

36:15.600 --> 36:16.600
All of that, I think applies.

36:16.600 --> 36:22.360
I mean, because the thing about this, you know, creative work, it's kind of the same

36:22.360 --> 36:26.240
like the open closed, because it can be really useful to have someone start even if it's

36:26.240 --> 36:30.380
just a terrible idea, right, but just to throw it out there and sort of get the ball rolling.

36:30.380 --> 36:35.240
But that requires enough openness and trust in the group that you can feel confident that

36:35.240 --> 36:37.560
like, that idea doesn't represent you.

36:37.560 --> 36:38.560
It's just a thing.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.960
You're just saying it right here, which is often true for what do you want to eat, but

36:41.960 --> 36:45.520
doesn't always carry over to what should we title the report.

36:45.520 --> 36:49.680
We're both brainstorming in a sense.

36:49.680 --> 36:51.840
And what's interesting is that everyone has a stake, right?

36:51.840 --> 36:57.840
And so some of the I read a really great book that was given to me by my uncle, who is almost

36:57.840 --> 37:00.560
identical to me.

37:00.560 --> 37:01.560
Like I'm a younger

37:01.560 --> 37:02.560
Is his name also Brett?

37:02.560 --> 37:03.560
Can we call him Uncle Brett?

37:03.560 --> 37:04.720
You could his name is actually Ray Allen.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.340
He's a great, great guy.

37:06.340 --> 37:11.960
But he has taught me he has taught me a lot about my own inner workings in that he's kind

37:11.960 --> 37:19.980
of a few decades ahead of me and has all this experience and dilutes that into what is helpful

37:19.980 --> 37:24.120
for me at my own stage of life, which is if you can find someone like that for yourself,

37:24.120 --> 37:25.120
it is fabulous.

37:25.120 --> 37:31.000
Does it work if I like just try to talk to like a face app aged picture of myself?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
You could start there

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
because I'm doing that already.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.700
Gentlemen I'll sneak in here if I can borrow the studio for a moment and tell everyone

37:39.700 --> 37:40.960
about Data Dog.

37:40.960 --> 37:46.180
Let's go solve some problems and analyze code level performance across your entire environment

37:46.180 --> 37:49.480
and troubleshoot issues faster with Data Dog.

37:49.480 --> 37:52.420
datadog.com slash coder radio.

37:52.420 --> 37:54.600
Go there to get a 14 day trial.

37:54.600 --> 37:59.840
And if you set up a dashboard and use that URL, you can also get a free Data Dog t shirt.

37:59.840 --> 38:03.920
Data Dog is continuous profiler automatically collects profiles from your production servers

38:03.920 --> 38:04.920
all the time.

38:04.920 --> 38:08.360
I'm talking the entire stack everyone like the whole dang thing from the metal all the

38:08.360 --> 38:10.040
way up to the applications.

38:10.040 --> 38:14.240
So you can analyze any of that data you need quickly with minimal overhead and you get

38:14.240 --> 38:19.220
a unified picture of your environment by correlating code performance metrics with your other monitoring

38:19.220 --> 38:24.820
data with these beautiful, gorgeous, fantastic, slick real time dashboards.

38:24.820 --> 38:29.800
You should go to datadog.com slash coder radio just to see the dashboards.

38:29.800 --> 38:34.260
But now they have over 450 integrations that allow you to do tracing and log management

38:34.260 --> 38:37.680
and that continuous profiler all in one platform.

38:37.680 --> 38:41.160
I mean, they're actually talking and analyzing your applications too.

38:41.160 --> 38:45.040
Can you imagine how this enables you to visualize and communicate across your team?

38:45.040 --> 38:49.520
Data Dog gives you the tools to pinpoint the root cause of issues faster than ever.

38:49.520 --> 38:54.860
So go try Data Dog's products for free for 14 days by visiting datadog.com slash coder

38:54.860 --> 38:55.860
radio.

38:55.860 --> 39:00.040
And like I said, for a limited time, if you start that free trial and you create one dashboard,

39:00.040 --> 39:07.560
you're going to get a free Data Dog t shirt, free swag, datadog.com slash coder radio.

39:07.560 --> 39:12.520
Back to this book, this book he gave me, which he gave to me like 10 years before I read

39:12.520 --> 39:13.520
it.

39:13.520 --> 39:14.520
Oh, right.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.520
Wow.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.260
It was the kind of book you're like, I think that's really interesting and yet not interesting

39:17.260 --> 39:18.320
enough to dive into.

39:18.320 --> 39:19.320
But I finally did.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.700
It's called The Six Thinking Hats.

39:20.700 --> 39:26.460
And it's all about simply, it's a brainstorming technique.

39:26.460 --> 39:30.000
And I'm sure we can link to a Wikipedia page that would describe this a little bit more

39:30.000 --> 39:32.740
sensibly than I would.

39:32.740 --> 39:39.360
But the main nugget I got from it is that brainstorming should be a protected area.

39:39.360 --> 39:45.640
You can do brainstorming with other people in a way that is methodical, and yet still

39:45.640 --> 39:47.200
very creative.

39:47.200 --> 39:52.700
And so the process in this book is basically, there's six hats, and they all represent a

39:52.700 --> 39:53.960
different way of thinking.

39:53.960 --> 39:59.240
And when you're in a hat, everyone's wearing, you know, quote unquote, the hat.

39:59.240 --> 40:01.780
And I forget what they are, but they're fascinating if you want to look into them.

40:01.780 --> 40:09.840
And so one of them might be, like, just throw out any idea at all that fits within creativity,

40:09.840 --> 40:10.840
for instance.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.720
And so obviously, you're gonna have some people on the team who are a little bit stronger

40:13.720 --> 40:14.720
at that stuff.

40:14.720 --> 40:16.480
So that's their time to shine.

40:16.480 --> 40:21.080
And yet when you put on different hats, it relates to some other team members' strengths.

40:21.080 --> 40:24.320
But the most important part for any brainstorming, whether you're trying to decide what kind

40:24.320 --> 40:28.080
of ice cream you want, or what kind of pizza or where to take a certain project is for

40:28.080 --> 40:33.640
it to be, like you said, a protected area where you're not sort of chastised for sending

40:33.640 --> 40:40.780
out what are seemingly bad ideas, but might lead to nuggets that are invaluable.

40:40.780 --> 40:46.240
And it's something I've only recently learned to do well.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.200
But that I see it being kind of a challenge, right?

40:48.200 --> 40:49.200
Oh, that's, yeah, right.

40:49.200 --> 40:53.160
And I don't know that we all think about it as much as we probably should.

40:53.160 --> 40:56.340
It's interesting, too, what you're talking about, too, like how structure can sometimes

40:56.340 --> 40:58.320
provide that.

40:58.320 --> 41:02.320
We all know the rules and like how it's happening.

41:02.320 --> 41:05.620
It's somehow a little bit bizarre to talk about structure and creativity in the same

41:05.620 --> 41:08.120
sentence in a way.

41:08.120 --> 41:12.760
That's another part, I guess, like kind of one of the themes in this whole conversation.

41:12.760 --> 41:17.200
We have these words and notions, but we don't, many people do, good books, right, what we're

41:17.200 --> 41:18.200
talking about.

41:18.200 --> 41:22.640
But generally, we don't necessarily dive into it or try to study or bisect, right?

41:22.640 --> 41:24.080
Like, oh, you're just creative.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.920
Brent, how do you take such good photos?

41:25.920 --> 41:26.920
I have no idea.

41:26.920 --> 41:31.560
I'm not going to conceptualize it, but I mean, there is some element of like, well, you see

41:31.560 --> 41:34.320
photos that you want to take and you take them.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.480
That's over simplification, but I'll take it.

41:36.480 --> 41:42.120
But there's both a lot of structure and a lot of whatever inherent creativity, artistic

41:42.120 --> 41:43.120
sense.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.580
So there's this great website that I'm not sure if you know about.

41:45.580 --> 41:46.580
It's called Brain Pickings.

41:46.580 --> 41:47.580
Tell me more.

41:47.580 --> 41:55.960
I believe the author is Mary Popova, and what she does is dives into a lot of literary work

41:55.960 --> 41:57.800
and extracts nuggets.

41:57.800 --> 42:04.840
And one post I saw that always sticks for me is describing the methods that writers

42:04.840 --> 42:14.120
use and some really historical writers use to begin their writing process on a daily

42:14.120 --> 42:15.120
basis.

42:15.120 --> 42:19.880
So that's the juxtaposition, again, of structure and creativity, right?

42:19.880 --> 42:26.200
They have applied this structure to their day that optimizes their creative time, right?

42:26.200 --> 42:30.520
Which probably doesn't always fit in whatever other random society and post structures.

42:30.520 --> 42:32.040
Yeah, fair enough.

42:32.040 --> 42:36.640
But what's fascinating about that to me is that you really need to know yourself well

42:36.640 --> 42:39.280
to be able to establish that structure in the first place, right?

42:39.280 --> 42:41.440
Yeah, no one's going to tell you how to find it.

42:41.440 --> 42:42.440
Yeah.

42:42.440 --> 42:47.520
And do you have any such routines or, well, you were mentioning earlier when you came

42:47.520 --> 42:50.520
in that the Sprint sort of shook up your routines.

42:50.520 --> 42:51.520
That is certainly true.

42:51.520 --> 42:57.400
You know, just changing, having everyone here and doing all kinds of different things.

42:57.400 --> 43:04.380
I'd say I'm reforming some routines because I had routines for a more traditional type

43:04.380 --> 43:10.800
of role or at least hours, and I have a few things I'm figuring out, I think, that I like,

43:10.800 --> 43:17.640
but I've kind of gone back to a blank slate, at least somewhat, and I've been actively

43:17.640 --> 43:18.640
exploring.

43:18.640 --> 43:24.000
I think I do really like sometimes just starting work immediately in the morning, which is

43:24.000 --> 43:27.080
one advantage of working from home is that you can do that.

43:27.080 --> 43:30.760
You do have to then have the flexibility to then, you know, stop at some point and go

43:30.760 --> 43:32.440
do like regular morning activities.

43:32.440 --> 43:33.440
Right.

43:33.440 --> 43:34.440
Like feeding yourself.

43:34.440 --> 43:37.840
Yeah, feeding yourself, your animals, I don't know, maybe going outside, that sort of thing.

43:37.840 --> 43:38.840
Seeing the world.

43:38.840 --> 43:39.840
Uh-huh.

43:39.840 --> 43:43.800
But there's something about this early morning, I'm not generally a morning person, I really

43:43.800 --> 43:44.800
like the morning.

43:44.800 --> 43:48.160
I'm just bad at going to sleep and enjoy being awake at night.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.040
It just seems to be what I gravitate to.

43:50.040 --> 43:56.480
But I love being up in the morning, so if I can't, but it seems to be the most enjoyable

43:56.480 --> 44:01.000
if I've been up the night before, not super later, but you know, I've been working on

44:01.000 --> 44:04.740
the thing, actively engaged, got a good night's sleep, and then I can just like jump into

44:04.740 --> 44:11.400
it because the early morning hours and then like afternoon are probably my best productivity

44:11.400 --> 44:12.400
times.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.400
Okay.

44:13.400 --> 44:17.560
Do you find that, well, wait a second, I'm going to challenge you there because you mentioned

44:17.560 --> 44:20.160
working late night on something.

44:20.160 --> 44:23.520
I do also, late night can work.

44:23.520 --> 44:24.520
That's a little more variable.

44:24.520 --> 44:26.400
It depends a lot on how the day has gone.

44:26.400 --> 44:32.760
I think it was a better time when my job was more predictable.

44:32.760 --> 44:37.160
These days, it depends a lot on what happens in the day, how many shows we did, you know,

44:37.160 --> 44:38.160
whatever.

44:38.160 --> 44:41.040
And so late night isn't always.

44:41.040 --> 44:46.160
If I have the schedule flexibility, and that depends too, I will sometimes do a hybrid

44:46.160 --> 44:49.820
where I'll just go to bed and then wake up at like two and then work from like two to

44:49.820 --> 44:52.180
five and that also can be very productive.

44:52.180 --> 44:53.180
That's two to five a.m.

44:53.180 --> 44:54.180
Yeah.

44:54.180 --> 44:55.180
Wow.

44:55.180 --> 44:58.000
There's just something about the times when like no one else is up, there's no distractions.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
I've heard this before.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Yeah, for sure.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.520
And two, it is one of the challenges, you know, with like working from home can be dividing

45:05.520 --> 45:09.440
those like, when you're doing life things, when you're doing job things, how do those

45:09.440 --> 45:11.780
mingle and where's the border?

45:11.780 --> 45:12.780
There's not a lot of board.

45:12.780 --> 45:15.200
I mean, like, you can just define what you're doing, you know, it's a chunk of time that

45:15.200 --> 45:17.080
you don't have any conceptions about.

45:17.080 --> 45:20.480
And so you can just assign it to something.

45:20.480 --> 45:23.080
And from two to five, nothing else is going to demand of your time.

45:23.080 --> 45:26.080
No, I don't have no plans.

45:26.080 --> 45:27.080
Thankfully.

45:27.080 --> 45:29.420
Well, the only plan you have is the plan you want.

45:29.420 --> 45:33.120
But I've so I've recently sort of rediscovered that I knew that, like in college, I would

45:33.120 --> 45:36.640
frequently, you know, stay up late working and be like, I'm just like too tired to be

45:36.640 --> 45:40.440
productive, and then have to wake up early to get the assignment done or whatever.

45:40.440 --> 45:44.480
And I think working a more traditional schedule, I kind of forgot about that.

45:44.480 --> 45:47.120
So I'm rediscovering it to an extent.

45:47.120 --> 45:51.840
There's something to be said about working at your best times for you personally.

45:51.840 --> 45:56.120
And sometimes our nine to fives can really challenge that even though they're there in

45:56.120 --> 46:01.760
place to try to make it easier or more productive for the general populace, but what I've discovered

46:01.760 --> 46:06.080
as many for many of us, especially in the tech sphere, this late night stuff or early

46:06.080 --> 46:07.560
morning stuff is more jam.

46:07.560 --> 46:08.560
Mm hmm.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.560
I don't know.

46:09.560 --> 46:13.920
There's something about like, the late morning that's just not a productive Yep.

46:13.920 --> 46:18.120
So it's either I'm going to like sleep in and you know, stroll into work at like 1030.

46:18.120 --> 46:22.680
Or you might as well I just just let me work from like, you know, six to nine or something

46:22.680 --> 46:24.160
then I'll come in in the afternoon.

46:24.160 --> 46:25.160
Right.

46:25.160 --> 46:30.920
Is there anything then that you've not had a work from a distance or work from home flexibility

46:30.920 --> 46:38.920
in any previous I have, but those the hours were still more traditional, and most of them

46:38.920 --> 46:41.800
were not totally remote, it would be like a hybrid sort of thing.

46:41.800 --> 46:42.800
Okay.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.560
So I was still at least in the culture of the office, right?

46:46.560 --> 46:48.880
Just from a slight distance, just from a slight distance.

46:48.880 --> 46:49.880
Yeah, exactly.

46:49.880 --> 46:53.720
And so this is kind of the first opportunity, at least in a while where I can be like, Well,

46:53.720 --> 46:56.400
if I want to get weird with it, I can.

46:56.400 --> 46:57.400
Let's shake it up.

46:57.400 --> 46:58.400
Yeah, right?

46:58.400 --> 46:59.400
Why not?

46:59.400 --> 47:00.400
And I mean, that happens anyway, right?

47:00.400 --> 47:04.280
A lot of the team is on weird schedules, just because we all live in different time zones.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.240
So we're a little bit all over the world, right?

47:06.240 --> 47:07.240
Mm hmm.

47:07.240 --> 47:14.840
I mean, you look at Joe, and I will ask him this a little bit more Joe has basically set

47:14.840 --> 47:18.280
his internal clock to a completely different time zone across the world.

47:18.280 --> 47:21.680
So I'm very fascinated about that.

47:21.680 --> 47:25.520
For you working late night on a project, and then sleeping and waking up.

47:25.520 --> 47:27.440
You mentioned that works really well for you.

47:27.440 --> 47:30.920
Do you find that there's something about the process of sleeping with an idea in your mind

47:30.920 --> 47:31.920
that

47:31.920 --> 47:32.920
Oh, yeah, definitely.

47:32.920 --> 47:36.960
I'm a big proponent of the one of my favorite people, Rich Hickey, who's the guy who made

47:36.960 --> 47:39.720
the Clojure programming language.

47:39.720 --> 47:45.000
He calls it hammock time, but just just really tries to underscore the value of like, thinking,

47:45.000 --> 47:48.420
you know, and turning things over in your mind before doing.

47:48.420 --> 47:49.420
Doing is important to you.

47:49.420 --> 47:50.420
And that's a separate conversation.

47:50.420 --> 47:52.600
So I value that a lot.

47:52.600 --> 47:58.280
I really enjoy, you know, that time when you haven't quite fallen asleep, but you're not

47:58.280 --> 48:03.440
quite you're not 100% rational, you're not you're lucid, but not totally.

48:03.440 --> 48:04.600
I think that is a great time.

48:04.600 --> 48:09.640
So that can be a kind of enjoyment too, you know, just like taking a break, having been

48:09.640 --> 48:13.720
a little more relaxed, just laying not worrying either, maybe you fall asleep, maybe not,

48:13.720 --> 48:14.720
it's okay, either way.

48:14.720 --> 48:18.800
That can be some of the best times you can resolve or just make clear something you're

48:18.800 --> 48:19.800
trying to work out.

48:19.800 --> 48:24.360
Yeah, there's a real like, freedom of ideas, right without constraint.

48:24.360 --> 48:28.640
And I think we're easy on ourselves in those times, because we're like, bye, we could just

48:28.640 --> 48:31.400
like, that's kind of like dreaming, and I don't need to commit to anything.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.680
Yes, you don't have to follow down, you may not even write it down.

48:33.680 --> 48:36.760
You can just it's a true exploration, isn't it?

48:36.760 --> 48:38.480
Have you done any meditation?

48:38.480 --> 48:42.600
Because I know that meditation can sometimes Oh, yeah, no, I am.

48:42.600 --> 48:47.400
That's one of the things that has been sort of disrupted in my routine lately.

48:47.400 --> 48:49.840
I definitely enjoy meditation.

48:49.840 --> 48:56.480
I could probably stand to do it on a more regular basis, but it is a usual part of some

48:56.480 --> 48:57.480
of my routines.

48:57.480 --> 48:58.480
Okay.

48:58.480 --> 49:06.080
And do you find it useful for you to gain just general clarity or more of an idea sphere?

49:06.080 --> 49:10.240
Um, yeah, I guess I it can it can be both.

49:10.240 --> 49:16.080
The ideas sphere is maybe a more constrained activity, or at least not constrained in what

49:16.080 --> 49:19.440
it is, but constrained in time and place.

49:19.440 --> 49:28.720
But for general meditation, I find it very useful just to set the tone and whatever I'm

49:28.720 --> 49:33.400
gonna call it brain tone, but you know, like the the thematics of how your day is going

49:33.400 --> 49:37.360
and what you're thinking about, because it's so easy to get trapped in like random little

49:37.360 --> 49:43.440
brain loops where you're thinking about something good or bad might not be what you should really

49:43.440 --> 49:46.500
be thinking about or want to be thinking about.

49:46.500 --> 49:53.720
And it seems like one of the more useful tools I have also, especially like with more creative

49:53.720 --> 50:01.320
work or different timelines, trying to bring a sense of priority and understanding to all

50:01.320 --> 50:04.920
of the things that might be going on at a time, like collecting all the things and sorting

50:04.920 --> 50:05.920
them like a triage.

50:05.920 --> 50:10.640
Yeah, but but in a peaceful, you know, not in a not in a hurry way to not focusing on

50:10.640 --> 50:14.600
any of them, but just sort of, I guess I would say it's more of like an acknowledgement.

50:14.600 --> 50:18.080
It's sort of, you know, you're looking around the room and being like, yep, all right, that's

50:18.080 --> 50:19.080
over there.

50:19.080 --> 50:20.080
I see.

50:20.080 --> 50:21.080
Yes, in the corner, too.

50:21.080 --> 50:22.080
And there's no judgments.

50:22.080 --> 50:26.380
There's no as little emotion as you can and just sort of accepting that those are there.

50:26.380 --> 50:30.840
And then when you're done, now you have the time to go engage with the ones.

50:30.840 --> 50:31.840
Right.

50:31.840 --> 50:37.560
I found often in that for me, items that have otherwise been forgotten tend to start floating

50:37.560 --> 50:42.700
up yet I'm not sure where they come from, or who's asking them to float.

50:42.700 --> 50:48.360
But that can really bring to mind some things that in a what I'll call a waking state, but

50:48.360 --> 50:54.120
a non meditative state, I suppose, our everyday state, our usual operating state, it are things

50:54.120 --> 50:58.100
that get sort of forgotten, despite their importance.

50:58.100 --> 51:02.440
It's almost like a scale from importance to urgency.

51:02.440 --> 51:07.840
And what we're aware of immediately is what's urgent, yes, but isn't necessarily what's

51:07.840 --> 51:08.840
most important.

51:08.840 --> 51:12.640
There's a lot of urgent things I have to do all the time then.

51:12.640 --> 51:17.280
While an important part of my life are not something I would think of as an overarching

51:17.280 --> 51:21.000
bigger sort of goal or task or anything.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.760
Yeah, that is true, right?

51:22.760 --> 51:27.060
Because a lot of the themes in your life are like, you know, things you're proud of things

51:27.060 --> 51:31.760
you've committed to things you've built or learned or enjoyed.

51:31.760 --> 51:34.880
But most of the time, those are not the urgent things are the things you have to plan for

51:34.880 --> 51:39.920
or think about a lot to be able to actually do and probably takes time to look back and

51:39.920 --> 51:40.920
actually appreciate.

51:40.920 --> 51:41.920
Right.

51:41.920 --> 51:45.440
And the rest of it's all like, well, the trash has to go out.

51:45.440 --> 51:46.440
Someone's got to do it.

51:46.440 --> 51:47.440
It's gotta vacuum again.

51:47.440 --> 51:51.120
Yeah, we don't have robots for all that stuff yet.

51:51.120 --> 51:52.120
Well, some of us do.

51:52.120 --> 51:56.080
Well, I'm with you.

51:56.080 --> 52:02.800
Do you find for yourself a real challenge in seeing some of the ideas that you've implemented,

52:02.800 --> 52:07.040
you know, some of the technologies you've implemented, even in the studio here?

52:07.040 --> 52:11.280
Do you find it a challenge to see them constantly evolving, like the entropy that tends to work

52:11.280 --> 52:12.640
its way into projects?

52:12.640 --> 52:16.600
Is that tricky to see something you've built needing to be changed all the time?

52:16.600 --> 52:18.080
Or do you get excited by that?

52:18.080 --> 52:26.640
I think I struggle with it less in a technical sense or a work sense and more in a personal

52:26.640 --> 52:27.640
sense.

52:27.640 --> 52:28.640
Like an emotional sense?

52:28.640 --> 52:31.160
Well, just in personal matters, I guess.

52:31.160 --> 52:35.440
Like I find myself building more routines, having more of those sort of structures in

52:35.440 --> 52:43.360
my regular life and being more exploratory and looking to change in a lot of like technical

52:43.360 --> 52:44.360
work things.

52:44.360 --> 52:45.960
So I kind of enjoy that.

52:45.960 --> 52:51.000
I mean, again, there's a lot of value in reliability and sameness and all that, and I'm a big proponent

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
of such things.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
Right.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.680
But I do enjoy change and evolution.

52:55.680 --> 52:59.320
And I like those things in my personal life as well, but it's a little more of I have

52:59.320 --> 53:06.800
to remind myself of that or I guess it's more of my brain wants to seek routines and then

53:06.800 --> 53:11.640
I have to remind myself that like, yes, you found this, but that's going to change soon.

53:11.640 --> 53:12.640
Like it's good.

53:12.640 --> 53:13.640
Keep doing it.

53:13.640 --> 53:14.640
That's good.

53:14.640 --> 53:15.640
It's working.

53:15.640 --> 53:19.120
Like I said, pinging you being like, well, you're probably going to have to move or it's

53:19.120 --> 53:22.280
going to be winter and you can't do that anymore or whatever.

53:22.280 --> 53:27.600
Do you find it's easier for you in the technical world in that you have a collection of tools

53:27.600 --> 53:31.680
that you can use to help you move through those changes and then your personal world?

53:31.680 --> 53:32.680
Yes.

53:32.680 --> 53:33.680
And more control.

53:33.680 --> 53:35.440
Oh, in what sense?

53:35.440 --> 53:39.560
Usually in the technical domains, I at least have some, I'm usually somewhat involved in

53:39.560 --> 53:42.520
the implementation or this is decision making process.

53:42.520 --> 53:47.680
So I can decide how much I care, but I really have to care a lot about my own personal life.

53:47.680 --> 53:51.560
And I could go live a life where I had more control, but like living in a city and currently

53:51.560 --> 53:58.900
renting and doing things that involve other people, a lot that can change without my input

53:58.900 --> 53:59.900
at all.

53:59.900 --> 54:01.120
I guess there are more external factors.

54:01.120 --> 54:02.320
There are more external factors.

54:02.320 --> 54:03.320
Yeah, exactly.

54:03.320 --> 54:08.080
Do you find to bring us back that agreeableness has an effect there?

54:08.080 --> 54:13.520
Like in terms of lifestyle, do you tend to shape your lifestyle for how it works for

54:13.520 --> 54:14.520
others?

54:14.520 --> 54:17.480
Definitely more so than other people, than some others do.

54:17.480 --> 54:21.720
Yes, that's probably true.

54:21.720 --> 54:25.120
I don't think in a bad way necessarily, at least not all the time.

54:25.120 --> 54:26.120
You never said it was bad?

54:26.120 --> 54:27.120
No, yeah, right.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.520
That's true.

54:29.520 --> 54:33.720
That just is what people think of in that role.

54:33.720 --> 54:34.720
It's the general perception.

54:34.720 --> 54:35.720
Right.

54:35.720 --> 54:36.720
Yeah, exactly.

54:36.720 --> 54:44.320
I mean, I'm not like moving to Tahiti right now or whatever, like I need to do this.

54:44.320 --> 54:49.960
And I do have some of those things, but I would say it is more of a balance.

54:49.960 --> 54:57.840
I would place more weight relative to other people, some other people on whatever, my

54:57.840 --> 55:04.360
friendships or established relationships or how that would affect the people in my life.

55:04.360 --> 55:09.800
That sounds so familiar for me because I'm, as you know, traveling quite a bit.

55:09.800 --> 55:16.060
And so my friend circles have sort of evolved from being in a certain city to being a little

55:16.060 --> 55:19.920
bit scattered, you can argue, all over North America.

55:19.920 --> 55:24.960
Oh, you can argue even further than that.

55:24.960 --> 55:32.560
And so what I'm exploring these days is the difference between what I generally really

55:32.560 --> 55:38.580
struggle with is trying to decide what is best for me and myself emotionally.

55:38.580 --> 55:39.580
Just you alone.

55:39.580 --> 55:46.400
Yeah, versus what should be the answer or what others perceive is the best path.

55:46.400 --> 55:47.400
A logical course.

55:47.400 --> 55:54.480
Yeah, and so that's true of friend networks and family networks as well, is that while

55:54.480 --> 55:58.120
I know I'm traveling lots and I can see all these people as I travel because that's how

55:58.120 --> 56:03.920
this all got built up, there's still some weird sense of needing to choose home.

56:03.920 --> 56:09.000
That currently I know is maybe not optimal in the way I've set it up.

56:09.000 --> 56:13.440
But in choosing a new home, that's one of the life decisions I find to be one of the

56:13.440 --> 56:14.440
most challenging.

56:14.440 --> 56:16.120
Right, especially when you have so many options, right?

56:16.120 --> 56:19.520
It's not like, it's not like you got it.

56:19.520 --> 56:24.040
And I guess that that's another aspect to you know, if, if you're going to go pursue

56:24.040 --> 56:29.160
some new degree or whatever, like you would have a limited set, but you could keep doing

56:29.160 --> 56:30.160
whatever you're doing, right?

56:30.160 --> 56:37.080
I suppose that's a challenge with having such a free lifestyle as well, is that, okay, well,

56:37.080 --> 56:42.840
while I absolutely love my lifestyle, it has freedom, in the sense that I can choose to

56:42.840 --> 56:44.880
do whatever I'd like.

56:44.880 --> 56:51.240
And that is, while that sounds lovely, and is mostly, it also has the challenge of not

56:51.240 --> 56:53.880
having any particular direction or any default.

56:53.880 --> 56:57.560
You got to choose, you got to make each of those decisions all the time.

56:57.560 --> 56:59.520
So that's something I generally struggle with.

56:59.520 --> 57:05.800
And I know you're, I think you're looking for a new space to live in, and that can bring

57:05.800 --> 57:07.520
a lot of those same themes, right?

57:07.520 --> 57:10.360
Is that how in the world do you choose?

57:10.360 --> 57:13.440
It's funny this this time to like, I got the news a little bit suddenly that I was gonna

57:13.440 --> 57:15.640
have to relocate.

57:15.640 --> 57:16.640
And I've moved a ton.

57:16.640 --> 57:19.080
I'm like, it's not it's not really that big of a deal.

57:19.080 --> 57:25.360
And I honestly, I enjoy the process of moving, not part where you have to lift heavy things

57:25.360 --> 57:26.360
a whole bunch.

57:26.360 --> 57:27.400
I mean, that part's fine, too.

57:27.400 --> 57:30.000
It's mostly the rush of having to move all these things really fast, right?

57:30.000 --> 57:31.540
It's just a stressful thing.

57:31.540 --> 57:38.560
But I really enjoy the like, considering new aspects, I think I am building more of a,

57:38.560 --> 57:43.160
at least in a particular domain, of a sense of like, what I like and spaces and ideas

57:43.160 --> 57:44.160
and that sort of thing.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.160
So that's all very fun.

57:45.160 --> 57:50.760
Some of it like the suddenness, and I think playing on that aspect of control, like this

57:50.760 --> 57:54.240
one, I think it was also just like it happened at an inopportune time where I was busy and

57:54.240 --> 57:55.960
stressed out about other things.

57:55.960 --> 58:00.320
But I found that it really like, ungrounded me in a way that I was surprised by.

58:00.320 --> 58:01.920
So you're trying to collect yourself?

58:01.920 --> 58:02.920
Yeah.

58:02.920 --> 58:04.720
So I'm trying to collect myself.

58:04.720 --> 58:10.120
And it was, I mean, I was kind of at a, you know, I moved into the city proper because

58:10.120 --> 58:13.200
that's where all the work was, right?

58:13.200 --> 58:15.060
And that's no longer what I'm doing.

58:15.060 --> 58:17.480
So you have different inputs now or different filters.

58:17.480 --> 58:18.480
Right.

58:18.480 --> 58:21.560
And so while I had been sort of refining this, like, well, I know what it like, looks like

58:21.560 --> 58:23.960
to live in the city, I know kind of what my options are.

58:23.960 --> 58:27.900
And I still have to make some tough calls about like, what do I want to do next?

58:27.900 --> 58:31.280
Now I suddenly found myself being like, not only do I not have the nice luxury of time

58:31.280 --> 58:38.600
to go like, fart around and think about these ideas, which you require, yeah, right, exactly.

58:38.600 --> 58:44.500
But I also suddenly have a giant swath of other options that I hadn't previously considered.

58:44.500 --> 58:47.240
So that's still exciting to, but it definitely took me a little bit out.

58:47.240 --> 58:51.280
And it was like a day or two where I was like, why, what am I, why am I feeling like this?

58:51.280 --> 58:55.900
Like, what is like, the facts don't add up to how this is making me feel.

58:55.900 --> 58:59.380
So you had to pause and be like, oh, yeah, right.

58:59.380 --> 59:00.380
This is what's happening.

59:00.380 --> 59:03.520
And I think it didn't help to that I kind of really like my current place.

59:03.520 --> 59:04.520
Your place is great.

59:04.520 --> 59:05.520
Yeah, for sure.

59:05.520 --> 59:12.880
I see kind of a link in moving house to traveling in the sense that it sort of puts a break

59:12.880 --> 59:13.880
in your everyday routines.

59:13.880 --> 59:14.880
Oh, yeah.

59:14.880 --> 59:19.200
And forces you to sort of look around, right, and reevaluate and have an opportunity to

59:19.200 --> 59:20.200
change things.

59:20.200 --> 59:28.280
And that's what I love that aspect and that it's so interesting, comparing how you live,

59:28.280 --> 59:30.840
you know, because we're all I mean, we're all living, we all have have lives and do

59:30.840 --> 59:34.280
things and make constant decisions every day and not in like a judgment way.

59:34.280 --> 59:36.760
But just in a I think I heard it.

59:36.760 --> 59:41.680
I think I heard this quote on like, remember the show, what was it like a seventh heaven

59:41.680 --> 59:44.960
or something like a religious?

59:44.960 --> 59:48.360
And I think the dad said something like, you know, you're like, life is basically just

59:48.360 --> 59:52.080
like a sum of all of the choices that you make.

59:52.080 --> 59:55.600
And I like that idea, even though I think the show was obviously terrible, and I was

59:55.600 --> 59:59.480
just flipping through channels or whatever and heard this, but it just stuck in my mind.

59:59.480 --> 01:00:04.000
And so it's just interesting to, you know, as you compare each little choice of like,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.400
well, when do you push yourself?

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.400
When do you not?

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.400
When do you move?

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.400
When do you not?

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.680
How do you place yourself in the world?

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.920
What's the sum you want to get to?

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.800
It's a good question.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.520
I have some ideas.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.600
It's very much a work in progress.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.620
As we all are.

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:24.920
One thing I struggle with is the difference in paths is that if you all of a sudden choose

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:31.120
one fork in the road, I struggle with trying to accept that the other fork is now no longer

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.120
possible.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.120
You just cut that off.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.120
Which is not always true.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:40.360
You can always sort of reach for alternatives later down the road, but they're necessarily

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360
going to be different.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.360
They're going to be different.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.360
Right.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.880
Do you have any techniques you use to deal with that?

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.920
Hold myself closely and cry.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:49.920
Right.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.840
Cat cuddles, maybe?

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.120
Cats help, certainly.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.540
No, it's something I've struggled with that I don't know that I've found the answer to

01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:58.540
for myself.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:01.040
And there is some perfectionism in that.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.040
You want to make the best choice, right?

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.780
You don't have all the information because you can't.

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:09.020
But sometimes both options are equally good only for varied reasons.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:14.080
And so then my toolkit is empty of tools to help me deal with that.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.080
Right.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.900
And so I can be very slow at making those types of decisions.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:22.720
Choosing home, I guess, fits into that realm a little bit.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:28.460
It is, you know, I think it's hard to there's, there's probably an element of whatever agreeability

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:34.600
and logicalness, you know, it's like, some of those bigger ideas.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.160
It's hard if you aren't falling in love with them, you know, because if it is one of those

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.240
things, you're just like, Oh, my gosh, yes, like, I was driving to this place.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.240
I love this town.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.640
I'm already working remotely.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.640
I want to live there.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.640
I'm gonna go do it.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.680
If you can fall in love with this idea so much, then everything's easy.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.840
I mean, you might still have a lot of problems, but makes it easier.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.760
There's so many things in life that just aren't, you know, it's like, okay, I gotta make this

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.760
choice.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.080
I know that it matters a whole bunch, and we'll have a bunch of outcomes I can't foresee.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.080
But it's probably both are fine.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.080
Right.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.080
What do you do?

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.000
I mean, you flip a coin, I guess, at the end of the day, but the coins are really useful.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
That's for sure.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I never really trust what they say.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
So

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I flip a smartphone, I think.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I don't know that we have coin money.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.640
That sounds a bit more expensive if it all goes wrong.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.320
There's someone I really love named Derek Sivers.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.320
Do you know him at all?

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.320
I don't think so.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.320
He built CD Baby.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.620
Oh, okay.

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:30.020
But one thing he, I guess it's a concept that he's sort of spread around, which is he calls

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:33.440
hell yeah or no.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:38.680
Which boils down to either you feel very jazzed about an idea and you say, hell yeah, I want

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.120
to do that, or you should just say no to it.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:50.160
And while that seems really simple to implement, I've actually noticed that it's profound in

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:57.160
that for those of us who are agreeable, and tend to go along with what seems like okay

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:04.840
ideas or okay paths that others set for us or convince us to follow or what it may be,

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:11.000
it's almost like a preset filter that allows you to tap into how you feel, you know, just

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.920
ask the question, well, how do I feel about this?

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:18.200
And often I found that pause is enough to convince you of what you actually feel instead

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.600
of what you're sort of empathizing with.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.400
And maybe related thing that just makes me think you're talking a little bit about friend

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.680
circles and other, and I feel like that applies a lot to like, there's the difference between

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:34.160
like, being around people, friends and like, more meaningful friendships, and both are

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.160
fine.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.480
I mean, you know, there's nothing, nothing wrong with that.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.480
But it just thinks a lot, you know, like, sometimes you have those moments where you

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.000
finally ask that question, and you're like, I mean, like, why am I, it's not that it's

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
bad, right?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.560
But you're just like, these aren't my people, or this is not my venue.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.840
And I don't have to be here, right?

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.280
But that can sometimes be a difficult thing is saying, wait, I'm, I don't feel like I

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.280
should be here.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.560
And therefore, I will leave.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.560
And I think it'd be hard to if you don't necessarily, you might not have an immediate replacement

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.560
to it, right?

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.520
So it's like, well, come out and do this thing with us, or do nothing.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.080
I mean, not, you probably won't do nothing.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.600
But at the time, it feels that way.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.520
So maybe we should all have our own defaults.

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:15.760
If we're doing nothing, we can just do something that we really love or find really useful.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.360
I'm trying to do better at that.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:23.480
I mean, because I've had both, your quote made me think of the opposite advice, which

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:29.520
I think is said a lot of like, just trying to say yes to more things, which is, I think,

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.520
applicable in different scenarios.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.240
And it probably depends on what phase you're going through, because that can be really

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:40.240
good if you've just moved or exploring something new or need change in your life.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:46.440
Like it's tied to a sense of adventure, as opposed to a sense of not being so busy or

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:50.720
optimizing the tasks you do have time for.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.720
Curious.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.480
I've mentioned a few books, I think.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.640
Are there books you're reading recently that really get you jazzed?

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:03.760
I am rereading because I read it very quickly and wanted to read it again.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:08.760
It's a book, getting the name of the author right now, but surely we'll have show notes

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.760
or some such.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.240
Yeah, we can come up with such a thing.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.400
I imagine we have the technology.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:22.280
It's called Why Buddhism is True, which is a ridiculous title, but is very much a book

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:29.680
about the more, I don't want to just say like science-based, but more secular side, I guess,

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.160
of Buddhism.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.120
And I think hits a lot on some of the topics we've talked about and just that.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:40.240
It ties it a lot to, because the author has a lot of theology knowledge and psychology

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:45.400
and twists those ideas together and points out, here's some of the things that Buddhism

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:53.320
teaches and here's why these make sense once you understand how your brain works and why.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:57.880
All of what we are is the image painted from our brains as it's exposed.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:01.600
The brain creates our understanding and view of the world, of course, and you should know

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:06.880
that it doesn't, you know, wise is maybe too strong of a word, but it has other incentives

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:12.880
and programming built into it than just what we are or as part of us, however you want

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.600
to conceptualize mind, and you should be aware, you should be thinking about that.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.760
But I really liked it, too, because there has been a lot of Buddhism and Buddhist teachings

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:26.240
that I've enjoyed, but I struggle with some of the more mystical elements of it.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:31.640
It just doesn't strike my, not that I don't appreciate some of the history or culture,

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.600
but as practical advice that's just not my jam, I want like science.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:39.800
So I found this book really nice as a way to A, learn more about Buddhism and B, I just

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.000
thought it had a lot of good practical advice.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.480
Yeah, it sounds like it leans a little bit more towards what you can implement and yet

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:53.200
not necessarily have the depth of spirituality that sometimes is required for some.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.200
Yes.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.160
And yeah, so there's like, that was actually what first got me meditating, too, because

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:01.760
it's kind of like the author describes an experience of like going to like a whole meditation

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.440
camp and then like coming out at the end and talking a little bit about their experience

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.960
of figuring out how to actually get that in their day-to-day life and the things that

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.500
did matter and didn't matter to them about that or what they actually took away and sort

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.500
of interesting case.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.800
It was like, yeah, okay, I see, I see what you're getting at here, but I don't need a

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.880
shaman to, you know, sit with me in a very hot room for hours.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.680
I mean, you're assuming the room is hot.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:25.480
Maybe if we take the right drugs, but otherwise, no.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:32.580
I have found in the same way this exploration of those kind of the desire to understand

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:39.600
your own mind, to then optimize it for the tasks that you generally have to solve, be

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:47.360
it technical tasks, but also tasks such as choosing what to work on and choosing how

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:55.280
to work on it, gaining knowledge of how your own mind works, while this general schooling

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.520
we're exposed to doesn't really dive into those topics.

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:02.480
And so I found that same curiosity of like, well, wait a second, like I know my mind is

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:07.840
all over the place and that it can also be hyper-focused and how do I understand the

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.880
difference between those two and guide it in the ways that I need to when I need to.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.880
Yes.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:18.920
And I think a lot of like what tools we are provided by whatever traditional society,

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.120
they're all wrapped up in like judgments and shame too, right?

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.920
Like there are all these like prescriptive things like you shouldn't do this or, you

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:27.040
know, that's a bad idea just because.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.000
And like there is, yeah, that probably is a bad idea.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.560
We know like history shows us that that doesn't work, but it's a bad idea just because, you

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.340
know, you should know because your brain works or at least be informed so that you can be,

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:41.400
you know, make different decisions or be more insightful as you go down whatever path you're

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.400
going to go down.

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:43.400
Right.

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:48.000
When someone tells you if that you should or shouldn't do something, do you find yourself

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.040
needing to understand the why before?

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.040
Depends on the situation.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.000
But yeah, generally, yes, I'm a, I'm a why kind of person.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.480
So like definitely like the best, you know, managers or bosses or whatever have been able

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.480
to do that.

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:10.080
It's like, you know, really, it's like I like to separate those because if I've agreed,

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.080
there's multiple concerns here.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.680
So there's like the imposed authority sort of situation, which let's put that out the

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.240
window for you.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.360
In the situation where I've agreed that I'll do what you say for money or whatever, I'm

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:25.120
okay with that pre-arranged agreement as long as A, I can tell you if I think what you're

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.360
doing, telling me to do is dumb, I'll still do it.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:32.400
If you make me make, you know, ask or whatever.

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.640
But the other side of that is I want to know why regardless just because I want help, like

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.640
I want to do it the best I can.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.520
And if I don't know why, I can't do that.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:45.700
I find that to be a real challenge for me too, is that if I don't know why, then I can't

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:51.680
optimize the task at hand to create the best outcome, because none of this stuff is really

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.680
linear, right?

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.880
And it's all within in situ, you know, there's context around that if I don't know, like

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.800
you just can't, can't anticipate.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.460
And sometimes maybe you can't know.

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:04.720
And that's okay as a temporary sort of answer, but at least get that far.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:08.240
Yeah, context is a great word for that.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:13.860
That's a way simpler way to explore it for me is that I need some context to understand

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:14.860
the path.

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:19.140
I was listening to a really interesting interview on the way up to the studio today, talking

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:25.180
about some issues in language education and young children, and how a lot of the approaches

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:30.400
today kind of focus on, like separating things so that, you know, you learn how to learn,

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.400
which is good.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.400
It's not that that's bad.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.360
But like, you remember those standardized tests where you have like a bad nonsense passage,

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.360
and then you have to identify like, what are the points and what are the three or what's

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.360
the main topic?

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.960
What are the three supporting arguments in here?

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:43.960
Yes.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.960
And while that is useful, all the studies then went and showed that like, while that

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.000
it can be good, like if you have kids who are either good, you know, scored on some

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.800
like reading comprehension scale, and then you present them passages about different

01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:00.840
subjects, what really matters is how much they know about that subject, you know.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.240
So like, if you don't know anything about the subject, even if you're great at trying

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.720
to understand it, you might get farther, but you're still going to do worse than someone

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.600
with quote unquote, poor reading comprehension who knows even a little bit about that subject.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:18.760
I just thought it was interesting, especially hearing discussions about this with adults,

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:24.260
how much context in the world we take for granted and just don't talk about and kids

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:25.260
don't have that.

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.260
Wow.

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.600
And many times we don't either, right?

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.960
If you're traveling or in a new situation, but it's almost impossible to see if you already

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:33.960
have it.

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.020
I love this.

01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:39.920
In travel, because you mentioned travel, you can easily clearly see this if you travel

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.720
to a place for the first time, it's total chaos in your mind trying to figure out all

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.240
the pieces and how they all fit together.

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:47.240
There are no systems.

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:48.240
No.

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.040
And then, but if you've ever come back to that, let's say you travel to the same city

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.600
for the same reason three months later, and you've already been through the path, you've

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.220
got all this context to figure it out.

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:01.240
And so if you're throwing some curveballs, it's like, well, I've already figured out

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.240
80% of this.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.320
So I can deal with this curveball far easier.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.920
Wow, I can see how that could apply to much more than just the education.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.920
Yeah.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.920
Right.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.920
Aspect.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.920
Fascinating.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:13.920
Do you remember what the podcast was called?

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:18.840
Well, it was on the local public radio station here in Seattle, so I can certainly find it.

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.840
I don't remember the name of the author's last researcher.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.840
That's all right.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840
We'll see if we can link it.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.840
I think we can.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.400
We have the technology.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.920
Well, Wes, thanks for chatting.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:34.640
I admit I wasn't sure where this was going to go, but it's gone in all sorts of fascinating

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.640
topics.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.640
Everywhere.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:37.640
Let's do this again.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.640
Super fun.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.640
Thanks so much.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.640
Next time, right?

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:41.640
We'll see about that.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.640
Thanks, Wes.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.640
Well, I hope you enjoyed that chat.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.440
I absolutely loved that conversation.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.440
