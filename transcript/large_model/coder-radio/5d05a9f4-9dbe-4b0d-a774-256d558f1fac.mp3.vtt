00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 447 for January 3rd, 2022.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Hello friend and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Take a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
Well, my name is Chris and joining us now in the future, which is now the present, it is our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello. Hello. Hello. Yeah, you gotta open with a nice cough.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
You know, people that are new, they would think that that's not the way you start a show.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
But us pros, we've learned and we've learned that's how you start a show.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
In the age of COVID, you want a nice hacking cough to really kick things off.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
The only thing that we could have done better is I could have asked the listener to turn it up first.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Yeah, that would have been better. Amazing. So I made it out of the woods.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Congratulations. What does civilization feel like? Nice.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Although it got really snowed in the night I left, a whole nother wave of snow came in.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
So I would have been stuck probably until about right now if I had made it out there.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
I planned to get out Tuesday and we did the show.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
I was going to hunker down, work on getting the RV out, and then I was going to leave Tuesday after Linux unplugged because, you know, I got a show to do.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Get out there and I can't bring my slides in. We knocked the snow off.

01:24.000 --> 01:32.000
We realized what's been happening is the snow would melt a little bit probably because slides are generating heat and the sun's coming down on it.

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
So it would melt the snow a little bit. And then the sun, because it's like winter solstice, wouldn't last very long.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
It'd be off the slide and it would freeze up immediately.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
And it was getting thicker and thicker and thicker every day, but we didn't realize this was happening.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
So it took us hours to clear these icebergs off of each one of the slides before we could bring them in.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I mean, I'm talking up there with a wind chill.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
It's probably seven degrees hacking away at these icebergs on top of our slides.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Try not to like rip the slide topper, which is made of cloth, and clear these.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
And we didn't actually make it out of there until Thursday, Thursday afternoon.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
And then just within hours of getting out of there, another snowstorm came in.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
It was touch and go, but we made it.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
And we did take some damage.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Our water filtration system, the filter expanded and cracked the housing.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I should have thought of that.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
But you know, I was just in survival mode and I didn't even think to go out there and like remove the filters.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
I should have.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
And there may be other damage that we don't know about yet because we can't pressurize the system until the filters are fixed.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
But we got it drying out and parked now.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
So we made it.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
But enough about the woods.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I want to hear about your week.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
It sounds like you were having some trippy dreams while I was trying to dig out from the ice.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
You really shouldn't read Linux Twitter and then go to sleep.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
I would just take it back one notch and just say you really shouldn't read Linux Twitter.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
Oh, so I had a dream where I had sold my company and was kind of wandering in the woods.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Did it feel good or was it scary?

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
The dream, it was scary, but that part felt good.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
It started off as a dream and turned into, well, let's just see where we go here.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
I got a call from Carl Rochelle of System76.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
How's Carl?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
He's good.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
He wanted me to come help them with a secret project.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
I said, okay, I thought, great, it's going to be like a laptop.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
The secret project, Chris, was he's like, you're the only person who can do this job.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
And then he started frantically drawing brackets on his whiteboard over and over.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Oh, no.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Oh, no.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, no.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
And the project was porting Papa Wes's UI layer to GNU step.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Sure.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
He has a dream.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I like this, actually.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
It was horrific.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Horrific.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
So I felt the need to DM Carl this.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Okay.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Poor Carl.

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
I don't know if Carl's like me, but most of the time I don't want to hear anyone's dream.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I can't stand hearing people's dreams.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
I hate it, too.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
It gives me almost like a mild panic attack just when people go on about their dreams.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
I mean, this one's great.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Just picturing if Carl's one of those guys, right?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
This DM comes rolling in.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Needless to say, his response basically is summed up as, huh, that's kind of crazy.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
If we were in person, he would have very slowly but purposefully backed away.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
So that is how 2022 is starting for me.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Objective C, GNU step, and Linux.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
That seems like a lot.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Honestly, sounds like a fantasy.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I love this.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
I mean, he brings you in.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
You know they had some good stuff going on there with that GNU step.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Like, it was going to be good times.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Maybe he could even do something with that BIOS or Haiku.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
You know, that'd really be cooking with gas.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Oh, my God.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Chris is like, let's make dreams come true.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
I saw you were setting up a machine, too, for the kid over the holiday.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
And you're going Linux?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
It's still a work in progress.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Yeah, he has a Raspberry Pi, but I'm looking to get him a little more power.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
And to be clear, he has an older Raspberry Pi.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I'm not sure what makes sense.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
So I remember the dark old days.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Was it Edbuntu or Kidbuntu?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Yeah, there was both.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Edubuntu was the one I had the most experience with, but yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Is that still a thing?

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
It doesn't look like it's super maintained.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
So I just reloaded my son's laptop this weekend.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
Even though I don't know if it's a great distribution for him specifically,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
although he's pretty flexible, I decided to go with Fedora 35

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
because that's what I'm running on my laptop.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
What's nice about that is when he wants to do something in Minecraft,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
like he wants to install Optifine or he wants to do some sort of mod thing,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
I kind of treat my machine as like the test go machine.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
And I get it working on my laptop, and then I go do it on his laptop

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
if it's something I've never done before.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
And that's why I like having him the same OS.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I mean, I guess I'm kind of like if you're finding like Pop is working for you,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
you might consider it for him too.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
Although I kind of also saw the suggestions of Endless,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
and I can see the logic in that as well.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
That'd be good kid OS as well.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
But when it comes to just getting things working,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
it's nice if it's the same thing you're using.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Well, that's not a bad idea.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
So that would be Snow Leopard.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
So what?

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
You know, that is true though.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
You can always get him a used Mac.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
There is that option.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
They're not bad machines if he doesn't need graphics.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah, I do have an old mini laying around that I'm kind of tempted

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
just to lock the hell up down out of Mac OS.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
The problem with a new Mac is, I don't know, it's just painful to update them

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
and be sad as each update makes them worse.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
It's not a great kid OS.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
I mean, that sounds silly, but the thing that's nice about Linux

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
is when Dylan turns his laptop on,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
and maybe he hasn't used it for three or four days,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
it's not trying to do 100 things in the background.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
It's not trying to update 15 different applications

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
and connect to a cloud service.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
At absolute worst, it's going to refresh the package cache,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
and it's going to do that for like 45 seconds.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Well, it's also like the strategy tax that you like to talk about.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
He actually has an iPad mini.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Well, he doesn't have unfettered access to it.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
But because I won't set up all the iCloud stuff on it,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
and I just have it locked down with parental controls,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
and I won't set up Face ID because the whole point is

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
he can't use it without permission,

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
it constantly makes me reauthenticate him with his Apple ID

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
because he has one of those child Apple IDs.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
I finally actually figured it out this morning that the reason it does that

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
is it's trying to, I won't say trick, but as soon as you reauthenticate,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
it's like iCloud configuration.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
It's desperate to pull you into that ecosystem.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah, and it'll do little unread count badges too in your settings.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah, I know.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
I give him the iPad because his school requires either that

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
or I think you could get a Chromebook or something.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
But they have an app that they use for their homework in kindergarten,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
mind you, which I think is crazy, but whatever.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
And I just put it on guided access so he can't do anything other than that app.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
But every time now, it's like you have to reauthenticate.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
I went so as far as to change the password because at first I thought,

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
is this some sort of someone's trying to get into his iCloud account or whatever

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
for some reason?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Like something's getting tripped.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Right.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
No, it's that it wants me to set up Face ID in particular,

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
and it also seems to want me to set up iCloud syncing,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
which is weird because he has no other devices.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah, they have both some of the best family support.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I mean, I got to give him credit for that.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
And some of the most frustrating with weird gotchas,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
regardless of which way you go.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
So I've got one kid account that isn't actually a kid account

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
because it was too restricted and couldn't do what I needed to do,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
which then means I have all these other gotchas.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
And then all my other kid accounts, they're set to the correct age.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
But there's a ton of stuff that I can't do with those accounts,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
and it's in a bad way.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
And yet it's better than just about any other large tech companies,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
family sharing, family, whatever plan.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Back to Pop OS for a second and your desktop.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
David wrote in, and his email kind of made me realize

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
I had missed an opportunity chatting with you about your VM setup.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Now, I know that the VMware solution is working well for you,

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
and this isn't an attempt to get you to try something else.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
However, if you have like another system, like another Linux box,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
and you want to do emulation on that,

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
and you don't want another copy of VMware or whatever your situation might be,

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
David reminded me that I should encourage you to check out Quick MU,

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
which is a project that was started by our buddy, Martin Wimpress.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
And it is a really kick-ass fast solution to get a very modern virtualization system

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
up and running with a lot of different options, including Mac OS on Linux.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
You're up and going, especially if you're on an Ubuntu-based system,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
or even one of the other popular Linux distros.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It's like three, five minutes of a setup,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
and then you can get a VM up and going in just a couple of minutes,

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
and it's quick, it's accelerated, it's really well done.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
They're creating a Flutter-based UI to sit on top of it,

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
but Quick MU itself is a command line tool that gives you like prompts and numbers

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
and options to choose from to get a VM system up and going.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
So this is my duty.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I'm fulfilling my duty now by letting you know about Quick MU

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
and suggesting that perhaps check it out sometime in the future.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I'll put a link in the notes.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah, probably on the next install I'll give it a go.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
I mean, like you said, VMware Workstation is working really well,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
so I'm just not going to touch that.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah, when you've got something like that, it's so nice.

10:40.000 --> 10:47.000
It's like on the MacBook for me, Parallels using a Vert.io for Linux accelerated graphics,

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm so hooked on that sauce now.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
But on Linux, they've done such great work on Quick MU.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
So this is also kind of me recommending it to those of you out in the audience.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
It's so easy to get going, number one.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
And number two, like I've been talking about with Parallels,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
you're going to get to use some of that Vert.io acceleration.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
They're doing file sharing pass-throughs.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
You can copy files.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
It supports Vert GL, USB device pass-throughs, smart card pass-throughs

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
for those of you that work in enterprises that need smart card.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
It's such an awesome, awesome project,

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
and our buddy Wimpy streams it when he works on it sometimes as well.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
And if you're on Linux right now,

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
and you're looking for a really great go-to virtualization solution,

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
or my God, if you're using VirtualBox, please go give this a look.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah, VirtualBox, I mean, it's great.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
It's open source, but it's maybe the least performant option you have.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah, and the UI is of an era that has passed.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
It's functional, but Quick MU is so great.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Hang on, Chris, I have to reopen NetBeans IDE real fast.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
There you go.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I wanted to mention on the show just as a bit of email follow-up

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
from when we were talking about keyboards forever ago,

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
I finally received my super expensive Ultimate Hacking Keyboard.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
This is just to jog everyone's memory out there.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
It's a keyboard.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
I'll have a link in the show notes,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
or you can just go to ultimatehackingkeyboard.com.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
It's a keyboard that you can split.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
It's an ergonomic keyboard that you can split,

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
and then it has a cloth-bound cord between the two, like an RJ11,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
that connects the two sides.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
And it lights up with LED lights, and then it's kind of well-known too

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
because it has a wood palm rest on each side, which is gorgeous.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
It comes in two boxes.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
And then it has like a little LED mode indicator at the top in the corner.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
And they've done things like they've replaced one of the space bars

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
because it's split like the launch is.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
It's replaced the left space bar with a mod key,

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
and it's replaced the caps lock with a different mod key.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
It has all these modes that you go into.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Like if you want arrow keys, you've got to go into a mode.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
F keys or all kinds of things really escape even.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
You have to go into a mode.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
But it's so beautiful on the table, I have to really say,

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
because the wood armrests that attach to it really class it up,

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
and then it's got a really kind of nice elegant white backlight to it,

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
and the key caps shine through with the light, and that's super nice.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
It's probably the nicest keyboard I've ever seen.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I mean, it's quite nice.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
I didn't get any of the modules, but it also supports modules

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
that when you split it, you can then pop in modules in that open area,

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
like a track point module or a track ball or touch pad.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I could see that being nice in a really cramped space.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
And then like the launch and other keyboards out there,

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
it comes with a cross-platform what they call agent to set up the keys,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
modify what they do, move things around.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
And of course, I had to move things around,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
and then I had to remap it using the software.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
That aspect of it is not nearly as nice as the launch software.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
It took me a while just to kind of figure out how to wrap my head around,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
how to just get it to apply to the profile I was using and all that,

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
where with the launch, it's just totally self-evident.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
If you're cool with a keyboard that you're going to have to tweak

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
a little bit out of the box to get it working for you,

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
and you're going to have to relearn how to use space and arrow keys,

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
which is a real ball ache when you're in the middle of an email jam

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
and all of a sudden you can't move around.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
That's a big ask right there.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
You're going to have to relearn the space bar.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Yeah. I mean, there's those things about it.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
But it truly is a pleasure to type on.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
They really nailed the typing experience.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
They have what they call their best-in-class double-shot PBT keycaps.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I don't know what that means, but they are nice.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
They feel good on the fingers.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
You can hot swap.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
It comes with a little tool to pull them out.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
They have different customization options you can do,

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
and they have, of course, all the source codes up

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
on their GitHub account for a bunch of it.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
All in all, I think it's probably the nicest keyboard that I can't use.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
And it's a shame because I spent a pretty penny on it.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I actually ordered it before the launch, I believe,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
or maybe just after, I don't recall.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
It had been so long that I'm ashamed to admit I forgot I ordered it

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
until it arrived, and I was like, oh, right.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
I like these ergonomic split keyboards a lot.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
If System76 launched a split ergonomic launch keyboard,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
I'd order one for my RSI.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
And the little feet that they bring with it so you can position it

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
in the right space, in the right area for your hands,

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
however it works best for your wrists, is really nice for that.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
I really wish it had arrow keys because I could live with the mod bar

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
because I could just turn that back into a space bar with the software.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
But the thing that I can't change back is that I have 30 years of instinct

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
of when I need to go modify something in a paragraph,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
my hand just moves to where the arrow keys are

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
before I've even realized I need to use the arrow keys.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
It's not unlearnable, but I have to ask myself why.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
That automatic function I do is very efficient.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
It makes me move around very quick.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Why would I want to change that?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
I don't want to change that.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
It's a silly thing, but I need arrow keys.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Yeah, I'm not sold on this keyboard.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
We did get a lot of recommendations.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I think that was part of it.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
And it's so beautiful.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
I mean, really, if you wanted a machine that you didn't use very often

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
for anything serious, but maybe it was in a public space

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
or in an office somewhere, it's nice, especially with the wood armrests.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
It looks classy.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
But yeah, unfortunately for me, the ultimate hacking keyboard falls short

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
in part not just because of the arrow keys,

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
because in time I could probably learn to hold down mod

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
and then put my hands over O, K, and L.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
But it's like you've got to find that sometimes on the keyboard.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
It takes a second to find O, K, and L.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
I can find WASDAP pretty quick, but O, K, and L takes a little bit longer.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
The arrow keys, I can do it without even looking.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I can run my hand across the keyboard,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
and I immediately know when I'm on the arrow keys.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It's just so efficient.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I can't give that up.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Unfortunately, but I love it.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I don't know if I'm going to keep it.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I may be willing to sell it on the cheap to somebody

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
if they'd like to give it a go.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I haven't really decided, but you can email me,

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
chrissatubitabroadcasting.com if you want to make an offer.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I just love looking at it.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I walk into my office and I look down and I go,

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
wow, that looks cool.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I just don't want to give it up.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
I like it too much.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
lino.com slash coder.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account,

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
and you go there to keep Coder Radio going.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
You know, Linode has been our backend infrastructure

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
for our projects for the last couple of years,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
but you should really take advantage of this $100

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
because it gives you an opportunity to really try the service.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
It really lets you explore it and try it out.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
It's $10, right? It's $100.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
And Linode is a service we enthusiastically endorse here on the show.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
They started in 2003 as one of the very first companies

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
in cloud computing.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Now, 18 years later, they're the largest independent

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
open cloud provider in the world with 11 global data centers

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
serving nearly a million customers.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
But their mission has remained unchanged.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Their focus, stronger and more resolute than ever,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
making cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible to all.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
And it really has led to the best-in-class experience.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
That's really why we host everything there.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It's the performance. It's the support.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
It's the range of options. It's 11 data centers.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
It's the fact they are their own ISP. All that stuff.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
But I know some of you have never deployed a server before.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
It's not something you do on the regular.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
They make it really simple to get started with some one-click deployments, too.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
And Linode has just added a whole bunch.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
I was just looking at a whole bunch of new stuff they've added

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
that you can get up and going in just really seconds.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
I think Nervoushare could be one that we use here at the network.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
Because we're already big fans of their S3 Object Storage over at Linode.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
And now you can put the secure file sharing application

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
that lets you collaborate with employees, partners, or vendors.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
It'll tie in with your Active Directory or G Suite or AWS

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
or other single sign-on services you have.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
So you can easily integrate and manage it.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
And then share files using Linode's Object Storage

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
with a one-click app deployment.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
It's just so great.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
You don't have to be a total pro and DIY this thing if you don't want to.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I mean, you can. You don't have to be.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
So go try it out. linode.com slash coder.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
From the best development tools around, the best support, and a whole lot more.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Go try it for yourself and see why I've been talking about it for a while

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
and why I'm still such a big fan.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
linode.com slash coder.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Get $100 and support the show.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
linode.com slash coder.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
We've got a couple of predictions.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Like, what is going to happen in 2022?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
As if we could guess.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
But I like where your head's at with some of these.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
So let's get them down on the record.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
And if we're lucky, maybe your positive vibes, man,

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
will like go out into the universe, man,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
and like reach Tim Cook, man.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Make this stuff happen.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
So I have two that are better.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
One is a straight up Apple one.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
One is tangentially an Apple one.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah, I suppose.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
I would say my first is that I think they're going to loosen up iPad OS.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
When I say loosen up, I don't actually mean significant technical changes to the APIs.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
I mean, they're just going to fly in some legalized marijuana from Denver to Cupertino

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
and have the review board chill the hell out.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
I think they have to.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
I've been saying for years now that the iPad is a great machine.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
The problem with the iPad has less to do with the implementation of the APIs.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
In the UI, though, of course, there are things that I'd love to see.

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
But realistically, the biggest barrier before any of that is just the puritanical

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
this is not a computer, even though we run multi-million dollar TV commercials

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
saying it's a computer position of the review board.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
I like where you're at.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Let me see if I got this.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
So you're thinking it's an unofficial laxing.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
They never have to go up on stage and say iPad OS can now do this.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
It's just somebody ends up shipping an app, pushes the limits a little bit,

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
and people take notice, and then more people start doing that?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah, basically.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
I mean, I think what's going to happen is we're going to have less non-BSC rejections

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
mostly because of the pressure they're facing and some of the controversies.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
They need, I think, some marquee apps, particularly around AR,

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
if they're going to make their push into the virtual or augmented reality markets.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
iPad seems like the most logical place for that in terms of professional work.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
They don't have to do much to do this, right, to satisfy this.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
And they've come closer than they've ever been.

21:46.000 --> 21:53.000
I think the big hiccup is going to be what do they think the iPad is?

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
And if you listen to their marketing, they think it's a computer.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
And that is basically that plus the pressure from the government.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
And let's not forget the good old EU who's always eager to bitch slap an American company, right?

22:07.000 --> 22:14.000
I mean, by the way, the EU always slaps, but they hit as hard as my five-year-old.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
At least when we do it, we take people out.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Although we never do it because, you know, lizard people.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Please don't comment on the lizard people thing.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
F*** the EU.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
There she is. It's been so long.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
No, but seriously, do.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I mean, why not?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
It seems insane for them not to.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
And also, the difference between an iPad and a MacBook Air is ever so small these days.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
True.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
There's a lot to this.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Here's the other thing to consider as well.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
You really, you kind of, you were touching on it there for a second.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
But I think Apple agrees with you.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
The iPad is an AR development machine.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Sure is.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
They shipped the LiDAR sensor there first.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I think that was their statement.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
They were positioning this, think of this as an AR development machine.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
I think there will be something they announce on stage in regards to this.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Okay.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
And I think you're right.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
There's no policy change.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
They're just going to be different kinds of apps start getting approved that haven't been approved before.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
I think you're right.

23:09.000 --> 23:16.000
And I think additionally, call me crazy, I think they're going to allow floating windows on iPad OS.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Yep.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Or at least tiling.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I mean, they have ghetto tiling now, but yep.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Yeah.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
But you know, when they introduced that quick note feature, that is a floating window on iPad OS.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
That's a floating window.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
That's a floating – isn't it just so?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
It's almost like the 80s are back.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Yep.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
It's great.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
I could see that.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
And then I could see them down the road when they have a VR AR product.

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
I could see them pushing iPad Pros as this is your professional AR development machine.

23:43.000 --> 23:50.000
And there's going to be edge cases where some reviewer does something stupid because people are human and they have lots and lots of reviewers, right?

23:50.000 --> 24:05.000
But I think they're going to go less from we will approve you if we feel like it to no, we – with a big caveat now of do not fork with their 30% commission or 15% depending on how you do it, right?

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
As long as you're not trying to get away from paying big daddy Tim his cut, I think you're all right.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
As long as there isn't explicitly a rule against it, I think that's going to become the new standard.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
You know what it is? It's the normalization of the play and the app store.

24:21.000 --> 24:28.000
Like the play store has become more like the app store and the app store is going to become more like the play store and they're going to essentially kind of meet in the middle.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Yeah, because neither of them – obviously the play store is Google.

24:32.000 --> 24:38.000
Neither of them can justify being arbitrary and capricious anymore because if they do that, her name is Elizabeth.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
She's from, is it Maine or Massachusetts?

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
Her last name is Warren and she's really, really eager to give them a nice slap.

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
Yeah, it is within their best interest to sort of act in unison in regards to policies and moves in their app stores now.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Like AT&T and Verizon, I don't even want to touch it.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Just going to leave it there. Just leave it there.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
You know it.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
All right, so that kind of leads into your next area of pontification.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah, so I pretty much hinted at it, right?

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
I think Congress in particular and of course our favorite, the EU.

25:12.000 --> 25:21.000
Oh, the sweet, sweet, idealistic EU is going to try to continue to cause trouble for the big tech five.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Oh, yeah.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
I think the EU will get some blood out of them in terms of fines, but again, Apple literally in particular couldn't care less.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
They just today are a $3 trillion company according to The Verge.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
So, hey, fine me a couple million, right? It's a bar tab.

25:34.000 --> 25:46.000
But I think because these are not stupid people with the exception of Facebook, whose business model is just so inherently evil that it's hard for them to seem less evil, too much.

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
I think they're going to find ways to avoid basically any real regulation, right?

25:52.000 --> 26:11.000
So Apple, like I just said, loosen up, voluntarily allow certain kinds of out of app store purchases, but make it such a crappy experience that any sane, particularly indie developer or smaller developer would use your in-app purchase system because it really doesn't make sense at a certain scale.

26:11.000 --> 26:18.000
Amazon, you know, don't maybe be so open about how hardcore you cloned pop sockets or those weird laptop stands, right?

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Like maybe not have that email thread.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
Bezos is out, man. He's out. He knows where that's going.

26:24.000 --> 26:32.000
But I mean, it sounds like you're thinking the regulation and antitrust stuff, at least when it comes to the big tech companies, probably really has no teeth in 2022.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
It's not really we're not seeing anything until 2023, perhaps.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
But that puts it dangerously close to election politics as well.

26:39.000 --> 26:48.000
I think the one exception is actually going to be Apple because they are riding high on the MacBook Pro M1 train with developers in that community.

26:48.000 --> 26:55.000
You're starting to convince me that maybe they will say something at WWDC or as I call it, Zoom dot app.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
I know. Hey, at least they do a decent one. You got to give them credit.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
Theirs is the best. Sets the bar.

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
I tuned into some of Ignite, which is Microsoft's. It was not very good.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Yeah, well, I've tuned into a lot of the free software community events.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
I can't even imagine because they're using Ogg.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
So, you know, what's become the norm is just tons of downtime between speakers like they'll just put a standby screen up.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
And it's OK that there's just like dead air for like an hour.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
And like as a remote viewer, it's a totally crap experience.

27:24.000 --> 27:32.000
The first time that happened to me, I actually thought my stream had crashed in the same vein as predictions.

27:32.000 --> 27:52.000
Mark Gurman predicted that Apple can complete their silicon transition in 2022 and that the Mac Pro may have up to 40 CPU cores and 128 graphics cores and will be less expandable and customizable than the Intel.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
And he says they're going to be all done with the Intel stuff by WWDC.

27:58.000 --> 28:07.000
So aggressive. I mean, he's usually pretty good, but damn, that's a by June in five months.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
I could buy it if Apple wanted to get everything on the M1 version.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
And this is like they're ready to start working on the M2 platform.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
And so they just want to get this transition done, perhaps.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I mean, the software is in a really good place.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
So it's really just a matter of how big can they and a quick can they scale these things out?

28:26.000 --> 28:36.000
If that's true, they will have achieved something that nobody else has been able to achieve since the beginning of the industry, which is a basically seamless processor transition.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Yeah, with the one exception of virtualizing Windows.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
But if you're Apple, you probably don't care that much.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
I kind of feel like they could already claim that it would be impressive if they completed it for all of their line.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
That would be more impressive.

28:49.000 --> 29:01.000
But what they've accomplished already, I think, should be studied because I find indications of it going back at least five or six years of them preparing the way for this transition to make this doable.

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
It explains the crappy MacBooks and the Mac stagnating for so long because they were working on this.

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
I don't think a lot of companies can stick to something like that, like Apple did.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
It was a complete ecosystem preparation from Xcode to the App Store to all of it.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
It's very well done.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
It was even better done than the PowerPC to Intel transition.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
Just the way Xcode compiles now, and it's been that way for four years because we talked about it on the show, bytecode, right?

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
It compiles all the versions of your app into bytecode, which then when it goes through the App Store gives you the right version.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Seemed a little weird before.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
We thought it was about ARM64 versus ARM32.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
It's really about Intel versus ARM.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Well, it was about both.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Both, right? Well, it does it all. Yeah.

29:43.000 --> 29:52.000
And you could see them preparing it in Mac OS as well, dropping 32-bit support a few versions ago and kind of having people eat the sandwiches early.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
That way, all of those really bad transitions were mostly done by the time the new silicon came.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
And that was really their most clever part.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
Several times they had their users eat a sandwich in order to make the transition down the road smoother.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
So the two did not get associated.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
Also, just a side note before we get to resolutions.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
It also came out that Apple is giving talent bonuses of up to $180,000.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Yes.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
To get staff to not flee to meta.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Are they really fleeing to meta?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
That's what the reports say.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
But, you know, there's always been those reports that it's like a back and forth between Apple and Facebook.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
That's always been a thing they say.

30:28.000 --> 30:34.000
But they're doing them as surprise, surprise stock packages that invest over time.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Of course.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Yeah.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Yeah.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
So it's like 25% annually.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
So you've got to stick around for at least four years.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Business?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
To get your money.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Yeah.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
But then again, you know what?

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
$180,000 of Apple stock.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
You could give me worse things than that.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Maybe my dream will come true.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
A partnership between Apple and Gnustep and System76 will port it.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Resolutions.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Let's talk.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Like, I have a resolution for 2022.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
Don't get stuck in Tucson and don't get stuck in a blizzard.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I feel like you should just avoid Tucson.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Yeah.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
Actually, legitimately, my resolution this year is to just not be in extreme weather conditions.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Good luck.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
It's rougher on you than you think.

31:17.000 --> 31:24.000
I am still, even though I got out on Thursday and today is Monday as we record, I'm still dehydrated from the experience.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
It's not great.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
So that's my resolution.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Can I make a recommendation?

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Yeah.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Alkaline water.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Oh, yeah.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Okay.

31:32.000 --> 31:39.000
My resolution for the rest of my Florida days, if I'm out in the yard, one glass of Alkaline water does about as much, feels like it does of like two or three.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
And it has electrolytes and minerals in it.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
So it wakes you.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
It's like Gatorade without all the sugar.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
It's got what my body needs.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Got what you need.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Nice.

31:46.000 --> 31:52.000
That's my resolution is to try not to have to force myself into horrible, horrible environment.

31:52.000 --> 32:00.000
You know, it was not appreciating how serious those situations are and letting like all these other factors dictate where we went at what time.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
And, you know, just family scheduling and stuff like that, too.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
So, smarter this year.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I have two.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
The first is I would like to not re-implement Clippy again.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I've done it several times.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
I think I need to stop.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
You personally?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Me personally.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Okay.

32:17.000 --> 32:26.000
It's a big time sink because we all make fun of Clippy, but a modern Clippy that does a bunch of stuff is actually super, super complicated.

32:26.000 --> 32:34.000
And I also never like go in thinking I'm reinventing Clippy, but I always end there.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
And it's such a waste of time, energy and money that I just need to not do it.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
How do you know then?

32:39.000 --> 32:45.000
If you if you don't realize when you start out that all roads lead to Clippy, how do you not end up there?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
I have the goal.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
I don't have the means yet.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
So I will try to figure that out for you.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
The second is related.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
If I wasn't rewriting Clippy a hundred times, I might actually ship more.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
So ship more is the other one.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Ship more.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
I would like to ship.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
In particular, I would actually like to ship an iOS app this year just to get my hands dirty again.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I've been doing the Swift challenge.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Oh, sweet, sweet Xcode.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
I had to update Xcode, which was far more challenging than you would think.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
We were chatting about that.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
It takes time even on these brand new fast systems.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Just ridiculous.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
And also Swift compile times.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
They can humble an M1 pretty quickly.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
I can't even imagine what they would have been like on an old MacBook Air.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Loud.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Loud.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
That's good.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
I like both those.

33:31.000 --> 33:37.000
I feel like if I were to think about business resolutions, mine would be to get regular about my sponsor game.

33:37.000 --> 33:43.000
Really, no one was interested in talking about sponsorship stuff in like the December time period.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
So like we're down to like one sponsor in a show.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Not good.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
You know, not good.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
I mean, I'm glad we I'm grateful we have members.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
Let me tell you, Jupiter party to support the network.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
It's just like something I have to get in a regular routine about.

33:55.000 --> 34:08.000
And I also I wouldn't say it's a resolution, but I do know I'm going to work at also trying to get better about regular swag and just general income diversification for the diversification for the whole network.

34:08.000 --> 34:14.000
I'm not like trying to raise money and and all that kind of stuff in like some sort of really aggressive way, but just to make sure we're good and safe.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
We're, you know, 16, 17 months now into being independent.

34:18.000 --> 34:25.000
And I'd say the first 12 months were a real scramble just to kind of well, not 12, but the first four or five months sure were.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
And then after that, it was like, OK, do we have this regular thing figured out and what do we need to fine tune?

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
And now I'm kind of looking at it and going, OK, how do I grow this thing?

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
So that way, like I can start getting myself health insurance and that kind of stuff.

34:37.000 --> 34:44.000
And so that's kind of where I think I'll probably go in a business standpoint over 2022 is, you know, I need to get that done.

34:44.000 --> 34:53.000
I'm turning 40 at the end of the month. My calculation was is that I was probably young enough to risk it for a while, but I feel like at 40.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
It's time I start going in, getting things checked out and, you know, that kind of thing.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Happy early birthday. Thank you.

34:58.000 --> 35:07.000
So that's my kind of goal over the years to just kind of figure out a way to diversify income streams a little bit and bring them up to a more regular basis.

35:07.000 --> 35:12.000
And then then no, I can afford like the whatever it's going to be, the two grand or whatever, because, you know, my my wife's a diabetic.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
So, yeah, it's not cheap. Not nine seventy five a month.

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
One guy and a five year old is probably not particularly great, I imagine.

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
I don't know. I mean, maybe this is business stuff, but self-employed like you. Right. So it's Obamacare.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
Yeah, right. Well, the market, whether they renamed it, the shop market, whatever they call it now, it's Obamacare.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
But yeah, I should get something. I can't rely on Bitcoin as my emergency fund.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
The price is dropping all the time. Although how do we bought Bitcoin when it first came out?

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
We not only we would be thriving on it, forget relying on it.

35:43.000 --> 35:50.000
You know, that's what a lot of this Web three stuff is, is these guys that made a bunch of money and gals made a bunch of money off of Bitcoin and now throwing it around because they're millionaires.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Oh, I guess good for them.

35:52.000 --> 35:58.000
But it is the new year. And with that, there are software bugs. I just thought I'd mention this before we got out of here.

35:58.000 --> 36:10.000
A lot of exchange admins were grappling with a bug in a malware scanning part of exchange that prevented email sending because because, well, it became the year 2022.

36:10.000 --> 36:15.000
It's like it's like the Y2K bug all over again. I'll have a link in the show notes for information about that.

36:15.000 --> 36:23.000
It was a bug in the FIPFS scanning service, which, man, I haven't used exchange in so long. I don't even know.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
But it just came down to a software bug because they used an IT32 in there.

36:28.000 --> 36:36.000
So exchange servers, you know, the ones that are on premise around the world, the older ones just as the new year came.

36:36.000 --> 36:42.000
I don't mean to laugh. I'm sorry. I really don't mean to laugh for those of you who got bit by this, but it's kind of funny.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
This is one hell of a software bug.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
It's a little funny. It is a little funny.

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
Microsoft's got an emergency fix they've issued. It only took them a few days.

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
Listen, who needs email? Yeah, right. It's the holidays. You shouldn't be checking your email anyways.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
Microsoft was worried about everybody's work life balance around the holidays.

37:01.000 --> 37:08.000
And if they told you about it, people had asked them to remove it. So they got to sneak it in like this. You should be thanking them. That's right.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
All right, Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send people this week?

37:11.000 --> 37:18.000
Go to alice.dev. Start off that new year by getting rid of that old data source database or crappy proprietary thing you're using.

37:18.000 --> 37:24.000
Amen to that. Thank you to our Coder QA team out there, coderqa.co, keeping us going even when the ad sales are down.

37:57.000 --> 38:03.000
Holidays mean the inbox goes dry. So you're back at work now. That means send us an email.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
