00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 458 for March 21st, 2022.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Hey there, you look nice today and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
My name is Chris and our righteous host joining us from the lands of Florida is Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Righteous. The sinners will burn on the stakes of the M1 Ultra.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
I've been reading a book recently called The Righteous Mind. I just picked it up, I think on a listener recommendation.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
And it's been giving me great insights into my children, actually. It's interesting.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
By children, he means my late night Slack messages.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
No, no. No, man. So, you know, of course, the chat room is talking about the fact that Apple's down today.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
I mean, kind of as we're recording, it's kind of it's coming back together. They're kind of getting things back up.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
But big iCloud outage today. Big iCloud outage.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
It's all those Mac Studio purchases are killing them.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
That's the other topic that everybody's chewing on this morning as we record,

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
is that someone finally decided to crack open their six thousand dollar Mac Studio, discovered removable storage.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
You could actually see the SSD and pull it out. But it turns out Apple software prevents it from being replaced.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
It seems they've intentionally put something in there, probably some sort of key or something like that,

01:30.000 --> 01:38.000
that when you swap out the storage or if you use the second slot, so you put in a second disk in the second slot,

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
system will not even boot. It just blinks SOS on the front.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Not only will not boot, it thinks it's under fire.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah. And, you know, people this reminded everyone that Apple made all these commitments about improving the Apple repair program for Macs.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
And there's like nothing that's happened from that.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
So and of course, this absolutely has a right to repair angle.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
And when you dig in there, you very quickly discover that the power supply is not covered.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
So capacitors and stuff are just exposed right there in the Mac Studio, likely for cooling reasons.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
I mean, there's legitimately probably a reason and they don't expect you to go in there.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
But the end result is that it makes it hazardous for any casual to open it up and do any repairs,

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
which just sort of stinks because Apple makes so much noise about environmental friendliness.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
You know, they don't even ship power bricks anymore.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
They do this reduced packaging stuff all for the environment.

02:30.000 --> 02:39.000
But yet something like this where you actually have two removable disks that could be replaced by the user and serviced and they've blocked that.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
Or like things that make it dangerous to open up the machine where you could actually shock yourself and injure yourself.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
It's right to repair hostile and.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm going to call it here, the Mac Studio is going to be a flop.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
I could be wrong on this one, so I only give this a 50 50 shop shot.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah, I do think so. I think this is going to be the de facto workhorse of small studios, right?

03:03.000 --> 03:13.000
Game Dev, regular dev design that are in person. Now it's that it's that has, you know, the quote that are in person part that maybe you might have something.

03:13.000 --> 03:23.000
But I don't know, man. I think the Mac Studio for a lot of workers with the studio display with its microphone array and the speakers built in probably makes for a very solid video conferencing machine.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
I mean, it's a very expensive one, but companies love to blow money on stuff. But here's why I think it's going to fail.

03:28.000 --> 03:35.000
I agree with you. Everything you said is right under the assumption that Apple doesn't kill this after V1.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
But I think they're going to iMac Pro this thing. And the reason is they blew it on the introduction.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Anyone who wanted to buy this thing shot their load on the MacBook Pro Max.

03:44.000 --> 03:53.000
Speaking for myself here, like I was waiting for Apple to rev the M1 platform for professionals, and they did that with the 16 inch MacBook Max.

03:53.000 --> 04:03.000
And so I went in on that one and I think a lot of people did. And there's just not quite enough incentive to get the studio unless you need the Ultra.

04:03.000 --> 04:15.000
And if you need the Ultra, you're a very limited set of buyers. So this thing's going to get an initial surge in purchases and then the channel is going to go dry because they have like a ridiculously expensive monitor to go with it.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
That also hampers the sales. I think they have home potted this thing and they're going to pull an iMac Pro on it.

04:21.000 --> 04:31.000
Easy for me to say, but it needed to be introduced with the MacBook Max. If you're going to blow three or four grand on a machine, you're only doing that once every few years.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
So you're saying the people that would buy this would probably just go to the MacBook Pro because the performance characteristics are relatively similar.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
And you get the XDR display and you really get a whole lot of nice things with the MacBook Pro.

04:43.000 --> 04:54.000
I'll say like if I were buying today, I'd probably go towards the studio. And now that Asahi Linux actually has an alpha installer, that seems like that'd be a pretty slick setup all in.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
But it's extremely expensive. And I think because it's so expensive, it already is limited to a very niche audience.

05:00.000 --> 05:10.000
And because they've already sold a system that's very expensive to that niche audience, they've essentially emptied the channel of most the sales except for people that need something for very high end video production.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
And that's just not tens of millions of people. That's just tens of thousands of people.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Well, I mean, I guess this is the test case, right? People have been saying they want like a lower end Mac Pro forever, right?

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
Since the early Aughts ones went off the market, were I think like 2010 months, right? We'll see.

05:25.000 --> 05:35.000
You do that with an $800 monitor and a $3,000 system. At that price, you could literally, you could literally afford to buy that for every new hire going forward, right?

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
But that the prices they're at now, it's just still not really a viable option for most of us, at least not for every hire.

05:41.000 --> 05:53.000
I don't know. I just I'm concerned about it. I feel like this Mac Studio seeing some of the feedback now after a couple of weeks in, I think a version two is the one to buy if you're in this market.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
And I worry you'll get some initial burst of sales and then people like me are going to say, oh, this is great, but it needs removable storage.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
That's something they got to address. If I'm going to buy a $6,000 computer, I want to be able to replace the storage maybe four or five years into it and get a few more years.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
And it's very likely this M1 platform is going to be supported for a very long time because it's the initial transition chip.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
And Apple has historically supported that platform for nearly a decade when it was during the power PC to Intel transition.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
So it's a machine that could really stick around. But, you know, two terabytes and you're done, right? It's just sort of silly.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
So I think there's some improvements they could make that could also make it look a little better.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
And that's going to be in a version two. No doubt about it. But I don't I don't know if it'll make it that far.

06:34.000 --> 06:46.000
And because it has essentially lineage to the Mac Mini, we're also totally unpegged to any release schedule because the Mac Mini has has gone sometimes what feels like 25 years between releases.

06:46.000 --> 06:56.000
Well, but that's a great point, though. The Mac Mini, right? It does this become the you own an iOS development company and you need a bunch of compute to build the Apple specific stuff, right?

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
Whatever the Apple VR thing is. And you just rack a bunch of these bad boys up. I could see that. I could see people putting in a rack.

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
All right. Can I can I cry a little bit? I have my feelings, please. I just spent twenty four hundred dollars on a Mac Mini for this very purpose.

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
Whoa, a mini, huh? A week before the studio came out. Oh, no, I have yet to open it because stupid reasons.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
I've been busy and I tried to return it and they're like, lol, kittens. Now you're a day out.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah, I'm super pissed because I would have much preferred the studio for exactly now.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
The mini will be fine, right? This is me being a little bit of a pony about this, but I could see a bunch of these racked up.

07:34.000 --> 07:43.000
Yeah, I could see a bunch of initial sales to studios that are waiting. Think of Mac Studio, Mac Studio dot com would probably buy like a whole pile of these, right?

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
I'm just saying I could totally see it. I could see the Mac Colo guys going in hard on something like this.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
Come with me on this journey. Should I should I listen and stay a while?

07:53.000 --> 08:06.000
Oh, this is a story about the future. Like I mentioned in passing as it was casual that I'm only buying employees laptops now, but those laptops are not like hardcore ball and high, you know, compute laptops.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
They're basically base MacBook Pro equivalents. A lot of most of them are System 76.

08:12.000 --> 08:23.000
Some of them are going to be MacBook Airs, but the build is going to be just like either in my house or at the office if we keep the office right on.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
You know, we have our array of Linux servers and we're going to have some Mac servers, too.

08:28.000 --> 08:37.000
So that and we have an email about this hybrid work thing. I've totally given up on hybrid. We're just full remote. We've been full remote for a while, but given up.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
You've given up. Wow.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
It's just it's just, you know, you can't in today's market.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
First, we hinted at this a little bit last week for a small business.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
I just lost some people and they literally got their wages almost doubled to be poached away.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
Any overhead you can cut as a small business that doesn't have, you know, thick, juicy with two C's margins.

08:59.000 --> 09:10.000
You got to cut. And, you know, people don't need three thousand dollar laptops if they could just build it on a home server or not home as in their house. But home is centralized.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
So anonymous writes in about hybrid work. I work for Google and I found your return to office comments. Interesting.

09:17.000 --> 09:25.000
Hybrid working is the worst of all solutions. The employee is demanded to provide their address so they can calculate commuting distance.

09:25.000 --> 09:34.000
Of course, always trying to look at all of the possible angles. You get the flexibility of working from your cramped overpriced place for two to three days as a as a return.

09:34.000 --> 09:42.000
The truth is, all employees benefits have been built around the office. Free meals, free snacks, free massages, free gym, et cetera, et cetera.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
And during the pandemic, it's been more clear to people that without the office benefits, well, there just aren't very many benefits.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
I enjoy the show as always. And I think different opinions are always healthy.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
So anonymous here says that at least with their experience at Google, this hybrid work thing just isn't working very well.

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
And it does sound like they're kind of all up their butts about details. That's something I noticed with the Microsoft one, too.

10:06.000 --> 10:16.000
You know, I got a DM very similar to this about someone who was saying that they're letting people work from home, but you have to install the software on your in there.

10:16.000 --> 10:28.000
But apparently a PC shop, a window shop that monitor. Do you ever hear this monitors your keystroke, records a screen, keeps the camera and microphone on while you're logged into the computer the entire time?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
To me, that's such a gross invasion of privacy.

10:31.000 --> 10:43.000
We got a note from a listener who just says, you know, what I've done is I have two machines at my desk and I have one machine that is just my work machine that they have their software on that I don't do anything else on.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
And then right next to it, I have my laptop with all my stuff, all my chats, all my emails. And of course, right? Of course.

10:50.000 --> 10:58.000
So what what's going to happen next? They're going to demand that you install their firewall so that way they can do packet analysis and all of your traffic and measure how much time you spent transmitting.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
Don't even put that into the right. Right. When you're like a 16 year old son is looking at porn, they're going to say, seriously.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Well, yeah, that would just that's just it. How would you? Yeah. How would you know?

11:08.000 --> 11:22.000
Actually, they might think it's the CEO's traffic, though, and say nothing. Who knows? Speaking of messages, we got some feedback about RCS, including from some folks that have been having issues with RCS for a couple of years now, but just felt like nobody was talking about it.

11:22.000 --> 11:30.000
And Reese wrote in and says, you know, I couldn't help myself but just mention that if Google just implemented Matrix on every Android phone, they could solve this whole messaging thing.

11:30.000 --> 11:38.000
Apple would be free to support Matrix protocols in iMessage, or you could just run any of the many Matrix apps on the iPhone.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
Right. So Apple is free to not support Matrix as well on iMessage, which they never would. And you still have the same problem.

11:45.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah, I agree that it would be I think Google should probably at this point, if I were if I were brought in, Mr. Fisher, we've hired you as a consultant.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
And I sat down with them at their big boardroom after I had my free lunch, I would tell them to jump on board with Matrix.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
I actually think that is the way to go or something like they should have just stuck with XMPP back in the day.

12:05.000 --> 12:13.000
But just get on board something that developers can start building apps around that can be integrated into desktop services, all this stuff.

12:13.000 --> 12:21.000
It worked in the past. I would just go that route. And I would say make it something that isn't carrier controlled, that can't be influenced by the carrier.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
And then I would collect my hundred thousand dollar fee or whatever it would be, probably two hundred thousand.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
And, you know, jump on my private jet they booked for me and come back to the studio.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
That would be how it would go down. And that's, you know, they could just listen to the show and save themselves some time.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
But I do want to mention. I'm going to do a live stream on March 31st, 4 p.m.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Seattle time, 7 p.m. Mike time, 11 p.m.

12:44.000 --> 12:51.000
London. And I want to help people get the element client set up to connect to the Jupiter broadcasting matrix.

12:51.000 --> 13:06.000
It's growing quite significantly. And everything we've talked about on the show about platform control and consolidation and centralization that has just been putting the squeeze on everything has made me kind of appreciate the fact that we run the matrix server.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
It's a decentralized federated system that is not subject to these particular problems.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
And I find that probably the horse to bet on over the long term.

13:15.000 --> 13:30.000
When I look at I was talking about this this morning in Matrix over the last 15 years, we have used so many different things from crazy PHP BB forums to IRC servers and all different Viber chat.

13:30.000 --> 13:37.000
I mean, just all kinds of crazy different things. Discord, Telegram, IRC, on and on and on.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
When you've been around for so long, you can't help but have jumped a few platforms because things come and go.

13:42.000 --> 13:50.000
But when I look at like the next 15 years, I think the horse to bet on is the decentralized platform that we run and control ourselves.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
And the nice thing about it is we can run our own matrix server. You could run your own matrix server or you could not.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
You could just use matrix.org. And, you know, it's like you can run your own IRC server or you could just not.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
You could connect to an IRC server and create your account there. And I like that about it.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
So I want to help people adopt it. It's a little bit of an onboard pain in the ass, in my opinion.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
I think that slows the adoption. So join me on March 31st at jblive.tv.

14:13.000 --> 14:21.000
I think I'll have the Mumble Room open, too. So if you're out there in the audience and would like to help me help people because I can see it getting a little bogged down.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
Please do join me and we'll help people get on a decentralized messaging platform.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
It's not great. I'm going to admit you're selling this super hard.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
I think this is really this is the problem of some of these, you know, platform software technologies, whatever you want to call it, like free stuff.

14:36.000 --> 14:44.000
Sometimes doesn't have the absolute best onboarding experience or maybe doesn't have quite the optimizations that something might have or whatever.

14:44.000 --> 14:51.000
You know, like Discord is a probably snappier, nicer looking UI. I don't love it, but it's probably to the masses.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Yeah. And elements a little it's a little more IRC, a little more slack.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
Can I ask like the old man question here? What's wrong with IRC?

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
Well, the users have moved on for one. I think, too, it's like it's like you could ask that same thing like, why not IRC over slack?

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Yeah, I think it's in part because you can have one server with a lot of different channels.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
So like there's two coder rate. There's a Coder Radio general chat and a Coder Radio feedback channel.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
So you can have like two separate and one of them isn't even on our server.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
It was created by the community earlier, but you can bring them all into one place in one interface.

15:21.000 --> 15:32.000
If I want to troll the community as you know, Chris, I'm getting older. My troll energy, you know, guys, when you hit a certain age, your edgelord energy might start to flag.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
You have to pick one chat protocol. Now, I used to get a lot of good on Telegram.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
The problem is there's too many people on Telegram and I can never figure out how to catch up.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
Yeah. And it's single threaded. It's one room. Right. That's the problem.

15:45.000 --> 15:54.000
In Matrix, if I were to, I don't know, like send oil photographs of oil paintings of Steve Jobs, would that be effective?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Yeah, probably very effective. Very, very effective. Yeah.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I need some onboarding instructions.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Yeah. All right. You'll join me on Friday.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Wait, is it Thursday? I think it's a Thursday. It's the 31st.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I'm in Florida. We don't even have a calendar, so don't worry.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Okay. There you go.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Okay. And our last email of the week comes in from Brandon.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
I wanted to just touch on the Windows 11 ARM experience that we were kind of skeptical about.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
He says he picked himself up the HP Elite folio.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
It's that fancy one that's wrapped in vegan leather.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
It's the vegan laptop. Yes.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah. It's got a Snapdragon 8CX, 16 gigs of RAM, a 4G modem on the SoC.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
So it's, you know. That's not bad. That's not bad.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah. He says it's like he got it as like the chuck in the bag and go machine.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
And overall experience is good. OS is snappy.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
It's vegan. It has powers. I mean, obviously.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
The performance, he says, is comparable to a 10th Gen Core i3.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Just to kind of give you an idea.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
Kind of one of the mortal wounds, though, is no Visual Studio.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
So that's kind of a non-starter for a lot of people.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Yes, because it's the only reason to run Windows. What?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
What do you mean not everybody?

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
Here's the thing, though. This is the reason I want it.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
This is what got me excited.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
The biggest advantage is running WSL.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
You fire up WSL, sounds obvious, but you get the ARM versions of your Linux stuff.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
So packages, Docker containers, etc.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
He says it's super beneficial for managing his home pie cluster.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
He can test and build software in WSL and then just deployed on the pies.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I love this dude for having a home pie cluster.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
I know.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Brandon, can you write it next week?

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
I want to know exactly what's going on with the pie cluster.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Like what pies are we talking about and what are they doing?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Are they doing one task like as a unit?

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Or is this like he said cluster, right?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
So they're probably doing one thing. But yeah.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
So, you know what else you can do this on the right?

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
You could do it on an M1 under virtualized Linux.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
And you'd have 20 hours of battery life.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
All right.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
Well, Ray sent us a boost yesterday for a thousand sats, which works out to be about nearly 42 cents.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
I don't know if he intended that to be the universal answer.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
Hey, guys, regarding productivity tips, I thought I'd throw out my recommendation for an ultra wide monitor.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
I always thought they were a gimmick.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
But after using one briefly at my company, I had to get one for home.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
My office is a tiny nook in the corner of a living room.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
And so the ultra wide allows me to have all the benefits of dual monitors without the space or power.

18:17.000 --> 18:25.000
I can view multiple text files at once, browse code with a video call running or even open one of those terrible side scrolling Excel spreadsheets with ease.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Uh huh.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
It's pretty amazing for RTS games like Age of Empires.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
Looking at you, Mike, that's what I'm talking about right there. Yeah. Keep up the good work, guys.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
I haven't missed an episode in seven years and I'll see you and Raleigh next month.

18:38.000 --> 18:45.000
So I also wanted to plus one this boost here and say I did the same thing.

18:45.000 --> 18:54.000
I had like there was some maybe it's Black Friday or something or some sale for like this crazy wide 32 or 36 inch Samsung monitor.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
And I wanted it for the home office in my RV.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
And I have the same thing I didn't I was attempting to do dual monitors with a visa mount thing.

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
You know, I was trying all that, but it's just a lot to load and unload and set up every time I move where this is just pick up the monitor and tuck it away.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
And it is great. I can fit Slack, Element and Telegram right next to each other.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
I can have a huge Web page open with the code going.

19:19.000 --> 19:25.000
It is so much real estate and in some ways I almost prefer it to multiple monitors.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
It's pretty great. So I have to totally agree with Ray.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
And if you want to send us a boost, go get an app that supports it at new podcast apps dot com.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
And you heard Ray mentioned the East Coast meetup.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
We are putting together a meetup in Raleigh, North Carolina, really just outside of Raleigh.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
And we have the address and details at meetup dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
We've got 64 confirmed, which means we're either going to have 100 or 30.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I'm not sure which way it's going to go.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
I noticed that when Michael Dominic announced he was going, the numbers shot up.

19:56.000 --> 20:02.000
They just went way up. So we'll see. We'll see.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
Although I think, you know, if you go, it's going to wreck the show. My personal opinion.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
Luckily for you, my child care has already welshed, so I'm scrambling to find another solution.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
Oh, stay tuned and find out. Will he make it? Only time will tell.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
Linode dot com slash coder. Go there to get one hundred dollars and 60 day credit towards a new account.

20:21.000 --> 20:33.000
And you go there to support the show. Simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode's Linux virtual machines and tools to develop, deploy and scale modern applications faster and easier.

20:33.000 --> 20:39.000
I was just goofing around before the show because I've recently fallen in love with NixOS.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
And so I thought, could I deploy NixOS on Linode?

20:41.000 --> 20:49.000
And yes, this is one of the things I think Linode is great about because I don't think NixOS is in the dropdown list when you go to deploy a machine.

20:49.000 --> 21:01.000
But they definitely have a comprehensive, well-structured guide that not only walks you through installing NixOS, which I kind of wish I knew about this when I started using NixOS.

21:01.000 --> 21:09.000
This guide is really great, but they also tell you how to ninja it onto the Linode, even though it's not like one of their official images.

21:09.000 --> 21:16.000
That's how Linode rolls. They'll tell you how to get it on there and they make it totally possible, which is so awesome.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
And this is a great guide in general if you want to experiment with NixOS.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
This really just sort of goes to what I love about Linode.

21:23.000 --> 21:32.000
They have just fantastic customer support that goes beyond just a 365 first tier support that answers the phone.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
And it extends into just documentation like this.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
I mean, geez, if I was the project, I think I would just link people to this.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
I'll put a link to this in the show notes so you can see what I'm talking about.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
You know, the great thing, too, about Linode is performance.

21:44.000 --> 21:51.000
They have SSD storage and now they also have MVME PCIe storage if you need just crazy fast throughput.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
They got 11 data centers around the world.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
They are their own ISP.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
You bring all that together and it creates a very, very competitive package.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
So it's pretty remarkable when I say it's 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the large hyperscalers.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
They're just trying to lock you into their platform, right?

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
They're trying to get you into their ecosystem.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
That's not how Linode rolls.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
There's few companies that really offer this value proposition today and Linode is the best out there.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
So go try them out. See what I've been talking about.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Support the show and get that $100.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
You can actually kick the tires with that.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Rubber is more expensive than ever.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
That $100 is really like $200 if you follow my math.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
So go try it out and support the show.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Linode.com slash coder.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
Well, how about a little App Store Monopoly update?

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
It seems that there is an upcoming EU sideloading bill that Apple says will, quote,

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
cripple the privacy and security protections of iPhone users.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Very measured response. Very calm.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Totally doesn't sound petulant.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
Doesn't sound exaggerating at all.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
They're not mad. They're just concerned. Yes.

22:59.000 --> 23:08.000
Do you remember when we played CFED and he was going on and on about how if this digital market acts went through,

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
it would destroy the iPhone and he said some really creepy stuff up on that stage and we had to play the cringy clips here.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I'll save that.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
If you guys want to go find that in the back catalog, go to notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com and just search for Craig.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
It's pretty bad.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
It was like he was going all in.

23:21.000 --> 23:27.000
It was the most disingenuous thing I've ever heard that man say and it actually made me lose a lot of respect for that guy.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
If you can sideload on your iPhone, you will never hear from your mother again.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
Your grandma will die and your puppy will become a cat.

23:36.000 --> 23:43.000
But it appears that Apple's begging and pleading has sort of fallen on deaf ears because it's kind of moving forward

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
and Apple's going to be required to allow customers in Europe to download apps outside the App Store if it goes through.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
And they also have to allow developers to use alternative purchase methods.

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
And failure to comply with the law could end up costing Apple tens of billions of dollars.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
It's sort of one of those.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
The cost won't be worth it situations.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
So you say Europe.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Is there some sort of union here?

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
Is there like some sort of group advocating for this, you mean?

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
Well, like, you know, like not states.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
We can't call them states.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Oh, I see.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Yes. Yes.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Yeah, I think so.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
At least they like to they like to think so.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I mean, I don't think it's as nice, but it's some system.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
But but not the U.K., of course, because they gracefully brexit in the situation.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I wonder what Apple's lawyer.

24:26.000 --> 24:32.000
I wonder if it's like maybe a young woman named, you know, Miss Nuland perhaps might say.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
You think you think Apple would just say F the EU on this?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
You really think?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Yeah, because they can time up a litigation forever.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Oh, they have unlimited money.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
I mean, I'm just saying like they can just do this forever.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Yeah, this probably is why you have so much money.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
And if you don't do that.

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
Right. If you don't somehow either defeat this or just tie it up.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Once you does it.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
I mean, Amy Klobuchar exists.

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
Right. I'm just saying I think it's interesting that Google has been so quiet.

25:04.000 --> 25:15.000
On this Digital Markets Act, Google's got the epic lawsuit, which I tend to agree with with a carousel on recode, that that's going to be a bigger win for Epic.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
Bigger win for Epic than the Apple one because Google does some weird shit with their platform, killing every product I've ever liked.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Maybe I'm bitter. Google Plus was good.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I don't care what you say. It was good.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Wow.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
What do you mean wow?

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Wes and I were just talking about Google Plus last night.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
You know, you guys just shit on everything I like.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
That's all you do when I'm not around.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
I'm no I'm just I'm just impressed that you went plus and not wave.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
I keep saying wave, but I think wave this VR stuff.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
It's I'm designing my little office.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
It's very, very frankly Japanese.

25:47.000 --> 25:54.000
Oh, it's like a bonsai garden with broken Python code on the one like floating window thing.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
But that's very peaceful and tranquil.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I could just get so like in the zone in there.

25:58.000 --> 26:05.000
I need as much Zen as I can get because I'm I think the technical term is psycho.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
I'm a Mac user.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I smell some bacon.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
You smell that it it kind of smells like Microsoft is lurking in the shadows.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
With this Digital Markets Act.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
You know, it didn't Germany just go back to using office.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Did they? That might be true.

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
I don't know, man. I mean, I don't have such a strong signal on this one like I did with the epic lawsuit.

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
It does seem like it would fit perfectly into Microsoft's current app store strategy.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
It would harm Google and Apple the most.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
And Microsoft would be perfectly positioned for this kind of play.

26:36.000 --> 26:44.000
And we've seen that they've been willing to work behind the scenes in the US to take the justice system and weaponize it against their competitors.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
So why wouldn't they be doing it in the EU?

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
I would almost argue the EU is the easier fight, right?

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Because the EU is always eager to attack American tech companies.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Perhaps, perhaps.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
It seems like it.

26:55.000 --> 27:02.000
And the reality there is, is that if you look at who benefits from this, you could argue consumers.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I think we'll see, but I doubt it actually.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
This is the irony.

27:05.000 --> 27:11.000
If Apple had kind of calmed down a bit, if CFED, I like that name by the way, had maybe not been so over the top.

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
They do have a real argument about privacy and security.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
The problem is when they make it sound like the world is going, right?

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
It's going to turn into the walking dead.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
It's silly.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
But I got to tell you right now, no one in my family is sideloading a goddamn thing if I can stop it, right?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I just letting it's all through the app store.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
I don't know secondary app stores because I am not dealing with that.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
We could have a digression to Windows 11.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Do not let old people upgrade to Windows 11.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
That's all I'm going to say.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
Apple's argument is that people will be socially engineered into turning it on.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
And they point to the Fortnite situation on Android where Fortnite tried to leave the Play Store.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
They had people turn on sideloading and it just got abused.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
I 100% agree.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
And I can think of one company in particular.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Forget about Epic.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Epic's weird.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
Tim Sweeney's kind of like, you know, I feel a kindred spirit there.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
He's kind of like over the top and nuts, but I don't think he's evil.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
He's just like he gets mad about things and he kind of goes too far.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Facebook or Meta, whatever.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
I love my Quest.

28:11.000 --> 28:18.000
I wish it was made by any other company, including Exxon Halliburne and Chef Rocks.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I just I hate them so much.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
Every time I give them money, I feel like I'm like I'm clubbing a baby seal.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
You could look at it as you're incentivizing a better business model than their previous one.

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
I mean, I guess if you give a heroin addict cocaine, you are giving them a lighter drug in some way.

28:35.000 --> 28:43.000
I mean, doesn't it sound great to just continually encourage another company to create an App Store behemoth platform?

28:43.000 --> 28:50.000
Once again, folks, we're going to he and I are dying to mention Revolution OS and go back to the 90s and cry.

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
I find this story that we've been watching slowly unfold absolutely fascinating.

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
And, you know, I think we've talked about this whole thing as if the impending doom was really coming from U.S.

29:02.000 --> 29:09.000
regulators to Apple. But the reality is, is the situation in the EU is much more dire for them and much more immediate.

29:09.000 --> 29:15.000
And so this is kind of where I'm going to be putting some of my attention just for a little bit, because this Digital Markets Act, this could change the game.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
The EU might do it. Yeah, they might do it.

29:18.000 --> 29:25.000
I could see it. And if they did it, how does Apple not just turn it on for everyone at that point?

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
No. What do you mean, voluntarily?

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
Well, no. I mean, if they get forced into allowing sideloading in the EU, they essentially have to allow it everywhere,

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
because otherwise people are going to be leaking builds and hacking in the US build and enabling that.

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
And it's just going to be it'll be a cat and mouse game forever where they could just standardize it,

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
build documentation and the system around it, maybe even sign apps if they just embrace it like they do on the Mac.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Like I could almost see it forcing their hand on this. I don't know.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
I feel like Apple can hold this up in court for at least 10 years. Yeah, I think you're probably right, though.

29:56.000 --> 30:02.000
I remember, you know, Google, Oracle, we were we covered it when the show started and it just finished a few years ago.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
All right. So this will this would be even bigger.

30:06.000 --> 30:21.000
You I think about this, too, from OK, so I think you and I both feel like it was a bit of a milestone when you could give a newbie family member an iPad or an iPhone and they could go in the app store and you knew they could install whatever for the most part.

30:21.000 --> 30:27.000
And they wouldn't muck up their system with persistent background tasks and crypto miners and stuff like that.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
For the most part, you know, you had some ad scams and a few things here and there over the years.

30:31.000 --> 30:40.000
But it was truly the first machine you could give the normals and they wouldn't eventually blow it up.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
And you got to appreciate that this innovation came around during the time of like Windows XP.

30:45.000 --> 30:54.000
When people were blowing up their entire systems by just going to a porn site on Internet Explorer and their machine was a goner.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
It was like super low friction to just totally devastate someone's computer back then.

30:59.000 --> 31:09.000
And so the app store model and the sandboxed applications and Apple's really draconian management of the app store.

31:09.000 --> 31:15.000
Did create a safer environment for regular users, and I think that is just objectively true.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
It is just objectively the truth. Absolutely. Things don't last forever.

31:19.000 --> 31:26.000
What about the next company that comes along that becomes the ultimate platform that becomes the ultimate app store platform?

31:26.000 --> 31:33.000
These things come and go over time. And so if the EU, you know, got this digital markets act in place,

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
in theory, it would apply to every major platform gorilla that comes down the road after Apple as well.

31:39.000 --> 31:47.000
And that might that might be a good thing. Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

31:47.000 --> 31:54.000
I just find it such a big change that it seems beyond the realm of plausible.

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
I could see it being necessary if there was no other choice in the market.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
If there was no Android, if there was no Linux, if there was no Web,

32:04.000 --> 32:12.000
I could see the necessity of forcing a company who's built a successful product to change that product for the better of the market.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
But because they don't even have the majority of the market share, like I've said before,

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
it's like using the big guns for a situation that doesn't really call for it.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
Right. Like the EU is sort of sort of bringing a gun to a fist fight.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
I don't know. Maybe not. Maybe maybe they see a long game that I don't see at this point.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
We also have to think about, like, how has the app store changed and Apple's distribution policies changed?

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
And they've actually gotten tighter, not looser. Right.

32:37.000 --> 32:44.000
Most consumers don't know about this, but the enterprise development program used to be super, super loose.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Right. You just needed a certificate and an account.

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
And you could basically, you know, as long as you it's kind of an unintuitive process.

32:51.000 --> 32:56.000
But as long as these are accepted, your enterprise certificate, you could distribute your app to them.

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
And this was super helpful to companies like mine where you would develop an app for somebody's business.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
Right. And not have to go through all that red tape of like being on the app store.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
Absolutely. Or, you know, if you just had an app that five or 10 people were going to use,

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
where they're on the floor of the warehouse and they're doing inventory and you have a custom app.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
That's it. You just do it now.

33:16.000 --> 33:25.000
Apple has tightened that up quite a bit because people were using that as a way to make effectively alternative app stores for, I think, porn.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
I don't I don't see them backing down right there.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
They're so they feel super strongly about this.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
It's the same reason why they are such maniacs about control over the app store.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
They really see this as a part of the product.

33:39.000 --> 33:46.000
So I'm saying, right, there are emails from way, way, way, way back in 2010 of them just like Steve Jobs and I.

33:46.000 --> 33:53.000
What is it, Federici openly talking about how they're going to use the app stores leverage against Amazon in business deals.

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
Right. Like this didn't just happen. They knew that this was a lever of control.

33:58.000 --> 34:05.000
And they're just I never I don't see a world where they give it up unless it's literally at the point of the gun.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Right. Where it's like or your executives here go to jail.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
I wonder, would this be the case with any company like of canonical?

34:10.000 --> 34:16.000
It would be any company. If if canonical could have pulled it off, they would have done it.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
Yeah. The Snap Store would be like their their gem.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
It'd be there. It'd be the core of their business if that had ever gone huge.

34:23.000 --> 34:29.000
Right. You'd think there would they would be. And we'd all be watching our own two TVs.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
There it is.

34:33.000 --> 34:39.000

Happy monitoring.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
All right, this isn't podcasting radio.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
I recognize that it is sad old man radio.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
You know what it is? It's Mike was right radio.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
The this what we have been watching happening to you and your business.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I would love to be wrong.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
I know. Thanks. Thanks, bro.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
And what we've been watching happening with app stores is now happening to podcasts.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
I've been telling you this for a while, but now we got numbers because some research was done by Edison Research.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
And Tom Webster is the one that wrote this up.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And here's a few stats.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
So this is positioned towards people who want to buy ads on podcasts.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Keep that in mind. Here's what they say.

36:23.000 --> 36:30.000
If you wanted to reach 50 percent of all weekly podcast consumers a year ago.

36:30.000 --> 36:36.000
You would need to have advertised on the top seven podcast networks in the world.

36:36.000 --> 36:42.000
But after considerable acquisitions of big independent shows in the past 12 months.

36:42.000 --> 36:51.000
You can now reach 50 percent of all weekly podcast listeners by buying advertising on just four podcast networks.

36:51.000 --> 37:01.000
50 percent of all weekly podcast listeners are either on SXM Media, Spotify, I Heart Radio or NPR.

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
And so what that means to advertisers is that's where they go to sell ads.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
And the report ends with this.

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
Indie podcasters have to find a way to organize and consolidate their buying power.

37:13.000 --> 37:19.000
Some monetization options are just not going to be available for them or for you.

37:19.000 --> 37:25.000
And this is it. It's the podcasts are going into what is software's equivalent to an app store.

37:25.000 --> 37:30.000
These app stores are managing the revenue generation.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
They're setting the price. They're establishing the channel deals.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
Like they're managing the distribution.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
They're managing how the brand it even gets displayed in the directory.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
Like it's completely being taken away from the podcast creator.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
The relationship of the audience is completely being abstracted away.

37:47.000 --> 37:54.000
And they've centralized the listening so that advertisers don't really want to be bothered

37:54.000 --> 38:00.000
dealing with some indie podcaster who's going to take three to six months to finalize a sales deal

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
when they can call up Spotify and they can buy a thousand podcasts in one hour.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
And this is happening so fast. It's really accelerated.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
It's more than that to the right. Spotify can sell them.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
Well, these are our customer demographics for this collection of shows.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
For instance, Spotify owns a lot of stuff.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.000
I wonder how much of an overlap there is between, let's say, the Joe Rogan experience and the Obama show.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
And Spotify can also do things like we can guarantee your ads will start tomorrow

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
because we'll digitally insert them.

38:29.000 --> 38:35.000
We'll just cut, we'll wildly cut the podcast at any point and just slam in an ad for you

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
that somebody else recorded that you don't even recognize their voice.

38:39.000 --> 38:45.000
And, you know, like we saw this coming a couple of years ago.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
That's why we launched membership programs at the network is because I believe what's going to happen

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
is there will be a smaller and smaller and smaller subset of advertisers.

38:55.000 --> 39:01.000
And the independent podcasters who are trying to do this full time are essentially all going to be knocking

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
on the door of a handful of advertisers.

39:04.000 --> 39:10.000
That puts independent podcasting in a really precarious position in terms of censorship,

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
self-selected censorship, all of that.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
So that's why we launched the membership program because that gives us runway to be choosy.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
It helps offset if we have a sponsor drop out, we don't have to panic.

39:21.000 --> 39:27.000
And I also see the boost that I've been talking about on the show that people consented with new podcast apps.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
I see that as part of a mix of ways to keep podcasting independent

39:32.000 --> 39:39.000
because with these boosts, the hardest part is getting into Bitcoin, buying a couple of stats and loading up a wall.

39:39.000 --> 39:44.000
That part is hard. It's confusing to people who are new to it.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
It can even sometimes seem a little sketchy, like depending on how you do it.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
Like it's a big barrier to entry right now.

39:50.000 --> 39:56.000
Once people get over that barrier to entry, they're on a peer to peer network that is run by the developers

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
and creators themselves.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
And so there's a direct network effect that happens.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
Like, for example, the podcasting 2.0 podcast has people listening that are boosting them.

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
And now they're sending boosts my way and my audience is now sending boosts their way.

40:11.000 --> 40:17.000
Even though we've never coordinated, our incentives have aligned to this lightning based network system.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
And so the network grows and we both benefit.

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
And as more people come online, as developers come online, everyone kind of grows and benefits.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
But it is really hard to get started.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Now, if Matrix is hard to get on to, this is even harder.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
So that live stream I'm doing on March 31st, I'm giving away Bitcoin on the live stream.

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
I'm not going to give away millions of dollars or anything, but I'm going to give out Bitcoin to people who show up

40:40.000 --> 40:46.000
to help load their wallets like in the Fountain app, fountain.fm, and help them get started so they can start sending boosts.

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
Because once you do it, you understand it. You get it immediately.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
You will immediately see what I'm talking about here.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
But until you try it, you just don't get it.

40:55.000 --> 41:02.000
So I'm going to put my money where my mouth is because I think this is actually a pretty important way to monetize podcasting down the road.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
And so maybe this works, maybe it doesn't.

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
But if I lead the way on this and then some of my friends join in and their podcast and others will just grow the network.

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
And then as developers come online or other places come online, we'll already have people that are in this network.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
It just keeps getting more and more valuable.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
But the hard part is getting involved.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
So during the live stream, we'll help people get on Matrix so they can get on a decentralized communication system.

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
And I'm going to give away some Bitcoin so you can put that in your Fountain.fm wallet or your Cast-O-Matic or whatever you use.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Just go to newpodcastapps.com.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
I'll have a link in the show notes and get an app that supports boosts.

41:33.000 --> 41:40.000
And I'm going to give it away so that way people can just they don't have to deal with the how do I actually buy the Bitcoin and put it in the wallet.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
They just need a few sats to get started.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
Like the boost we got earlier today was 42 cents.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Right. It's not like it's a big deal.

41:47.000 --> 41:58.000
And so I think that's, I hope, another way to help keep things decentralized, to incentivize a system, a network that can get some momentum, that can keep pace with the centralization.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
It is a long shot, but it is our only shot.

42:02.000 --> 42:08.000
And it's not the only way to keep podcasting independent, but it is part of a basket of ways that we are going to make this work.

42:08.000 --> 42:14.000
And, you know, I feel like it's pretty critical because I recently said three to five years.

42:14.000 --> 42:20.000
And now, after seeing that report and how fast this has happened in just one year, the current game is done in two years.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
And I have to be doing something different by two years from now.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
And that's if I'm lucky now. It may only be a year at this point.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
So this is part of that solution. And so join me.

42:30.000 --> 42:37.000
It'll be March 31st, 4 p.m. Seattle, 7 p.m. New York time, 11 p.m. London at jblive.tv.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
We'll get you on Matrix. We'll give away some Bitcoin.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.000
And I'm also going to do a Q&A if you've got any questions about stuff we've talked about or things like that.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
I'm also going to invite my friends to join me. Swing by the stream so they'll be there, too.

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
And Scuba Steve sent us a boost that said, can't wait to see you guys in Raleigh.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
My question is, what do you guys think about Substack?

42:58.000 --> 43:04.000
Do you think that platforms like it play a role in the long term sustainability of independent content creators?

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Thanks for everything you do.

43:06.000 --> 43:11.000
This is in the context of Substack just launching their own app,

43:11.000 --> 43:18.000
which takes all of the various, quote unquote, independent substacks and aggregates them in one place, sort of like YouTube.

43:18.000 --> 43:27.000
So if you have a popular substacker like, say, Glenn Greenwald or anybody else, you read that guy or that gal,

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
and then it'll start recommending other creators that can kind of draft on their popularity, sort of like the YouTube algorithm does.

43:32.000 --> 43:38.000
It does give creators a way to monetize. It can integrate with Stripe and they can they can own that part of it.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
But it still feels like a platform consolidation to me.

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
And this app where they're putting everything in an app and they're kind of recommending other substacks

43:47.000 --> 43:53.000
and kind of using one popular substacker to promote others, which is good for some and bad for others.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
It feels a lot like an App Store platform YouTube thing again.

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
And Substack was, I don't know, for some reason, people thought it was going to free us from that. But yet here we go.

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
It's just slowly but surely drifting to this model.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
You think or do you think I'm overreacting?

44:09.000 --> 44:14.000
I don't think you're overreacting now. I think this is problematic, to say the least.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
We'll put a link in the show notes.

44:16.000 --> 44:26.000
By the way, for the live stream, I recommend a quick and easy way to just grab a small amount of Bitcoin, as small as you like, really, is get the Strike app.

44:26.000 --> 44:32.000
Strike app is it's backed by a great team. It has super low fees. It is safe to use.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
It supports lightning and it takes a day or two to get verified, though.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
So if you want to grab your own Bitcoin, get the strike app.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
You can purchase small amounts with that.

44:42.000 --> 44:49.000
Then you can use lightning to send it over to your podcast app and then you can send it to creators and apps like Fountain FM.

44:49.000 --> 44:54.000
They will let you know when a creator can take boosts. And I could see this extending to software.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
I don't know. I don't plan to talk about it all the time, but this report just came out.

44:57.000 --> 45:03.000
Of course, I see the ground crumbling underneath me like you much saw as the app stores were gaining dominance.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
So it's it's a topic, you know, it's on my mind.

45:07.000 --> 45:18.000
You know, we talked about last week about weaponizing Firefox and kind of sabotaging certain features for people that are in Ukraine or in Russia, depending on their location.

45:18.000 --> 45:26.000
And you and I kind of pontificated about the long term ramifications of that and probably why even though we think this conflict is horrible,

45:26.000 --> 45:33.000
weaponizing free software is a bad precedent to set. A couple of days after we recorded that episode.

45:33.000 --> 45:41.000
It came out that some open source library was sabotaged an MPM package.

45:41.000 --> 45:48.000
And it was set to wipe the hard drives of systems in Russia as a protest of the war.

45:48.000 --> 45:57.000
And. They wiped the drives of an NGO that was over there documenting war crimes by Russia.

45:57.000 --> 46:05.000
The team is absolutely completely devastated. Tons of video and pictures. Completely gone.

46:05.000 --> 46:12.000
They were doing a fly by night, kind of build up a system, set it up, get it going. Just everybody start throwing your video when you're out in the field on this thing.

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
They didn't do it. They executed something and they wiped the whole thing accidentally.

46:17.000 --> 46:23.000
You really just don't know the ramifications, the second order effects of something like this.

46:23.000 --> 46:29.000
And I have I have a thoughtful piece that will link in the show notes on the weaponization of open source software.

46:29.000 --> 46:34.000
And then the author looks at Mongo DB cutting off services in Russia.

46:34.000 --> 46:43.000
The node library that deleted files. Of course, there's a code in the license change in a terraform module to let the entire world know that Putin is a dickhead.

46:43.000 --> 46:47.000
And there's been several other things that have happened. Ours covered a couple of them.

46:47.000 --> 46:54.000
And it's really kind of unfortunate because I think that's exactly in line with what we were worried could be sort of an unintended consequence.

46:54.000 --> 47:00.000
I totally understand that people people feel like they need to respond. They need to do something.

47:00.000 --> 47:08.000
But you really can never know where these things are going to land. And right now, right now, Senator Warren, who's a who's a good friend of Mr.

47:08.000 --> 47:18.000
Dominic, she's working on a bill that could potentially hold open source developers responsible if regimes we have sanctioned are using their software.

47:18.000 --> 47:26.000
And that's very scary because, of course, we know Russia has a Linux distribution. We know that they use Linux.

47:26.000 --> 47:33.000
You know, there's other regimes around the world that are using free software and the developers have nothing to do about it.

47:33.000 --> 47:39.000
I think the best thing would have been just for everybody in the free software community to stay neutral in this regard and not even bring this conversation up.

47:39.000 --> 47:48.000
But now it's up for discussion. And now we're even seeing legislation going through. I don't know how far it'll get, but it's pretty dangerous.

47:48.000 --> 47:56.000
Yeah, we talked about this a lot last week, but there's so much here. It's kind of surprisingly, Chris, I got a bunch of private messages about this.

47:56.000 --> 48:05.000
And there's a lot of hot feelings on kind on all sets. But, you know, I will say it's got to be a little careful with this, right?

48:05.000 --> 48:17.000
My and I think your position of some of the changes in the software community, the tech community in general, almost nobody kind of brought that up to me, which I thought was interesting.

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
I don't know if that I hate the word libertarian because I mean, it used to mean something that it doesn't mean.

48:23.000 --> 48:37.000
You know what I mean? Like it's evolved to be very specific. But I found it surprising that at least a lot of the private correspondents I got was basically calling me an old man.

48:37.000 --> 48:50.000
I like a super right winger because like somebody went out of their way to mention that like Revolution OS is like a libertarian propaganda piece, which I thought was a little nuts.

48:50.000 --> 48:56.000
Well, I think that's because people associate some of the early free software folks as, you know, libertarian and fair enough.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
But as they are, but it's a war.

48:59.000 --> 49:09.000
I mean, people throw the same thing around Bitcoin. And what it is, is that the reality is there are certain concepts, there are certain technologies that will appeal to certain crowds early as early adopters.

49:09.000 --> 49:15.000
But eventually it widens out. I mean, the same. It's just how it's how everything works.

49:15.000 --> 49:23.000
Right. I mean, so there's a lot going on here, right? The legislation, the proposed legislation that you mentioned is insane.

49:23.000 --> 49:29.000
Right. It would it would criminalize open source. Yeah. The liability, the risk would be so high, right, that you would not want to do it.

49:29.000 --> 49:40.000
Yeah. The bill calls for sanctions on anyone who, quote, significantly and materially assisted, sponsored or provided financial material or technological support or goods or services to support any sanctioned person.

49:40.000 --> 49:46.000
So even if a sanctioned person uses that code. That's dangerous, man, that's super dangerous, right?

49:46.000 --> 49:52.000
Like it weaponizes, it weaponizes because there's no way they're going to enforce it on the regular. So it's something they could just throw at somebody when they really want to.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
Well, I mean, it's all right. This is this is Mike being a New York hipster.

49:57.000 --> 50:04.000
But I was just listening to the New Yorker podcast this week. And yes, there you go.

50:04.000 --> 50:09.000
I can't believe you just outed yourself. That's great. They do have great covers. And if you listen to it, you don't get to see those great covers.

50:09.000 --> 50:21.000
That's true. They they were talking about a I think was Obama administration initiative where the Justice Department would go after, quote unquote, Chinese spies that Trump like double down on.

50:21.000 --> 50:31.000
But of course, the way Trump did it all of a sudden went from a nothing no brainer to incredibly unpopular because Trump put like China in caps and red and bold.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
Right. Well, he had to go and tweet about it. You know, he should have just kept his mouth shut.

50:35.000 --> 50:47.000
Just just do it. You don't tweet. Yeah. And the Justice Department was just having a bitch of a time actually prosecuting these dudes because it turns out proving someone's a spy is really, really hard in a networked world.

50:47.000 --> 50:55.000
When like everybody talks to everybody. Right. I got telegram messages from Moscow the other weekend. Right. Not from Russians, from Americans living there and leaving.

50:55.000 --> 51:04.000
So it's you know, it's it's tough. So what are the Justice Department clever bastards that they are prosecutors?

51:04.000 --> 51:14.000
Well, wait a minute. If our goal is just to throw this asshole in jail and get him to flip on his friends and try to why don't we just find like anything else he's ever done?

51:14.000 --> 51:22.000
For instance, he made a mistake on a form. Well, we think he did it on purpose. So that's fraud.

51:22.000 --> 51:31.000
The fraud in the United States government done. That's yeah. I mean, I would say that I think if they want to pass any laws, they should repeal five.

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
That's a good system. Now you're going. Yeah, I'm going now. Welcome to the unfolded.

51:35.000 --> 51:45.000
No, no. Now you've gone beyond a filter. You're Steve Bannon now. No, I'm serious. It's like everything. It's just I would urge folks who listen to show that think we're crazy.

51:45.000 --> 51:54.000
And I know I'm out further than you are now. Look up what happens when a prosecutor wants to get somebody and can't for the charge they want to get them.

51:54.000 --> 51:59.000
Yeah, especially. You know what, man? Developers get it so hard. They come down hard on developers.

51:59.000 --> 52:07.000
They think they can freak them out and scare them. They ask you a question. What's the difference between an accidental hitting of a port on a server and a cybercrime?

52:07.000 --> 52:14.000
An FBI agent's opinion, a prosecutor's opinion. Exactly. Yeah. Right. The FBI agent doesn't really care. It's the prosecutor who gets to decide.

52:14.000 --> 52:19.000
I think that's it. But I I also think that this thing has a snowball's chance of actually passing.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
I'll never pass one. Elizabeth Warren sponsoring it. So the Republicans will just hate it automatically, which is perfect.

52:24.000 --> 52:32.000
Yeah. And it's well, it's very, very, very, very broad. It's it's it's like, you know, industry is going to be upset about this so broad.

52:32.000 --> 52:40.000
And so it's going to get dialed in. It is absolutely under the guise of trying to be tough on sanctioned Russians.

52:40.000 --> 52:47.000
It's under that guise that this is being proposed. And so I think it I think it remains healthy to stay a little skeptical of things like this.

52:47.000 --> 52:56.000
You know, you look at these bills and you got to even though it says we're going to be tough on mean Russians, I think people have to kind of look past that and see what it's really trying to do.

52:56.000 --> 53:03.000
And I feel that same way when it comes to sabotaging free software, because I think that undermines the trust in free software.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
It makes people worried about, you know, this is a liability now. That's how businesses look at things as well.

53:07.000 --> 53:13.000
And I think it also starts this conversation. It starts this conversation that I don't think we really want to have that.

53:13.000 --> 53:19.000
Well, what is the developer's responsibility in how the user actually uses their code?

53:19.000 --> 53:29.000
What what should the developer be doing to prevent that? And then once you start having that conversation, you start talking about compliance and measuring and punishing.

53:29.000 --> 53:37.000
So I feel like this is a very slippery slope and I don't love slippery slope arguments, but it seems pretty clear as day to me that's exactly what this is.

53:37.000 --> 53:46.000
Yeah, it's a little crazy. I mean, you know, I would just posit one of the things that I think is kind of ironic is back in the day, all this free software stuff.

53:46.000 --> 53:52.000
The criticism from Balmer, frankly, right, was that it was communism.

53:52.000 --> 53:59.000
And the irony is it was in a way political, but not in like pure day to day politics, political.

53:59.000 --> 54:12.000
It was like it was more philosophical, I'd argue. Now, I just I'm not sure I'm super comfortable with every line of code having to be interpreted as a political or social statement.

54:12.000 --> 54:19.000
And I understand that people will say, well, but all this evil stuff and all these bad things happen in the past and, you know, inclusion and all this.

54:19.000 --> 54:30.000
But I I think the problem is you end up in this crazy world of you end up doing nothing because you don't want to get the consequences right.

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
You don't want to get canceled or in this case, if this law actually passed, get thrown in jail.

54:35.000 --> 54:40.000
Right. Self-censorship. You end up you end up creating a regime of of self-censorship.

54:40.000 --> 54:46.000
And because of the very nature of it, the people that are being censored don't really ever have full representation.

54:46.000 --> 54:53.000
You know, man, like that's always a back and forth. Right. Because it one group is underrepresented and then we overcorrect.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
And now another group is under. I mean, that's an ebb and flow thing.

54:56.000 --> 55:05.000
Well, but but it's different when it goes from like let's say we want to get more minorities and women in tech and do like positive help that if you change that to.

55:05.000 --> 55:10.000
Oh, we don't like Russia today or we you know, you could imagine the opposite happening with the Chinese.

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
We don't like the Americans anymore. So we're going to throw Americans off projects. We collaborate off.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
Yeah, absolutely. You could see that it once once this nation states it.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
I would argue it's I don't like the other stuff either.

55:21.000 --> 55:26.000
I get worried about like I think maybe we should all give each other a break and try to get along.

55:26.000 --> 55:33.000
But once you have a flag, I don't know, like a flame war can become a literal shooting war too easily.

55:33.000 --> 55:43.000
And that and although having said that, the backdrop of this is it's amazing how little effect cyber operations have actually had in in the Ukraine war.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
In the Russia-Ukraine war, whatever you want to call it, the conflict or whatever.

55:47.000 --> 55:57.000
Surprisingly impotent, right? Like you based on the propaganda and coverage you were saying, you would have expected Russia to be like turning off water processing.

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
Right. You would expect that a lot of right. The grid would be down completely.

56:01.000 --> 56:11.000
Like like Y2K level planes fall right down out of the sky, which which I'm wondering, is it because it's not possible or is it because maybe their systems were old?

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
Right. You need a dude there to actually like run the switches. Right. I don't know.

56:15.000 --> 56:21.000
I mean, it sounds silly, but doesn't that just seem like a simple solution to at the end of the day?

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
And, you know, it's also a jobs program. Right. It's like Battlestar Galactica.

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
Right. Just run that cord, baby. Run that cable. Yeah. No networking on this ship.

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
Did you just bring a Wi-Fi card?

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
O'Dama does not want any Bluetooth. Yeah, I could totally see that.

56:36.000 --> 56:42.000
President Rosalind lover just throwing it out there. Season one, though, season one is the best, really is the best.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
It is the best. It really is.

56:44.000 --> 56:50.000
I don't think this is going to happen. I don't think this bill will go through. And I hope people will kind of read it.

56:50.000 --> 56:54.000
We'll have a link in the show notes. It's very broad. And so people are interpreting it different ways.

56:54.000 --> 57:00.000
I'll put that out there. But the part that I think we quoted in the show is the bit that concerns me the most.

57:00.000 --> 57:09.000
And we'll have links to what we talked about today at coder dot show slash four five eight, which means we're almost to four sixty, which is crazy.

57:09.000 --> 57:14.000
That's crazy. Well, I know. Wow. Thank you to our members.
