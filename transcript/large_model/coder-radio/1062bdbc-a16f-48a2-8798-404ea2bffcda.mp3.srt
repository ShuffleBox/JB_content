00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Koto Radio, episode 305, for April 16th, 2018.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hi everyone and welcome to Koto Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This episode is brought to you by our two fine sponsors, DigitalOcean and Linux Academy.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'll tell you more about those great sponsors as this here show goes on.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Me, my name is Chris, but what's more important is our host.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
He's perched, established, and ready to go.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Over in the bayous of Florida is Mr. Dominic.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hello Mike!

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want Szechuan sauce, I want that Mulan 1990s Clinton-era Szechuan sauce.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Have you tried it? Have you tried it?

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes, I have actually.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah, it's, you know, it's alright.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, Mr. Dominic, we had a lot of follow-up to get into from last week, but we're going to kind of do something different with it.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Instead of just reading emails, we're going to have it inspire a couple of things in the show for the next couple of weeks.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Including, we're going to do a little bit of historical deep dive into Big Blue this week, just to sort of set up another conversation we're going to have in a couple of weeks.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And the early dominance that IBM had, and the fight they had in the 80s.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And then we'll get into a more modern hoopla that involves your current workflow.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But why don't we start out with some emails that came into the show.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Are you ready, good sir, for the feedback?

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm ready like a dime store hooker.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, alright, I can't ask for more than that.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And somebody calls right on that dot.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You know, the thing is, the thing is, I'd pay for you.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I think you'd be money well spent, I gotta be honest.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You'd be money well spent.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's the nicest thing anyone said to me.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So we got an email that said, hey guys, keep an eye on Swift Playgrounds.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Remember you said that the canary in the coal mine, or I said the canary in the coal mine for Apple switching to ARM processors would be when Xcode starts coming out for the iOS platform.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And a couple of emails pointed this out, but I like this one.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He says, you know, look, this is the way it's going to go.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Swift Playgrounds is going to grow up into an Xcode replacement.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It also means that Apple would have to create a layer much like art to make sure that people don't brick their iPads.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Then Mike can finally preach the iPad Pro Bible once again.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What do you think?

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
iPad Pros with like a grown up version of Swift Playgrounds, sort of like Final Cut came out of iMovie?

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I mean, that is like a certain version of Lovecrafting.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah, a couple of people write that in.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't know.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't think that's the case.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I could be wrong.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I hope not.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I mean, Playgrounds should really stay focused.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, it's not even that Playgrounds should stay focused.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's, you know, the more dev I do, the more I realize I need all the toys, right?

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Like, this is not a minimal, minimalist paradise here.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is a bring me all the toys.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What do you mean by toys?

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Like, you know what?

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Sometimes a Mac is the right tool.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Sometimes a Linux system is the right tool.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And sometimes a Windows 10 machine is the right tool.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I can't.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And all three of those are like actually powerful systems.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can't imagine coding on an iPad and doing my day to day workflow on that without like being filled with a rage that could consume a thousand cents.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, well, don't think of today's tools.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Think of, you know, five, 10 years of iteration where you've got, you know, different smart boards now.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Like, OK, what is an iPad when I hook it to a mechanical keyboard?

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is it even still an iPad?

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Maybe not.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I mean, maybe not.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So then we're now we're talking like a surface, right?

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Which, yes, I think is a fine dev machine.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So, OK, good.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
All right.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, we'll be there.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Esteban says go with your gut.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He wrote him with a couple of emails, but I really like this point.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He made he says forget about the nice songs and poems about following your heart.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Your heart can and will mislead you.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But your gut, your gut always feels right.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's always right.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I agree.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Go.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And here's your problem with the heart.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
My heart was with the language.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You might be familiar with this, Chris.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't know if you know this.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
In 2014, something happened.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There was this language called Objective C.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Here we go again.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And then my heart was carved out like I'm a deer on the side of the road rather swiftly,

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
one might say.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, bitter.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That was good.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So I did it.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Next.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That was pretty well done.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Esteban, your feedback is the best only because you set me up for another hit at Swift.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We got we also had a pretty good point on the subreddit.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Just really.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Maybe not.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Pretty good point might not be the way to put it.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But we got a feedback.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Well, because it wasn't really a point.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It was just an observation.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We got a feedback on our episode last week.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No bad guys, only survivors.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Code Radio 304.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And Andy writes, it was a it was a really valuable lesson for him.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He says he went back and re-listened to certain chapters a couple of times.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And he really felt like it was a great reflection on how to how to sort of understand failure,

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
learn from failure, which he's also been able to use as a contractor.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So he says, I also enjoyed your recent forays into being shocked that PowerShell is a thing.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He's talking about me there.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah.

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But like that, we went down to Microsoft and talked to them and got that story.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So he's covering a couple of bits here.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But he says, I really found it informative and useful specifically today because he has

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
had to deal with the other end of empty promises of enterprise software salespeople for years

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
now.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And he says crossing the chasm is definitely on his reading list.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So it was great to be able to serve somebody who is on the other side of the contract agreement

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
that we often like sort of proverbially talk about.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It was super useful for him to hear insights into the other side of the argument.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So I thought that was pretty cool.

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And a lot of a lot of people really like that episode, which just makes me feel bad for

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
all of you.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Really, you just have to burn things down from time to time and and replant a forest

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and then you don't like my thank you.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You beat me to it.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You know, you know, our cousins, Uncle Jay and of course, Bain is a very similar philosophy.

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, man.

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You know, you know, I've started watching this.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Have you heard of Alex Inc.?

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I have not.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's not that great.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's not that great.

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But it's an ABC sitcom starring What's His Face from Scrubs, the main guy from Scrubs.

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And he's a he's a he's a mid 30s father who quits his full time job to launch a podcast

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
network.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And it's oh, does this hurt a little bit?

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It is awkward.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm watching it with my with my kid.

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And I'm like, that is kind of like what life is like.

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And it's funny to watch something that you do because I know developers see this is I'm

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
not even going to resonate with developers because this has been common with development

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
for a long time.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But nobody in the mainstream has really talked about podcasting for four decades.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
For as long as it's been around a decade.

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And now all of a sudden there's a TV show about it.

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Pandora is launching podcasting support.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's really something to be sort of just sitting here watching all of a sudden this industry

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
just I don't know, be awesome.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Really?

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah.

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Like enter the next level of consumer awareness, you know, like it's reached another section

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
of it's moved on from the early adopters.

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
See, I never understood why podcasting and this has nothing to do with the topic of the

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
show, but let's just go into it because I'm bored.

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why podcasting isn't just treated as like an extension of AM radio, like I used to love

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
AM radio.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I mean, before Imus was an asshole, I used to listen to Imus in the morning.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Right.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You know, when I lived in New Jersey, when I was younger, there was a you know, you remember

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Chrissy.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I mean, I'm sure they still exist.

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You have the local stations.

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Right.

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You have like your, you know, Washington state weed smokers.

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
One oh one dot AM.

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We had a one to one point five in New Jersey.

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Right.

169
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And you get like the local feel.

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, yeah.

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And you're right.

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So why do I I'm obsessed with you being a drug addict, by the way.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah.

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
All these drugs.

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah.

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
All these drugs.

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
All these years.

178
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But why don't people see it as an extension of like talk radio?

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,340
Seriously, because in my mind, that's exactly what it is like.

180
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,200
I'm wearing over the head headphones that are cushy and hot and my ears are literally

181
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,020
on fire right now because I live in the goddamn jungle and I'm using a microphone that looks

182
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,200
like a swollen penis.

183
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
It's huge.

184
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Yeah.

185
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Yeah.

186
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
That is a particularly phallic microphone you have.

187
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Yeah.

188
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,480
So I mean, it's black.

189
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
It's not good.

190
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
It's not wrong.

191
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Wrong.

192
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
My setup.

193
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,960
But we've gone down a path anyway.

194
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,680
Why do you think podcasting is not treated just like an extension of AM radio?

195
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,240
Well, because it's sort of a no rules medium and it's such a varying degree of quality.

196
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,860
It's a lot like software development that in that regard, you know, like there's some

197
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,280
great software developers and there's some horrible software developers.

198
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,240
And I think also just the sort of homebrew nature of it.

199
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
It's it's it.

200
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
That's changing, though.

201
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,440
I think that is going to change as now you've got all of these major radio networks that

202
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,800
are releasing podcasts and maybe it will start to be seen as that.

203
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,080
Well, I have to say, like the Wall Street Journal just recently did theirs and they've

204
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
upped their game.

205
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Yeah.

206
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Yeah.

207
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
Yeah.

208
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Yeah.

209
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
Yeah.

210
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
And so is the New York Times.

211
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
It sucks in a way, but then at the same time, it just got up our game.

212
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
You know, always got to be up on our game.

213
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,280
Well, listen, put on the video stream and I'll just take my shirt off.

214
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
There we go.

215
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Boom.

216
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
Boom.

217
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Yeah.

218
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Yeah.

219
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Yeah.

220
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
We've got a lot of pop requests that come into the show.

221
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,760
You know what I've seen some great beards and some plump Linux developers.

222
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,160
I would love to see Linux developer.

223
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
I don't know, man.

224
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,000
All that mud in those beards, that just is the nightmare for me.

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I just triggers me.

226
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
All right.

227
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,580
Well, we do have a topic today to get into and it's kind of an important one, so we shouldn't

228
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,080
run people off because it's going to be setting up the next couple of weeks of shows.

229
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,940
So before we dive in, let's do our first bit of duty and business and thank the fantastic

230
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:17,580
folks over at DigitalOcean.do.co slash coder. Now let me go check here, getting out the

231
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,340
prop piece of paper that I have. Yes, verified with the back office staff, there is no S

232
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,660
on that do.co slash coder. You go there to sign up for DigitalOcean, simplicity at scale,

233
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:34,980
and you'll get a $100 DigitalOcean credit. Did you hear that? $100 in DigitalOcean credit.

234
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,340
It's a limited time offer, so I want you to take advantage of it while they're still giving

235
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:45,940
it out. Do.co slash coder. DigitalOcean is incredibly fast infrastructure on demand.

236
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,280
You can get spun up in less than 55 seconds. Every single DigitalOcean droplet, from the

237
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,180
three cents an hour, which is my favorite or even cheaper than that, to the super expensive

238
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,180
hundreds gigabytes of RAM, massive Xeon CPUs, everything in that entire lineup, SSDs, all

239
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:06,740
of it. 40 gigabit connections into the hypervisors, all of it. Great, beautiful, easy to use dashboard

240
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,060
on all of it, and a straightforward, well-documented, full-featured API that you can start programming

241
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,940
against, take advantage of existing libraries, or open source code that's been completely

242
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,700
designed and built for you. DigitalOcean has predictable pricing, entire application stacks

243
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,460
that are ready to go, and you can also deploy a base system if you like. You combine all

244
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,740
of that with fantastic documentation and their new flexible droplets. For $15 a month, you

245
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,300
can mix and match resources the most appropriate for your application. Or, I mentioned it,

246
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,660
they have those really high-end Xeon CPUs for CPU-optimized droplets. If you have a

247
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:45,500
really compute-intensive workload, very, very useful for that. And then, on top of that,

248
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,740
for storage, they have Spaces and Object Storage. Spaces is S3-compatible, and Object Storage

249
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,180
just shows up as another device right on your rig. That's so sweet because it's great for

250
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,580
backups, it's great for centralizing storage, it's great for adding just new disk if you

251
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,980
have something that's growing on your existing droplet, and recently they've adjusted their

252
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,260
prices. So, if you've been a DigitalOcean customer for a while, you can go upgrade your

253
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,140
system for free. Pay exactly what you're paying now, and you just get more RAM, more disk,

254
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:24,420
more CPU. dio.co slash coder. Go to DigitalOcean, try it out with a $100 credit. dio.co slash

255
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,420
coder.

256
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:31,940
All right, Mr. Dominic, you tweeted something that kind of stuck with me, because you did

257
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,220
this towards the beginning of the month, still thinking about it. You said, I've read this

258
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,260
twice now, and I'm absolutely convinced that Microsoft is becoming the platonic ideal of

259
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,100
IBM that I mentioned a few weeks ago in Coder Radio. And then you include a link to the

260
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:53,300
resignation of one of Microsoft's long-term engineers who, after 21 years, was leaving.

261
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,320
And you said the platonic version of IBM. And when we were talking about Sun Microsystems

262
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,780
on the show, we sort of got a new appreciation for how important some of this backstory of

263
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:10,160
the tech industry is to really kind of understand where it's going. And we danced around IBM

264
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,020
a lot when we were talking about Sun, and then we danced around IBM a lot when we started

265
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,860
talking about Microsoft again. So I thought maybe this would be the week we hit the pause

266
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,340
button and we just do kind of what I'm going to call a high-level deep dive, so the important

267
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,140
bits about IBM that we need to know for the wider context of our future discussions, with

268
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:34,340
a little background history. And maybe even take a moment and go to sort of IBM's real

269
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:43,860
peak over the PC industry in the early to mid-80s. Are you a complicit co-host in my

270
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,500
schemes here? Do you think this is something worth doing?

271
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Listen, let's put on our black suits with white shirts, and let's make sure we have

272
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,940
high socks. Let's go to IBM.

273
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:58,620
You know, just to kind of give you, we're going to talk about IBM's influence over tech,

274
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:05,700
but IBM really kind of had big influence over the way employment works in the US. I don't

275
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,260
know if it's true, but they definitely, IBM says it's true, that they pioneered the 40-hour

276
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:17,620
work week and group health benefits in a company. That's a pretty big claim, if that's true.

277
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:24,900
And IBM technically got started in 1911 when they leased unit record equipment and were

278
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,440
famous for creating punch cards. In fact, they really became the Computing Tabulating

279
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:37,100
Recording Company, CTR, until an individual named Thomas J. Watson took over in 1924 and

280
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,300
renamed them to International Business Machines, or IBM.

281
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:50,460
And so let's go back to sort of IBM's origins, sort of a quick overview. This is a clip that

282
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:58,140
I grabbed from a 1985's broadcast of the Computer Chronicles. Now, to take you up to speed in

283
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:06,080
1985, IBM had just recently wrapped up a potential monopoly lawsuit with the federal government.

284
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,540
They were trying to push for a new expansion card format, and there's a lot of discussions

285
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,760
about white label BIOS development. And so at this point in time, the Computer Chronicles

286
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,260
goes back and looks at IBM's origins.

287
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,660
In many respects, the history of IBM is the history of computing. The parent company's

288
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:29,480
founder, Herman Hollerith, devised the first practical card punch calculator. It was used

289
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,880
for the first time to tabulate the 1890 American census. The IBM card soon became the symbol

290
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:42,340
of the early computer age. IBM's first mainframe, the Mark I, ushered in the post-war era of

291
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:48,080
data processing, for the most part restricted to scientific applications. But IBM's choice

292
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,120
market was always business, especially big business. As advances in memory and storage

293
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,500
took place, they were applied and promoted for business use. In this manner, the company

294
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,460
developed an almost exclusive hold on the data processing departments of major corporations.

295
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,660
By the 1960s, IBM was the leader, both technically and commercially, with over two-thirds of

296
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:16,360
the mainframe market. Its pervasive customer support and computer families gave it a major

297
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,500
advantage in almost every aspect of business computing. By 1966, the company began to look

298
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:29,660
at the small business market and expand it overseas. Today, suddenly cleared of its history-making

299
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,420
antitrust suit, IBM continues to expand its share of the market. And it does so in the

300
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,340
same way it has in the past, secretively, cautiously, and with ruthless efficiency.

301
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:47,260
They didn't really have a clear picture of how IBM was ever going to be supplanted. They

302
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,840
were so dominant that here was an interview that took place right after that clip plays

303
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,460
in the Computer Chronicle, and listen to the resignation in their voices. It's just a foregone

304
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,460
conclusion.

305
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,980
Jim, IBM saw some opportunities here a few years ago and jumped right in and took the

306
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,260
lion's share of the PC market. Do you see any effective competition now? Are we all

307
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,900
going to be working toward being compatible with IBM?

308
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:16,320
Well, Gary, in 1984, we saw IBM capture 26% of the worldwide PC market, and we at DataQuest

309
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,140
expect that that market share will continue to increase through our forecast period, which

310
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,180
ends in 1989. I would certainly expect they would command 40 to 50% of the market by that

311
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
point in time.

312
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:33,660
So, I mean, you really get an idea of how dominant IBM was in the PC market, which is

313
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,940
a market they don't even play in anymore. They don't even bother anymore. I think it's

314
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,460
kind of remarkable that that transition where they go from, how could anybody ever replace

315
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,820
them? That was the IBM. They were so dominant, right? And now they're more thought of like

316
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:55,700
cloud services and enterprise services and mainframe still, but it's in a lot of ways

317
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:02,260
where Microsoft is in their world of the compute little kingdom. Amazon's in their world of

318
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,620
the compute kingdom. They own all of that. Now we have lots of little IBMs, it feels

319
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:12,700
like. Baby IBMs, mini-IBMs, where they don't have unilateral influence, but they sure have

320
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:20,620
a lot of influence in the section of the galaxy they own. What do you think? Is that fair?

321
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:27,340
I think it's fair, right? I mean, I think IBM really, it's interesting to think about

322
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,180
how long they've been around, right? And how much has, can we say changed since they've

323
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,180
been around?

324
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,180
No, they're still around.

325
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,500
Well, I mean, of course they're still around. They're a big player in AI.

326
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,820
But since 1911, over a hundred years ago, things have changed.

327
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:47,300
Right. I mean, I like to think of IBM in terms of the ThinkPad in the more recent history.

328
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,020
And at some point, it became just not worth it for them to actually manufacture their

329
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,820
own computers. Which is a little sad.

330
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:01,060
It is, and it's really telling. So now though, even despite that, the company's taking in

331
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:07,980
about a hundred billion a year and has around 450,000 employees still. So they didn't go

332
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,820
away. And I think that's maybe a key lesson that when we start talking about where Microsoft

333
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,820
is going, if you get to a certain dominance, I don't think you quite go away. Like Sun

334
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,020
never reached that. They didn't, they never reached the level of influence that IBM or

335
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,780
a Microsoft or a Google has. Whereas, you know, I think once you get to a certain scale,

336
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,260
a certain size, unless you're acquired, you just never really go away. You still have

337
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,780
a certain customer base you're going to serve for our lifetime, is what I suspect.

338
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,100
So when you say the platonic version of IBM, do you mean like a less hostile version? Like

339
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,860
a less like over overusing of their influence? Cause IBM was known for playing. Yeah. I mean

340
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:53,260
like the, the, the purist, the best idea of what IBM should have been. Right. Although

341
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,620
I will say it's interesting that you mentioned Lucent because Lucent like died amid accounting

342
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:02,900
scandals, right? Like, yeah, that's true. Maybe not the same thing.

343
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,820
I have a visual guide to the history of IBM linked in the show notes. If you go to coder.show

344
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:13,100
slash three oh five, you will find that. And I also have the entire computer Chronicles

345
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,420
1985 broadcast linked in there, which is, which the whole episode is a profile of big

346
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:24,060
blue sort of a during its mead. It's a, it's a peak PC industry influence, which is a fascinating

347
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,060
time to take a snapshot and then to look back at it now. Yeah. So that's all in there. And

348
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,260
also a link to the New York times when IBM dropped, or when the US government dropped

349
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,920
its antitrust suit against IBM, which the federal government said they no longer dominate

350
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,420
the computer business, but the rest of the industry didn't necessarily agree. And there

351
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,980
was quite a bit of controversy about it back then. And it's also interesting that, you

352
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,580
know, we think of the Watson machine now, that big, huge, you know, chest destroying

353
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:58,460
IBM mainframe. Well, it's not just Sherlock Holmes is a right-hand man. Thomas J. Watson

354
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:05,020
ran the company when it was still called computing tableting record company to IBM. He ran it

355
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:10,580
from 1874 to 1956, I think, or in, I'm not sure exactly his timeframe, but he ran it

356
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,500
for, or yeah, anyways, he ran it for quite a while as his name was Watson. So I, some

357
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,260
of these, the Watson project we hear about now may actually, I guess, be a reference

358
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,980
to him and not a Sherlock Holmes reference that I always thought it was, which is kind

359
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,340
of neat, just a little bit of history. And they've been around for so long. They've seen

360
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,660
so much. And of course they don't necessarily have the best history either. They sort of

361
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:33,740
have a famous dark aspect to their history when it came to those punch machines. But

362
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:39,900
now they're in the cloud. Now they're a business technology company and a cloud company. And

363
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,780
Lotus is still around. I don't know what to make of any of it, Mr. Dominic, but I do know

364
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,420
what to make of Linux Academy. Let's go to Linux Academy and then we'll get to the hoopla

365
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,700
of this week. There's a great promo going on. This was, well, it's a new release over

366
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,580
at Linux Academy. Go to linuxacademy.com slash coders. They have 70 new courses, challenges,

367
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,880
and learning activities coming out in the month of April. Linux Academy is a full feature

the community to help you study. They have learning paths, which are series of courses

375
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,740
and content planned by instructors for specific career tracks. And if you want to get certifications,

376
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,060
they've got courses created specifically to prepare you for those as well. They've got

377
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:45,500
iOS and Android apps, study tools, lesson audio, study books that you can download and

378
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,660
use offline, practice exams and quizzes, and those labs I mentioned that will spin them

379
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,860
up on demand. If you ever get stuck, they've got a human being to help you along the way.

380
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,540
With 70 new courses, challenges, and learning activities, it's never been a better time

381
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:05,460
to try out Linux Academy with a seven day free trial. Linuxacademy.com slash coders.

382
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:11,140
20 new courses, 50 new cloud assessments, hands on learning activities, and new challenges

383
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,980
are all coming this month to Linux Academy. Linuxacademy.com slash coders. And a big thank

384
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:23,540
you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Coder Radio program. Linuxacademy.com slash coders.

385
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,400
So let's talk about our workflow. This is a topic that we keep revisiting every single

386
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,580
time we think we're done. And then it keeps coming back. And it won't, it just is not

387
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:40,300
getting fixed. And it's getting very frustrating for me, as you can probably tell. Since the

388
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,420
last time we talked about this, the last time we really talked about this is when the rumors

389
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:49,180
were going around that Apple might ship ARM processors in the Macs. Now we've gotten new

390
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:57,420
news that the Mac Pro is going to be delayed until 2019. That they've hired a Pro workflow

391
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:02,500
team to pretend to do work so that way Apple can analyze how they work. And they brought

392
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:08,220
down TechCrunch's Panzerino to do a one on one interview to kind of just get an update

393
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,880
on where things are at. And it looks like there's not much news for the Mac Pro other

394
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,220
than it's going to be later and we're still at the drawing board. But this Pro team that

395
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:26,420
they've hired, which is a group of producers and editors and content creators that are

396
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:31,640
shooting real world projects at Apple and then trying to edit them on Apple Gear with

397
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,060
developers sitting over their shoulders going, oh, what do you think about when that happens?

398
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,480
How do you feel when that happens? How can we do this better? And trying to find frustration

399
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:45,060
points to influence the design of the Mac Pro. In other words, Mike, your computer woes

400
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,420
aren't solved. You're going to continue to have to wait and see. Oh, we did get news

401
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,960
that they are absolutely definitely working on a new monitor. So that's going to be coming

402
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
as well.

403
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,520
I'm happy right now.

404
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,180
And so this totally comes out right after the ARM news. And there's no way this thing's

405
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,080
going to be Intel. It's supposed to ship in 2019. So I think we can just put the ARM discussion

406
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,300
aside and just focus on this part.

407
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,140
Yeah. So you know what this tells me, Chris? And it's interesting because I've listened

408
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,420
to a lot of takes on this and my response was completely different.

409
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,420
Okay.

410
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,180
Mine was the Mac Pro is not for me.

411
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,460
I would perhaps too boldly say this wasn't a machine for you with the price tag. If the

412
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:28,660
iMac Pro starting at $5,000, this thing's probably starting at $7,000 or $8,000. Possibly.

413
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,200
I think my take on it was also a little bit different than the other takes. My take on

414
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,540
it was holy shit, Apple really doesn't know how to build a computer anymore. Like everybody's

415
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,140
always talked about when Steve Jobs died, Apple lost their way. I think it's more like

416
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,580
the recent talent drain they've had lower in the ranks that has gotten some coverage.

417
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:52,940
There's been some well-known ones like Mr. Skeuomorphic when he left, Scott Forstall.

418
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,100
That was I think one of their massive technical assets that truly understood the hardware

419
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,780
and the operating system. He was gone and he was a power user. And I think over the

420
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:06,380
years they've had power users leaving Apple. And I don't think, I mean, I just don't think

421
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,860
there's a really super strong computer enthusiast in the company that's in a position to influence

422
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
product design.

423
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,860
Now, come on.

424
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:21,860
You don't need to hire these million dollar a year editors and producers to find out that

425
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:27,700
you just need to create another version of the Mac Pro Tower. I think they don't know.

426
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,940
The fact that they didn't see-

427
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,940
How could they not know though? There are people who are obviously tech enthusiasts.

428
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:40,140
No, I think it's a group of out of touch old white men that are running it. Look at the

429
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,140
people who come out on stuff.

430
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,140
I don't know, dude.

431
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,060
Phil Schiller, Tim Cook, they're all-

432
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:50,540
Yeah, but if they're old white guys, if that's going to be the thing we use, they're us or

433
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,260
older, right? I mean, you're slightly older than me, but like there are rough generation.

434
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,540
So their idea of a computer should be very similar to what I mean.

435
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,540
But they're so out of touch. They've been running Apple. They haven't probably gone

436
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,980
to the Dell website and looked at how you configure a Dell or anything like that in

437
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,940
years. I guess I'm not trying to say it's because they're old white guys. I'm saying

438
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,720
it's because they are people that have just gotten out of touch over the years by being

439
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,140
Apple executives, running the company and not looking at PCs.

440
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,340
I don't think you're making like some weird social issue here. But first of all, if you're

441
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,600
a business like Apple, the idea that you're not going to look at your main competitors

442
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,380
seems crazy. Of course, they probably go very regularly to Dell.com and play with the configurator

443
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,380
and see what Dell-

444
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,580
Oh yeah. No, I think the issue with the leadership though doesn't understand why you might want

445
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,820
more GPU power over CPU power. I don't think they grok the concepts. And that's how we

446
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,000
got the trashcan.

447
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,920
It's funny. I see it completely differently. I don't think they grok the concept of why

448
00:27:50,920 --> 00:28:00,020
upgrading RAM at the user level is important. Right. When do you suppose the last time Craig

449
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:07,900
Federici or Tim Cook or Phil Schiller has upgraded the RAM in a laptop? Maybe never.

450
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,840
Maybe 10 years.

451
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,840
Probably never.

452
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,340
See, they don't live that world. They don't understand it. I think they really for a long

453
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,180
time thought the iPad was going to do it for a lot of people.

454
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,180
And so-

455
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,980
I think they did too. I mean, it's obvious when they had the original Mac Pro Summit

456
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:28,940
that they were shocked that people didn't think the iMac Pro was the right answer. Which

457
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:35,940
in reality it probably is for a lot of people, right? But I don't know, man. This whole thing

458
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,280
of them being out of touch feels kind of like, there's nothing stopping them from making

459
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,500
the device you and I want. Let's just have a little bit of self-awareness here. Are we

460
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
just out of touch?

461
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Right.

462
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,540
No, no. I mean, I think it's pretty clear in the product. The failure of the trashcan

463
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:02,620
and the inability for them to recognize still the limitations of the iMac Pro. The iMac

464
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,940
Pro is being lauded right now in this conversation as, it's great. It's going to be more than

465
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:13,260
what most people need. But in reality, the iMac Pro still suffers from thermal limiting.

466
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,260
There is not currently a Mac in production that does not suffer from thermal throttling

467
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:23,940
when you push it. That is embarrassing. None of them, none of them are sufficiently cooled

468
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:29,420
because of design compromises. And when I'm pushing my MacBook trying to encode a video

469
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:35,140
and I know that the CPU is being downclocked so that way it doesn't reach thermal thresholds,

470
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,240
it's like, what did I pay all this money for? That's embarrassing. And they just don't get

471
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:45,180
these concepts. They don't understand why USB-C isn't enough. Why even though only some

472
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,140
people have an SD card reader need that they should put it on every model. They just haven't

473
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:55,220
lived that. And so they think the solution is to bring these pro people in and hire these

474
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,520
yes men to tell them what they should be building.

475
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
But that-

476
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,120
Well, it is interesting the people they brought in, right? They haven't brought in people

477
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,940
who are going to be critical, which I get it. You don't want to pay people to insult

478
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:14,700
you. But hiring a Chris Fisher would have been an interesting look at it, right? Saying,

479
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:22,820
you know what guys, I'm an IT admin and I'm a video podcast producer and I have a budget.

480
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,140
So I would like a month, because I think you and I effectively want the same thing, but

481
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,940
you would lean on GPU and I would like to buy the cheapest model, but be able to upgrade

482
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
it for five years.

483
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:39,260
Yeah. I think if I could have, if Tim and Johnny came to me and said, what do you want?

484
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:46,780
I would say, take the Mac Pro cheese grater tower and sell it at a base of the cheapest

485
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:53,660
you can sell, one CPU, 16 gigs of RAM, one SSD drive. And then let me-

486
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,660
Add to it later.

487
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,940
Yeah. Six months, I'll throw four drives in. And then in six months after that, I'll throw-

488
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,060
Okay, but I have that on my desk here.

489
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,220
Yeah. Well?

490
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:11,000
It's a Dell Optiplex 7050, right? Is it possible that you, me and John Syracuse and everybody

491
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,820
bitching about Apple's like, quote unquote, abandonment of Mac Pros is just wrong? Not

492
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,220
wrong in like that we're wrong technically, but wrong in that-

493
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,780
We should be using Windows.

494
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,380
Right. Apple's not making a mistake. Apple's just choosing not to serve you.

495
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:33,060
So that's my option. So there's just a couple of specifically Adobe applications. Ironically,

496
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:38,020
Photoshop isn't really one of them, that I need a platform to run and they're the latest

497
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:44,340
creative cloud versions. I'm not going to run like version seven of Photoshop, for example.

498
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,680
And so if I have to run that, I prefer to run it on a Mac than run it on a, on Windows

499
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,820
because my, you guys know my history. I'm just not a, I'm not a huge fan of using Windows

500
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,100
as my work OS and daily driver. I have some Windows systems and it's fine for what I use

501
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,380
it for. And I don't care if other people use it, but it's just not what I want to use.

502
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,940
And so, and it's not what I want to have in production 24 seven in my studio either.

503
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,820
Well, because it'll restart five times. Oh, jeez.

504
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,100
So my options right now are Windows or Mac. And I just, it's the, it's the, it goes back

505
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,020
to that tool thing. Like these are the tools of my trade and those are the, those are the

506
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,080
two platforms they run on. I find that infuriating. So I'm constantly spending a lot of my time

507
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,380
and energy trying to come up with alternatives on Linux constantly. I'm always searching

508
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,900
for Linux alternatives. I'm always trying out different projects under Linux. And I

509
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,700
mean, I probably burn four or five hours a week and it's just, I'm getting really worn

510
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,500
out and I'm getting, I'm starting to lose the faith that I'm ever going to find a solution.

511
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,140
So now I just need Apple to figure their shit out because I don't want to use Windows and

512
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,600
I'm kind of getting to the end of my rope of trying to re re-engineer everything on

513
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,660
Linux every, every week. So right. But that's insane. So you're, you're basically going

514
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,940
to like spin your wheels and like just wait for Apple to solve this problem for you.

515
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,420
What if they decide not to, right? I think it's pretty obvious. Well, I think even if

516
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,380
they, even if they build a good Mac pro, I'm not going to be able to afford it. So I think

517
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,980
I have to move on anyways. Right. Exactly. Like if the iMac pro starts a five grand,

518
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,620
you know, the Mac pro is going to be starting at eight, like there. And also it's not going

519
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:18,300
to be what you and I want. It is not going to be a black or gray or whatever color tower

520
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,540
that you can slot in parts. It might be like several different takes on the Mac mini for

521
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,460
all we know. You know, right. It could just be, I know I'm almost thinking that's what

522
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,060
it is. It's just like a super beefed up. I can't remember the name, but what does that

523
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:34,700
Nvidia machine that recently came out? You're not thinking of the, you're not thinking of

524
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,300
the Intel NUC, are you? You're thinking of the Intel NUC, the one after it. Maybe it

525
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,900
isn't, it's like, it's a new, like a skull, something NUC that is Intel latest Intel

526
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:51,300
I seven with an AMD dedicated ish. Yes. GPU. Yep. Yep. That's that things that NUC is.

527
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,700
It's funny you say that. That is exactly what my thought process is. If I could move my

528
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:02,580
remaining workflow items over to Linux, um, then I, that would be my go to workstation.

529
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:08,180
It's small, it's interchangeable. It's quiet. It's relatively low cost. It's expandable.

530
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,780
It has Thunderbolt. Um, it's everything the Mac mini should be, but I would use it to

531
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,860
run Linux. The issue is even on Linux to do my job that all the tools I need are still

532
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,280
commercial. They're still proprietary. So I'm not fully, um, right. You're not a freedom

533
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,260
beard. Well, I'm still not even getting, I'm still, I still can get drug around by the

534
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,740
nose horn a little bit. You know what I'm saying? Like I can still kind of, so in part

535
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:35,660
of me, part of me feels like maybe Apple has gotten the, um, the smell of fear that they're

536
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:40,620
losing their pro market. And so they're maybe over the next few years, we're going to see

537
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,260
some 2019, right? They said 2019. Yeah, but, but this pro team isn't just influencing the

538
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,500
Mac pro it's going to go into the, how the Mac book pro works. And I think the pro moniker,

539
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,380
I think that's, I think you're going to start seeing, I wouldn't be surprised if you see

540
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:00,660
a mea culpa of some kind on the Mac book pro, like an SD card reader or a totally revamped

541
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,260
keyboard or something like that, that they say is influenced by the pro team. Well, if

542
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,460
there was a keyboard, that would be definitely something worth talking about. I think maybe

543
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,220
the bigger meta issue here though, it to even take it away from Apple and say the meta issue

544
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:18,440
is I have a tool that I depend on several tools and the vendor of that platform seems

545
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,980
like they've completely stopped. They've lost how to serve me. They don't know how to do

546
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,980
it.

547
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,900
Right. So you went to a bar and the bartender doesn't care to serve you, right? They don't

548
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,920
care. This is the problem, right? They just said, you know what, Mike or, you know, Chris,

549
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,540
we only carry, you know, Peruvian amber ale. We don't carry what you want. I don't know.

550
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:44,340
I made something up, but like the DOS Uber IPA, right? Like this is how I feel. And I've

551
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:50,920
been a pretty, like I have bought many Apple machines, both for my businesses and for myself.

552
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:57,240
And I don't know, every time I like deal with them, I feel like I'm not their target customer.

553
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:04,120
They're happy to take my money cause they're a business, but they just don't meet. Like

554
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:09,440
every machine I buy from them is, is very expensive and it's like deeply compromised.

555
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,800
There is the Mac pros keyboard, which is in my opinion, basically unusable. Um, and by

556
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,220
the way, another great bug I found in my $3,000 Mac book pro HDMI doesn't work very well.

557
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,160
It's unreliable. Plug it in. You have to unplug it, replug it. No, no, no. Max, you're supposed

558
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,880
to just work, dude. You're fine. You're fine. You're probably, it doesn't work. And then

559
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,800
I looked it up and it's like, yeah, it's because of the interchange between USB-C I have the

560
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,760
Apple official Belkin adapter that costs $70. And it's just like a bug in the, in the OS

561
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,600
for, for HDMI, right? There was a bug with HDMI. Well, you mean on the flip side on Linux,

562
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,580
you just have, nobody's even bothered to write that score yet. Nothing's up to resident looks

563
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,760
like shit on my phone and on windows is just going to be fixed the next driver release.

564
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,000
We swear we promise just update next. It'll be fixed. We swear. We promise it never gets

565
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,640
fixed. I'm going to push back on it though. So running my Dell on windows 10, which I've

566
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:10,840
been doing for a, I'm going to be doing quite a lot actually. Everything just works. I can't

567
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,840
believe I'm saying that about windows, but what dude? No, it just works. Yeah, it does.

568
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,640
I have had, I have more day to day problems now running my Macbook pro, which I am trying

569
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,760
to do in clamshell motor of HDMI, which people say, Oh, well you should get a DP. Yeah. What

570
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,880
is it? DPI DVI. You should get a mini DVI adapter to thunder pole and you should buy

571
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,720
the special licensed one. And uh, but like I'm not buying 20 adapters. Like I paid $70

572
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:44,680
for an HDMI adapter. I think it ought to work. Um, I'm sorry, but like, so this is the error

573
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:50,680
case. If the laptop goes into suspension or falls asleep because I like got up to take

574
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:57,560
a phone call and it, uh, resumes, you know, wakes up, it sometimes won't notice the HDMI

575
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:03,460
adapter. Then you have to restart the machine, plug it in, unplug it to get it to pick up

576
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,840
the HDMI. Sometimes it doesn't work. I have hit a bug on my editing Macbook where I'll

577
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:14,480
be working on a project. I'll close the lid. I'll arrive at the studio. I plug in my single

578
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,480
Thunderbolt three cable, which provides power, video networking, et cetera, USB. I plugged

579
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,160
that in, opened the lid up and the screen, I have a mouse cursor, but both screens are

580
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,300
red, like bright, bright, bright, bright red. And the only thing I can do is power off

581
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:33,320
the Mac book and power back on. Well, and all these compromises are in the name of what

582
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,840
thinness? Yeah. Right. Like, well, and you know, like the old West has stagnated in,

583
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,480
in terms of stability with, you know, and supposedly, but again, they're turning around

584
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,600
on all of that. It, it really, the thing is, it's like, I have weird ass issues on Linux

585
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:52,980
sometimes too, you know, like my Gallego pro does strange semi military plane lifting off

586
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,480
in my lap things all the time. So I would be willing to bet if you stuck her around

587
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,720
on a windows 10 for six months, issues will start to crop up because in my experience

588
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,200
in all of these systems, the first couple of weeks tend to be like the golden weeks.

589
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,440
Like you just, right. You have not only is it something fresh and new, so that's kind

590
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,380
of nice, but then you don't have like the cruft and all this crap that just eventually

591
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,560
starts causing problems. I don't even know how to explain it. So, so can I take a swing

592
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,280
here? Go for it. Would you agree with the statement that OS stability and quality has

593
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,760
just gone down over the years? Yeah, I was just saying that yesterday. Actually, I was

594
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,000
just having kind of an off the air conversation with Joe about how, uh, it's totally feels

595
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,800
like it's gone downhill. Like, uh, I thought by now all of these little weird things would

596
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:42,240
be worked out by now. Like we would have like fought the good fight and we would have figured

597
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,440
this stuff out, but we still have video issues. So what do you think? Yeah.

598
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,000
Uh, I mean, I think, you know, I, I think it's kind of a shit show to be honest. I think

599
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,440
Apple doesn't know what they're doing. I think you might be right. They may do a maya culpa

600
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,120
and change their mind. I think you're, they really wanted to converge Mac OS and an iOS

601
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,960
and that's maybe becoming hard for them, right? Or they're about to do it. They're getting

602
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,680
windows. Windows has the opposite problem where they're so obsessed with legacy that

603
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:19,000
they can't like, you know, high DPI up some of the control panel stuff. Linux is doing

604
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,760
too many things at once to really get anything done, right? Which is a problem. Well, it's

605
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,960
got to, you got to figure it must have a super high churn rate compared to other longterm

606
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,800
operating system projects because you've got people that are, you know, contributing while

607
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,960
they work at Intel for a few years and then they go over to Samsung and then you have

608
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,360
people whose passions burnout. I think you're right to summarize it. I would say Mac OS

609
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,000
is suffering from a lack of attention and focus from Apple and proper prioritization.

610
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,020
And so that platform has suffered. Windows suffers from a long legacy of technical debt

611
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:57,880
and a super deep spaghetti code infrastructure. And honestly, you know, just team bureaucracy

612
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,080
where different things get prioritized different ways and different things are broken out with

613
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,000
different levels of funding. That's windows. And then on Linux, I think what you have is

614
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,080
a bunch of shallow developers who don't go super deep on a lot of stuff. They, a lot

615
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,960
of them want to work on that big, big core foundational problems, but those cause burnout

616
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,200
and they don't solve the last 10% of user polish problems that we constantly run into.

617
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:26,400
And so each platform has its own particular toxic eroding of its, what should be better

618
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,840
stability, should be better performance, should be more reliable. But these toxic natures

619
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:38,720
to all of them have, I think, sort of prevented that. And I do feel like long, long, long,

620
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,960
long term, hopefully open source would be better because it can just slowly and slowly

621
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,680
and slowly iterate with, with no need to ever generate revenue. So in theory that would

622
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,560
be best longterm, but we so often reset and we have so much apparent development churn.

623
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:03,800
I'm not sure if I just want to say like Wayland, right? Like that entire nightmare. Yeah, it's

624
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,600
been basically in the works for 10 years and it's, you know, just now shipping is default

625
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:17,160
on a couple of distros and Ubuntu is actually rolling it back for their 1804 release. So,

626
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:23,080
you know, what really, what we really want at the end of the day is we want a nice system

627
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,480
that is almost gotta be top of the line. You might have to pay premium and it just comes

628
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,880
and it works. Like you've, you've tried to now order non max and other systems, even

629
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,600
Dell systems, and they've completely blown up in your face. Like we're not there yet

630
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,880
together. So the hardware side of this is a bit of a shit show too, because the whole

631
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,480
hardware industry has been obsessed with mobile now for eight years, nine years. Well, the

632
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:51,960
whole hardware side is nobody's making money. Yeah, that's just a problem. So yeah, I don't

633
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,400
know. I mean, you would think that there was a space for a vendor to come in and say, we

634
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,560
have good machines, high quality components and a stable operating system for you to just

635
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,720
get your work done, right? It's just not the case though. Like you're right, windows after

636
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,000
a long, after a couple of months generally becomes a fricking nightmare, right? Running

637
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,280
windows after, you know, six months is really not fun. A bit rot tends to set in and things,

638
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,120
you know, just right. And you, what you really started to notice with windows is like how

639
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,520
many different installers are there? You know, there's so many different install wizards

640
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,840
and some of them still want to install as a system tray app to like check for updates

641
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,000
to the installer. Like that's still a thing on windows, this mishmash of installation

642
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,440
methods and all of it. It's just, there's a real legacy there that it eventually does

643
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,600
catch up to you. I just, I don't know. I, that's why I've been trying to make the plasma

644
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:57,560
desktop work, to be honest with you, because being able to mix and match my OS, my desktop

645
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,800
environment and my hardware seems to be the only long-term solution. But it, like I said,

646
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,720
I spend a lot of time trying to make that work and it's still not successful, but that's

647
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:11,240
why I keep spending time every week, at least taking a crack at a segment or a show. Like

648
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,320
right now I'm trying to learn this editor called Reaper, which they don't even want

649
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,360
to admit is available for Linux. They make it available for the Mac and for windows and

650
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,400
they make a Linux build, but you got to go through like this double duck blind, this

651
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,640
system to get a download link. So you can try out a beta version of their editor for

652
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,320
Linux. And it's like, well, how long is this going to stick around? And can I even count

653
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,760
on that? So I feel like in a lot of ways, 2018, we've talked a lot around this issue

654
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,480
and about this issue, but it's, it's getting worse and it's been getting worse since about

655
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:49,800
2015, I feel like 2014, it's just started getting shittier and shittier. And, and maybe

656
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,040
with this pro work group and this 2019 Mac pro announcement, you're starting to see Apple

657
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,880
turn it around because I'll give them this. I'd rather they delay it and get it right

658
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,120
and then screw it up and do another trashcan. You know, so see, this is my problem though.

659
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,420
I don't think the issue is like, they don't know how to do it. I think it's just like

660
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:11,240
philosophically not something they want to do is anything they've done before. Basically,

661
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,720
since they've done a tower, they'll never do it again because they've already done it.

662
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,480
Well, it's more that like they see that as a commodity business, right? We're like, if

663
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,380
you can slot in parts off the shelf that, you know, they're not a commodity, they're

664
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:27,680
more of a luxury, they're more of a brand. And it's not a thing they want to compete.

665
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,740
But like, I'm, I'm, I'm tired of waiting, right? Like, that's why I'm, you know, looking

666
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,760
so closely at pop OS. I'm looking at windows 10 because I just seen an OS to like do its

667
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,400
job, be able to be put on any hardware and get out of my way.

668
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,840
Right? Yeah. I, I don't know. I, I think this particular problem is beginning to change.

669
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,800
I think it's going to start getting a lot better on the Mac side. I really do. I don't

670
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,520
know if it's going to be right for me because I, the hardware just will be out of my league.

671
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:01,960
But you know, with Mac OS 10.13.4, they now have official eGPU support for external AMD

672
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:08,500
GPU. So you can hook up a brand new AMD GPU to a MacBook pro. That's a huge deal for professionals.

673
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:14,040
The fact that the iMac pro does at least address a lot of compute needs. I might not want to

674
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,240
use it and I might be a little hurt that it has a, still has thermal throttling, but it's

675
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,400
overall a very fast machine and it seems to be a good value for $5,000 when you include

676
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,080
the 5k screen. And so that's a good sign. And so this Mac pro, you know, it's a ways

677
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,060
off, but they may bite. They may be in the right direction now. I mean, eGPU pro work

678
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:37,920
group team, even though I think that's a little weak sauce, iMac pro and now delaying the

679
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,160
Mac pro until they can get it right. All kind of indicate that they're starting to take

680
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:47,740
this seriously again. Just might be too little too late. Not to even be cliche or quaint

681
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,960
about it, but I think it's just too little too late. And I think that's just the reality

682
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:59,040
of it is there's going to be other categories of machines now that at different price points

683
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,160
and maybe, you know what, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe in a few weeks, if you're still on Windows

684
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,000
10, you'll think it's great. And then maybe this won't be an issue for you anymore, but

685
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,320
I doubt it. We shall see. The Coder, it's like we're stuck in a Coder radio. Did you

686
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,800
ever see that episode of TNG where they just kept getting in a loop over and over again

687
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,640
because they were crashing into a Frazier's ship and then they just kept right. Yes, yes,

688
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,920
yes, yes. Yeah, that's what's happening to us here. So really quickly, before we leave,

689
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,520
I'm going to point you to an article that you'll find in the show notes at Coder dot

690
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:31,840
show slash 305. And I think this is really kind of interesting compared to what we keeping

691
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,160
in mind what we talked about last week. And it's an article that is kind of legitimate.

692
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,680
It's the science of breaking out of your comfort zone. Now, I read through this whole thing

693
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,160
and I found a few areas in here that I think are particularly good. And if you're stuck

694
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,600
on an idea or a project right now, this might be exactly what you need. This is something

695
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,840
I have found helps me a lot. And you know, if you if you're if you're really from a recent

696
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,280
failure or a setback and you need to get new fresh perspective, I really encourage that

697
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,720
you go read the science of breaking out of your comfort zone. You know, really, if you

698
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:08,080
think about it, our brains are engineered to seek out comfort zones because it minimizes

699
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,800
stress. There's patterns and routines that you can recognize. It's it gives you a state

700
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:18,000
of mental security, but it also can kind of kill new ideas. It prevents you from seeing

701
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,600
the big picture. So the idea of this article is to give you a few tools to potentially

702
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,480
break out so you can maybe be more productive. You'll have potentially an easier time dealing

703
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,360
with new and unexpected changes. I know it all sounds really hippie and fufui, but it

704
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,880
works. And I thought it was sort of a nice sort of conclusion to what we talked about

705
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,960
last week. And it is a lifehacker article. But I think you I think you would find it

706
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,920
useful to take a look. We'll have that over at the show notes. Mr. Dominic, is there anything

707
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,240
else we want to talk about this week before we get the snot out of here? Sounds good.

708
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,120
Follow me at Dumanuco on Twitter. Boom at Dumanuco on Twitter. You can follow the whole

709
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:57,140
dang network at Jupiter signal. You can follow me. I'm at Chris LAS. And like I said earlier,

710
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:02,440
we have that new so show website, which means we also have a new show feed. So you can go

711
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:08,240
to coder.show slash RSS to get that new feed coder.show slash RSS. Or if you just want

712
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,680
easy links, coder.show slash subscribe. We also have the subreddit, you can always participate

713
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,480

714
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,400
I'm throwing at your face. But I believe in you. I have faith that you can remember them,

715
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,580
or at least remember one of them. You can also join us live we tend to do this show

716
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:32,240

717
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,160
so much for tuning this week's episode of the coder radio program. I hope you join us

718
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:41,580
right back here. We do this show every single week. And you can count on at least more insightful

719
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:56,600
and deep commentary from Jar Jar Binks.
