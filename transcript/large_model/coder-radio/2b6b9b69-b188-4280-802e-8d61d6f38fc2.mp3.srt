00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Coder Radio, episode 409, for April 12th, 2021.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:19,200
Oh, hey there. This is Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,600
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology. And of course,

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,400
this episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru. Cloud Guru now has that cloud playground.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,120
Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud sandboxes on ACG's credit card. Not yours. Get certified, get

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,660
hired, get learning at a cloudguru.com. My name is Chris and our very own Florida man

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,600
who truly has his heart in New Jersey. It's our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,720
You know, I was going to come in hot with the Jar Jar, but you got me on that one.

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
I did.

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
Yeah.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,400
I thought about it today. I thought, you know, you've been in Florida for a few years now,

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,840
but you're a Jersey guy through and through, you know?

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:04,180
This is sort of like the Yodas fighting Palpatine. He falls and then inexplicably just gives

14
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,480
up when he was winning the entire time.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,160
Right. You kind of just ended up in Florida, but your heart's still in Jersey. But you

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,360
fight the good fight down there, you know? And somebody has to keep count of the Gators

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,920
and that's your job.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,200
Can I tell you, I saw a 10-foot Gator just like chilling on somebody's lawn the other

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
day. I'm like, yeah, this is not a great place to be.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,520
Yeah. When animals can eat your dog, I don't think that's where I want to live. I like

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,680
my dog too much.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Or like your kid.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,720
I kind of, but then it's like, but your stomach's in Texas this week. So, you know, I stalk

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,920
you on the Twitters like I do. And you tweet this picture of a steak breakfast. Like, what

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,060
is this thing? A T-bone you're eating for breakfast?

26
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,680
It was a New York strip. So very on-brand with the New Jersey.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, amazing. Didn't even realize it. Didn't. That's perfect.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,880
So this is, you know, once again, what happens, you fall asleep on YouTube. Inevitably, Jordan

29
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,400
or Michaela Peterson comes on.

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,520
Yeah. Okay. I was going to mention that you're tweeting, you're tweeting Jordan Peterson's

31
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,920
daughter. Just picture. I was like, what's going on there? Like, are you being an evil

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,080
genius and getting like some of her followers to notice your feed or are you actually trying

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
to get her attention?

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:26,320
Why not? Indeed. Why not? I think, I don't know. I think she's, uh, she's, she's probably

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,440
not on the market, but I'm not sure. Isn't she in Canada? You'd have to move. You'd

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,720
have to move. Last I heard they were like, he was like in some sort of weird Russian,

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,960
like hospital or he's back now. He's back. Yeah. He's got a new book too. So, you know,

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,320
watch out. You get in on this book thing, man, these guys, they can just like go MIA

39
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,320
for like two years and then they've come rolling out with a book and now everybody's talking

40
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,560
about him again because they wrote a book, wrote a book, you know,

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,000
I was trying to write a book at one point and I guess I just failed to disappear. Is

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,160
that like a necessary step? You just, you gotta, you gotta peace out for a bit. You

43
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,200
gotta be aloof and mysterious, you know? And then if you don't have any strife to write

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,520
about, you just got to create a bunch of it.

45
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,400
Well, you could, I could just read the YouTube comments. I mean, there you go. There you

46
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,840
go. Okay. So remember, let's go back in time for a moment. Let's do a robe, Mike. It's

47
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,880
going to be so much fun. Let's do a robe. All right. So I had to make an executive decision

48
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,640
this week. We had to just decide to move forward and at this point in time, cancel the international

49
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,000
robe orders. And I hate to be on air saying that, tried so hard to be able to not have

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,340
to say that, but with that loss of this battle, I have committed myself to winning this war.

51
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:57,320
And I have eaten my humble pie from this experience, learned a lot, and I'm going to be talking

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,080
more about what I have figured out. I've done like a whole post-mortem on the whole thing

53
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,880
and realized where the failures lie. And I'm also entertaining several ideas of how to

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,680
solve this problem in the future. And I'm going to work towards solving this problem.

55
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,440
And I will, at some point in the future, well, at least I hope, have another batch of robes

56
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,720
that I will then have at that point, figure out all the international stuff. And I will

57
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,360
either be shipping it directly or I will work with an intermediary party like in the EU

58
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,160
to have them act as a local distributor or something. I will figure it out.

59
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,600
What would, what was it, Valerie? Valerie, I can't even remember the unfiltered soundboard.

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Which one?

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,360
The one with some interesting comments about what to do with the EU.

62
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,400
Oh, yeah. What was her name? Yeah, you're right. Victoria Nuland.

63
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Victoria Nuland. That's

64
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah. F the EU was her famous quote. Yeah, I didn't, you know, because we

65
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,400
have like a 30, 40 percent outside the U.S. audience, right? It's a significant demographic

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,440
for us. I even got notes from people who said, hey, man, I'll even pay $185 of shipping for

67
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,280
a $65 robe. I just want some cool swag for one of my favorite shows. And when you get

68
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,960
notes like that, you're like, wow, OK, I'm going to figure this out. Like, this is something

69
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,120
I really do want to figure out because I want to have all kinds of cool stuff that we can

70
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,040
ship out, maybe in small quantities and whatnot.

71
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,360
I just ordered my LUP beer stein.

72
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,280
So, yeah, so the beer stein is is sourced through Zazzle and they have international

73
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,360
shipping partners already. Where it got tricky with the robe is we went with something that

74
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,880
no fulfillment center fulfills. Right. If I wanted to do a T-shirt, a cotton T-shirt

75
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,320
or a ball cap, or if I wanted to do a face mask right now or a mug or a mouse pad, I

76
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,960
could source that pretty successfully. And there's a lot of fulfillment places that just

77
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,100
manage international shipping. They have incredibly competitive international shipping rates because

78
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,560
they have facilities in those areas and I could fulfill that. But I didn't really want

79
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,520
to do a cotton T-shirt or a ball cap or a mug for the show because I feel like Coda

80
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,280
Radio being around for a while, like we're kind of beyond that stuff. That's like, you

81
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,160
know, beginners merch. Right. We're a sophisticated podcast now. We've been around for a while,

82
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,640
gone through a few losses, come back from it. You know, we're like we're like that couple

83
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,360
now who like has gotten back together and we know each other's flaws, but we're still

84
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,240
just going to work, make it work because we're not going to find anybody better. And like

85
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,120
we're just now we're like in it forever. And so it's like, you know, you don't want to

86
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,680
have beginner swag, you know, like first relationship stuff. That's embarrassing. Like you want your

87
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,480
more sophisticated grown up stuff now. There's so much here. The fact that you're still determined

88
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,040
to do this is amazing. I've been watching Battlestar Galactica. Let's just take the

89
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:57,960
new one, not the not the 80s one. And I would say we are more like the exhausted command

90
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,100
structure who has the number of survivors behind. You know, President Rosalind has the

91
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,520
number of survivors on a whiteboard behind her at all time. And that number is not going

92
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:16,000
up in a positive way. Right. So I think, you know, I mean, we lost Objective C. Mm hmm.

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,920
You all fail to admit the glory that is the Phantom Menace. Right. Right. Continue to

94
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:31,280
insist that Katie is good. And I still cannot change the background on my desktop without

95
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,200
seeing tremendous crashes. Well, listen, all I'm getting from that is you're just encouraging

96
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,040
breeding within the audience. That's what I'm getting from that statement. I don't really

97
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,960
know what to make from that. That's exactly what I'm saying, because then we can be bold.

98
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,860
We can and we can be very progressive. This is our growth strategy. We could indoctrinate

99
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,200
them into the Coder Radio program at an early age. Coder Radio diapers, disposable diapers,

100
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,360
and we could just do it as a subscription. Oh, man. Oh, yeah, man. But diapers, cloths,

101
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,000
any of that stuff, you know, formula, anything that's a consumable with the babies, man,

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,560
that's a whole stage of life. That's just prime for making money. You know, anything

103
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,800
like that. You know, also, we ought to launch a whole pregnancy line of clothing of special

104
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,720
swag just for pregnancy. And, you know, there's a lot of dads out there that like something

105
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,360
a little more comfortable, too. So we could have one for the ladies. And like on the stomach,

106
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,640
it just says compiling. Yeah, that'd be great. And then for different stages of the like

107
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,320
different trimesters, different progress loading bars, you know, like a whole it's like a whole

108
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,640
set that you buy that gets bigger and bigger as you're as the progress bar increases. The

109
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,040
shirt actually gets larger. So it's more comfortable as you're further along. I mean, why has nobody

110
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,160
thought of this, man? I'm just saying money on the table. I have seen one that's for dad's

111
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,200
successful process forked or something. Oh, nice. Yeah. You know, you don't really get

112
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,060
into anything if you understand the scope of the task before you start. That's true.

113
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,600
For development, for media creation, whatever. Now I have seen the scope of the task and

114
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,000
I think I see a path forward, but I don't know yet. It's very beginning of my journey.

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,640
It's humbling. It's been a long time because I've been doing this for a while. It's been

116
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,720
a long time where something like this has has gotten me. It's vexed me. And I've had

117
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,400
to like, oh, shit, I don't know anything about this. You know, I'll get it, though. I'll

118
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,980
get there eventually. Or you will die trying. I will, man. I will. I'm going to give it

119
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,640
my damned best one way or the other. You know, we have some feedback to get into. I feel

120
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,960
like Chuck here is just poking at you. Chuck writes in just for Mike, according to a new

121
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,960
report that was released, Objective C has slid down the popularity rankings yet again.

122
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,440
And it's pretty bad. This is, of course, Chuck has sent us a link that we'll have in the

123
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,000
show notes. This is according to the Tiobi index for April 2021. And Objective C has

124
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,760
now fallen out of the top 20 most popular programming languages as of April. Why would

125
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:02,120
this upset me? This proves that somewhere in hiding the square bracket Jedi order that

126
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,280
is Objective C developers has survived. OK, all right. I'm not seeing the connection,

127
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,000
but I'm going to let you have it. You know, it's yours. Well, if there are so many people

128
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,240
reporting that they're doing Objective C, unless they're all quarter radio listeners

129
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,680
who decided it would be, you know, they're doing it like, ironically, drinking a PBR.

130
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,480
That means that somewhere in the and I can only imagine a kinder land. My brothers and

131
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,200
sisters live. They're still going. You're right. You're right. They have not been taken

132
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,120
out by the Swift drones. Well, actually, this might make you feel better. Swift also saw

133
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:44,600
a decline in popularity. Yeah, it has slid from the 11th place to the 15th place in a

134
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,780
year. Not so good. Meanwhile, the snake, Python, continues to gain popularity and continues

135
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,840
to see particular growth in the data science and artificial intelligence and measuring

136
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,480
machine learning spaces, which I know drives our audience crazy. That seems to be what's

137
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,080
driving a lot of its growth. And Visual Basic and JavaScript essentially stayed put in their

138
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:11,860
ranks coming in at six and seventh, respectively. Damn it. PHP and ninth and SQL as a language

139
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:20,560
in 10th place. So apparently writing SQL is more popular than Objective C or Swift.

140
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,360
Well, yeah, that makes sense to me, though, right? Because SQL, you're going to get a

141
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,360
lot of SQL. Yeah. And you're not just writing SQL. You're running SQL and like insert other

142
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,120
language here, right? Yeah. No, that's it. And it's in like so many things. So I mean,

143
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,640
it's the back. It's a back end storage for so much, especially if you're using like an

144
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,360
ORM. And at some point, it's like, you know what? There's just such an there's an inefficiency

145
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,560
here and I need to write just like a custom query. Yeah. We're a stored procedure. Oh,

146
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:54,080
yeah. Hey, oh, lino.com slash coder. Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards your new

147
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,720
account and go there to support the show. $100 is real money. Let me let me check this.

148
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:06,520
Who authorized this $100? This can't be real. What's that? It's absolutely real. It's been

149
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,480
real for a while. Uh huh. OK, so they just got to go to lino.com slash counter. Oh, all

150
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,520
right. Well, if you go to lino.com slash coder, you will get a $100 credit to try out lino.

151
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,260
They're my hosting provider. Been using them for a couple of years now. And once it was

152
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:28,240
the moment to launch JB 3.0 and I realized, holy crap, I'm going to need a lot of infrastructure.

153
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,240
It was just obvious to go with Linode. I wouldn't do it any other way. I am absolutely happy

154
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,220
a couple of years in. And one of the things I think that's great about Linode is they

155
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,100
have a lot of different distros and the various version of those distros to try and use and

156
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,760
deploy. And I find that immensely useful when I'm testing and prototyping stuff. I have

157
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,280
a project that I'm working on right now. Spoiler alert, it's hosting my own mail server. And

158
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,960
I just thought, let's try it out on several different Linode setups and see which which

159
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,100
set of packages, what system, which distro works the best for me. So I just set up a

160
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,080
few different Linodes and tried it on each one. I took a shot kind of like just a racing,

161
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,600
you know, just race to get installed on each one and saw which worked best for me. And

162
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,720
I think that's immensely valuable. That's immensely valuable for me. And it also gives

163
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,440
me a ton of experience to kind of judge where different distros stand up. And I just find

164
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,120
that very, very handy. It's an example of why Linode's pricing structure makes this

165
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,600
kind of stuff really super simple. They're often 35 to 50 percent less than the major

166
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,760
cloud providers like AWS or Azure, while still being faster, better tools, a cleaner, much,

167
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,860
much, much cleaner design. And they're independently owned and they have been since 2003. Years

168
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,040
ago they became their own ISP. Now they have 11 data centers around the world, super fast

169
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,200
interlinks between them, 40 gigabit connections coming to the hypervisors, crazy fast native

170
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,400
SSDs on the machines. It's great. And they back it all up with fantastic customer service.

171
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,920
So you're not going to get stranded. You're not going to get stuck. They're going to work

172
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,520
with you by phone, by ticket, by email, whatever is best for you. Linode's committed to making

173
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,280
that happen. And they're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing. If it

174
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,660
runs on Linux, it runs on Linode. So go try them out. See what I've been talking about

175
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,200
at linode.com slash coder.

176
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,080
Now let's get into just a few more emails because, you know, we get we get some feedback

177
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,140
from time to time. I actually thought we would get roasted for the hate we tossed Android

178
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,880
last week because I was intentionally being a little incendiary and I didn't really get

179
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,600
it. I guess maybe we've scared all those people away. But Jacob wrote in and said the Mac

180
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,740
is garbage. When I started my career over a decade ago, I was developing on an employer

181
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:44,120
provided MacBook. About two years ago, I switched to developing exclusively in a Linux environment,

182
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,120
usually Kubuntu. My current work recently switched the entire organization to MacBook

183
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,840
only hardware. And coming back to Mac OS after almost a decade of Linux, it feels like the

184
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:01,080
desktop environment has just stagnated full stop. Multi monitor support is minimal at

185
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,320
best. You still can't span a window across multiple monitors or even disable a monitor

186
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,280
from within the OS. After comparing how capable and stable plasma was for me to the child's

187
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,200
toy that Mac OS desktop environment seems to be. Well, it seems like Mac OS has just

188
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,480
become an afterthought for Apple when compared to how iOS has advanced over the years. And

189
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,840
I know here's a hot take with the M1 chip, but I won't be surprised if we just see a

190
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,360
unification of iOS and Mac OS in the next decade now that it's all in one platform.

191
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,500
My thoughts, Jacob. It's a kid like desktop environment.

192
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,800
It's definitely dated, right? It's obvious that there can really, so they're holding

193
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,620
back because in the hardware side, like the M1 is a true achievement, but it's obvious

194
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,600
that they have something big planned for the next, let's say three to four years. And,

195
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,600
you know, with, uh, they still call it catalyst. No, they gave it a real name, right? Combine.

196
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,480
No, it's not that, but I like that. That's just, that is what it should be called the

197
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,240
mulch mulch, whatever it's, they're going somewhere and they're not ready to go there

198
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,280
yet. And it may well be like a hybrid OS.

199
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,880
I find this conversation silly because I just think Apple has said it clearly Mac OS for

200
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,360
the Mac machines and iOS, and then they'll share the fundamentals. A lot of the fundamental

201
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,400
tech APIs, they're going to share a lot of the fundamental tech stack they're going to

202
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,640
share. And now a lot of the fundamental hardware architecture, but they're going to have a

203
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,920
separate desktop and OS for a mouse and keyboard driven interface versus an iOS driven one.

204
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,440
And this reality cannot ever change until you see full fledged Xcode on iOS because

205
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,280
otherwise you're always going to need a Mac.

206
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,040
I also challenged Jacob here, and I don't know how much I have to virtue signal about

207
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,280
how much I love Linux and how long I've used it. And the fact that I've hosted podcasts

208
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,720
about Linux for 14 years, I don't know if I need to virtue signal all that first, but

209
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
I find this complete bullshit that the Mac has stagnated and I'm not Apple's number one

210
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,120
defender when it comes to a Mac environment. But you know, it strikes me that a couple

211
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,120
of releases ago, they completely rewrote their desktop render from OpenGL to Metal, completely

212
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,000
rewrote the whole damn thing and shipped it within one release cycle. Meanwhile, Wayland

213
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,520
has taken like 12 years to even get to the stage it's at right now. So, you know, they

214
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,480
can actually ship when they need to ship.

215
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,320
And then the other thing that I think is pretty remarkable about Apple that you're still seeing

216
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,760
the Linux space flail around like a bunch of idiots that don't know the value of a decent

217
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,080
modern file system is Apple managed to deploy and ship APFS within a super respectable time

218
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,120
window. And not only that, but they managed to convert both their mobile and their desktop

219
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:35,560
user base and you never heard about mass reports of data loss. I'd like to see a Linux distro

220
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,160
pull that off. And meanwhile, they're struggling to figure out if they should even ship Butter

221
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,760
FS or ZFS. It's a total joke because their file system is just completely something out

222
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:49,600
of the 80s now. And Apple has completely successfully rolled those things out. And honestly, that's

223
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,960
just scratching the surface. That's not even bringing in the stuff that they've done security

224
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,960
wise that I actually think has held up pretty well over the years. I mean, you can bitch

225
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,120
and moan about gatekeeper all you want, but the implementation seems pretty solid. And

226
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,000
the one thing they haven't done, which everybody said they would, even now that they've gone

227
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,640
to the M1 platform, is they haven't locked that sucker down. You can still turn gatekeeper

228
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,720
off. You can still right click open and say, yeah, I know it's not safe. I want to do it

229
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,200
anyways. They've still left all of the sideloading style ways to get software on a Mac while

230
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,320
bringing default security that is obvious and just works for end users that they don't

231
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,640
have to think about. And I don't really see that in Linux because they're too busy fighting

232
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,440
over snaps and flat packs. And if things should even be sandboxed in the first place, not

233
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,000
to even mention there's no monetization strategy for people that are creating third party applications

234
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,720
for the desktop. And at least people can make money on the Mac and have been doing so for

235
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,120
10, 20 years. And I don't think any of that stuff should just be tossed away because plasma

236
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,440
lets you define your monitors better. And then on the monitors angle, I will say this.

237
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Let me see the Linux box that can currently do what my MacBook is doing because I thought

238
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,000
let's give this a go. The GNOME 40, it sure is a hell of a lot like the Mac now with its

239
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,260
horizontal layout. But let's see how the Mac handles four different resolution monitors

240
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,600
at different types of arrangements and rotations in a different refresh rates and some that

241
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,720
are HDR and some that aren't. Let's see how the Mac handles that. Well, surprise, surprise.

242
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,800
It handles it about a hundred times better than Linux does. And while plasma is the one

243
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,040
exception that handles it just fine, GNOME Shell, even GNOME Shell 40 and all the other

244
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,640
Linux desktop environments lose their crap every time my system reboots or goes to sleep

245
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,800
and all of my monitors and all of their rotations are completely screwed up, hasn't happened

246
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,860
once on the Mac yet. So I don't know what you're saying, Jacob, because to me it seems

247
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,620
like multi-monitors still have a mixed bag unless you have one precarious special setup

248
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,760
with a special right kind of video card and the right graphics card with the right desktop

249
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,880
environment. So the thing is, I think we have to acknowledge where it's weak to acknowledge

250
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,800
that it needs improvement. And then to appreciate the fact why people are not switching over

251
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,680
to it and to appreciate the fact why the advantages of the M1 with a desktop operating system

252
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,880
that solved all of the above issues that I just named right off the top of my head, then

253
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,940
I think it's worth considering these problems so that way we can fix them and make this

254
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,660
more appealing to people that would actually create software that makes it more usable.

255
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,000
But until we get all those things fixed and checked off, the Mac is still a viable platform

256
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
that has done plenty of progress and we shouldn't discount that. And by the way, that's not

257
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,040
even getting all the advances Windows has done recently with WSL and Windows 10 and

258
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,440
the improvements they've done there. I mean like more than ever, Linux really needs to

259
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,800
get its game up. And I think some distributions like Fedora 34 are doing a fantastic job of

260
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,640
it. I got a little excited there, I apologize.

261
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,240
You did. I would say like if I were like a true Linux advocate, I would be less concerned

262
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,640
with the Mac except on the like, hey, you know, M1 battery life is amazing and more

263
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:49,440
concerned with the pace at which Windows is getting good at doing the Linuxy stuff is

264
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,040
pretty quick. Yeah. And they seem to be partnering with Canonical and the good folks at SUSE

265
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,840
and basically whoever the hell will take their call. And I don't know, like we're still talking

266
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,120
about file systems and like I think this whole snap versus flat pack thing is a waste of

267
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,320
time. But that's because I have strong and well documented opinions on monetization on

268
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,840
desktop Linux. I don't know. I guess if you're worried about eroding desktop Linux market

269
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,920
share, I would be worried about Windows 10.

270
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,360
And you know what that whole me getting worked up on my soapbox didn't even get into is the

271
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:33,120
development options that are available and the lack of a coherent development story around

272
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,960
the Linux desktop, unless maybe you go to a distro like elementary OS open to is trying

273
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,960
to do flutter. Right. But that's a very new, very it was just announced like a month ago

274
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,960
for their future applications. Right. And that would be the blessed development platform.

275
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:54,800
But I, you know, can I throw in a story that we missed? Yeah. Infoworld, which not one

276
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,560
of my favorite sources for reasons that we can discuss a different day, has a article

277
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,320
on the decline of Heroku. You remember Heroku? Oh, yeah. It was a very beautiful, easy deployment

278
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:14,220
thing if you just knew getting Ruby. It caught my eye because they're now owned by Salesforce.

279
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,640
And I actually personally like Heroku, but things like doku exist and the pricing structure

280
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,020
is just a little nuts if you know how to do anything with like Docker or frankly just

281
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:33,440
run a server. So one of the co-founders, none of the founders are at Heroku anymore. Adam

282
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,040
Jacob writes on Twitter, Heroku is like a fallen civilization of elves, beautiful, immortal,

283
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:46,700
beloved by all who encountered it, but still a dead end. That's such a sick burn. You burned.

284
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:52,440
Now I'm waiting for the Python trolls to write me in. Isn't that kind of like Ruby? Beautiful,

285
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,360
but can't do half the stuff Python can do. The snake wins again. You know what? The snake

286
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:05,040
always wins. So before I completely close out on my whole rant about my concerns about

287
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:12,300
the Linux desktop, I say go check out linuxunplugged.com. I think I may have mentioned this on the show,

288
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,760
but I interviewed the Lutris developer and he shared his perspective on a lot of uncomfortable

289
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,720
issues facing Linux desktop software development still. It was an interview I was expecting

290
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,080
to go a different direction and that's the direction it went and I think it tells you

291
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,440
a lot of what people are struggling with from a developer's perspective who are trying to

292
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,020
write software for Linux desktop, not to even mention some of the other basics to make it

293
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:39,640
a decent workstation still. And I absolutely think if you get the right setup and if you

294
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,280
know what you're doing, like you buy from somebody who makes something that works or

295
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,160
you know how to get it all assembled, it's gonna work just fine. You're gonna have a

296
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,520
good experience, you're gonna have a very powerful workstation. I think all that's true,

297
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,480
but I don't think it's fair to say that the other platforms don't have it going on. Last

298
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,080
but not least, Adrian says that I too have stopped playing with my Android ROMs for quite

299
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,000
a while. I just used to tinker all the time, but now honestly I've been running stock Android

300
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,440
since the pixel line. And he says there isn't really much keeping on Android, but iOS doesn't

301
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,120
even have a file manager yet. So you see, geeks do care about this stuff. They do. They

302
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,200
do care about that nitty-ditty gritty stuff like file systems and file managers. And yes,

303
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,160
it does. It does have a file system and a file manager. You just can't do much with

304
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,040
it because it's typical Apple. It's just very broken. I'm impressed how many apps can integrate

305
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:39,200
with it, but it's not really a file browser for just like the iPad file system. No, no

306
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,920
it is not. System76.com. They are systems that are born to run Linux over there and

307
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,840
our friends had a special note they wanted me to pass along. This is my prop piece of

308
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,320
paper that I have today and I am just milking it. But on this piece of prop paper, I have

309
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,920
this supposed theoretical note that they have a few things going on. But the thing

310
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,840
that I thought I should let you know about is that new keyboard that's probably going

311
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,400
to be your new keyboard is Ni. We've talked about the System76 launch before and now we're

312
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,880
starting to get some real hints about the launch and what it's going to look like. It

313
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,240
looks like it's going to be a clean milled chassis with individually addressable RGB

314
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:23,700
LED backlights, which I think is great, hot swap sockets, and a really simple layout to

315
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,080
manage everything for like lighting or custom key bindings and combinations that will be

316
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,640
saved to firmware. Love that because that means it's going to be persistent between

317
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,240
different OS loads and distributions. And they're going to also ship a System76 keyboard

318
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,720
configurator. And of course, the design and the firmware will be open source. They're

319
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,840
starting to tease it right now. We don't have like exact images, but since it's all open

320
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,000
source, you can actually see some of the renderings up on their GitHub page. So go to System76.com

321
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,280
to see the progress on that. And while you're there, go check out the new Thaleo. I think

322
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,520
it's Mira. Mira. Yeah, this the one. That's the one, Mike. Like that thing is the perfect

323
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,280
sized Thaleo for me. Like if I was going to get a Thaleo, that's the one. And it does rise in

324
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:16,200
CPUs, 128 gigabytes of RAM, and they've meticulously engineered, they tell me, the cooling system

325
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,620
now on that thing. And they have this awesome like exploded diagram of it. I can't imagine

326
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:27,000
why they did that. It's so rad now. You should go to the go to the page of the Thaleo and

327
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,600
look at their exploded diagram of how they assemble it. It's modular. It's it's rad.

328
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,560
I mean, they really did meticulously engineer it. They've really gone all in on it. Not

329
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,360
to mention, it's just like one of the best looking desktop lines out there ever built.

330
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,520
I mean, they are handcrafted in Denver, right here in the United States, but they just look

331
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,680
so cool. So go to System76.com to see it all. And if you buy something, leave them a note

332
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,000
saying the Coda program sent you. Longtime friends of the program. And I just love working

333
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,800
with them because I think they have they've really nailed this. And this is a problem

334
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,000
that Mike and I talk about all the time. And System76 has a solution for you. It's systems

335
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,560
born to run Linux at System76.com.

336
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:14,080
Did you see this news that Apple admitted that it keeps iMessage off Android for competitive

337
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,520
reasons completely? Of course. What other? I mean, duh. OK, see, OK, OK. I thought that

338
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,140
might be your take. And I kind of want so I thought maybe you should take that side

339
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,000
of it because I think this is, man, I hate to see this because it's it's one of these

340
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,900
things that tricks consumers. They don't appreciate the ramifications of getting kind of locked

341
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,960
into the iMessage ecosystem. I don't think average users get it. And the key argument

342
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,080
that Apple has is that here is that simply hoarding it over would be it would make it

343
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,400
easier. The reason they don't want to do it. Check this out. This is like actually these

344
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,280
are in court filings for the epic case that came out is because it would make it easier

345
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,720
for parents to put kids on Android. That's they think would be the biggest loss. That

346
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,400
makes a ton of sense to me, right? Because iPhones are expensive and kids are stupid

347
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,760
and break things. Yeah, that's why they should let parents do that. Not to mention family

348
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,600
members. They even had something in-house going for a little while. Eddie Q said in

349
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,160
2013 there were plans to make iMessage for Android that would be fully cross compatible

350
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:18,600
with the iOS platform and that users of both platforms would be able to exchange messages

351
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,240
seamlessly with each other. That's a direct quote from Eddie Q. Then later on, in a deposition

352
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,320
Craig Federighi said iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone

353
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:35,200
families giving their kids Android phones. And then Phil Schiller in an email said when

354
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,480
an email wrote in said, hey, iMessage is like the number one reason I can't leave the iPhone.

355
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,320
Why won't you put this on Android? Phil Schiller wrote back, moving iMessage to Android will

356
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,760
hurt us more than it will help us. This email illustrates why. So they got Craig, Eddie

357
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:56,920
and Phil. All right, this is where Mike becomes evil. I don't understand why this is getting

358
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,160
the play that it's getting. Well, it's because it's them admitting to monopolistic behavior

359
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:07,840
in one sense, admitting that this creates lock in and then. How? How is it admitting

360
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,880
to monopolistic behavior? If you if you have a product or I guess this is a service, right?

361
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:20,580
Why would you let your chief competitor interrupt with it if that only serves to lose you customers?

362
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,920
I think you only could really make the argument that they should win. And if they are of such

363
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,440
a market size that it becomes it makes it impossible for anybody else to exist in the

364
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,840
market, which I don't think they are that size. Right. And there's tons of messaging

365
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,320
services now. And so it would be different if you couldn't SMS message an iPhone, right?

366
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,760
If it was like it's iMessage, like, believe it or not, the next old next machines were

367
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,840
like this. You could only email a fellow next user. Amazing. So they learned their lesson.

368
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,320
But it's I don't I don't see this as a big problem. Like I have taken a look for, you

369
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,280
know, because my son decided to smash my phone during FaceTiming grandma, because that's

370
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:07,360
what we do. Oh, man. And I did not get the accidental damage because that's what I do.

371
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,640
You self insured. Yeah, that's not that good with health insurance either. No, but that's

372
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,080
how you make it sound like it's not a total like financial catastrophe is, oh, no, I just

373
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,480
self insured. Yeah. I mean, I'm selling the iMac Pro if I can find any fool willing to

374
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,080
buy it. I'm actually was looking at a mirror, believe it or not. One of my chief reasons

375
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,040
for being on iMessage is kind of gone. Right. But I was not impressed. Even I was that the

376
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,960
Samsung 21 or something that the Verizon guy was like drooling over. I was like, oh, but

377
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,760
what does it get me with the iPhone? It's like it's two hundred dollars cheaper. I said,

378
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,040
ah, he said, but if you get your if you're getting a plan, then they're both like the

379
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,140
same price. And that's if you don't even care about the privacy ramifications of like having

380
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,600
all of your stuff backed up to Google servers versus Apple servers. All right. And I do

381
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,920
have like like concerns about that because I'm even strongly considering every quarter

382
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,360
moving my business off of Google. Right. It's just that sort of you want to talk about lock

383
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:12,520
in. That's pain that Google AppSauce. Is that what you're talking about? That Google really

384
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:18,160
Google Drive. Yeah. Yeah. That's yeah. I'm hooked on. I'm hooked on the mail. I'm hooked

385
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:25,000
on it, man. Yeah. It's that's that's tough. So I don't know. I mean, what's your angle

386
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,120
on this? Because I think this is like the biggest no story ever. I mean, there's absolutely

387
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,960
a part of me that would love it to just be like a like an open spec. If they would have

388
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,720
open sourced FaceTime like WebOS. Well, remember when Jobs is up on stage and he introduced

389
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,120
FaceTime and he said and tomorrow we're going to the standards bodies and we're going to

390
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,200
open source it. And then, of course, that never happened. Apple got sued. Apple had

391
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:56,460
to rearchitect FaceTime. And I just I imagine this virtual parallel alternative, whatever

392
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,760
you'll have it reality where Apple actually followed through. And a lot of the stuff like

393
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:09,400
iMessage and FaceTime and AirPlay is all open source standards that anybody could implement.

394
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,560
And so the Apple ecosystem would just go so much further beyond just iOS devices and Apple

395
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:20,660
devices. But that reality never panned out. And you're right. I can't come up with a good

396
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,760
justification as to why they should give their competitors something that makes their platform

397
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,960
special. And I think if Google had played their cards right, they would absolutely love

398
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,640
to be in the same position that Apple is with iMessage. I don't think they'd do anything

399
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,920
differently themselves. And now because they're in the underdog position, they'll push for

400
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,820
standards like RCS and perhaps improve the situation for people that aren't on iMessage

401
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,520
that are communicating with iMessage people. Because it sucks. You know, I'm in a couple

402
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:55,740
of family group chats and the Android users stink the chat up. They really do. It's like

403
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:02,440
they don't support tap back for just quick replies to comments. They often embed images

404
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:09,360
weird. They don't support the same reply inline stuff that iMessage does. They crap up the

405
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,600
chat. It's always like, oh, yep. There's cousin Jimmy using the Android device. Messing up

406
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:22,920
the whole group chat now. So it'd be nice if I didn't have that experience, but I cannot

407
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,040
come up with the compelling argument with the market realities that we have in the market

408
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,680
shares realities that we have as to why Apple should.

409
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:39,080
I almost feel like the sexier story to come so far of the epic IBM. Oh, my God. Oh, Apple

410
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:46,440
would not like that. The epic Apple lawsuit is just how premeditated Apple is at controlling

411
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,440
their app server, which I guess we knew. Yeah. But what I didn't know is how long Epic was

412
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,280
planning to do what they did. Yeah. So that's the other side of this that's come out, is

413
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,480
that Epic was playing a bit of a long game themselves and even even hired a firm. Yeah.

414
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,300
Yeah. So according to Apple, Epic hired a PR firm in 2019 to work a media strategy called

415
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:10,360
Project Liberty aimed at portraying Apple as the bad guy, which is probably where that

416
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:15,680
video that came from that that 1984 mocking video that they had just right away. Yeah.

417
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,160
And that they were preparing for this all along and that they knew this was they were

418
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,360
going to run a risk with Apple and that they were just kind of getting their ducks in a

419
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,160
line. And this is some of their example that it's premeditated. And that's where we're

420
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,440
at right now. Right. Epic doesn't have to prove that Apple's a monopoly. Epic just has

421
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:37,320
to make a case that Apple has monopoly like behavior. And it's a pattern of behavior that

422
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,240
would suggest that just like Apple is going to try to make the case that Epic had a pattern

423
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,760
of behavior of preparing for this about specifically trying to violate Apple's policies. And Apple

424
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,600
actually kind of has a solid argument here. First of all, they point out that Epic Games

425
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,980
earned more than 700 million dollars in revenue from the iOS app store and that Fortnite is

426
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:03,560
distributed on other platforms that take even more commission than they do, that have the

427
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,880
same limitations that the iOS app store does in terms of having your own built in app store.

428
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,440
And they say they can't really be a monopoly like Epic is calling them because they're

429
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,840
not a leader in the gaming market. They really are not super strong in gaming. And so they're

430
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,240
not acting like a monopoly in the games, the gaming market, because they're simply not

431
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,440
one. They wish they were more established in the gaming market. They say Epic's monopoly

432
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,600
maintenance claim is premised on the notion that the antitrust laws preclude Apple from

433
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,880
imposing conditions on license use of its intellectual property and impose on Apple

434
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,940
a duty to deal with Epic on the terms of preferred by Epic to the determined of other developers

435
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:50,940
and consumers alike. I don't know if you were going to make a call on this one right now,

436
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,040
which way would you call it, Apple or Epic?

437
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,440
Who I think is going to win. Mm hmm. Apple. I do too. I listened in on one of the live

438
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,180
streams of the court preparing to hear the in person trials and they were doing this

439
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,820
test pilot of live streaming these court sessions to the public because of Covid. You couldn't

440
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,680
go to the courthouse to witness them if you wanted to. So they were live streaming them

441
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:21,320
on YouTube and I and about 20 other people were watching this and and Apple's lawyers

442
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,000
really had their together and they really knew how to talk to the judge with respect

443
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,280
and Epic's lawyers seemed a little sloppy. They had to catch themselves like a couple

444
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,540
of times, didn't refer to the judge properly. But additionally, Apple's lawyers and legal

445
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:45,780
team were pushing to do this in person in court and Epic's legal team had been pushing

446
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,680
to do it all remote over Zoom and Apple made this case for why why that would be more advantageous

447
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,060
to Epic and I think the judge went with it and the judge ruled that they have to do these

448
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:01,400
in person in the court. They can have some remote testimony over video if need be, but

449
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,780
they're going to proceed with the in person trial and just listening to like that planning

450
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:11,220
session for the court case, it really felt like Apple was very confident.

451
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:17,060
I mean, we're not lawyers, right? But Apple doesn't have to prove anything, right? Apple

452
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:24,060
can say Epic has to prove that they're a monopoly, which they're really not. By the way, it's

453
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,440
defined right. Listen to Kara Swisher if you ever want a detailed explanation as to why

454
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,500
that is or any of the really the verge or any place like that. And the other thing is

455
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,960
Apple does have a contract with every developer, right? That's the developer agreement, which

456
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,140
Epic was very obviously in breach of. So what Epic has to say is, yes, we breached this

457
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:52,340
contract, but the contract was illegal because they're a monopoly. Well, that's a big lift.

458
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:57,620
I mean, I could see a world where for however much money Epic screwed them out of in terms

459
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,620
of the 30% cut or whatever number the cut should have been because I'm not sure if Epic

460
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:10,220
is at 30 or 15%. Epic may end up paying them damages back, right? It seems like like both

461
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:16,940
things are true, right? Apple is going to face some sort of regulation for the app store

462
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,860
and it's just going to be industry wide, but they're also going to defeat Epic in this

463
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:28,580
case. So also, I think it's worth remembering that Google also kicked Fortnite out for doing

464
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:36,060
these actions. So it's complicated for Epic in that regard. And they're only choosing

465
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,360
to go after Apple because I think that's the case they can win. But Google kind of did

466
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:46,200
Apple a favor by going along with Apple and kicking them out afterwards. And I think what

467
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,700
regulation does come down, it's going to be a much lighter hand than it would have been

468
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:55,320
a couple of years ago. And Apple is already making the argument that look, we've done

469
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,780
nothing but lower the rates in the app store. We've only lowered the price. And now developers

470
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,660
that make less than a million dollars have even gotten a bigger break, which is, by the

471
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,340
way, they'll say the majority of developers in the app store.

472
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:13,020
And if you if you listen to that interview with Kara Swisher and Tim Cook, he went out

473
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:18,020
of his way to say, I'd even let Parler back in, which, you know, I'm sure he's no fan

474
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:23,100
of Parler, right? But which is not going to happen. Yeah. Well, no, but why? He's defending

475
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,580
his flank to say we don't pick and choose based on whether we like the people, right?

476
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:32,020
It's we have more terms. You follow our terms. You can be in our store. Mazel tov. There you

477
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:37,420
go. If you're really curious about this or if you're like a little anti Apple, read the

478
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:43,020
emails that were disclosed from the epic side about them plotting this entire campaign.

479
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,620
They do not come out, come off as freedom fighters here.

480
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:51,020
OK, now let's hit the pause button and alternate reality mode here for a second. But think

481
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,420
about all of the shit we have bitched about when it comes to the app store and all of

482
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:00,460
the clear abuses of power that Apple has clearly flexed over the years when it comes to independent

483
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,780
developers, developers, especially even you. Wouldn't it kind of be nice for somebody to

484
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,180
come along and punch him in the nose and get them to clean this act up and maybe even make

485
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:13,820
it possible? Like, imagine just for a moment, Mike, for just a moment, if even one one outcome

486
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:19,320
of this is that Apple was mandated to allow third party payment processing so you could

487
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,860
use Stripe or something for subscriptions or whatever, it would be better for developers

488
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,740
and users around the world. Yeah, I mean, there's going to be they're not going to.

489
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,700
I it's not going to happen. I mean, this alternative reality, though, it's not good. I feel like

490
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:37,380
I feel like that's the right. But that's the red line for them. You know, like my my position

491
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,820
on all of this apps or stuff has mellowed out quite a bit, which is ironic because I

492
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,100
think other people have become more militant as I'm kind of like, well, well, I think what

493
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:50,500
it is is you have resigned yourself to the reality while others are now getting their

494
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:55,140
livelihood is now being endangered. And so now they're making a noise where I think DHH

495
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:01,020
is just like utter shock with how the App Store operates was. Yeah. Amazing. Right.

496
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,980
Well, they came for you first because honestly, like, you know, if they go for somebody like

497
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,380
DHH, that's going to get a lot more attention. But they come for you like we bitch about

498
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:12,300
it here on the podcast. Right. But they they still get away with it. But there are there

499
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,300
are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of me, like, you know, relatively

500
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:22,540
small software companies that I mean, I should be fair. I currently do not sell any unless

501
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:28,080
I'm maybe publishing like the Fleet Week app for for the Navy. So but I do not sell any

502
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:35,460
of my own apps on the on the App Store right now. I'm not saying I never would, but we

503
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,260
talked about this a million times. I don't want to rehash it too much, but I constantly

504
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,780
have this problem where I look at my iPad Pro, I'm like, this is an incredible device

505
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,980
that I would love to build software for. But then I look at the investment that would be

506
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:54,300
required. And I read the, you know, the annually updated Apple developer, you know, not just

507
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,700
the human interface guidelines, but the actual rules. And there's always like one or two

508
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:04,100
that I'm like, is this close? And there's it's, it's getting better, right? They're

509
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:08,280
liberalizing some where you can like ask them questions to a point. But it's it's it's a

510
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,160
risk to invest all this capital and energy into developing something on a platform where

511
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,460
they can just say no, you nailed it. That's exactly what the situation is. And so that's

512
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:25,340
why I just think like, imagine a world where third party payment or third party apps, some

513
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,500
sort of sideloading, like like it is on the Mac with gatekeeper, you could still have

514
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,660
where developers, they what's it called? What's it called on the Mac when you sign it? Notarization?

515
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:39,100
Yeah, no, yeah. Why couldn't they just use the notarization system that they have for

516
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:44,420
the Mac on the iPhone? Obviously, not by default, right? They're trying to get a cut, right?

517
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:50,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I just I know we should leave alternate reality world because

518
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:54,140
it's just it's just a waste of energy. But I acknowledge that I think Apple's gonna win

519
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,200
this thing. And I think Apple has the stronger case. And I think epic is from all all evidence

520
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,500
we can see at this point in the public is likely in the wrong here. They knew the rules.

521
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:09,020
But man, man, oh, man, if I could just have them win this so that we some of these things

522
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,580
could be improved. I think it would address the primary issues people really have with

523
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:16,260
the iOS platform. Well, the stronger case and where I think we'll actually see some

524
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,860
sort of regulation and then we should jump off of this is basically the Spotify case.

525
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,220
Oh, yeah. Right. And Apple's already backed down quite a bit on that because Apple is

526
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:32,060
both the platform vendor and a direct application competitor. Apple does not make nor please

527
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:37,340
should you try any video games, right? So they are not, you know, they're just as far

528
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,460
as epic is concerned, they are indeed a store. And if you know anything about how selling

529
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,060
software used to work, the deal with Apple is far better.

530
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:50,580
Data dog.com slash coder radio. Now let's let's talk about data dog. This is a tool

531
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:55,180
you should be using to help visualize your infrastructure analyze code level performance

532
00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:00,620
across your entire environment and troubleshoot issues faster than ever with data talk and

533
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:05,020
communicate them with their beautiful dashboards. Go look at their dashboards, go look at them.

534
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:09,220
Data dog.com slash Coder Radio just to go see these things. And data dog has this feature

535
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:14,780
called continuous profiler. It automatically collects all the metrics from all the places

536
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,520
your applications, your servers, your servers in production, your servers and testing like

537
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,940
you can make it all clear and delineated. And then you can analyze data and results

538
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,580
quickly with minimal overhead and get a unified picture of your environment by correlating

539
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:32,260
code performance metrics with other monitoring data across your entire infrastructure in

540
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,180
these real time dashboards. They have tightly integrated plugins for other applications

541
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,980
or APIs that you can use and tracing and log management that makes it really easy to parse

542
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,580
through all this stuff and get the information in the log super quick. And then you bring

543
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,460
that continuous profiler in. It's all in one platform, you bring it all together and enables

544
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:54,040
you to pinpoint the root cause of issues faster than ever. Save time, save money and communicate

549
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:18,340
What do you think about talking a little history here on the show? You know, COBOL, we all

550
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:25,100
know COBOL, the common business oriented language. It's been around since 1959 in one form or

551
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:30,700
another, so clearly older than I. And it's actually just recently got a little bit of

552
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:40,100
love from IBM. IBM has released version 1.1 of their COBOL suite of tools for Linux and

553
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:48,020
the x86 environment. And they talk about like maintaining interoperability between some

554
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:54,660
of their large mainframe platforms to legacy software never dies. It never dies. In fact,

555
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,620
this set me down a whole rabbit hole. I was actually kind of really getting into this

556
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:06,700
for a bit because, you know, COBOL, it runs so much, almost like still almost all of the

557
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:12,900
major ATM networks run COBOL. Tons of government systems still run COBOL. For you as news for

558
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,140
a little while, a lot of the COVID-19 cases and deaths and positives and negatives and

559
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:24,100
all of that is being tallied on systems where the code is written in COBOL today. Oh, yes.

560
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,660
It's still getting actively used, right? And it just blows my mind that this thing's been

561
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:34,020
around since 59 and is still you can still get jobs for it. And it's it's just been recently

562
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:40,060
updated and ported to Linux for the x86 environment and with with new features added just like

563
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:45,940
last week. Just nuts. I mean, I'm pretty sure the Florida unemployment systems written in

564
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:51,140
COBOL because they famously couldn't find vendors to to help them. Maybe it was for

565
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:55,860
them. But well, so this is the trick now, right? Is it's becoming it's becoming a lack

566
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:02,180
of developers to fulfill IBM's long, long promise of like these these large systems

567
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:08,300
like the system 360 that launched in 1964. IBM pitched it as a promise of if you develop

568
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:14,660
software for this today in 1964, you will run it in 40 years. And they did actually

569
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:21,620
deliver on that. I found this awesome clip that IBM made a few years ago, I think like

570
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:27,400
back in 2004, even they made this this hilarious, cheesy video about how awesome how awesome

571
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,060
their mainframes are for inclusion into the Computer History Museum. And I just grabbed

572
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,460
like a moment of it for us.

573
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:39,780
You know, the 360 and the mainframe didn't just revolutionize the IT industry. With the

574
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:45,500
360, the modern software era was born. You didn't have package software before the 360.

575
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,860
Our computers enabled NASA to land the man on the moon in 1969. The modern financial

576
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,980
services industry was built around the mainframe. And even today's airline reservation systems

577
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,620
have antecedents going all the way back to the 1960s.

578
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:06,020
We've done a lot of things based on 360 technology. Some of the programs we originally created

579
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,980
back in 65 are still running today.

580
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:19,980
The mainframe is here to stay. It's a technology we all grew up with and we know we're comfortable

581
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,020
with. If I look at all the different technologies out there and what we can achieve and what

582
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:29,460
we have achieved on the mainframe, it's the most reliable technology that we have today.

583
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,940
Yeah, it's here to stay.

584
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,940
Here to stay.

585
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:37,100
That was pretty good. And then I got one more really short one. This is IBM's technology

586
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:43,780
chief back in 2004 on the 40th anniversary of the launch of the IBM System 360, talking

587
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:50,180
about how long-term compatibility was a key promise of what IBM was delivering. And of

588
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,020
course they delivered some of that using, of course, Coolball.

589
00:48:53,020 --> 00:49:00,700
As I look back on those days, while the making of a revolutionary product was one thing,

590
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:09,980
what was huge was that System 360 was a platform for genuine innovation. It was a defining

591
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:18,900
moment in the information technology industry. You could say that the System 360 was innovating

592
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:25,700
by anticipating the future, an information technology platform that would be compatible

593
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:35,740
with systems yet to come. IBM made the promise then of computing that's always there, computing

594
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:45,820
that offers what our industry has affectionately come to call the illities, availability, scalability,

595
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:55,300
adaptability, flexibility, manageability. And the System 360 family was the foundation

596
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:01,700
of those promises, promises IBM still extends today.

597
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:05,380
If they can find developers for it. So maybe it's time to go write Cobalt, kids, because

598
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,620
they're still looking for people to write applications.

599
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,880
It gives me hope.

600
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,620
We have one last email, but maybe we should save this for the Coderly.

601
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,620
Let's save it.

602
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:19,300
Bonus Coderly email. That'd be kind of fun. We haven't done an email in the Coderly before.

603
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:24,140
So that is recorded every quarter and we release that for our members. It's a way to support

604
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:29,980
the show. We have a membership program at CoderQA.co and you become a member and you

605
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:34,940
support the show. You get a limited ad feed as a thank you and that Coderly report. Did

606
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:40,260
I say that right? Anyways, we're recording one very soon, very, very soon. So it'll be

607
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,600
in your members feed in just a few short days. So if you're not a member yet, you can sign

608
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:49,300
up now at CoderQA.co and then you'll get that when we release it and we thank everybody

609
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,920
who is a member.

610
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,300
Go get yourself some Mike on Twitter. He's at Dumanuco and his company's at the Mad

611
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,540
Botter Inc over there. Anything you want to plug this week, Mr. Dominic?

612
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:02,100
No, if you need any Python or dare I say Objective-C development done, let me know.

613
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:07,020
There you go. Nice. I'm at Chris Lass on the Twitter. The podcast network is at Jupiter

614
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:11,940
Signal and the show itself is at Coder Radio Show. Links to some of the things we talked

615
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:17,820
about today and that entire video for that IBM mainframe party at the Computer History

616
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:23,720
Museum. That's linked in the show notes too. That's at Coder.show slash 409. You also find

617
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:29,380
our contact form over there as well as our RSS feed. And I'd encourage you, I'd personally

618
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,580
like to invite you to join us to the, to the live stream at the Coder happy hour, the live

619
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:39,060
