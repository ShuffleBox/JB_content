00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,800
This is KOTORadio, episode 422 for July 12th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,160
Hello friend and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,760
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,500
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,640
My name is Chris, but that don't matter because joining us like every single week is our host,

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,520
it's Mr. Dominic for a little bit longer from the Sunshine State.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,520
Hello Mike.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
Thank you for calling Florida.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,200
We've got a Gator, we've got some IPAs.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm going to miss it.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
You're going to miss it?

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
I'm going to miss it.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,000
We've got the Stanley Cup again.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,840
You know, there's something fun about you being our Florida guy, but when you go to

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,920
Jersey now, man, you know, Jersey's scary.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,920
I don't know.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,360
You know, like one, one time I was just driving along and I looked over there and I think

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,720
I saw some guy getting murdered just like from the road.

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,000
Like it was bad, man.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, absolutely.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,400
Every exit on the parkway, there's a guy getting shot in the back of the head, execution style.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Yeah.

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
The polite thing to do is to wave.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Just yeah, keep about, keep going on about your business.

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Don't mind me.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,820
We can do a, you know, an AB test real quick.

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,840
So the app store in Florida is, oh, bless your heart.

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
We can't accept your app.

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,080
In New Jersey it's, it's a nice app you got there.

34
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,760
Fortunately we had a problem.

35
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,280
We're going to need a 30% and we're going to come by every week.

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,320
I'm going to get a 30% we're going to need a $99 minimum a year.

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Okay.

38
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Capisce?

39
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,840
And if the rules change, screw you.

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Pay us.

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Okay.

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,440
Listen, you want to have a sit down?

43
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,880
Well we don't answer the phone.

44
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Good luck.

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Business.

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Yeah.

47
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,840
So, um, what are you trying to make sure that I don't catch up to you?

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,080
Is that what you're trying to do over there?

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,960
Like I come on the air and tell you about my big old 17 gallon accident of water spilling

50
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,880
all over my electronics and you're like, hold my beer.

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,960
The worst part was, you know, there've been some jokes about perhaps certain spirits have

52
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,240
flown into Mac books.

53
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Sure.

54
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,360
I was actually asleep.

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
It was actually water.

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,240
And let this be a lesson to you kids about having your nightstand way too close to your

57
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,520
bed and coding at night.

58
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
Oh, what happened?

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
I thought I was clever.

60
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,280
I was on my Lenovo X1 carbon, which I cannot recommend enough, by the way, if you're looking

61
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,540
for a windows machine.

62
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,860
And I believe, and folks in the chat will correct me, but I believe the carbon is one

63
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,480
of the fedora certified ones, right?

64
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
That's the one I got.

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
All right.

66
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,880
So I have, I have the windows version cause I'm, I was, I'm ironically, I don't need another

67
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,140
windows machine, but I'm on a windows project doing terrible things that I'm sad about because

68
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,320
they almost just whatever.

69
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
But you know, I'm coding at night.

70
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,100
I'm trying to catch up five year old schools out.

71
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,880
You can imagine that I do a lot of work at night.

72
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
Yeah.

73
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
So I'm getting tired.

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
I'm in bed.

75
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,320
I'm a little too lazy to go back into the other room.

76
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,320
So I'm like, okay, let me just close the laptop up, put it between the bed and the nightstand,

77
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
right?

78
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,120
There's a little gap there, a little negative space.

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,040
And I have my glass of water cause I go to, I mean, this is way too inside Mike's bedroom.

80
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,960
Although the coder leader, I'm picturing it though.

81
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Picture it.

82
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Yeah.

83
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
I have my Valeri.

84
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Are you wearing, are you wearing?

85
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Yeah.

86
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Okay.

87
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Tell me, go ahead.

88
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
My, my coder robe, right?

89
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Of course.

90
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Smoking a pipe.

91
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,040
Do you have like one of those little silk caps?

92
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,720
I do not, but I should, that's a, that's a great addition actually.

93
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Yeah.

94
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,480
So, you know, I have my, my sleepy time tea and I was careful to move the tea away from

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,440
the edge of the nightstand thinking that the small cup of tea was the biggest threat.

96
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,560
Not the giant Linux 400 stein of water, no, no.

97
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
I love it.

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,980
I'm glad it was the stein though.

99
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:06,160
This was a very JB on brand destruction of a Lenovo laptop.

100
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,800
Everybody tells me you could spill water on these things.

101
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
They got drain holes in them.

102
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
They tell me.

103
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,520
Well, not if they're sideways and the water goes directly into the Thunderbolt ports.

104
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Oh yeah.

105
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Yeah.

106
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,720
You know, it was a, I turned it on and it, it, the fan feebly tried to kick up and it

107
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,160
made the screech and it, and it, after even a day in a giant bowl of rice, never, it's,

108
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
it's done.

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Yeah.

110
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,000
And you know, they have all those little water sensors in there now where they can see if

111
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I got wet.

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,360
So they know, they know.

113
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,400
Actually if you read the patent, those are called Mike sensors.

114
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
So now what?

115
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Now what are you going to do?

116
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,040
Uh, nothing until I get to New Jersey cause yeah, listen, I can't survive going to sleep.

117
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,760
How do you think transit is for me?

118
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Yeah.

119
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,720
I just wonder, are you going to do another X one or are you going to try something else?

120
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,880
It's an opportunity to try another rig.

121
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,820
I mean, it's not a great opportunity, but it's an opportunity.

122
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,820
I was thinking of it.

123
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,520
I was thinking of trying an XPS again.

124
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,440
I haven't had an XPS in four or five years, but see the thing with the XPS is I would

125
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,960
be tempted to try the Sputnik edition.

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Why not dual boot?

127
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Yeah.

128
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,440
Cause I'm not going to pay the stupid prices for the storage.

129
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,560
The other thing is I was looking at laptops right now, the prices are on crack.

130
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,400
Oh, are they because of all the supply issues or something?

131
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Yeah.

132
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,720
If you want anything that's like not like mid range, if you want something nice, which

133
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,160
I don't know why I would cause they only last four weeks, but um.

134
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,800
Really at this point you should just be buying Chromebooks.

135
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Let's be honest.

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,000
You know, I just, I got to put it up, but I just talked to the folks from shells on

137
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,680
the Mike Dominic show and that seems like the ideal situation for me, a Chromebook and

138
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,640
just a bunch of VMs running around in the cloud.

139
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Yeah.

140
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,600
You got to wonder or even a tablet, you know, uh, it seems like that could be another route

141
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
to go.

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Yeah.

143
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,700
An iPad, iPad pro with like a nice keyboard, but um, although now I'm a crack head for

144
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,700
my launch keyboard.

145
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,700
So.

146
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
Oh yeah.

147
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,200
I still feel and I paid full price.

148
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,920
I still feel the launch keyboard is the best keyboard I've ever owned.

149
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Yeah.

150
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,080
I also paid full price last night though.

151
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Could not sleep.

152
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,920
I have this problem where if I fall asleep and then get woken up within about 20, 30

153
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,400
minutes of falling asleep, I do not fall asleep again for the rest of the night.

154
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,800
I don't know if anybody else has this problem and if you figured out how to solve it, let

155
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
me know.

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,280
But like after two hours, it's just two and a half hours of just laying there.

157
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,360
I just gave up and I got up to work, but I grabbed the iPad and I brought up, I think

158
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:31,080
it's Termulus on there and um, SSH into my server and just spent the evening over a wire

159
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,720
guard connection, SSH into a server here at the studio, building out a website.

160
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,840
And it was great.

161
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,080
It just struck me like the, I really liked the, uh, the new multitasking stuff that's

162
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,220
in iOS 15 because I had, I had a couple of windows up.

163
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,400
I was checking a guide while also switching over to the terminal.

164
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,280
And I kind of feel like they've made some substantive improvements in iOS 15 on the

165
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,860
iPad in terms of multitasking.

166
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,720
And mostly what they did is they just added some stupid dots.

167
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,260
So I know where to drag stuff and I know where my dumb meat clicker needs to go.

168
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,260
That's all it took.

169
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,260
Have you played with it?

170
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,260
I have.

171
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:15,320
It's really going to, okay, can I just take a quick detour before I go into a full rant?

172
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Yeah.

173
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,120
Someone suggested new merch for you, Chris, Coder sippy cups or water bottles.

174
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,800
I think that's a good, that's an easy one.

175
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,600
Something with a no tip base.

176
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,040
We got to get on that.

177
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,560
So okay.

178
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,480
The new iPad multitasking is so good that it pisses me off because of the dumb API restrictions

179
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,440
that iOS still has or iPad OS.

180
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,380
Of course they've never been closer to the star Trek dream of the tablet that you're

181
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,640
just like a commander Sulu, you know, throw this stuff up or it was a commander Sulu or

182
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,680
is it Lieutenant Sulu commander, right?

183
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,320
It depends on if it's star Trek six or if it's earlier in the, oh, that's right.

184
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,280
He gets a, he gets a promotion, but whatever.

185
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Right.

186
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,200
And you know, I would love to hear from like full time, like I guess you could be a swift

187
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
iOS developer.

188
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
No, you can't.

189
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
You know why?

190
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Because they don't exist.

191
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,280
There's a part of the story I didn't share chair.

192
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,820
I was on the iPad and I needed to retrieve this IRC log because, um, let's just say that

193
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,600
I had an incident during last week's Linux unplugged.

194
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Oh boy.

195
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Um, yeah.

196
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:21,060
A founder of a really kind of high focus, high attention, open source project came into

197
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,760
our IRC room and things got a little wild.

198
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,440
And after, after it all went, after it was all done, I thought to myself, you know what?

199
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,040
I want the logs of that because I want to be able to talk about it in the show and I

200
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,280
need to be able to prove it happened.

201
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:45,400
So I went to pull my log and it generated my IRC log all the way back to 2016.

202
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,560
That was like, it was like a T it's like a 260 megabyte text file.

203
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
Right.

204
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Okay.

205
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,140
And nothing on iOS was having this and boy does like the file management fall down.

206
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,580
It's gotten a lot better.

207
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,360
But when you're trying to move around, like first of all, I needed to extract it from

208
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,640
a zip file.

209
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,520
When I needed to do something, yeah, no, it just started falling apart.

210
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,700
And even once I got it into its text form out of the zip file, none of the text editors

211
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,920
that I have on iOS could open it.

212
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,440
They all just kind of just crashed out.

213
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,660
Cause they have to use stupid URL schemes to open the, uh, yeah.

214
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:25,460
So I toss it, I toss it in Dropbox and I go open it up on my Linux desktop and K write.

215
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,240
And it opened like it was three lines of text.

216
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,080
I mean, it opened instantly.

217
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,640
It was, it was a total, absolute non-issue on my desktop.

218
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,520
And I struggled with it for 20 minutes on iOS and gave up.

219
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,680
So it's not all there.

220
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,720
Like this is the dumb thing though.

221
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,660
This isn't like a Linux master race case.

222
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,640
This is like iOS is based on macOS, right?

223
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,960
It's like the same core.

224
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,260
I know people will jump, but that's true.

225
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:57,960
It's just like a decision that they made was to limit iOS in this way for no reason, right?

226
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
It's fast enough.

227
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,160
It's fast enough to power.

228
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,240
But just the SDKs they make available, the APIs they make available, um, frankly they,

229
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,440
they, uh, hamstring the developers such that they can't do simple like open a 256 meg text

230
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
file.

231
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Sorry, keep going.

232
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,520
It's just, it is kind of disappointing because it's, you know, an iPad pro and I would wager

233
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,780
that if I bought the new iPad pro with the 16 gigs of Ram option, this would likely still

234
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,780
be a problem.

235
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,340
And it's just kind of like, uh, sort of, it's sort of too bad.

236
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,720
What I ended up doing last night while I couldn't sleep was just a terminal, some web browser

237
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,960
and some chat.

238
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,360
And I mean, I just, I probably worked for three, three and a half hours without, without

239
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,520
any interruptions because it was the middle of the night.

240
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,480
It was so glorious.

241
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,680
And the iPad just chugged right along.

242
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,160
Chris, don't make me, don't make me install Xcode again.

243
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Don't.

244
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
I am sorry.

245
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
All right.

246
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Dan writes into the show.

247
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,720
He says, guys, I just listened to episode 421 and I wanted to confirm what I think Michael

248
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,840
said about the programming language of the future.

249
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Sorry, Chris.

250
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
I don't know about Rust.

251
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,320
It's definitely going to be Java or TypeScript.

252
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,500
I'd love it to be Rust, but the community still doesn't get what it takes to succeed

253
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,240
in the enterprise ecosystem, i.e. being boring and stable to an extent like Go has become.

254
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,560
Rust just loves to pump out new releases and create too many nightly only features that

255
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,460
people can't keep track of.

256
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,920
And when that's paired with no LTS version, it makes Rust unappealing to the enterprise.

257
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,680
That's a point that I guess I don't really have a lot of insight into, so I hadn't really

258
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
considered it.

259
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,840
But I suppose it looks like Rust does move pretty quick right now.

260
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,360
Yeah, I could see how something like Go would be more appealing to an enterprise developer,

261
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,440
especially when you have projects that take years to build.

262
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah, I don't really have a lot more than I said last episode.

263
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,680
I mean, you know, to add here just that it's interesting since we started the show, enterprise

264
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,360
product managers who maybe don't have technical backgrounds in the 13 years we've been doing

265
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,080
this have learned one lesson, and possibly only one lesson.

266
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,980
Do not use esoteric technology that some weird vendor, some weird bespoke vendor local to

267
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,200
you does.

268
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,240
Use something super common that you can fire them and hire someone in India or wherever.

269
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,280
Or just some other local vendor, right?

270
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,760
So I mean, it's why Python is just a lot easier for me to sell now than Ruby, frankly.

271
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,720
Which Ruby is not even that weird of a technology.

272
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,680
It's just Python has the market share wise.

273
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,640
And so do you think part of that is your clients are doing the math saying, well, if I fire

274
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,080
this jackass, I can hire another guy and he'll pick it right back up?

275
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,840
Well, there's two levels of math, right?

276
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,680
Because you know, in our case, we're the Mad Botters, a small shop.

277
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,240
We've been around for a while, but we're, you know, we're still like, we're small.

278
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,880
So it's if we fire them.

279
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,720
But the more common case, because I think people like to be polite, is if you guys go

280
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,960
out of business or you sell for whatever reason, can we replace you?

281
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
You know, easily.

282
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Right.

283
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
If you get a big fat paycheck.

284
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Right.

285
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
That's a nice way to say it.

286
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Yeah.

287
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
I mean, what they really mean is if we fire you.

288
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Right.

289
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Yeah.

290
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Of course.

291
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
It's, you know, like rust.

292
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,100
There's just like, I've even like looked around.

293
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,220
There are rust vendors and they seem great, but they're awfully expensive.

294
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,180
It also just doesn't feel like that's the, that's not the place rust is at right now.

295
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,320
It is still new.

296
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,520
There is still a lot being figured out.

297
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,960
We're just now seeing major vendors.

298
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,600
Talk publicly about how they think they might incorporate it.

299
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,240
Like an example is Microsoft is considering rewriting aspects of the hyper V code for

300
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,780
Linux in rust, but they haven't done it yet, but they are discussing that.

301
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:38,060
And Google has just put forward an initiative and is helping pay for a developer to contribute

302
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,340
to rust for the Linux kernel full-time, but that's just begun, right?

303
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,260
It's early days for mainstream adoption still.

304
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,760
It's a lot of people are using it, but when you look at enterprises like Amazon and, and

305
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,120
Microsoft and Google, it's still early days.

306
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Yeah.

307
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,200
And just for some real time followup from the chat room, X S X Sierra, Charlie 27, I'm

308
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,720
going to use, I don't know what you mean there, buddy, but okay.

309
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,360
Is saying a TypeScript is hot, but as rust and TypeScript in the same domain, obviously

310
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,660
they're not right.

311
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,720
But I can give you the perfect example that I'm using, right?

312
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,220
We're using Python as the high level business language, business logic language and C plus

313
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,960
plus as the underlying performing code and that you could use rust and something else.

314
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
I, in fact, I did that.

315
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,520
If you listen back maybe a year ago, I did something where it was Ruby as the business

316
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:32,920
logic with a rust, a native rust library for Linux that I wrote doing some, um, uh, Oh

317
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
my God.

318
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
The stupid 3d files.

319
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
I talk about them all.

320
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
STL.

321
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
No.

322
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Oh my God.

323
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
A color OBJ.

324
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,480
I can't remember the name of the file format, but it's these color 3d it's the ones that

325
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,800
you use for 3d modeling.

326
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,240
I can't remember the name off the top of my head, but that was a case where the performance

327
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,320
calculations for the three graphics were done in rust, right?

328
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,780
Via a native library, via FFI.

329
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,000
But the general business logic of the application was done in Ruby because we're just, you know,

330
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,440
Ruby is just like an easier language to work in.

331
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Right?

332
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,920
So yeah, especially if you've already done, you know, some pre-work in there like years

333
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
of Ruby.

334
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Right?

335
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Yeah.

336
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
All right.

337
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,000
So we've got a lot of conversation about the Apple store, Epic and antitrust.

338
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,080
But one of the things that I think a lot of people have missed is that Apple is no longer

339
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:25,120
a hardware company and they're not a software company and they're not even a services company.

340
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,760
Apple I think is selling an experience and the only tech company that is doing it, which

341
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,200
is a major reason why they are appealing to a lot of people.

342
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:40,160
Apple computers, watch, iPhone, iPad, home, everything integrates together messaging,

343
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,760
including SMS across all your devices, answer your phone from your watch or on your computer,

344
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,880
automate much of your house with home kit and turn on the lights with Siri with a voice

345
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,840
command while you're driving home.

346
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,000
This is the Apple worldview or maybe what you might call the experience.

347
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,680
And it's actually pretty nice when you buy into their entire ecosystem.

348
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,920
Part of that experience is the app store.

349
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,880
In my opinion, where Apple really went wrong was letting everything into the app store

350
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,900
and not curating the apps.

351
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,820
We end up with a lot of junk and a race to the bottom and allowing sideloading would

352
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,000
only worsen this problem.

353
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,920
That's an interesting point.

354
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,600
Sideloading would perhaps negatively impact the pricing on the platform.

355
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,800
What do you think of that?

356
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,520
I sort of separate it into two different spaces.

357
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,760
I think he's right in the consumer space that sideloading would only lead to a bunch of

358
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,880
piracy and a bunch of bullsh**, fair enough, lowering prices for developers.

359
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,720
I just want to say, though, that perhaps over the years, my perspective has changed.

360
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,760
I've gone from selling consumer apps to basically enterprise products.

361
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,360
I'm not sure what you call an app or a program these days, but I guess everything's an app,

362
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
right?

363
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
So apps.

364
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
All right.

365
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,720
Look, I have multiple customers that I have decked out with Surface Pro Xs and Surface

366
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,480
Pro tablets and even a couple of Surface Go's, not because Windows was the better platform

367
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,480
to work in, although in some cases it was because of hardware compatibility and drivers.

368
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,500
Not because we prefer working with Windows.

369
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
We don't.

370
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,320
Our primary, most of our stuff runs on Linux, but given our druthers, the client side environment

371
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,700
would be the DOM, the web browser, and then second to that, iOS.

372
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,240
It's just never worth it to deal with the enterprise provisioning for Apple where you

373
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,520
have to like code sign and go through their weird enterprise portal for just like a factory

374
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,480
or for like a farm or for like a hangar.

375
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,200
It's just never worth it when I can just tell someone to buy like 20 Surface tablets.

376
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,920
We write the thing, we code sign it, you know, we self sign their certificate and we can

377
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,920
just manage our own installation without going through a third party.

378
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,840
I know for those who haven't done it, that might seem petty, but Apple, even in the enterprise

379
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,040
still gets to decide what the hell you do.

380
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,960
And if I can just make a case or an example of a case from, was it 18 months ago when

381
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,840
Apple got pissed off at Facebook and you couldn't order a lunch if you were a Facebook employee

382
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,280
because the iPad app broke in the cafeteria because Apple just revoked the certificate.

383
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,200
That's, that's bull.

384
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,420
That shouldn't be the way things are, at least not in the enterprise.

385
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,960
A lot of their internal apps broke.

386
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Just broke.

387
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
A lot of them.

388
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Yeah.

389
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,320
That is my core issue, you know, cause I sell mostly B2B software.

390
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:35,360
If I could write iOS apps for iPad in particular and just like deploy them like I do, you know,

391
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,520
not on the app store, but the, uh, whatever private deployment mechanism without going

392
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,440
through Apple, I would probably in almost every case prefer iOS.

393
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Yeah.

394
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,000
The thing is with the Microsoft Surfaces, let's be honest, it's not that hard of a sale

395
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,840
because they're probably already buying them for some users or they're buying something

396
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,040
in the windows ecosystem.

397
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,200
They probably already have an active directory system.

398
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,400
They probably already have group policy.

399
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,960
They already have audit procedures around the windows desktop.

400
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,520
So it's not a particularly hard sell to get them to, to deploy it on a, on a, on a surface.

401
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Yeah, no.

402
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,120
I mean, I have a customer who's a huge Linux fan, JB fan, and you know, we ended up just

403
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,800
going windows for the simple reason that he needed a good touchscreen environment for

404
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
these tablets.

405
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
You bastard.

406
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,720
And you know, Ubuntu touch, uh, sorry, you know, it wasn't even considered, but like

407
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,380
the hurdles of like getting him enrolled in the enterprise program for iOS, it just like

408
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,440
no one wants to delay a project because you know, mom doesn't, you know, mother apple

409
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
doesn't want to let you do something right.

410
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
That's, that's ridiculous.

411
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
So.

412
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
All right.

413
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,660
Well he just wraps up and wraps up real quick with, I think part of the problem is that

414
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,800
everyone is thinking of each part of the experience as a separate thing and I want to pause right

415
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
here.

416
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,000
I've had the experience and I'm a, you know, I'm a daily iPhone user and I have an iPad

417
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,400
and I have the watch and over time I got the air pods.

418
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Apple action show.

419
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,720
Right over, over time it's like you do get sucked in.

420
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
Just the air pods.

421
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,000
And the thing is so far, but the thing is in its own, it's not, it's not, it's not as

422
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
good of an experience.

423
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,800
So when my friends that maybe are Android users get an iPhone or get an iPad, they're

424
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
very frustrated.

425
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
They find it very limited.

426
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,800
They, they're very frustrated by the experience because I think it, it does require that you

427
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,060
kind of are all in on the entire experience, um, where all the pieces do fit together.

428
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,980
So he finishes with saying, I liken it to visiting Disney world.

429
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,400
You can buy a ticket at the gate when you get there and you can pack your own lunch

430
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,680
and you can wait in all the lines and you can still have a decent time or you can order

431
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,140
a package deal ahead of time, stay at a resort, eat in the restaurants with Disney characters

432
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,000
and skip the lines with fast passes and VIP tours.

433
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,280
Yes, it will cost some more and you will be at the mercy of a schedule, but you will get

434
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,320
more of the experience that Disney is trying to offer you and have a great vacation experience.

435
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,380
The Linux and Android experience can't even come close.

436
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,060
It's more like visiting a local county fair.

437
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:01,200
It seems like a good idea before you go and you'll have a good time, but it isn't anything

438
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
special.

439
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Don't order the scallops.

440
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Yep.

441
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,920
That's a pretty, I mean that guy, that guy's dropping bombs right there, Em.

442
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,000
You're dropping bombs.

443
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,280
So I will say the, the thing that keeps me locked into the Mac ecosystem, or I shouldn't

444
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:18,080
call it Mac, I should call it the Apple ecosystem, is not the incredibly amazing M1 chip.

445
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,200
And I don't care what you say on Reddit, it's still amazing and you guys have to accept

446
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
that.

447
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,660
Um, the beautiful sound quality of the home pods that Chris intentionally didn't mention,

448
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:32,720
the wonderful connectivity of the AirPods max and the incredible disappointment that

449
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,520
I feel with the iPad pro because Apple only do what it needs to do.

450
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,960
I think we're like at $3,000 worth of gear now, maybe $5,000 worth of gear so far.

451
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
Right.

452
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
But that's what it is.

453
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,520
Every, every piece of Apple hardware you buy, it's just like another hit of heroin, right?

454
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,160
Always using theme parks, very family friendly.

455
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,200
I'm going to go the other way.

456
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,000
At some point, you know, you're just, you're just turning tricks on the street corner for,

457
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,840
you know, honestly, I almost bought a purple iMac.

458
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,720
Do I need a purple iMac?

459
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,160
Does anybody think in the audience that I need a purple iMac?

460
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Probably not.

461
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
No.

462
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,920
So I mean, it's just, it's a crack because you turn around and it's like, do you have

463
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,480
an, I see you have another Apple device.

464
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,440
Would you like us to magically set this up?

465
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,400
Oh, we see you have Apple music.

466
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,360
I, you know, I wouldn't even necessarily undersell it because if they, if they blew it every

467
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,160
time, every time you bought one of those products, you're like, oh, well, this sucks.

468
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,360
You would stop buying them.

469
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Right.

470
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,840
But the thing is, is they are meeting or exceeding your expectations.

471
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,200
Now I'm not, I actually feel like there is also the flip side where you have people who

472
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,800
prefer to assemble things.

473
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,840
They prefer to build things.

474
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,640
They prefer to build a repair things.

475
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,080
We've had this conversation before and I feel like that doesn't get enough airtime in this

476
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,360
conversation because that is a large group of people, but it's just not where people

477
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,760
who are maybe heads down, very busy at work, managing a business, managing customers, managing

478
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,260
at such projects.

479
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,440
That's not where maybe their heads at.

480
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,560
So, and that's you and I, we're very much these days, we're very busy and we hear from

481
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,440
our audience who feel like they're very much in the same place, but there is, there is

482
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,360
a different kind of value in that stuff and I kind of look at it and I think to myself,

483
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,960
I just wish, I wish somebody could create like a machine that was close to a middle

484
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,000
ground of all this stuff, but he does, I do agree with the overall experience like you're

485
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
alluding to as well.

486
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,640
If you, if you want to fork out the cash for it, you know, like one of the things that

487
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,000
just as an example of this, it's pretty, pretty nice is if you got the watch and you've got

488
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,600
the Apple TV automatically without you having to do anything, the watch automatically just

489
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,800
becomes playback controller for the TV if it's not doing anything.

490
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,840
So you get play, pause, skip.

491
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Wait, it does?

492
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Yeah.

493
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
It's so great.

494
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,080
I have like three Apple TVs, I didn't wait.

495
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,460
So if I just really, yeah, it's cause what's happening is on your, you know, it's the same

496
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,460
thing on your iPhone.

497
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,120
When you go into the control center and you look at all the different airplay devices,

498
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,400
you can pop, you can pop in and control the Apple TV there too.

499
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,600
And when your phone detects it, your watch detects it and it's so nice and you maybe

500
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,580
have to do it once, maybe, and then it does it all the time.

501
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,840
And so if like my kids are watching TV and they're not listening to me, I just flick

502
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,360
my wrist up and hit the pause button.

503
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Boom.

504
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,360
TV pauses instantly.

505
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,040
I went on a hunt for the remote and I didn't have to go like set up any config file or

506
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,480
set up any special DNS or do anything weird to my DHCP server.

507
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
It just works.

508
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,320
Wait, you didn't get to pop open nano and realize you don't have them installed?

509
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,160
That's the experience though that he's talking about there.

510
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
And I do agree.

511
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,600
It's, it is nice when it works.

512
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,520
By the way, if you use nano, please explain why.

513
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,640
I love nano.

514
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
It's great.

515
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
Get the f**k.

516
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Really?

517
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,400
See, I'm already in New Jersey mode.

518
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,800
We were going to be bleeping a lot when I get back up there.

519
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,320
Linode.com slash coder.

520
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,600
Go there to get $100 in credit for a new account for 60 days and you support the show.

521
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,280
You know, Linode started in 2003, so they've been doing this for longer than I've been

522
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
podcasting.

523
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
That's a really long time.

524
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,240
They've been doing this for like 18 years.

525
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,640
Linode's like old enough to vote now.

526
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,800
They started before AWS and the other enterprisey big old like hyperscaler cloud guys got into

527
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,020
it, you know, with their big fancy offerings.

528
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,040
They were like, they were like late to the game.

529
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,020
Linode was there first and they're independently owned and they're founded on a love for Linux.

530
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,680
And now they're the largest independent cloud provider.

531
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,880
That's pretty awesome.

532
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,280
And one of the things they're doing that I, I think is just so indicative of how they

533
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,800
support the community is they're helping make our Jupiter colony reunion road trip possible.

534
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,120
We're meeting up with Salt Lake city and Denver.

535
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,960
That's that's being powered by Linode, both, both like in the money sense, but also like

536
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,400
in the technology sense, everything we host for Jupiter broadcasting since we've gone

537
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,380
to Indie has been on Linode.

538
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,380
And that's because it's fast.

539
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,660
They have a great dashboard.

540
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,680
They have fantastic 24 seven, amazing customer support.

541
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Really.

542
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,300
I mean, these things all add up.

543
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,000
They have 11 data centers worldwide.

544
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,520
They own the connections between their data centers, Linode, man.

545
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,560
I think I was like, I mean, I don't remember the date exactly, but I think it was like

546
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,500
somewhere in 2017, 2018, they became their own ISP.

547
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,720
That's the advantage of being around for a long time.

548
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,700
And then just continually doubling down on your focus.

549
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,360
So they have these advantages that you kind of don't even really notice until you start

550
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
using it.

551
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,180
And they have super high end systems with like AMD epic processors.

552
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,900
And they also have just like $5 a month rigs that you can get a surprising amount of value

553
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,900
out of.

554
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,600
And you can look at their different options and mix and match some pieces that are upgraded

555
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
later.

556
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,460
And they're always a great deal, like 35, 50% less than some of the major cloud providers

557
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,460
out there.

558
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,540
You know, Linode just runs our backend so well that if I didn't tell you in these spots,

559
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,600
you wouldn't know because it's not like you're getting error pages and things aren't working.

560
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,960
Like everything's humming right along.

561
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,720
And one of the things we do to make our infrastructure scale with our user base is where we can, we

562
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,580
take advantage of Linode's S3 compatible object storage.

563
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,520
That means we kind of grow as our user base needs to.

564
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,900
And we also can use it for things like stashing assets in the cloud and generating public

565
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:06,820
URLs or serving up static websites super fast or offloading images to Linode.

566
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,780
And that makes just things really snappy.

567
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,320
There's so much you could learn, so much you can try.

568
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,700
And there's those one click application deployments, there's lots of those too.

569
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,780
So there's a lot of ways you could use that $100, have some fun, learn something and maybe

570
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,980
deploy something in production and support the show.

571
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,260
It's a great opportunity to do all of that.

572
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:31,660
So go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 60 day credit on your new Linode account

573
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,180
and you support the show.

574
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,020
Thanks to Linode for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

575
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,620
That's linode.com slash coder.

576
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,900
So I thought maybe by this week, all of the hoopla around Copilot would have just simmered

577
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,660
out, but it definitely has not.

578
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,780
And I didn't take this very seriously initially.

579
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,780
Neither did I.

580
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,780
I didn't even really bother trying it.

581
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,780
I just thought, okay.

582
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,780
Yeah.

583
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
I thought it was like a dumb toy.

584
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,980
Honestly, it was one of our little, okay, we need content.

585
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,980
Let's just throw it in.

586
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,980
Yeah.

587
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,980
Let's just talk about it.

588
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,980
It was like, it's weird.

589
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,980
It's new.

590
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,620
Like we weren't taking it very seriously, but it definitely has gotten a whole gamut.

591
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,700
It's gotten a lot of praise.

592
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,740
It's also gotten a lot of fire.

593
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,900
And I mean, I really don't even know what to think of it at this point.

594
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,620
I'm curious where you're at with it.

595
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,660
I sort of feel like this is either one of those things that I'm just going to completely

596
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,060
be wrong about.

597
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,060
I don't get it.

598
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:24,620
Like I get the concept, but everybody that I follow and you know, that follows me or

599
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,940
whatever on Twitter is like all pissed off about this.

600
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:36,260
I don't understand why it's a kind of bad idea that isn't working super well.

601
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,940
And like, there may be some licensing issues.

602
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,940
I don't know.

603
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,940
I'm not an attorney.

604
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:45,060
I personally don't understand how there could be, um, but like, oh, it reproduces stupid

605
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,060
bad code.

606
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,300
Well, yeah, it's just regurgitating code.

607
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,940
It's public available on GitHub.

608
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,120
What idiot would copy pasta code from GitHub or Stack Overflow?

609
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,340
Every developer ever is the right answer to that question, but we all pretend like we

610
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,340
don't.

611
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:02,140
So like, I don't know if, is it, I mean, could it be useful?

612
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:07,100
Maybe I don't honestly, I did not install it.

613
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,260
So this is one of those things like maybe I'm completely missing the boat.

614
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,500
I mean, my judgment's been so good with windows eight and Metro, right?

615
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,660
Well, I went out and I did some reading and I found a really comprehensive risk assessment

616
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,180
that's posted up on GitHub and I'll have it linked in the show notes.

617
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,180
And I really liked it.

618
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,820
You know, they started out talking about how Copilot is a generative model, meaning its

619
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,620
purpose is to generate output that is, that statistically resembles its input.

620
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,900
That's a very important aspect of when you think about how Copilot is going to work.

621
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,760
And so the, in other words, the goal is not exactly to reproduce the input because you

622
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,540
definitely don't really need a machine learning system to do that.

623
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:50,740
This model has a parameter called the temperature, which is a sliding scale between conservatism

624
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,500
and originality.

625
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,900
The higher you go towards originality, the less structured the output becomes.

626
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,940
It will gradually just become gibberish actually.

627
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,940
So GitHub controls the temperature of Copilot and they've presumably just been fine tuning

628
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,940
it based on, you know, the, the trialing that they're doing right now.

629
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,260
But the thing that's interesting about this, I guess I should say is if you prompt Copilot

630
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,220
over and over again with the same input, you won't always get the same result.

631
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,220
That's kind of interesting.

632
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,300
But yeah, I looked at this myself just from like what people are saying, cause I wanted

633
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,300
to figure out the licensing aspect of it and what they're saying, and I kind of see this

634
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:34,100
Mike is, well, it might be used for license washing where because it can regenerate things

635
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,460
almost really, really close to the original code, but with just like slight tweaks, you

636
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,460
could use this to output code that resembles very closely to the original GPL code with

637
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:51,020
just a few of the essentials tweaked, essentially reproducing the original thing very easily,

638
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,660
but under a different license now.

639
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,420
But why wouldn't, if that was your aim, why wouldn't you just like look at the GPL code

640
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,980
and then steal it anyway?

641
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,680
I'm not, and I have never done this, but I'm just saying like, or wouldn't it just be easier

642
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,380
to pay the people for like a private license, the GPL code I've done that.

643
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,420
I think maybe the other problem is that it could sort of slip in there and then somebody

644
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,980
comes along and sues you and says, Hey, that's GPL code.

645
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,980
Okay.

646
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
Well, don't you have to prove intent?

647
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,500
I mean, this is where not attorney is, right?

648
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,620
Can your defense be the computer, the computer typed it for me?

649
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,280
Is that a, well, what if I won't, what if like Coco or Coco touch, let's just say I'm

650
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,520
doing iOS development is ripping off some GPL code.

651
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,440
I know in that case, I'm not the obvious target to Sue, but how would I be liable for utilizing

652
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,800
that code?

653
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,260
It's just a tool I'm using to do my job, which shouldn't that not be me.

654
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,800
So that's where I wonder, because you look at, you look at these lawsuits we've seen

655
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:49,660
where even just like comments have come down to infringement, copying the comments and

656
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,880
I can defeat my own argument actually remember the old, uh, the patent troll that was hitting

657
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,920
all the iOS developers, the, uh, what is it?

658
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,060
Not PI start the, uh, Oh my God, the in app purchase guys.

659
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,060
This is from years ago.

660
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,060
Yeah.

661
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,060
Yeah.

662
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,060
Yeah.

663
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,060
So they were going after because Apple was allegedly infringing, but they were suing

664
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,480
the individual app developers.

665
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,840
So I guess you could, but I don't know.

666
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,520
It's it depends on how you look at it, right?

667
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,480
If you want this thing to large to write large portions of code, I think that's a real dumb

668
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,960
idea, but I could kind of see it working if you treat it sort of like the Gmail auto completion

669
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,680
when you're writing an email and it sort of suggests like the completion to the sentence.

670
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,680
It's like, it's like in cell, it's like a better version of IntelliSense if you think

671
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,280
of it that way, but I think the problem gets more complicated.

672
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,220
If it starts completing larger and larger blocks of code, you as a developer, it's your

673
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,480
responsibility to go back and check that and make sure it's legit and it just creates more

674
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,480
work.

675
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
Well, it should be against what?

676
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,800
Against the known universe of GPL code or you mean just that like works?

677
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Yeah.

678
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,640
That's just that it seems sane because it doesn't always actually produce sane code.

679
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,440
Well, this is why I kind of, so I think when, when we first saw a copilot come out a couple

680
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,360
of weeks, so you and I sort of put it in there because we put it in there or whatever, but

681
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,680
like, I don't think, I mean, maybe I shouldn't speak for you.

682
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,440
I didn't take it super seriously.

683
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
No.

684
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Yeah, I agree.

685
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,440
I kind of still don't.

686
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
Yeah.

687
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,960
I think maybe we got it right because I watched several videos and I read a lot of people

688
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,440
that wrote like their opinions about their usage of it and it seems some people have

689
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
a pretty good experience.

690
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,840
Some people have it producing really trivially bad code, obviously bad code just by looking

691
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,800
at it.

692
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:27,440
So I mean, then that means it's not a, that means maybe it has, let's just say an 80%

693
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
accuracy rate.

694
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,720
Maybe even 90% that still leaves doubt and it still means the human has to go back and

695
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,040
check the work.

696
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,720
That's why I think in smaller pieces and smaller little bits, sort of like an email autocomplete

697
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
like Gmail does.

698
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Okay.

699
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
I could see it.

700
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,920
But if it's more like, you know, larger than that, anything larger than that, really, I

701
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,600
think it becomes more of a nuisance than it is a value.

702
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
We'll see.

703
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
I suppose it just gets better over time.

704
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Yeah.

705
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
I'm sorry.

706
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
I just, I'm sorry.

707
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,520
The hard part of like the job of being a developer is not writing the actual code, right?

708
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
That's like a miss.

709
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,400
Like all those stupid movies or like the, you know, NCIS or CSI or whatever those dumb

710
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,720
cop shows are where the guy's like pounding away at 4,000 words a minute on a keyboard

711
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
that shatters, right?

712
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,120
Most of the time I'm working on graph paper because yes, I'm old and please don't send

713
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,640
me the tool that you think will replace my graph paper.

714
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
I've tried.

715
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,960
I'm currently trying to write one.

716
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,160
It's harder than you think because graph paper is amazing.

717
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Get a hobby.

718
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
I have a hobby.

719
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,280
My hobby is writing iPad apps that I never ship.

720
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,440
I like it when you argue with yourself.

721
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,560
Is it a great, like Pat, I hate past Mike.

722
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Yeah.

723
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,120
The arrogant prick that he was.

724
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
Yeah.

725
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
I mean he likes Sousa after all.

726
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,840
Oh, Sousa is great.

727
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,920
It's Sousa by the way, just so you, oh, our sponsor Linode will gladly give you an open

728
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Sousa server.

729
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
That's true.

730
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
So just, you know.

731
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Sousa.

732
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
It's what you want.

733
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Yeah, I'll stand by that one.

734
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Good job, past Mike.

735
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,480
No, it's just not that hard.

736
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,120
Like the writing, the code isn't hard.

737
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,520
It's figuring, like figuring out, I don't know, like should these models be coupled

738
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,760
together as a join in the database?

739
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
Maybe not.

740
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Maybe locations and doors are different.

741
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Right?

742
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,880
Like maybe, I don't know, maybe like what we call a car or a vehicle needs to be called

743
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
a truck.

744
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
What is a truck?

745
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
What constitutes an SUV?

746
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,960
Maybe we're working for an auto dealer is do we care about fighter jets versus bombers?

747
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,520
Is this the client going to come back and say, Hey man, awesome windows app.

748
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Can I get it on my iPad?

749
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,520
Right?

750
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,040
Like there's a million things that can go wrong and none of them are, I can't write

751
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,280
a for loop fast enough.

752
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,640
So I don't know.

753
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
Yes.

754
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Yes.

755
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
Yeah.

756
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
I completely agree.

757
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,000
I guess this is one of those things I feel like we should at least keep our eye on in

758
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
case.

759
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh, absolutely.

760
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,680
Just to see where it goes.

761
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,500
Just maybe, maybe it gets better.

762
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,780
I could see them improving it over time as more and more users start using it.

763
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,760
I'm curious if like the EFF or somebody is going to sue them.

764
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,200
That's see, that's where I think this is going to go.

765
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,040
I suppose if you could, if you could demonstrate that somebody was reproducing GPL code essentially

766
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,080
and then licensing it as something else like MIT, maybe it's not GPL, but they, or I don't

767
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,360
think it's GPL, but they did reproduce the doom source code verbatim, right?

768
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,680
In comments at all.

769
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,440
Our friends over to Cloud Guru have a lot of, a lot of options for you to check out,

770
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,880
but this week I want to mention their Ansible best practices.

771
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,120
Now this is part of a Red Hat certified specialist program, and it's going to teach you everything

772
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:35,520
you know about Ansible and Ansible Tower, and as well as get you ready for an exam on

773
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
the topic.

774
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,800
So go over to our show notes at coder.show slash 422.

775
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,520
You'll see the ACG link in there and that'll take you directly to this course.

776
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,060
If you're planning on expanding your Ansible knowledge, you probably ought to check this

777
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,600
particular course out and all the other great courses over to Cloud Guru will have a link

778
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:59,020
for this one in particular at coder.show slash 422.

779
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:04,040
So speaking of Visual Studio code, how has the Live Share experience been going for you?

780
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,000
I know you were, I think you mentioned you were just starting to use that a bit and wondering

781
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
if you have any updates.

782
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yep.

783
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,200
We've been using it for about a month and it has been fabulous.

784
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,480
For those who don't know Live Share, how do we call this like a super, it's not really

785
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
a screen share.

786
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,480
It's like a...

787
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,640
And it's not, it's kind of like Google Docs but inside VS Code.

788
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
That's exactly right.

789
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,060
Google Docs.

790
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,920
But the key is, so I can give you a perfect case.

791
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,880
We had two guys, I was not one of the guys in this case, but one on Mac and one on Linux

792
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:38,560
and the Linux guy had the tool chain set up to actually build the code, the Mac guy didn't.

793
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,200
He was just coming into rubber ducky, second set of eyes.

794
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,960
He could hit F5, which is the shortcut in VS Code to build, and it built off of the

795
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,960
other guy's machine using his dependent, he didn't have to install all the dependencies.

796
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,560
But the code in his editor, it's Python, so the formatting's, it's the same.

797
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:05,080
But his key bindings, his color scheme, everything the way he wants in his VS Code, but the dependency

798
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,360
chain was from the other guy's machine.

799
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
That's awesome.

800
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:14,240
And they were live editing like Trista's Google Docs style, the code, running through it.

801
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,320
It makes me wonder if we could use it for show prep.

802
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,320
That's so nice.

803
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,920
And so it seems like it, it seems like it's, I mean, for that kind of collaboration, it's

804
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,400
gotta be pretty quick, pretty accurate.

805
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,240
Well pretty quick, and it has voice calling.

806
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,440
So you're talking to the person on the same connection.

807
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Really?

808
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Yeah, that's what it was.

809
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
What?

810
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,440
No way.

811
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
Really?

812
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,440
That's pretty neat.

813
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
I've done a few myself.

814
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,440
It's like, okay, what file are you in?

815
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Wow.

816
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,760
I'm going through, I'm going through the page that we'll have link.

817
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Oh yeah.

818
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Look at that.

819
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,880
This is, this is, oh man, they're unstoppable.

820
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,840
You know how, you know how I've been going on about, about Apple, well geez, well Microsoft

821
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,960
is just crushing this area right now.

822
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,080
It really, and then you consider the whole GitHub angle of all of this.

823
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,880
This is some powerful, powerful stuff.

824
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:06,240
And then, and how long, how long have we been waiting for local applications?

825
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,720
Well call it native, even though it's an Electron app, native applications with this kind of

826
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,360
functionality where you could break out of your web browser and you didn't like, you

827
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,200
didn't have to be in a web app to get real time collab like that.

828
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,760
And we should, we should add an important point here.

829
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,440
You mentioned a Electron.

830
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,800
So this also crosses the streams between a VS proper on windows and VS code.

831
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
So what do you mean?

832
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,180
So you can cross the sessions.

833
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,920
So I can be on VS code on my Mac and someone can be on a windows 10 running visual studio

834
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,680
19 and that's fine.

835
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,760
Oh, okay.

836
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
That's nice too.

837
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Huh?

838
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,100
Look at them.

839
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,680
They're just knocking down walls and barriers.

840
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,120
I'm going to have to give live share a try.

841
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,120
We'll have a link in the show notes and you know, anything we talk about in the show,

842
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,640
we always love to get your guys' feedback.

843
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,080
So when you go over to the website, you'll have the contact link there too.

844
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,680
Shout out to our Coder QA members out there who helped make this show possible.

845
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,920
You're going to get a new Coderly soon that's coming up.

846
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,480
And if you haven't joined our membership program over at Coder QA.co, you could join now and

847
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,760
get access to all the previous Coderlys and then you'll get the upcoming one.

848
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,720
We do one a quarter and I've already got a couple of topics set aside.

849
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,680
I haven't, I haven't shared what they are yet.

850
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,680
And so we'll, Mike and I will sync up before we record, but I got a couple ideas, but also

851
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,840
you get access to our limited ad feed as a member.

852
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,100
It's a new RSS feed that we generate just for you.

853
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:26,280
It's a bespoke feed and it's a, it's still the full production from Dr. Drew, just a

854
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
limited ads.

855
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,040
So you get all of that as a thank you over at Coder QA.co and thanks to our members.

856
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,640
I just have one last thing I just wanted to touch on in the show before we leave because

857
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,000
both you and I had been watching this drama play out and the Pentagon has officially killed

858
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,720
this $10 billion Jedi cloud contract.

859
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,580
And I feel like this is actually probably the biggest tech story of the last few years

860
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,840
that nobody's talking about.

861
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,480
I mean, it was weird how they got the contracts.

862
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Yeah.

863
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,000
It's weird how it got killed.

864
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,480
I don't get, and I don't think the story's done.

865
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,000
I think we're going back to court.

866
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,640
Amazon was so all in.

867
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,800
So when they thought they had this thing, I think it was before Trump came into office

868
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,640
and Amazon was so all in, they built a second headquarters out in that area to just kind

869
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,040
of make them closer to the, to the heart of the operation.

870
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,160
And then Trump and Bezos had a, some sort of feud, I think because of the Washington,

871
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
I don't know.

872
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,640
The Washington post, right?

873
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,640
Post.

874
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Yeah.

875
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
Yeah.

876
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,440
Anyways, so the contract ends up getting canceled maybe for better or for worse.

877
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,400
I mean, I've never been very happy with the idea that these private companies have these

878
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,440
$10 billion contracts with the defense industry.

879
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,440
It just felt whatever.

880
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,040
But I mean, I can think of one that would love a $10 billion contract.

881
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,040
Yeah.

882
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
No kidding.

883
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,040
Right?

884
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,760
If they need a podcast contract, let me know.

885
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,120
So then Microsoft ends up getting the deal.

886
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,520
Microsoft starts building up and staffing up for it.

887
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
You know?

888
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,520
I mean, can you imagine a 10 bill, even for a company like Microsoft, $10 billion deal,

889
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,620
you're staffing up, you're building out office space for that deal.

890
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,760
This is going to be like an aspect of your business for years.

891
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,240
And then the Pentagon calls up just a couple of weeks ago and says, we're actually going

892
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,960
to exercise that cancellation clause that we had etched in there at the last minute.

893
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,260
We're out.

894
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,700
And then it turns out in the background, there has basically been a Bezos led lawsuit and

895
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,340
legal challenge against this entire thing.

896
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,920
Basically putting it all on Trump and saying, you know, it's because he doesn't like me

897
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,560
that this whole thing got canceled.

898
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,640
And it seems like that thing is proceeding and it's created this wedge and the Pentagon

899
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,180
use that opportunity to cancel this whole damn thing.

900
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,320
And the reason why I think it's noteworthy is because whichever cloud provider ends up

901
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:41,640
with this, and now maybe several of them, is essentially going to get an indefinite

902
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,360
paycheck from the federal government.

903
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:49,080
Like that cloud provider is set for life because it's not like they're going to build out infrastructure

904
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,640
and then canceled a few years later.

905
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,720
So it's one of those things where I think they desperately want it because it's it's

906
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,820
a 10 billion dollar paycheck that's just going to keep paying out indefinitely.

907
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,160
It's a huge story.

908
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,840
The tech CEOs have gotten really powerful, too.

909
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:12,560
You know, Tim Cook, Colin, Nancy Bezos maneuvering this, you know, Pichai Pichai was working

910
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,960
with the White House on that acquisition of TikTok.

911
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,840
Like that was so weird, though, that they were just going to hand them and the White

912
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:25,640
House is just going to hand Microsoft an acquisition and like the tech CEOs are they're like the

913
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,760
big oil executives now only to have these cool guy personas.

914
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
Most of them.

915
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
Well, maybe.

916
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
Maybe not.

917
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,760
Yeah.

918
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,120
I mean, this is a bigger, bigger conversation for a different day.

919
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:40,720
I mean, something has definitely changed in just our industry, right?

920
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,920
I mean, it's interesting to see the oil companies.

921
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,560
I think of it as the railroads.

922
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,560
Right.

923
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,560
That's better.

924
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,560
That's a better analogy.

925
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,560
Right.

926
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,560
I mean, you're at a great rate.

927
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,320
You're taxed effectively to the big tech companies, if you're at all in the technology space.

928
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,880
And even if you're not right, even if you're in a different business, you're kicking up

929
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
to somebody.

930
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
Fair point.

931
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,040
Well, good luck on phase one of the moving.

932
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,800
I'm the only person moving to New Jersey.

933
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,840
This should be interesting.

934
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,460
Is there anything you want to mention before we get out of here?

935
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,660
If you need Python development done and or especially Objective C development, reach

936
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,320
on Twitter at Domenico.

937
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
Absolutely.

938
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,440
You can find the whole podcast over there, too, and the and the network.

939
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
All of it.

940
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,880
The podcast that's at Coder Radio Show, the network that's at Jupiter Signal.

941
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,560
I'm there, too, at Chris L.A.S.
