00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
This is KOTORadio, episode 442 for November 26.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,920
Hello friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,840
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,880
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru, with a cloud guru you get that cloud

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,820
playground, Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,600
My name is Chris, and joining me stuffed full of turkey is our host, Mr. Dominic.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Hello Mike.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
Oh, trip to fan.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Isn't it something?

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,600
It really is great.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,560
I mean, my favorite thing is if I do get a great post-meal nap, but as we record right

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,680
now, I actually, I have not had my Thanksgiving meal yet.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,680
We're recording on a Friday, after Thanksgiving, a little early for us, and what I have done

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,360
so far, and I'm curious if you've ever done this, is I just completed last night the test

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
turkey.

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Do you ever do these test turkeys?

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,800
No, what the hell is a test turkey?

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,040
I know you're not a big testing guy, you know, but think of...

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,560
Listen, I'm on a good clean show, no rabbit punches, no shots below the belt.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Come on.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
All right.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
Especially so at the top, right?

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,320
So I deployed my family as QA members, and we test out the same size turkey, the brine,

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,360
and the cooking method that we're going to use that year, because unlike a sane person,

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,080
I kind of change it up every year.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,300
Last year, I smoked the turkeys.

30
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,600
This year, I want to oven roast them, but I don't want dry breast meat.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,680
So I wanted to get the full workflow worked out and tested before production day when

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,980
family's around.

33
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,360
So last night, we cooked up the turkey and deployed it to the children, and I collected

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,780
their feedback and got their input, and I am actually going to make a few adjustments

35
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,720
before the actual production turkey is deployed.

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,020
Not only is it like reduces my anxiety about turkey day, but I never end up having enough

37
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,040
turkey meat as it is, because for some reason, like the chef, you know, I never get to eat

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,400
enough, and then everybody takes some home, right?

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,840
So this way, I get enough turkey to make sandwiches.

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,320
I also like that you have a turkey deployment system here.

41
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,400
Oh, it's all we got it.

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,200
You got to even monitor the timing of it, too, because I got to make sure that I repeat

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
the brine window.

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,020
I don't want to like over brine it or under brine it on production day.

45
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,460
That's a big deal, right?

46
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,320
And I'm also going to match the resting time.

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,900
So I've kind of come up with a post oven resting strategy where the turkey will rest.

48
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,040
Then I will actually kind of bring up the dependencies of the meal, like, you know,

49
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,200
your green bean casserole and warm up the stuffing, get all of the meal dependencies

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,000
figured out and ready to go, and then deploy everything at once.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, my God.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's my strategy.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,080
You got to take this stuff seriously, man.

54
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,720
So it's like a turkey continuous integration system there.

55
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
Yeah, it definitely is.

56
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
Yeah.

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,080
Well, once about 2 p.m. hits, yeah.

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,640
This is actually the first year in a long time I did not deep fry the turkey.

59
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,720
And it's also, on a perhaps related note, the first year I haven't gotten burned.

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,920
So I think I like roasting it.

61
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,720
I think this was much less painful.

62
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
It was a lot easier than smoking, too.

63
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,120
You're hardcore with the smoking.

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Yeah.

65
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,800
This year, a montage went around of everybody's turkey fryers catching on fire.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,960
And I thought, oh, let's go easy this year.

67
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Let's go easy.

68
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
It's very good.

69
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,880
I didn't try to fry it because I found out that the turkey was still par frozen in the

70
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
middle.

71
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,560
And had I put that in a vat of oil, it would have exploded for sure.

72
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,320
Those two things do not like each other.

73
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Water and oil.

74
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
All right.

75
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Well, so we have a batch.

76
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,960
We have a batch of productivity tips.

77
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,160
So you're welcome, everybody.

78
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,800
By the time you're done listening to this episode, you're probably going to work faster,

79
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,680
make money faster, and probably owe it all to us.

80
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,580
So you are welcome.

81
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,160
Your deal for this show on Black Friday is you get a bunch of great tips.

82
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,700
And Jose wrote in essentially saying, for the love of God, use a clipboard manager.

83
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,080
You got to use a clipboard manager.

84
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,600
There's a bunch of options out there for Windows.

85
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,160
I use Ditto.

86
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,480
And for Mac OS, I recently started using Maccy, M-A-C-C-Y.

87
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,200
Ditto for Windows looks really nice because the Windows clipboard is obviously very basic.

88
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,040
But you add this little gem on there, you're pretty much rocking a power clipboard.

89
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,720
And this is something that I think us Plasma desktop users often take for granted.

90
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,320
This comes built into the Plasma desktop, and it's a nice one, too.

91
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,960
And I feel very limited when I'm on other desktop environments that don't have a clipboard

92
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
manager.

93
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,360
So it's just a real simple one right off the top.

94
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,240
I also will admit that the clipboard manager, when I don't have one, is the thing that I

95
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,620
tend to install after I've already needed it.

96
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,960
When I've been in a situation where I'm like, ah, if I just had a clipboard manager, I would

97
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
have that.

98
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,480
And then I'm like, all right, I should go get one.

99
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,320
And that's usually the point in which I install one on a Mac or if I'm, God forbid, on Windows.

100
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,040
I have not gotten on the clipboard manager thing.

101
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,820
Although I use, in Slack, you have that stupid account that's like your name.

102
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,820
It's like you.

103
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,820
Sure.

104
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,880
I use that as a ghetto version.

105
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,020
But I'm looking at this Maccy app.

106
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,760
This seems like just a much better way to do this.

107
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,480
Yeah, it's one of those things that as the more you use it, the more you realize how

108
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
handy it is.

109
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,000
Often you're like copying several things in order and you'd like to go back and get something

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,280
or have a place to temporarily store something.

111
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Yeah, absolutely.

112
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,560
Well, and you're writing code.

113
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
It's all from Stack Overflow.

114
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
So, right.

115
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Of course.

116
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Yeah.

117
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Yeah.

118
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,080
You want to be able to go back a few Stack Overflows.

119
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,360
Listener Michael says, I use an Elgato Stream Deck for development, not for streaming.

120
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,840
So I recently got a Elgato Steam Deck and I also got it to work using the Steam Deck

121
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,520
UI, which we'll have a link to that.

122
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,760
He says it's great.

123
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,240
I have buttons that launch programs.

124
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,640
So I've dedicated buttons for programs and I've automated rather large test environment

125
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,920
using a button and I fire one button off and half a dozen processes start up.

126
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,120
It's everything I need to simulate the system I'm working on.

127
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, I could probably have made some sort of keyboard shortcut system in Gnome or something

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,280
else, but I just prefer having dedicated buttons on my desk for these things.

129
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,240
It saves me so much time and effort.

130
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,000
Plus, if I ever do need to use OBS, it's great for that.

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,440
The Elgato Stream Deck, I don't know if you've seen this, but it's this little box.

132
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,240
It has like these little OLED screens on there and you assign each one of them a function

133
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
on your machine.

134
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,160
Now apparently it's working in Linux too.

135
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,180
Thanks to some of the work of some friends of ours on the Mac and Windows, you could

136
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,360
just use the Elgato software.

137
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,360
I would be, I guess the term is remiss if I didn't mention how much Elgato has come

138
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,960
up recently for different things.

139
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,800
Elgato really seems to be getting a name out there for making pretty good products out

140
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
there.

141
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,600
So I would imagine the Stream Deck is probably one of those, not to be confused with the

142
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Steam Deck.

143
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,360
Stream Deck, Steam Deck, two different things.

144
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,200
One's a keyboard, one's a game console.

145
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,720
Gab found a really useful bumper-like app for Linux.

146
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,960
I've talked about it on Linux Unplugged before, it's called Junction.

147
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,760
Bumper is the app that lets you choose which browser a link opens up in.

148
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,800
Junction goes even further because it includes things like your default file manager, your

149
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,840
default terminal, your web browser, all that kind of stuff.

150
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,020
You can really take it to the next level as you'd expect with a Linux app.

151
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,340
And so that is called Junction and it's on Flat Hub.

152
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,080
Just go search for Junction.

153
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,820
These are like little tools over the years that I've kind of just started to let myself

154
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,820
use.

155
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,180
I used to be a big, it's only the defaults and then deviate from there kind of guy.

156
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,740
But in order to use GNOME or Mac OS or Windows, I've just sort of resigned myself to implementing

157
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,740
a bunch of these kinds of tools.

158
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,040
You can't use a Mac anymore, a new Mac with the notch.

159
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,320
You can't use a new Mac without Bartender.

160
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,360
If you do, I'm sorry, but you're just not going to see some of your icons.

161
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,980
So there's little tools like this now or iStat menu.

162
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,400
How the hell do you know what's going on on the Mac if you don't have iStat menu?

163
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
You're going to launch activity?

164
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,560
You don't because activity monitor is pretty much terrible.

165
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,820
Yeah, it's awful.

166
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,180
There's these kinds of things.

167
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,560
Another one, like on the Mac, when you click on the calendar, you don't get a calendar.

168
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,000
When you click on the clock, I mean in the menu bar, you don't get a calendar anymore.

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,860
You get some stupid sidebar loaded with junk from the phone.

170
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,860
It's nonsense.

171
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,660
And so I've got a stupid little app in my menu bar that I can click and it gives me

172
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,280
a stupid calendar.

173
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,780
Stuff like this that's just built into Plasma or most of the stuff built into GNOME or Windows

174
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,780
even.

175
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,020
So I've started resigning myself to using some of these apps.

176
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:24,480
So I'm using Junction and Bumper now and Bartender and extensions up the wazoo on my GNOME desktop.

177
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
It's not a good life.

178
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
It's not.

179
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,040
It's bad over here.

180
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,320
You're getting a nickeled and dimed for every little app.

181
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,480
You got to load half a dozen extensions before your work environment's even useful anymore.

182
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,920
They break with every major upgrade.

183
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,980
It's not a good life.

184
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,200
You know, I can't get around it, but maybe I could feel a little better because Danny

185
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:50,040
wrote in and mentions that he's made a brown Ubuntu style theme for Soos Plasma desktop.

186
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Yeah.

187
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,080
There you go.

188
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,800
So if you want your personal color scheme to be as brown as hell on Plasma, we'll have

189
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,740
a link in the show notes made by listener Danny.

190
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,040
If you've ever wondered what brown can do for you.

191
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
That's right.

192
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,440
Vold wrote in with a couple of Python related productivity tips.

193
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,860
He says, I've heard you guys mention Poetry for Python.

194
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,920
Definitely worth checking out.

195
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,560
It gives you a smooth development workflow like building the project, running commands

196
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,760
in a managed virtual environment, publishing packages on an index server is easy.

197
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
It's got lock file.

198
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
He says there's a lot of value in it.

199
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,760
He also says that the tool talks works particularly well.

200
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,800
And then get this brace yourself.

201
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:37,760
We had not one but two people write in and say they use Nix OS and Nix OS as the VM inside

202
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,040
Mac OS as a host for development.

203
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,760
So they're using the tools in Mac OS to like build stuff and edit stuff in the Nix OS virtual

204
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
machine.

205
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,040
Nix OS is a distribution built on top of the next package manager.

206
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,480
And the big thing that it's known for is it uses a declarative configuration system.

207
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,580
You essentially go in there and you declare everything and then build it.

208
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,720
If you're looking for a reproducible environment, that kind of stuff, it's great.

209
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,520
He says each project that he has, has its own development environment with its own Python

210
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
version.

211
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,220
And he ends up saving a lot of time because he doesn't have to worry about broken states

212
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,760
between projects after doing a brew update or something like that.

213
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,000
And he says, last but not least, Emacs org mode for note taking introduce Emacs lifestyle.

214
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There you go.

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
There's a plug in there.

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You knew it was coming, right?

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,400
You knew Emacs was going to show up.

218
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,680
I'd have been disappointed if it didn't, you know, because, you know, you're going to get

219
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
VS code.

220
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
You know, you're going to get that.

221
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
So you got to get the.

222
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
You got to get the OG.

223
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
Mm hmm.

224
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Mm hmm.

225
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
Mm hmm.

226
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,080
We also have a link in here to the advanced Visual Studio code for Python developers handbook.

227
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,120
This is a massive resource and I cannot remember if we've talked about it on the show before,

228
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,760
but it was sent in recently.

229
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,280
I know you've seen this.

230
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
It's a gold mine.

231
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,680
I use a bunch of, well, I use a few of them.

232
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,400
A lot of it's to taste, but these are basically productivity tips and how to kind of configure

233
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,000
VS code to be the ultimate Python IDE.

234
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,840
Take what you want and don't use what you don't, right?

235
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
That's what's nice about it.

236
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
All right.

237
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,400
We got an email from Nick and Nick points out that, look, if you got RSI problems, you

238
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
got productivity problems.

239
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,980
You're not getting any work done.

240
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,980
And that is definitely true.

241
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,000
And he says, what I discovered, which really changed my RSI problem for me, I got a tip

242
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,600
from a friend in the VFX industry.

243
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,880
And it so far has eliminated my pain.

244
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,540
He says, I've switched to using a Wacom drawing tablet instead of a mouse.

245
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,000
So he's blasting around his machine using a tablet and a mouse, you know, the Wacoms

246
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,880
as a result to use it properly.

247
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,280
He sort of also had to hold himself differently, you know, assume better posture, he says,

248
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,440
and sort of stopped slouching because when you slouch, you can't really use the stylus

249
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
very well.

250
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,480
And he says, I don't know if everybody will benefit from this like I did, but these tablets

251
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,840
have gotten pretty cheap now.

252
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,400
They have good Linux support.

253
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,760
And if you have RSI issues, you should give it a go.

254
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,200
It made a big difference for Nick.

255
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Something to try out there.

256
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Who would have thunk?

257
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,720
Who would have thunk?

258
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,640
I've definitely seen editors using these tablets before.

259
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,760
I never thought about using them just to mouse around the UI.

260
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,320
I also find for RSI, just switching up the type of input device.

261
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,400
So I have a vertical Logitech mouse, which is great for RSI.

262
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,520
And that works by you move your entire arm instead of just your wrist.

263
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,080
So that's something to go check out.

264
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,680
And then when I get tired of that, I switch to using a trackpad.

265
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,760
And then when that wanes, I switch back to the mouse.

266
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,460
And I also just kind of move around between a lot of different systems.

267
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,800
And that helps, I think, too, just it's not the same ergonomics and sitting the same spot

268
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
every single time.

269
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,600
I think that helps too.

270
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,640
As a result of my RSI issues over the years, I have gotten a lot more serious about my

271
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,200
keyboards, and I've started buying nicer keyboards.

272
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,540
And I stopped using like the butterfly keyboard.

273
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,160
And I've been using like the System76 launch keyboard, or I'll get a keyboard that's specifically

274
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
built for ergonomics.

275
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,680
We talked a bit about this when the show first came back, because we really kind of went

276
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,040
deep into keyboards for a bit.

277
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,960
And I ended up with like a split ergonomic keyboard.

278
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,020
I can't remember the name right now.

279
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,280
But Microsoft also makes a pretty decent nice split one.

280
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,180
And I have found those work pretty well for me.

281
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,840
And if it's not a split keyboard, something that's mechanical, that has some actual travel,

282
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,720
because I'm an old man, and I grew up in the 80s, where you actually typed on these large

283
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,720
IBM keyboards, these things that were like skateboards, and you really typed on those

284
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
things.

285
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,160
And that's how I learned how to type.

286
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,960
And so I bottom out really bad on things like the butterfly.

287
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,200
And so something like the launch keyboard, or my keyboards upstairs, or my keyboards

288
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,680
at home, they have a lot more travel, or they're ergonomically built so that they're a lot

289
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,900
better for me.

290
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,680
And I found that helps too, but I could definitely see taking it up to the next notch with a

291
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
tablet.

292
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,240
Have you made any tweaks to how you sit, or how you work, or any gear you use for RSI

293
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
issues?

294
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Not in a long time.

295
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,520
I mean, I use the launch keyboard.

296
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,120
I'm pretty much the same here, mechanical keyboards.

297
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,520
The biggest change I made was a couple of years ago when I went all in on standing desk.

298
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,720
So other than when I'm doing the show, I'm usually standing.

299
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,800
And the only reason I don't stand for the show is I tend to list a little bit while

300
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I'm talking.

301
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,760
So I'm such a lazy, out of weight slob that I have to sit down after I've been standing

302
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,800
for a while, because I start moving around, and then I run out of breath.

303
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,120
Like I can't help but pace a little bit and stuff, and it's good for the energy level.

304
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,080
But when I'm speaking into a mic, it's just enough that I'm breathing a little heavy.

305
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,640
Because again, I've got to go for more walks, which is something I work on.

306
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,600
But it seems like it's never enough.

307
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,880
Never enough.

308
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,120
System76.com.

309
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,880
Do you hear those bells are ringing?

310
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,960
It is our friends over at System76, and they are clearly in the holiday spirit with their

311
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:45,760
special power up holiday sale up to three hundred and twenty dollars off select systems.

312
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,240
This is what I wait for every single year.

313
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,000
I never fear this year.

314
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,680
They're including a sweet power up fanny pack, too, so you can, you know, you can really

315
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,680
rock it.

316
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,160
And they've got a nice little System76 power up logo on there.

317
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,360
It's a unique piece of swag.

318
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Also kind of great.

319
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,560
You know, that laptop that Mike just got, the Pangolin, guess what?

320
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
It's on sale right now.

321
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,000
You can get it for one hundred dollars off.

322
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,040
So that should really put a little salt in Mike's wound right there.

323
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,520
As for the Lema Pro, yeah, it's on sale.

324
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,640
The Darter Pro, my favorite rig, the Oryx Pro and the Gazelle.

325
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
I love the Gazelle.

326
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,840
That's also on sale.

327
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,200
And the one that's escaped me, but I've always wanted to try because I think it'd be so great

328
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,480
in the studio set up or in the RV set up or for a home server, the Meerkat, that tiny

329
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,400
little itty bitty Linux computer is on sale, too.

330
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,080
Also great to see the launch keyboard is back.

331
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,840
Ship dates are in December.

332
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
What a gift that would be.

333
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,080
Honestly, if somebody gave me a launch keyboard for the holidays, I would probably consider

334
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,520
that to be near a marriage proposal.

335
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,160
I'd rather have that than an engagement ring.

336
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,400
I'm just saying, ladies, it's back in stock.

337
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,480
It's truly my favorite keyboard.

338
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,600
In fact, I have it right here in front of me right now.

339
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:58,280
I'll type I love the System76 launch keyboard.

340
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Keyboard.

341
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
Keyboard.

342
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Keyboard.

343
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
There we go.

344
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
See, I got to move that key right there.

345
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
But that's the thing you can.

346
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
You can move these keys around.

347
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
It sounds great.

348
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,080
These are actually the little slightly quieter ones.

349
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,520
Of course, I have it right up against the microphone here.

350
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,880
I say go for the quieter ones if you're in office space and if you're in your own place

351
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,520
and you don't care, go for the louder ones because they have a fantastic feel.

352
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,360
I got a chance to put my hands on both of them.

353
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,400
The launch is back.

354
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
It's available right now.

355
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,720
Could be a great chance to get that.

356
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,160
But head over to System76.com if you've been on the fence, if you've been thinking maybe

357
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,560
now is the time to get a piece of hardware but you're looking for a deal, well, this

358
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,040
is it.

359
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,660
This is the sale of the year.

360
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,160
You can get it from System76.com.

361
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,680
They're building computers in Denver, Colorado, born to run Linux and they have their Power

362
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,060
Up Holiday sale going on right now.

363
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,120
Just go to System76.com and if you pick something up in the notes, tell them Coder Radio sent

364
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
you.

365
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Let them know.

366
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
You heard about it here on the show.

367
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
The guy sent you.

368
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Do me a favor there.

369
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
System76.com.

370
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,780
The Power Up Holiday sale is on now.

371
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,560
Go get a computer born to run Linux, a keyboard, or maybe some sweet swag.

372
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
System76.com.

373
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Mr. Dominic went to Pallet Town and practiced some sequel alchemy.

374
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,280
Boy, that sounds like the start to a really good kid's novel, but that's not actually

375
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
what it is.

376
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
No, no, no.

377
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,880
So I did one of my beginner posts again.

378
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,280
I always call them Pallet Town because I'm a big nerd and you know the old Pokemon games.

379
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Okay.

380
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,880
So I've been writing these posts and talking about Python a lot and the thing that people

381
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,960
have been kind of asking about is SQL alchemy, which is, if you don't know, it's the ORM

382
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,560
that most Python uses, right?

383
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:37,180
So if you're doing like Django or fast API, you're probably using SQL alchemy.

384
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,280
So yeah, this is just a couple quick tips on dealing with common performance issues.

385
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,480
I give you a little bit of setup.

386
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,740
I don't go through the trouble of setting up the entire project because I just don't

387
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,880
think it's necessary, but a couple of things, right?

388
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,600
So we won't go into too much detail because if you're not a Python developer, you're not

389
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,480
going to care, but Python has hybrid properties, which are basically other languages might

390
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,680
call them computed properties.

391
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,940
You know, it returns a value based on arbitrary Python function.

392
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,680
The very, very dumb example of this you could do is like full name would be like self dot

393
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,460
first name plus space self dot last name.

394
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,480
It's actually a lot more helpful than that, of course, because you don't want to create

395
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,820
unnecessary database columns and have to track everything here and there, especially if the

396
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,220
value you want is dependent on other values on the table.

397
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,220
Good stuff.

398
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,960
You can read about all about that there.

399
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Deferred columns.

400
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Exactly what it sounds like.

401
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
You load a model.

402
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,440
You don't want to load the entire model, usually, especially if you have, let's say, a profile

403
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
image or something.

404
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,280
In my Pokemon example, I give the Pokemon's image.

405
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,920
You do a deferred column and it won't immediately load the image.

406
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,440
In my case, it doesn't have to be an image, right?

407
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,320
There are some caveats to that, but in the most simple cases that you'll probably be

408
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,400
getting, it's going to be one of the better ways to go for large data objects.

409
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,560
The opposite of that is load only, where you specifically tell SQLAlchemy which columns

410
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,840
you want to load off a table, ignoring the others.

411
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,680
Pretty basic if you've ever dealt with an ORM before, but I was surprised to hear how

412
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
many people found it.

413
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,200
I think it's maybe the syntax, especially coming from something like Active Record,

414
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,080
but how many folks were having trouble understanding kind of the fundamentals of SQLAlchemy.

415
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,360
The next one I'm going to do is relationships in Python.

416
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,520
Not like, hey, do you want to go out tonight relationships, but, you know, has one belongs

417
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,160
to kind of thing.

418
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,320
So yeah, if you want to keep reading along, that's fine.

419
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,560
I'm doing these SQLAlchemy posts and probably going to dip a bit into fast API, but I'd

420
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,160
say we probably have like one a month coming, maybe a little more frequently, depending

421
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,680
on how busy I am.

422
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,640
And we have a link to that in the show notes.

423
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,080
You can go follow along with the series.

424
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,160
I mean, you know, some of this is simple stuff, but some of it actually results in pretty

425
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,240
decent performance gains because, you know, you're not doing a bunch of unnecessary database

426
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
queries and things like that.

427
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,720
I guess they're actually good little tips.

428
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,440
Yeah, I would say it's stuff that's simple once you know it, but then if you actually

429
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,800
don't know it, I mean, I'm sure people can write in horror stories about how when they

430
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,000
were super junior, they didn't understand why their query took forever, right?

431
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Isn't that the thing?

432
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,440
It's like you just don't know what you don't know.

433
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,680
And it's a cliche thing to say, but it is very true.

434
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,160
It's ignorance, and it's the very thing you require.

435
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,400
If you knew everything and how hard things were, you wouldn't get into it.

436
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,620
You needed ignorance, but it's also it's also a challenge and you got to figure to like

437
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,000
it's good for you, you know, like putting this stuff out there, get the name associated

438
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,160
with working with Python, get some Google juice, hopefully, although that seems to be

439
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
rare these days.

440
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,680
Not that I'm bitter.

441
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,120
Does that still work, man?

442
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,640
It just burns me up because we got shows that have covered stuff that goes back years, right?

443
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,800
But we never show up in the search results when you're looking for that stuff ever like

444
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,120
Google has never properly figured out how to index and weigh podcasts in the whole scheme

445
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,240
of things.

446
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,960
And they went all in on figuring out YouTube.

447
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,040
You know, if they've got anything relevant on YouTube, they'll give you an embed right

448
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,880
there on the Google search.

449
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,680
But say somebody wanted to know this information and they do a search for it.

450
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,120
You're hoping they'll hit the blog post, right?

451
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,600
But wouldn't it be great if Google was actually good enough to say, by the way, this same

452
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,760
author was over here giving a verbal explanation of it.

453
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,680
It just feels like we haven't evolved it at all.

454
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,320
And I find it incredibly disappointing because, you know, there's a bunch of good stuff out

455
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,680
there that you just can't surface, really.

456
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,280
It's a lot of great free content on podcasts, for sure.

457
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,920
One day we'll write a really powerful Python script that'll go through, transcribe it all

458
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,560
and convert it into blog posts, and then we'll make it big.

459
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,080
And then Spotify will put it behind the paywall.

460
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,440
Leno.com slash coder.

461
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, you go there to support the show.

462
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,880
It's Leno.com slash coder.

463
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,080
Leno's how we run and build everything for the last couple of years.

464
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,020
Since we've gone independent, we've deployed it on the node.

465
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,960
And like Jupiter broadcasting, Leno loves Linux.

466
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,320
They use it every day in every environment.

467
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,080
It's the core of their tooling.

468
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,360
And that was the basis that they used to build the node 18 years ago.

469
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,660
And now, well, now they're the largest independent cloud provider in the world.

470
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,600
And over that 18 year period, they learned a few things.

471
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,660
And when you, you know this, when you're in business, and you're focused on something

472
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,460
for 18 years, you start to get better at it.

473
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:24,480
And over that time, Leno learned that customer support, it's totally critical.

474
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,620
They've invested in the absolute best customer support team there.

475
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,580
It's a big part of why I feel like, even though I never had a major issue, if I ever did,

476
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,720
I really do feel like Leno's got my back.

477
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,940
That makes me feel like my business is going to stay online.

478
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,680
I'm going to be able to continue to do business.

479
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,200
Also Leno sort of reflects on us a little bit because of their high performance, because

480
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,400
their speed is just fantastic.

481
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,760
I mean, I'm talking 40 gigabit connections into the hypervisors.

482
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,280
They are their own ISP.

483
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,040
These factors all play into like when you access a service for Jupiter broadcasting,

484
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
it's fast.

485
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
It responds.

486
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,820
And they have data centers all around the world, 11 of them.

487
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,940
So on top of all of that, they've got some of the best performance out there.

488
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,020
They've got great features like object storage, cloud firewall, backups that could be baked

489
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,580
right in.

490
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,280
The monitoring on their dashboard is really nice.

491
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,140
You log in and you get a nice snapshot of exactly where your system's at right now and

492
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,220
where it's been at recently, like performance wise and metrics wise.

493
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,460
And then on top of that, you can plug into their API and pull some of that information

494
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,120
right down and you could even use their Linode command line client if you wanted to.

495
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,620
I mean, there's like a lot of ways you can get to that stuff.

496
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:40,920
So as you grow, there become more options for how you manage your Linode infrastructure,

497
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:47,720
like Kubernetes or Terraform, the API, pre-built images that you can actually design and store

498
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,760
for yourself and then deploy them again, which is a really quick way to maybe do some R&D.

499
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
There's a lot out there.

500
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,380
There's a lot you can choose from, but it's not overwhelming.

501
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,360
We've built a dashboard that makes it clean, understandable and easy to get started.

502
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,540
So much so that literally everyone on our team has proficiency with the Linode dashboard.

503
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,880
When do you see that ever happen in a group of people?

504
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
It's pretty rare.

505
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,520
You know, again, 18 years.

506
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,960
They've learned how to build these things.

507
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,360
They've learned how to do it right.

508
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,080
So why don't you go build something, maybe go learn something, try something for yourself

509
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,940
and support the show.

510
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,800
Go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 in 60 day credit, kick the tires for yourself

511
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,240
and support the show.

512
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,660
It's linode.com slash coder.

513
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,720
We were doing this here show and I was debating, was I going to get an M1?

514
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Was I going to wait?

515
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,480
Did I want to even tempt into the Mac side of things?

516
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,280
Because it's a very sticky ecosystem and it's not an ecosystem that necessarily plays great

517
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,760
with what I have now, although I've managed to kind of walk that line over the years since

518
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
I have an iPhone.

519
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,640
It's, it's not a huge, huge deal, not a huge gap, but I was hesitant.

520
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,520
So when the M1 was announced, it was to me, clearly the consumer level machines of the

521
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,640
16 gigs of Ram limitation, eight CPU core, those kinds of things.

522
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
Okay.

523
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,040
That looks promising, but not for me yet.

524
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,320
So I started saving up my coins thinking obviously there's going to be something more powerful

525
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
around the corner.

526
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,640
They'll rev the laptops.

527
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,880
Probably a great time for me to get one because I've got a 2016 MacBook pro here, you know,

528
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,760
with the full on like OG butterfly keyboard.

529
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,140
My Z key just started going out on me.

530
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,800
This seems like a good time to replace this.

531
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
It's a nice leap.

532
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,480
And I wanted to get my experience with an M1 machine.

533
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,680
I put the order in a little bit after I hem and hawed about a little too long.

534
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,200
So I was sort of on a long shipping delay.

535
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,440
And in the meantime, in that window of time, as a business, we made the decision, well,

536
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,480
we'll purchase a M1 Mac mini for testing purposes of Asahi Linux.

537
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,440
So we can provide full coverage of that when they launch an installer, which is any day

538
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,740
now to get Linux on the M1 Mac mini, they are using the M1 Mac mini for their development.

539
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,400
So it makes sense that that's probably your best bet in terms of hardware to run Asahi

540
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,120
Linux as an M1 mini, because that's what they're using.

541
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:17,160
So we picked one up and I set it up and I realized, oh, damn, I didn't need to wait.

542
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,820
This is plenty fast.

543
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,860
This is plenty fast for me.

544
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,920
The M1 mini was, it's a nice little piece of machinery.

545
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,520
It really is truly nice.

546
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,160
And additionally, it doesn't even show up in my power stats.

547
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,200
It uses such a small amount of power, I can't actually tell when the M1 mini is powered

548
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,360
on or powered off in my solar stats.

549
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,200
I can tell when the monitor's on, I can tell when the monitor's off, but I cannot tell

550
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,800
when the minis are off and the mini performance is fantastic.

551
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:51,400
So when I got the mini and I realized it was this nice, I thought, holy, the M1 Macs is

552
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,960
going to be mind blowing.

553
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,000
And I watched the YouTube reviews and the YouTubers, their minds were blown.

554
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,400
Unbelievable performance.

555
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,520
So I got an M1 Macs, I ordered it with 10 cores, 8 performance, 2 efficiencies, 64 gigabytes

556
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
of RAM.

557
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
And he said, give it to me.

558
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,760
I'm ready to have the ultimate in performance workstation.

559
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:20,520
I took it out of the box and my first impression was an odd sense of sad nostalgia.

560
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,280
Holding it in my hands took me back to the titanium power book.

561
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,460
And that was like my first years in IT support.

562
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,080
It was a very formative time of my life.

563
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,920
That back then, it was an aspirational machine.

564
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,240
I could never afford back then in my early twenties, a titanium power book pro.

565
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,800
It was this machine that like the directors and the executives had and I'd be working

566
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
on their machines.

567
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,760
It was squared off just like this one was.

568
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,080
And I couldn't believe the overwhelming like time travel sense of nostalgia that hit me

569
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,920
when I picked this laptop up.

570
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,720
It was completely unexpected.

571
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,440
And immediately it gave me a connection to this laptop like I don't have with any other

572
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,520
piece of equipment that I own.

573
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
I couldn't believe it.

574
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,480
And I opened it up and my next reaction was, oh, I missed the touch bar.

575
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Really?

576
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Yeah.

577
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm a horrible speller.

578
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,840
And the autocomplete was a fricking lifesaver.

579
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,120
And also the emoticon autocomplete was nice, too.

580
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,840
I am like horrible at spelling.

581
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,020
And so having anything that could give me an assist was appreciated.

582
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,760
What I'd like to see is the full size F key row and then just put the touch bar above

583
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
that.

584
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,240
I know it's crazy, but that is a little crazy.

585
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,280
You know, I started using this thing, Mike, and I I was expecting to just be blown away

586
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
by the performance.

587
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,360
I mean, everybody's just been raving about the performance of this thing.

588
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,600
And that is not what I got.

589
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,240
I mean, it's fast.

590
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,680
It's probably the fastest computer I've ever owned.

591
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,400
I mean, it probably does everything I've ever done with a computer the fastest I've ever

592
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
done it.

593
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,920
And that's impressive in a laptop.

594
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,880
And it does all of this.

595
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,520
I've never heard the fans yet.

596
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,320
I've had it for three weeks.

597
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,320
I've never heard the fans.

598
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,400
I've had three VMS going with four monitors attached while I'm browsing the Web and watching

599
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,520
a movie.

600
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,500
And I still did not hear the fans.

601
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,680
What happens is it just has unlimited headroom, like I have not been able to max it out.

602
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,520
I do not yet have the sense of I've ever put this computer under load, even though I've

603
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,460
put it under what would have been substantial load for an Intel machine.

604
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:31,440
It is fast in that sense, but I have this sense that it's not like, oh, man, everything's

605
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
different now.

606
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,880
It's like, oh, everything's finally as fast as it should have been.

607
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,340
That's my takeaway from it is, OK, well, this is about as fast as they should have been

608
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,440
for years.

609
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,360
And now they are that speed, which is great.

610
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,160
But it doesn't feel like five or 10 years down the road like I was expecting.

611
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,240
It feels like what today should be.

612
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,340
And what we've experienced so far was just inadequacy.

613
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,820
And now they've made up for that, and that's good.

614
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,280
But I just dropped a lot of coin on this machine expecting this to be like a five to 10 year

615
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,960
machine for me.

616
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,040
And it will be a long term machine, no doubt about it, especially since I can't even break

617
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,760
a sweat on it right now.

618
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,360
But it wasn't that like fundamental, the land has just shifted for me kind of machine.

619
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,840
There are a few things that make it really nice, like the way it handles multi monitors

620
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,240
is nice.

621
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,880
It's really nice.

622
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,900
Four screens being powered by a laptop and it doesn't even get warm to the touch is impressive

623
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,160
and doesn't make a sound.

624
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,480
It's legitimately absolutely silent.

625
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,320
And I am extremely picky about this kind of stuff because I record audio and I cannot

626
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
hear the machine.

627
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,000
Do you feel like you got your money's worth given your I wouldn't say disappointed, but

628
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,320
somewhat not blown away by the speed?

629
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,080
If I think of it as a desktop, maybe not.

630
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,120
But if I think of it as a laptop that is kicking the ass of any desktop I've ever used, yes.

631
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
You know what I mean?

632
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
Sure.

633
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,920
So if it's like the one computer, it makes sense because it's almost taking to two purchases

634
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
with four screens.

635
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:02,760
I can actually be running two different Linux VMs simultaneously and still have like a Mac

636
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,640
app going and doing plenty of stuff.

637
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,040
That feels like a workflow to work for me for a long time.

638
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,880
Like that's that's pretty damn nice.

639
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,840
And the thing that I just am blown away is like when I unplug those three external monitors,

640
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,420
the screen like doesn't even flicker.

641
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,820
It doesn't even like spaz out in the slightest and just those monitors and those windows

642
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:26,880
just get moved to the main screen completely without having a spaz attack.

643
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
That's nice.

644
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
Yes, it's remarkable.

645
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,120
And I can just be like, oh, I need another screen and I'll plug it in to one of the USB

646
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,640
C ports and I've got another screen and it just turns on and the other screens don't

647
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,600
freak out and it doesn't completely rearrange everything.

648
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
That is really nice.

649
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,640
And it's plugging and unplugging for monitors is something I do because I've got a USB C

650
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,920
Thunderbolt 3 dock with, you know, a bunch of monitors hanging off of it.

651
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,720
And I am impressed with Rosetta too.

652
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,240
No surprise there.

653
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,800
The only way I can tell I am running an Intel app is it takes a little bit extra to launch.

654
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,240
You know, it takes a few bounces in the dock and then it launches where everything else

655
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,960
launches instantly.

656
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,840
So you can tell if it's native because there's zero load time and if it's Intel, there's

657
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,120
a little bit of load time.

658
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,680
I imagine that's your experience.

659
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,440
Honestly, I think things have been pretty fast for me on Rosetta.

660
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,440
But see, I basically live in VSCode and Terminal and Slack, right?

661
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,840
So that's been the interesting thing for me is Electron apps perform like they're native.

662
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:37,320
VSCode and Slack and Discord and Element, they have all felt like native code.

663
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,800
Just super fast.

664
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Really good performance.

665
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,920
If that's not an endorsement, I don't know what is.

666
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,360
It's sort of ridiculous that you've got to buy a near $4,000 laptop to get good VSCode

667
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
speed.

668
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,040
Well, we should say that because you have the max, right?

669
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,040
So you're not on the bottom of the ladder here.

670
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,720
No, I went all the way because that was always my intention is to be responsible and save

671
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,680
my moneys up and then pull it all in one big go and hope that lasts a few more years.

672
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,680
I don't know.

673
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
We'll see, right?

674
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,060
Because I feel like I'm in a worse spot than you in one sense that there's not really anybody

675
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,800
I can hand this machine down to if this doesn't work for me.

676
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,120
I can't even swallow that cost.

677
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm going to just have to use this machine now and I am happy with it.

678
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,120
I am happy with it.

679
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,420
I'm just not blown away with it.

680
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:24,120
I think a lot of this is it's nice to have ports, but I should have always had these

681
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
ports.

682
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
It's great to have high performance.

683
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,600
I should have always had this performance.

684
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,160
It's nice to have it be silent, but honestly, I feel like for the last few years, these

685
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,960
machines should have this is what they should have been.

686
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,880
And I think Apple could have gotten there or at least closer.

687
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:45,080
I hate to say this, but I got to suspect Apple intentionally held back the MacBooks knowing

688
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,520
this transition was coming.

689
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,840
The reason why I say that is when you look at some of like the tear downs that I fix

690
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,880
it and like the Linus Media Group did in there, you can see there's easy steps they could

691
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,520
have done to make the cooling systems better on these systems.

692
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,900
And Apple didn't.

693
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:05,240
And then surprise, Apple used that exact cooling system when they launched the M1 version of

694
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,360
the MacBooks.

695
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,820
And it just, to me, seems like maybe these systems had been held back one more iteration

696
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,120
so that way they could get the new keyboard in the ARM Mac, you know, they could get that

697
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,800
improved function key row in there, you know, all of that.

698
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,940
It just seems like maybe they sat on it for a little bit longer than they should have.

699
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,840
It makes every other machine I own feel slow.

700
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,600
It really and it's really bad here in the studio because these systems are like from

701
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,080
2017, 2018 and 2016.

702
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,600
So these systems down here really, really feel like dogs.

703
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,620
It's not just the CPU.

704
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,720
It's also the fact that they have this unified memory architecture and they have these ridiculously

705
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,300
fast SSDs or MVMEs.

706
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,880
As a work machine, it is a very solid performer.

707
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,520
Mac OS, I think, is what holds it back.

708
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,880
I think the reason why it doesn't feel faster to me is Mac OS.

709
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:59,040
Yeah, Mac OS feels like it's in this weird, I don't know if it's a transitional state

710
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,440
or it's something neglected, unoptimized.

711
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,080
It doesn't feel like it matches or it's getting the same amount of attention as the hardware.

712
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,640
The very first thought I had when I booted it up was, that booted just as fast as my

713
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,360
last Mac and my last Mac from 2016.

714
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,440
You know, that and then it shuts down at the same speed my other Macs do.

715
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,820
OK, great.

716
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,540
You know, my Linux box boots up faster than my brand new Mac does.

717
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,800
Not that that's a metric of performance, but it's pervasive throughout the OS.

718
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,160
I mean, Mac OS is pretty solid in terms of stability.

719
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,840
I think it's holding this hardware back now.

720
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:38,840
And I suspect that if I were able to put Linux on this and it was fully accelerated, I suspect

721
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,080
I would realize more of the performance gains in the hardware.

722
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:50,760
Because the way this manifests to me is functions like processing things, that is remarkable.

723
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,640
It's like decompressing files, compressing files, building an application, any of that

724
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,880
kind of stuff, encoding audio or media or video, but bonkers fast.

725
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,280
But anything that involves the OS, just as slow as it was on your previous machine.

726
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,920
And it's just like it's unoptimized code or I don't know what.

727
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,080
It just does things a slow way, an inefficient way, I don't know.

728
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,040
But it does feel like it holds it back a little bit.

729
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,800
Now the nice part is, is that applications themselves are really fast, web pages even

730
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,120
feel like they load faster.

731
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,480
And something that was surprising to me is my internet feels faster just simply because

732
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,320
my web browsers are faster, which is a funny thing.

733
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,640
But it's been a little while since I've experienced that kind of change.

734
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,160
And that you do get that kind of experience from this.

735
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,200
While it's not like blow you away, it's like, oh, wow, huh, even the web feels faster.

736
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,520
This is definitely a direction the rest of the industry has to go.

737
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,440
They have to respond to these machines.

738
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
It's going to be tough.

739
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,600
Yeah, Intel and AMD are working on it.

740
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,560
Samsung says they've got a ARM chip that's going to be just as good as the M1 soon.

741
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:01,800
I know like Carl over at System76, he's kind of excited about RISC-V and there is some

742
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,240
more developments in that area.

743
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,880
But when I look at even the fastest RISC-V chips, they're like a gigahertz.

744
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,720
And I don't know if that's not the full picture.

745
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,280
The thing that kind of special sauce about these Apple chips is that they've grafted

746
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,720
so much of the x86 instruction set on top of their chip.

747
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,600
I'm running an Intel app and an ARM app right next to each other.

748
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
It gets easier.

749
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:32,240
Yeah, I just this is impossible, but it's easier to run an Intel application and an

750
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,480
ARM application on the same system than it is to run a 64-bit app and a 32-bit app.

751
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
That's what they've done here.

752
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,120
They've made it simpler than just trying to have 32-bit and 64-bit apps on the same system.

753
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,040
And they're entirely different CPU architectures.

754
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,280
I'm hoping they go somewhere with macOS itself to, I don't know, modernize it.

755
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,480
I mean, take a few pages out of Katie's book.

756
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
I just don't think they can.

757
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,320
No, I don't think they want to either.

758
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,360
I think somehow I almost wonder if it's like an act of debate over in Cupertino, like what's

759
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,440
is iPadOS going to become macOS or what's the...

760
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,080
There's another kind of world out there where they want their systems to be kind of like

761
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,320
NixOS declarative, or they want to be able to deploy their desktops, their workstations,

762
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:23,840
and their laptops using things like Ansible or some sort of centralized management system.

763
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,720
And macOS sucks so bad at all that kind of stuff, right?

764
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,940
Like you're still in the era where you could mass deploy Windows and Linux workstations,

765
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,620
but then when it comes time to work on the MacBook, you're either all in on the Apple

766
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,240
management system or you're just bespoke setting up that MacBook.

767
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,120
Maybe you've got a base image and then you're configuring all the apps on top of that.

768
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,640
And it's the same for me.

769
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,720
Like I can kind of centrally manage the configuration of a lot of the settings of my Linux desktops,

770
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,920
but then the MacBook comes along and it's like, well, I'm just going to burn an afternoon

771
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,040
setting this one up.

772
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,520
I got to go download a bunch of apps.

773
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,520
I got to go get a bunch of serial keys for these things.

774
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,960
I got to do it all by hand every single time.

775
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
It's tedious.

776
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,320
It feels like for a professional, it's fine to have that to work that way.

777
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,000
In fact, sometimes it's even fun to kind of experiment with different stuff and do new

778
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,480
apps and try new things on each setup.

779
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,780
Like that's what I'm doing with this MacBook in general.

780
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,040
But if I wanted to deploy these things on the regular or if I wanted to be able to quickly

781
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,520
recover from some sort of hardware failure or hardware swap, it just doesn't seem like

782
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,860
Mac OS is really suited for that.

783
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:30,520
Then you got like, Windows has a Linux subsystem, Chrome now lets you run Linux apps.

784
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:37,720
It'd be really nice if Apple acknowledged that Linux exists and that people are deploying

785
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,840
to Linux servers in production.

786
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,400
Like just accept that you don't sell the XServ anymore.

787
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,740
Acknowledge your own iCloud data center is full of Linux boxes.

788
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,880
Maybe even recognize that your own engineers are on Macs and they're deploying on Linux

789
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,560
and could use a Linux subsystem or something, right?

790
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,240
Something that makes Docker less of a piece of **** on Mac OS.

791
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Well, I think that's why Terminal and Rosetta work so well, right?

792
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,400
And if you remember when they first demoed the M1s, they even showed that use case off.

793
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,200
You know, for me, this last week, my work setup, because I was testing things on a Raspberry

794
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:19,520
Pi compute module, was my Macbook on the table next to me, a headless compute module.

795
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,020
And it was actually a pretty great setup because I was testing out different containerized

796
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,520
applications that I was using for benchmarking for a self-hosted segment.

797
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,360
And I was looking up the information on the Macbook, getting the URLs and stuff like that

798
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:40,720
and had VS code using SFTP to connect to the compute module so I could edit all my Docker

799
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,880
compose files and VS code hit save.

800
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,500
And then I set iterm to do drop down terminal like I do in Linux, which is awesome.

801
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,040
So I have like a Quake style drop down terminal and I would, you know, execute the Docker

802
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,000
up, Docker compose up and whatever and, you know, I start testing stuff and I realized

803
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,360
this is a pretty slick workflow and yeah, it sucks that I had to set up a separate machine

804
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:07,240
that was an actual Linux box that had actual software on it, but you know, it's a $35 compute

805
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
module.

806
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,080
It took me like, it took me like a half hour to get the thing set up and going and then

807
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,040
I, I've been using it for two weeks.

808
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
It's amazing.

809
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,040
Yeah.

810
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,780
It really worked really well.

811
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,960
So I mean, it's a, it's a dumb way to do it, but you could re you could recreate that

812
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,480
with like a, a VPS or something like our VM machine as well, I suppose.

813
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,960
In all, I know we've mentioned this before on the show, but I have to give an honorable

814
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,200
mention to Parallels 17.

815
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,760
I thought for sure I'd go on the new Mac and I'd use UTM, which is a free open source virtualizer

816
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,160
for M1 hardware and it seems like it needs further investigation, but let me say the

817
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,120
folks over at Parallels really hit it out of the park with Parallels 17.

818
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:55,080
This thing shows up as essentially pass through hardware to the Linux guest, VFIO GPU pass

819
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,120
through to the Parallels VM.

820
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:04,880
So Linux, Linux is like full on given it it's all like it thinks everything's full 3d accelerated.

821
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,040
And then what Parallels is doing is using the metal API to render the VFIO input that

822
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,160
it got from the Linux guest.

823
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,240
So you're getting a 3d rendered metal interface on top of that.

824
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:25,600
And it screams, I mean, I'm talking full screen 4k resolution, Linux desktop environment,

825
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,160
full 3d acceleration.

826
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Things looking great.

827
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,760
I've got wobbly windows going just to see how far I can push it.

828
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,600
And it absolutely top performance.

829
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,040
The only downside is you have to use ARM images because if you want native performance, you

830
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,280
have the whole stack has to be ARM.

831
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,840
And there are less Linux ARM packages out there, but it's pretty, it's pretty good.

832
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
It's pretty good.

833
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,960
So you got to be willing to live with an ARM Linux desktop, but if you use Parallels 17

834
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,000
and perhaps other virtualizers do this as well, I have not fully tested it.

835
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,780
Once I got a rocking setup, I was like, why change the thing?

836
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:02,840
This is, I actually dropped like a good chunk of change for Parallels after I had what I

837
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:08,720
have described before as the fastest virtualized Linux experience ever.

838
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,800
And I've even used it with GPU pass-through before.

839
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,480
It is just as good as GPU pass-through, absolutely.

840
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,720
And that to me was a huge game changer because it meant I didn't have to like have a limited

841
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,020
experience when I try out the Linux desktop and a VM, if I want to just try something

842
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:28,640
for a couple of hours, I can have a really good full 3D accelerated experience.

843
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,240
Now I've still got my ThinkPad.

844
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,760
I'm still using that for hardware, laptop tests, but you know, to have a quick 3D accelerated

845
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,760
VM, yes, please.

846
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
Thank you very much.

847
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,960
Don't mind if I do at all.

848
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,840
And UTM looks great, but Parallels 17, it was for me.

849
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,360
Yeah, that's actually the same VM I use, but I have not tried it on the M1 yet.

850
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,600
So there you go.

851
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,560
That's my reaction to finally getting the M1 Max.

852
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,920
Guess my takeaway would be, if I have one, is just get the Pro chip.

853
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,840
If you get one, get the M1 Pro.

854
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
That makes sense.

855
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,120
Like what's taking advantage of the Max right now.

856
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,600
And you know, we're having an M1 love fest here, but just a friendly reminder, if you

857
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:15,200
need to use Visual Studio proper for Windows or older.NET development, the ARM chips are

858
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,800
a deal breaker for you, even in the magic of Parallels.

859
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,400
What would be a real game changer for me would be if I saw Linux ships with 3D accelerated

860
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,480
support on the M1 Max, then I would really be over the moon with this laptop.

861
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,400
It seems to me because of that's a very normal work case for me.

862
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,460
That's a major way that this is limited.

863
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:42,800
It's saved by the fantastic VM performance that is truly the best I've ever experienced.

864
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,720
And it doesn't even put a load on the laptop.

865
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,720
That's the other nice thing.

866
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,920
It's like penalty free virtualization.

867
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,520
I can have a VM going on a second desktop all day, all night, and I'm not penalized

868
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,520
for it.

869
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,640
There's still plenty of overhead.

870
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,480
So that's really good to see.

871
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,360
I hope as time goes on and Asahi Linux ports that this laptop will get even better and

872
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:09,600
it'll become even more valuable to me because right now I'm very much in love with the physical

873
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,600
hardware.

874
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,200
It has a very special place.

875
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,320
When I hold it, it still feels really special to me.

876
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:20,240
And the performance for doing processing is just, it's mind blowing, just held back by

877
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,240
Mac OS.

878
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,760
And I think Apple could address that, but perhaps I won't have to wait.

879
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,740
Perhaps the Asahi Linux team will address it.

880
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,180
I'd love to hear anyone out there's take if they've gotten one, if they have any tips

881
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,840
or experience, coder.show slash contact.

882
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,080
Now I thought maybe we were going to get a little hardware update from you, but it seems

883
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,440
like the journey continues on your end for your new hardware.

884
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,440
The journey continues.

885
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,480
I didn't get enough time with the holiday and the kid being off of school to really,

886
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,420
to really open up the Pangolin.

887
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:50,000
Next week for sure, I'll probably have a review up and I'm actually, spoiler alert, going

888
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,960
to be trying out an XPS 13 in Windows and Linux.

889
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,960
That's a thing, huh?

890
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
That's a thing.

891
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
Wow.

892
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,960
That's a thing.

893
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,960
One of the current ones, one of the new ones?

894
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,960
Yeah.

895
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,960
The brand new new ones.

896
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,960
Yeah.

897
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,960
Tis the season.

898
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
It's the end of the year.

899
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,960
Yes.

900
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,960
Very good.

901
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,960
Good.

902
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,040
I'll be, I'll actually be really interested to hear that because I've always really liked

903
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,040
the XPS 13.

904
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,680
I felt like that's a good little piece of hardware and also a really good value.

905
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,680
Yeah.

906
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,520
This is, this is one of the, I mean, I don't want to extend it cause we'll talk about it

907
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,520
next week, but.

908
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,520
Sure.

909
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:26,960
A purchase entirely driven by the fact that I can't successfully VM windows on the M1,

910
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,400
which is just becoming more and more important.

911
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
So.

912
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,400
Well, very good.

913
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,400
I look forward to that.

914
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,400
Also, thank you to our members out there.

915
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,080

on Twitter.

921
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,460
He's at Dumanuco and his company's at the mad botter ink.

922
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,700
Is there anywhere else you'd like to send people this week?

923
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,920
Go to Alice dot dev.

924
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,360
If you want to get rid of some legacy data and move it to something new.

925
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,440
I like it.

926
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,960
Alice dot dev for that.

927
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,960
I'm at Chris LAS on the Twitters.

928
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,400
Oh, the network's at Jupiter signal and the show's at Coder radio show.

929
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,320
Kind of getting tired of the Twitters.

930
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,320
You know what?

931
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,320

There's also a matrix colony dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com.

935
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,600
If you know Matrix, that's the server.

936
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,240
Love to have you over there.

We're normally live on Mondays.

939
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,640
We did this one as a special on Friday, but we'll be back at our regularly scheduled time

940
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,520
