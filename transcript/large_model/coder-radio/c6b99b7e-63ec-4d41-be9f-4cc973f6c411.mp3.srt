00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
This is KOTORadio, episode 324 recorded August 29th, 2018.

2
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,520
Hi everyone and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,360
pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

4
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,280
This episode is brought to you by our two great sponsors, Linux Academy and DigitalOcean.

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,320
I'll get you hip to them sponsors later on in the show.

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,360
My name is Chris and joining us every single week, like the wise Yoda in the swamps, but

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,280
instead of like some weird planet.

8
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,760
No, no, it's Florida.

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
Hello Mike.

10
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,240
Hmm, you said not been to Florida recently.

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Yeah, I guess that's what I was thinking when I said that I'm like, well, it is kind of

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
a strange planet.

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,280
But you know, I know now that I'm sure we're that you're based out of Florida.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,160
We probably have a hardcore Florida fan base.

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,360
I would just imagine true.

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,720
That is not well, I didn't want to upset the one or two of them as it might be, even if

17
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
they are family members.

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,680
I didn't want to upset them, Mike.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,880
We are gathered today to do a little makeup for the audience last week since I've been

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
sick.

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,120
Yeah, we wanted to we wanted to make another episode for you.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,140
We wanted to give you something a little more something later in your week, a little more

23
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,140
coder in your life.

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,480
And we've got a good smattering of topics that we like to put together on these kinds

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,920
of episodes, some some that are really just for me to troll Mike really, to be honest

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,720
with you and others that I think we'll get into pretty far.

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,800
Maybe we should start with what you teased in our last episode.

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,320
And that was you breaking your phone, because that's probably the one everybody's expecting.

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,080
So they'll not have any idea what's coming next.

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,520
So let me let me set the stage thousand dollar iPhone 10 with face ID, no home button, all

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,560
glass screen.

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,520
Is it in a case?

33
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,080
In a leather case, it is.

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Yes.

35
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,800
Oh, I have the leather case, too.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,320
So the leather case did not prevent this disaster failed the test.

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,240
So did it fall like on a rock?

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,080
Like how did you get past the bun the bumper around the edge here?

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,160
So it landed directly on his face on quote unquote artisanal.

40
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,860
Yeah, basically uneven tile, right?

41
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:39,520
Like tile that's intentionally uneven to feel whenever at the Brandon Mall.

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Thank you.

43
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,560
It was great.

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,040
So so the irony is there's a crack in the screen.

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,120
That's not the worst part.

46
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,880
I can no longer hit buttons on the top nav bar.

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Hmm.

48
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,720
So it's like pretty much unusable.

49
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,120
Yeah.

50
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,580
Oh, Mike, you know, you're supposed to wait another couple of weeks because we're like

51
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,560
we're like probably what seven, eight days away from announcement.

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,320
I know I could literally buy a new iPhone.

53
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
I get it.

54
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Yeah.

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,360
So I've had this happen to you know, not not exactly a destroyed phone, but my partner

56
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:25,120
hadia her phone is a is like a six s I'm not sure the seven I don't know seven maybe I

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,800
don't know but it's a it's a it's a standard iPhone.

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,800
It's not the it's not the eight and it has a lightning port like all iPhones do hello

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,720
and when she plugs it in regardless of charger or cable or if it's like a car charger or

60
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,800
an Apple brick it'll say charging you know boom and it's a little icon will light up

61
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,040
that it's charging and you're good to go say it's like 20% you come back an hour later

62
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,080
and it's like at 18% it goes down it's going down even though it's showing that it's charging

63
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,920
it's got the little lightning bolt icon the battery is discharging and sometimes if you

64
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,980
like unplug and replug it'll start charging back up again won't necessarily get to 100%

65
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,680
but sometimes it does and then sometimes it stops at like 50% then you got to like pull

66
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,200
the lightning cable out turn it and plug it back in again tried multiple cables multiple

67
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,100
power adapters try to DC adapter.

68
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,960
It's always exhibiting this issue and I'm like babe you got to just keep this thing

69
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,800
going for like three more weeks you got to keep this phone going I'm not I'm not going

70
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,400
to go buy you a brand new iPhone seven or whatever eight or whatever it is just weeks

71
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,920
before so naturally the only solution is to buy an Android phone right.

72
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,840
I've done nothing so far oh are you tempted to go with the Android route I was until I

73
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,800
found out there's no comparable Android phone to buy the now the Samsung S8 is coming out

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,040
shortly but there's nothing and here's the problem I'm traveling to Utah in a week and

75
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,080
a half what from the date this will be out with no phone no you got to get a phone no

76
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,120
I need a phone that works like this phone okay my iPhone 10 works if I'm very concerned

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,720
like it's basically a dumb phone now that I have to be very sensitive and how I touch

78
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,480
it yeah I'm living in a nightmare you could just get a feature phone you know just for

79
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,720
like a couple of weeks although when you're traveling also slip my wrists in a bathtub

80
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,120
you need maps and oh man yeah cuz I'm driving in Utah let me tell you Utah it's not a friendly

81
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,680
state to me have you have you met Mormons and by the way we're once again brought to

82
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,280
us by Malfoy gin I'm just saying Utah's not where I want to be lost Salt Lake City is

83
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,880
not bad I tell you what I've had some good times in Salt Lake City have you cuz I've

84
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,800
had some rough times in Salt Lake City I did get stared at a lot I did a lot of are you

85
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,480
okay sir yeah I got a lot of that I got a lot of I got a lot of weird looks and I don't

86
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:56,120
know exactly why cuz I wasn't doing anything oh I can tell you why why cuz of me cuz cuz

87
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,520
you and I do we stand out yeah we're well how it stands out is it is it the hair what

88
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,680
is it have you ever seen the movie have you ever seen the movie Monsters Inc it's my it's

89
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,440
a Disney movie kids love monsters my son's current favorite yep oh man it's a good time

90
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,680
when they get you and I are effectively hairy blue neon green monsters and yeah in Salt

91
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,920
Lake City yeah and we're sullies is what you're saying we're walking around as giant sullies

92
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:30,440
we're giant sullies and sometimes I'm Mike Wazowski like it's not what you want because

93
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,480
I don't know I I fear Mormons and and I have relatives who've converted to the Latter-day

94
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,240
Saints Church which is Mormonism yeah I'm terrified of them because my nightmare is

95
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,440
a Mormon cop actually like that's things I'm afraid of it does sound scary it does sound

96
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,960
scary I'm wondering I'm wondering if there's a show title in this somewhere but it does

97
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,000
I follow your point I do follow you Mike fears Joseph Smith right right like yeah I mean

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,200
so you you and I have ever okay can we talk about water down beer for a moment yeah okay

99
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:13,400
have you ever had tap your beer in Salt Lake City the worst beer okay in the United States

100
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:20,240
that is the it is it is so disappointing but to drink you know why law it's a lot like

101
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,120
they think they have a hard cap on the right there's a municipal ordinance right on the

102
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,800
alcohol content of beer right yeah how producers I actually think Utah is partially responsible

103
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,360
for America's bad rap for beer because we have we have fantastic beer here in the States

104
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,320
we have a massive microbrew culture with really good beer Tampa has 70 breweries yeah like

105
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,400
we're yeah but we have that we have that dysfunctional situation in Utah where beer manufacturers

106
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,800
have to make these half-assed one-cock versions of their beers which just tastes horrible

107
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:01,360
I can't even describe the taste it's and it's almost like it's like just a water it tastes

108
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,680
like this like it tastes like sadness right there's a really cuz like because there's

109
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,920
no reason to drink it because it tastes horrible and it's like shitty soda yeah it's not beer

110
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,880
it's not soda it's something awful in between yeah yeah I was shocked I mean I know about

111
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:27,280
it but I was shocked when I die and frankly go to hell because yeah I will end up in Salt

112
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:35,480
Lake City like that so like I'm not enthusiastic about this trip I'm pretty unhappy you know

113
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,800
as long as you don't drink the beer I think Salt Lake City is pretty great you know I

114
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,680
think it is yeah what are two martinis and wait till the cops follow you around yeah

115
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,480
I'm just saying yeah yeah yeah it's just hostile territory we should move on from this all

116
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,680
right so uh so your phone broke and Mike's an alcoholic but we give you yeah yeah those

117
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,200
are the two two major points here yeah now here's the one that I don't know if we shared

118
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,920
with the class is you and maybe you told us but I don't think you've given us the review

119
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,400
yet recently picked up a new workstation a new portable workstation a galago 2018 you

120
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,160
bought the original galago uh 4k had some fan issues had some temperature issues so

121
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,800
I was surprised to hear that you went back to the new galago but from your initial impressions

122
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,520
it sounded like they had made some revisions to the model that were pretty good so now

123
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,560
I'm curious now that you've had them for a couple of weeks what's it been like using

124
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:37,680
the new galago yeah so I got the new galago um I got the 1080p not the 3k version okay

125
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:45,560
or rather 4k version apologies um and I have to say matte screens are the way to go ah

126
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,840
the 1080p screen is matte part of it's because a lot of linux apps just don't have awesome

127
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,280
4k coverage yeah and it's a lot more computer to drive that display too right and and just

128
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:06,480
like matt is prettier the battery life is better than the 4k version is this you're gonna is

129
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,560
this gonna be your utah rig no and I like the entrapment I like the entrapment so why

130
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:20,360
is that because the product I am unveiling at utah is a windows-based product oh my mac

131
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,160
my macbook will be my utah rig because it has a windows partition you know that tickles

132
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:32,520
me right yeah that tickles me in the words of my my distant cousin bain necessary evil

133
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,960
so this is like your office daily driver this is what you're like you know what fuck it

134
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm just gonna go for it all right we're gonna talk about the cute company for a moment oh

135
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,200
oh boy I spent months writing this product in c++ to run on linux it was gonna be a huge

136
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,320
thing for us we were gonna veil on quit radio was gonna be fabulous it was gonna be great

137
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,480
I was gonna give you some money you could have done some ads on linux yeah that sounds

138
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:05,360
good I like all those linux action news it was gonna be awesome and then capitalism oh

139
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:14,980
not that again those dirty dirty money grubbing money they yeah yeah but I'm hoping to make

140
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,680
some money yeah yeah not they want to make more money per unit than I was gonna charge

141
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,920
per license right like I would literally owe the money every time I made a sale like what

142
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,760
the hell is wrong with cute so you were you're buying this galago and you're thinking this

143
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,000
is my future right here this is it like we're gonna build linux and windows cross-platform

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,920
software because you know we're in the aerospace industry so yeah ignoring windows is is effectively

145
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,760
suicide right or you got a choice that's what your customer that's what your customers run

146
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,360
the future is going to be linux right okay like the future's next even microsoft knows

147
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,280
that so right so I'm thinking okay we'll write it in cute for linux and then we'll like effectively

148
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:05,320
back the work to windows all right and I spent three days in and we talked about in a previous

149
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,960
episode in dll hell making it all work yeah and it worked it was fabulous right everything

150
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:18,560
worked we have a fully functioning binary that written in cute that's awesome feels

151
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:26,120
good business deal with the cute company just like it was basically if I can channel my

152
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:33,640
new jersey roots here and forgive me itunes go get your fucking shine box kid we just

153
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:41,280
don't make enough money for them to even care to deal with us yeah it's it's crazy that

154
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,800
is an old saying go get your shine box kid that is so jersey it is very jersey I like

155
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,480
how you cleaned it up so we ended up in this position where while linux is the future windows

156
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,880
is a requirement for right now to go it seems like that's yeah we're already committed we're

157
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,720
already we're already like married to the show I can't back out I'm I'm hooked yeah

158
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:12,720
man so rewritten in dot net it was what do you think about windows 10 dual booting on

159
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:20,360
the galago I haven't done it yet I bet you it works better than it does on the macbook

160
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,600
you know I wonder why you say that because it's because it's garbage on the macbook first

161
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,760
of all the camp isn't that terrible it is it is like the fans are crap like this your

162
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,880
macbook constantly is way too hot it's because there's no thermal management under windows

163
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,440
until you start getting to the really critical stuff it's just never has felt right it's

164
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,320
just like the bootcamp drivers are trash they're just the worst software you gotta you gotta

165
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,720
run that one single executable to install everything and they're all garbage and at

166
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,200
the end of it you get a machine that's got like a somewhat less functional trackpad poor

167
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,440
thermal management it just feels like forced on there but the galago I mean that's just

168
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,160
standard Intel hardware with a standard thermal system and a standard fan management system

169
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,960
like it's all just Intel spec so Windows 10 would just work with natively with all that

170
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:16,440
stuff you know because you know there's models of that galago sold by other OEMs that are

171
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,600
running Windows you know so I so so this is the sick irony of this whole problem I would

172
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,720
have bought a galago with a bigger hard drive had I known true right right right I do recall

173
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,840
you kind of got a smaller one because you didn't need a big one but but you asked me

174
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,440
about the galago and I decided to go on a rant about cute those money-grubbing pricks

175
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:41,080
from Boston the literal worst place in the United States other than Salt Lake City so

176
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,360
we should continue on so you're liking it though for what it is I'm liking it you keep

177
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,520
pop on there did you switch off pop what's going on I'm on pop I am running basically

178
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:58,320
an environment that is effectively as close to the stock as you can get and I want to

179
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,840
hedge that a little because I've done some changes hmm I did get really drunk one night

180
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:11,320
sure and mess with your computer install Katie I installed plasma oh Chris I installed plasma

181
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,020
yeah it's tempting I know and let me tell you something oh plasma is not just tempting

182
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,240
plasmas leave your wife and kids and never look back yeah you can lose a lot of time

183
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:28,000
you couldn't yeah plasma is nice I I question the wisdom of pot being based on no after

184
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,560
looking at plasma you know I had a I had a I had a back and forth on Twitter with a journalist

185
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,120
at Forbes who's been today before we go to the show that has been trying out a bunch

186
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,200
of different Linux distros and he just popped on plasma and loves it too and I'll tell you

187
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,520
if you if you try it and you like it it's it kind of behooves you to install kabuntu

188
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,240
or another spin that is plasma first so that way it's a little cleaner like you know terminal

189
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,320
launches the right call you know the cute version of it and all it is it is a great

190
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,800
desktop system I agree it is nice you throw that on there you got a nice screen you got

191
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,060
a good keyboard that's a it's a good setup it sounds like how's the heat how's the heat

192
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:12,320
and fan how's that so this is where we get into some conversation so I still have I was

193
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,840
able to repair my damaged original galago now it's slightly damaged still so we can

194
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:28,620
take this a grain of salt my subjective analysis is that the fan on the non-high dpi new galaco

195
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:36,320
comes up much less frequently that makes sense but it does come up oh and the battery life

196
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:47,800
while being better is not like macbook good or macbook pro good it's it's good enough

197
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:55,360
right that's what I would say I follow that's a little disappointing but I follow it yeah

198
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,760
it's I'm happy with the machine I'm not in love with it you know if I put it against

199
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,860
my 50 I mean it's unfair to put it against my 15 inch macbook pro with a designated graphics

200
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:15,340
card but it like it's weird it has a better keyboard for sure but the battery life definitely

201
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:20,880
suffers and I was wondering so would you say so I know you you kind of you bought a pretty

202
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,560
reasonable one for me because I would want some storage for multiple distros and stuff

203
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:33,640
like that for me in fact that price is mine like a 2161 dollars do you feel like that's

204
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,560
a fair price for the rig would you would you spend that kind of money on it for more storage

205
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:48,640
and an i7 it has the i7 with 32 gigs of ram is that is it a 2100 computer it I think it

206
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,960
is it so so this is a you're getting to a fundamental problem I'm having of should laptops

207
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:05,920
be a main development computer or not and what I'm realizing is you know maybe Mac versus

208
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:13,120
Linux is not that important I mean Windows is garbage because it's Windows but I'm just

209
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:21,160
kidding folks like let me give you an example I put like right now I'm broadcasting on my

210
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:30,200
MacBook Pro right the minute I plug it into my monitor eight down clocks so and I mostly

211
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,600
work in clamshell mode plugged into a monitor or monitor mode using the laptop screen as

212
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:42,080
a second monitor it and that's not a Mac problem at most computers do that I think the Gallego

213
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:49,320
will do that so is that a reasonable computer I guess if you intend to use it as a laptop

214
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:55,560
but I would almost question and more question myself than you do you need does your portable

215
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:03,400
computer need to be that powerful like have we approached this question in the wrong way

216
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,440
I think the assumptions always been more powers better see battery life is becoming a bigger

217
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,200
and bigger issue for me I feel like my dual core XPS 13 is way too slow these days web

218
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,120
pages are not loading fast enough electron apps are too laggy like a booth still fine

219
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,600
shuts down super fast like the disk seems fine like doing updates packages installing

220
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,640
all perfectly fine but I do feel like I'm getting leg in the UI on both Chrome and Firefox

221
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,560
a lot more these days to the point where sometimes it makes it a little annoying to use and even

222
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,040
to the point where sometimes I've even seen input delay when I'm like filling out a form

223
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,120
or something like that so that is not fast enough and so that's why I've decided to get

224
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:52,120
a ThinkPad T 480 myself it's ordered now it is ordered and I think it's gonna take him

225
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,640
like three weeks to make it because it's a custom order and that's gonna be a 14 inch

226
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,360
screen but with you know pretty high-end components because I was trying to get the most out of

227
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,920
this XPS 13 I could but it really has just felt too slow and because I'm pushing it so

228
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,040
often the fan has been going so much now that it sounds like that the fans starting to grind

229
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,920
like the fans going out it's only got one fan in it so if it goes I don't know what's

230
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,560
gonna happen that's that so that was sort of my threshold you know I didn't have like

231
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,340
a like a metric I was trying to figure out a metric to measure some benchmarks or something

232
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,340
that I could get some data around and I couldn't I never got there even on unplugged I asked

233
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,680
the audience I'm like what do you guys use like what tools and I talked about open benchmark

234
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,280
and how you could use that but it just didn't really work it was at the end of the day I'm

235
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,800
like this computer just doesn't feel fast enough I'm waiting around too often for this

236
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,440
computer and then part of it is because the web applications the damn electron and web

237
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,740
apps have just gotten bigger and I'm not really doing anything different other than just running

238
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:03,200
more complex online applications it's yeah so I and yeah so that I went with the t480

239
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,200
although I was I did consider the galago for a bit it's a it's also a great machine so

240
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,000
and I'm glad to hear that it seems like it's better overall I would be curious now how

241
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,840
Windows 10 works on that thing yeah I might have to do I mean that the problem I'm facing

242
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,280
is my dogs also hate the cute they're barking at you right now yeah like I don't want to

243
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:32,760
like badge on cue like I said last episode I have invited a rep from the cute company

244
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:40,840
come on and they have not responded I there is no reason I should be doing major WPF

245
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:47,840
done that development other than as a small business I can't afford their license right

246
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,640
they sort of forced your hand on what tool you're going right they gave me no choice

247
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,240
because I'm already married to the show we talked about it I think last episode in Utah

248
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:05,460
or was it this episode I have no idea in my sadness with their water down there yeah it

249
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:12,520
it seems weird to me that we don't have a first class completely open source Windows

250
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,240
slash Linux cross platform software development platform well I guess we do supposedly it's

251
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,360
just not the one you wanted it's the hero you needed but not the one you wanted which

252
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,280
one is it that I want done well you wanted to use cute but dotnet is offering you a solution

253
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,000
it's just not the one well and this is the irony and this is where I want to take this

254
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,040
conversation ironically the Xamarin right now you can compile to GTK sharp and one on

255
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:44,240
Linux yes right right so the answer to my question is actually dotnet yeah it feels

256
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:52,320
weird like it feels like a cringe you know I get a little nauseous it feels it feels

257
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,080
odd because I think about Q and I think that's like so you know that's the KDE project that's

258
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,600
in the Linux ecosystem but it turns out that they're like more hostile to a small development

259
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:11,240
shop that wants to be Linux focused then Microsoft which is like weird you know so I'll pick

260
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,240
up on that a sec but I'll say this just as an aside is I have always heard rumblings

261
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,160
of the licensing around cute it's really strange it's something you'd look into it's a concern

262
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,880
and I never really got any specifics on it until this event and I think I think so I

263
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,520
know it I know this it has a rep but it's really always been very vague and it turns

264
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,660
out you don't really find out let me take it for you exciting and there are two types

265
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,040
of licenses there's a straight commercial where you pay per developer which is expensive

266
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,000
but kind of reasonable it's like taking a merchant advance loan it's really expensive

267
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,400
but you get how they got there yeah the problem I hit is that they felt and I was cringing

268
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,920
at the developer license is that they felt what we were doing and I'll in a few weeks

269
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:04,440
so I'll be talking about the product on the show they considered it an embedded product

270
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,680
even though it's running on you know straight Debian and straight Windows 10 they considered

271
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:17,840
it an embedded product which they have a per unit license fee plus an initial cost which

272
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,120
was completely unsustainable for sure and they considered using it in this manner was

273
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:30,040
an obvious violation of the LG PL no matter how we do so that okay that does that does

274
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,600
clear it up so that that left us and it because people have been tweeting at me that left

275
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,280
me in a position of if I went forward and just like a sort of the LG PL yeah you know

276
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,160
I can't go to court against Q right in win because I don't I just don't have the capital

277
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,800
I just don't have enough money my whole product that I've been working on for months would

278
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:54,000
be open source and I would just like not be able to sell it philosophy aside that's just

279
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,320
not the model I'm working on yeah yeah so yeah I mean if that I mean feel free to ask

280
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,160
any questions you want Chris I mean that but that's like the long and short of it well

281
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,100
I'll do this let's take a moment and thank digital ocean and then I'll come back and

282
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:12,520
ask do dot co slash coder that's where you go to sign up for a $100 free credit for new

283
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,360
accounts over digital ocean and then you can try out the platform for 60 days with that

284
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,760
$100 credit try out one of their mix and match droplets where you can set up the different

285
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,200
resources that you need for your specific application one of their high CPU or high

286
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,520
memory droplets that's why over a million developers trust digital ocean because they

287
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,400
make it so easy and so quick to get started which means you go from hey I got an idea

288
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,520
to it's actually up on the web and ready to test in five minutes and that kind of compression

289
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,060
of time means you actually get to do it you actually get to try it and you build momentum

290
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,920
so quickly with these projects it really makes the difference and you can get started with

291
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,200
a $100 credit at do dot co slash coder they have industry leading price to performance

292
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,920
an example my favorite rig three cents an hour beautiful four gigs of RAM two CPUs 80

293
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,520
gigabytes of enterprise grade SSD three terabytes of transfer and you can get it going in less

294
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,480
than 55 seconds you can do an entire deployment of an application stack or you can just deploy

295
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,160
the base system and get started plus they have a lot of really good documentation to

296
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,020
help you get even further with digital ocean just a couple of days ago they posted how

297
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:23,160
to use node.js and github webhooks to keep your remote projects in sync you could get

298
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,980
this running on a digital ocean droplet take care of this for you and man this is nice

299
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,680
looking and one of the beautiful things about digital ocean just real gorgeous number all

300
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,080
over there is their tutorials really well crafted well put together not only I mean

301
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,600
not just from like a structure standpoint but from a formatting standpoint to to really

302
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,840
make it clear this is code this is something that needs to go to config file and then it's

303
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,560
all itemized out to it's the best documentation on the web so try it all out by going to do

304
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:57,020
dot co slash coder and a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the coder radio

305
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,360
program so I guess my question to you is this how big of an oh shit moment did you have

306
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:08,000
when all this math comes to okay this is why I bought the galago shit now I can't use that

307
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,980
oh crap we've already committed to present at this show in Utah and now that the demo

308
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:18,600
app that we have built we can't use and we got to come up with something else and we

309
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,880
have a couple of weeks to do it like how big of an oh shit moment was that for you let's

310
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,800
just say those those boxers will never see the light of a lot of poo came out yeah it

311
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:36,860
was a bad situation I mean and it was yeah oh man that must have been a really stressful

312
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:42,200
couple of days I imagine it was rough I'm sorry dude I can only cheese and my coder

313
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:50,440
therapy sessions were canceled I know right right so it was but the whole application

314
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:56,340
got rewritten and it's frankly done now in dot net so you bet how much writing of dot

315
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:05,560
net have you been doing on Linux itself some okay a little bit so how much so just a little

316
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:12,760
bit well so like back in logic is back in logic right the the places where you get into

317
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:22,800
trouble is the user interface I imagine that is very much the case actually yeah yeah yeah

318
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:29,920
so like yeah so you you tease me with some large-scale WPF development I'm assuming then

319
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,520
that this is all part of this this is part of this yes the application it's a WPF application

320
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:43,800
which you know we had platform UNO on a few weeks ago they do not currently support WPF

321
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,520
the irony though is in parallel to all of this Xamarin the little the little busy bees

322
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,640
over there have been working on a GTK sharp compile point and a WPF file point compile

323
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:05,480
point rather so this may all be able to be rectified by simply refactoring a bit from

324
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:12,360
WPF native to Xamarin okay that's not like you know it's not terrible yeah it's not like

325
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,640
writing yeah that's that's recoverable you know this is another way to put that the C

326
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:23,320
sharp code goes into the garbage I mean start the C++ code from Q has already gone into

327
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:30,720
the garbage which is kind of disappointing I think I hear your MacBook over there working

328
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,360
hard right now my MacBooks real upset you're not running Windows on that thing are you

329
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:44,520
I'm not it's just running Firefox and Chrome one Chrome tab like I hate I hate computers

330
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,920
right now I can't even you know all I have to say all laptops kind of suck right now

331
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:54,360
yeah yeah it's the best machine is the machine down on the on the floor with a monitor and

332
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,720
keyboard like attached to it yeah I have to say it's you know I know system 76 supposedly

333
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,520
is coming out with a desktop their manufacturing Colorado yeah Apple in 2019 may or may not

334
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,720
have a Mac Pro right I think those are gonna be the two machines I looked at I'm just getting

335
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,880
real tired of worrying about thermals I mean yeah yeah battery life and just you know what

336
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,560
like get a Chromebook get 12 hours of battery life and that's your expectation I just I'm

337
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,600
so there and maybe this will finally solve our problems that we've been having with these

338
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,560
things like I'm here recording I'm thinking to myself you know I my best machines in the

339
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:33,120
studio have been these desktops because they last for like five or six years to running

340
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,300
24-7 laptops don't hold up to that and these things never get a break they're always going

341
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,120
they're always on always ready to record and they're still great they're still reliable

342
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:49,000
and they still feel fast no I I I I mean my laptop dream and I can hear my fan through

343
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,820
my headphones I can hear and it's a Mac it's not even the Galaga yeah I can't even say

344
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,240
it's like I know has a bad thing it's the fricking MacBook yeah yeah it's that Chrome

345
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,220
tab the Chrome tab eats up the CPU it's the one tab I'm running with you to do the show

346
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:10,520
right like yep yeah it's there's there's so much wrong with the way things are right now

347
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,880
I don't know no but but at all all kidding aside right like I am deeply disappointed

348
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:22,120
that the that the stuff with Q didn't work out yeah man I could only imagine like I mean

349
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,600
you got you know not only do you have like this this like like the sensation oh man I

350
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,480
bet on the wrong horse but also like now you got it you got to do this whole like what

351
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,080
are we gonna do now how long did it take for you to sort of refactor was it was it was

352
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,000
it a was it sort of an a B thing as in well we have no other choice but this or was there

353
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,120
some sitting around thinking what do we do can we LDL this thing can we there was it

354
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,880
yeah there there so a lot of things happen in parallel there was an initial version of

355
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,840
this written in Xamarin actually ah okay and it was well do we just do we just embrace

356
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,520
Xamarin right it's a Marion whatever you want to call it right that that got effectively

357
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:09,320
vetoed by me because splitting average garbage yeah right like well Xamarin is not garbage

358
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:15,960
I take it back but like Xamarin for the high performance error space use case is a tough

359
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:25,240
choice right now so we ended up going with WPF taking some of the C sharp logic over

360
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:31,000
for the Xamarin version and that was purely a practical decision of our potential end

361
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,960
customers in this industry ultimately while they're moving to Linux they ultimately initially

362
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:43,280
care about Windows and WPF is a technology like we looked at Avalon rather Avalon UI

363
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:49,960
which is an open source UI project to bring a UWP to all the platforms we looked at platform

364
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:56,540
Uno but ultimately as a small company working in a big space I felt that I very strongly

365
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,960
that I need to mitigate the fear right to sell our product come back to the mic come

366
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:07,120
back to the mic so yeah you fear of the team or fear of the customer fear of the customer

367
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,620
right okay so the customer look at that sideways and go what the hell is this right so we ended

368
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:19,120
up rewriting the UI and WPF ah so to make it safer essentially to the customer nobody

369
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:27,360
gets fired for buying a WPF app right oh man that's true yeah so we ended up going in that

370
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:38,320
direction huh seems pretty rational it seems sad yeah a compromise I would have preferred

371
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:47,160
to even go UWP to be honest you know I feel like in some way not that this is the double

372
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:54,200
episode of picking on Q but Q is somehow like ignoring a market that would be willing to

373
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,640
pay them several hundred dollars a month yeah I have also heard that sentiment from others

374
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,920
yeah like I would have been much happier coming on the show today and saying we are a Linux

375
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:12,120
shop we're running C++ yes we cross compile to the windows and yes we you know 90 percent

376
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:17,760
of our customers are using Windows devices but you know we're a Linux shop but in reality

377
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,680
the licensing fees were just unacceptable I'm curious as to what you've heard I've definitely

378
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:27,280
heard that they could come up with something that is way more compelling to small business

379
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,260
and solve a lot of this that is that is a sentiment I've heard from people at conferences

380
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,000
a lot where I've gotten a lot of the side by grousing that never was quite clear to

381
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,200
me until we've had our conversation I'll tell you man I'll take the liable liable suit yes

382
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:48,040
I'll tell you know things can change but it sort of doesn't matter like the window of

383
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,120
opportunity like let's just I was just thinking like maybe down the road they'll come up with

384
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,800
some sort of like small business competitive offering but because you know really the reason

385
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,360
why I think that'd be great is cute is stronger as a platform the more of it that is out there

386
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,680
the more the more people that are shipping cute apps the more people that are developing

387
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:13,280
cute software the larger the community though just what is the right word to put it it's

388
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,480
a it's a it's there's a tangible benefit that's probably the way to put it there's a real

389
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,080
tangible benefit to the cute company for more people to be shipping cute apps so it would

390
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,920
seem like if the opportunity came up for them to say okay here's a small business here's

391
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,720
a small business package that would be a very compelling offering that would probably get

392
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,000
a lot of traction but it's it's too little too late for you isn't it well it's a done

393
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,200
deal right I mean I I'm going to demo the software in a week and a half now and we're

394
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,960
by the time this is on the RSS feed probably less than a week so it's yeah I mean we're

395
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,640
married to dotnet we're married to C sharp you're already going to the event as far as

396
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,840
it's concerned really I mean you're right I mean even if this product fails it would

397
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:02,680
be hard for us to go to Q and and frankly I think this product is going to do okay well

398
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,000
I hope so that sounds from what I've heard off air it sounds pretty cool I'll take a

399
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,480
moment and I want to thank Linux Academy they have something really cool going on starting

417
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:42,000
for sponsoring this here program so if you ever you ever fantasize about like what if

418
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,920
you're in a totally different field and I have yeah yeah what's yours what would be

419
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:55,200
your like if like you know a universe be version of Mike that never becomes a developer you

420
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,080
know what would your teacher school teacher school teacher poetry wow school I could do

421
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:06,560
teaching definitely I I feel like I worry for me that it'd be something like sales you

422
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,400
know like I get into sales or something because I think you do have that voice yeah I sell

423
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,600
yeah yeah yeah you're a seller that's so I mean it would just be horrible like no offense

424
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,440
to salesman because a good salesman is a very valuable thing no a lot of offense to salesman

425
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,940
cause I have not yet to meet a good one keep going you're talking to one no I'm telling

426
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,840
you like I worry that's what it would be but I think it'd be like a like a used car salesman

427
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:35,120
or something horrible if I had a fantasy we're like it would never work out it would be running

428
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:41,480
my own barbecue you know like a like a hole in the wall slow-cooked pit barbecue where

429
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:47,840
I just have a like a stable customer base that comes in on the weekdays for lunch and

430
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,320
I only serve lunch and dinner and then and then maybe start doing a little breakfast

431
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,960
do you have a liquor license I mean I think I do in this fantasy yeah well then I'm there

432
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,660
baby I'm your best customer I think I would I think I would run a pretty good barbecue

433
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,000
place I'd only have a few things at first you know keep it real focused real narrow

434
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,560
and nail those products that's my fantasy but I got to tell you I think the reality

435
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:15,960
is I'd be I'd be like a software engineer sales lead or something it's like the worst

436
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,880
job on the planet because I already went into IT so I've got to avoid that but you know

437
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,240
and I'm already in broadcasting now and so I got to avoid that so it'd have to be I mean

438
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,080
that's you know that's a couple of that's a couple of my go-tos that I can't choose

439
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:33,760
from so you could tell us audience what you think our alternative universe careers are

440
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,160
by going to coder.show slash contact and if you got a good one I'll try to read it on

441
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,160
a future episode of the Coder Radio program our record schedule is gonna be a little funky

442
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,320
for the next bit because you heard their mics traveling and doing this thing and it's a

443
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,560
long event and he's gonna be gone for a bit so when we get an opportunity we'll do some

444
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,840
doubles and we'll keep the feed going so go to coder.show slash subscribe for all the

445
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,160
ways to get new episodes.

446
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,760
Now before we wrap do you have any like tools or like tool chain stuff you want to cover

447
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,040
because we always tend to do that when we do these doubles any new I mean we mentioned

448
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,360
scoop last week so we can't use that mentioned scoop last week any tools you've been working

449
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,920
with in this process or anything like that yeah kind of so geez I don't even know if

450
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,080
I want to mention this but I took a quick look at a oh geez what did get pod or oh yeah

451
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:25,520
get pod.io that's what it is I'll drop a link in the show notes yeah drop a link they're

452
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,800
in beta yet yeah I've heard about this yeah they're one of these cloud IDEs and I looked

453
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,320
at it in the content let me give you some context again I have an 11 year old brother

454
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,240
now and I and he's interested in learning coding so you know but he's in New Jersey

455
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:46,640
I'm in Florida so you know there's some challenge there right like working with him on assignments

456
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,880
this is a cloud IDE that integrates directly with github it seems pretty powerful I've

457
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,320
played with it some it reminds me a lot of remember cloud nine we featured a few years

458
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:03,640
ago yes yeah it seems like a cloud nine on steroids the catch here is they only support

459
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:11,960
so many languages okay very few actually so javascript java python go php rust ruby

460
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:21,040
c and c++ json docker and obviously html and c it says they don't support much else but

461
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,720
they they directly tie into a github get flow workflow yeah that's like their key feature

462
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,160
really yeah so so to me I mean this is not how they build themselves and I would love

463
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,880
to have someone from get pod on the show to explain it to me but to me this is the ultimate

464
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:43,280
teaching tool for a oh you know a child like like my brother sure huh yeah so it's it's

465
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,160
it's tightly integrated with github it's where you start actually with this you have to use

466
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,240
get up right it's it's you have no choice yeah and then they have an enterprise version

467
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,920
that you can host yourself but that's you know this is pretty cool though how's the

468
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,400
how's the ui all that stuff it's pretty usable you know it reminds me of vs code like it's

469
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:06,360
okay honestly i we've experienced some latency issues my brother is running a older macbook

470
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:15,280
that i gave him uh like a 20 oh geez let's say a 2014 macbook pro 13 inch uh with a kick

471
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,920
as a ram but you know he i give him my hand me down he's doing like it works for him fine

472
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,080
yeah he's right you know he's right you know how you mean you remember kids right i'm sure

473
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,760
you have dylan you know they're writing their little games right whatever it's you know

474
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,080
yep yeah yeah they're fine with it his laptop is not a performance machine at all and he's

475
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,400
fine with it i mean yeah i'm sure as he gets older he'll want something faster but yeah

476
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,000
this is nice and so it's got an integrated chat too and it makes it yeah it doesn't make

477
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,320
it clear who's working on what portion and whatnot it does i find it works significantly

478
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,720
better in chrome than firefly uh-huh i've had a few of the little yeah which is a little

479
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,880
annoying to me but other than that it's it's a uh i mean it's pretty powerful my brother

480
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,560
and i like i can't speak to the go support or the java support we've been working mostly

481
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:08,280
in ecma script slash javascript um but yeah and also it supports python so any of the

482
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,840
other parents out there i know 99.99 percent of our listeners are um frankly corrupted

483
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:22,520
by the snake and love python so yeah does not support ruby though somehow uh oh right

484
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:31,080
it does oh oh it doesn't support it partially supports ruby yeah i have uh i have been i

485
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,160
have been using chrome more and more again because of several applications and sites

486
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,600
that i use that just seem like they slow down the firefox ui the whole browser ui gets

487
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,200
all laggy i've been having since i've been working on my mac for this wpf project because

488
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:52,000
yay visual studio for mac and vmware um i've been having stability issues in firefox because

489
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,400
of just like certain applications seem to just require chrome and and it it reminds

490
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,960
me of ie6 i don't i don't i hate saying that because it feels very old manny but i mean

491
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,120
come on chris you remember like what's best than i yeah yeah like yeah oh yeah oh yeah

492
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:14,840
i do oh yeah i do yeah i'll give you a couple of tools that i've been using just really

493
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:20,880
quickly um i guess i'll really one um but i've been using it to use multiple tools and

494
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,200
uh you may know about it but i'm going to remind you in case you've forgotten it's called

495
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:30,840
nata fire nata fire makes any web page into essentially an electron app um oh sure yeah

496
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,760
but it's great because so you know you can point nata fire mail.google.com and i can

497
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,280
have multiples with different icons and different logins and in their own individual windows

498
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,600
which i find really great for managing multiple gmail accounts or whatnot and it's just really

499
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:52,420
simple because it pulls down like their uh web app icon so you can you know you can actually

500
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:58,800
use the official logo icon for the application and it works on uh i think all the platforms

501
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,440
i mean i've obviously been using it on linux but uh i yeah their github page shows it on

502
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,080
a mac and it's nice it's simple sounds like you've probably heard of it before mike and

503
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,320
it just essentially wraps up websites and electron which i know that's everybody's favorite

504
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,920
thing but if it gets a heavily used web application out of a tab in my web browser and lets me

505
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:25,520
have my own set of credentials in that window and all of that it's a win for me so yeah

506
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,040
i'll link to that too yeah sounds yeah no that's really good in the notes it'll all

507
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,280
be a coder.show slash three two four is this which which episode is this yeah three two

508
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,200
four two four they run together yeah so i've been i've just plugged in like a few different

509
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,600
google apps into that and a couple other things that i just i find that to be intensely useful

510
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,340
there's a couple others out there we talked about another one on linux unplugged this

511
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:51,880
week but mr dominic i that was my tool um i don't really i don't really have much others

512
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,520
other than grousing about firefox which i i could do for a whole nother episode but

513
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,520
yeah i want firefox to be better than it is yeah yeah i just want it to be great because

514
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,940
i want there to be that strong competition and i want a company like mozilla to be putting

515
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,960
a product out there where their primary motivation is an open web and not commercial dominance

516
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,700
of the internet so google frankly scares me yeah yeah and their and their leverage of

517
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:22,960
chrome is one of the scarier aspects of google right now so it is a big problem oh too bad

518
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,080
it seems to i mean it just seems to work better for me and i find that intensely frustrating

519
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:33,580
i feel that way about mac os oh oh oh i'm sticking with firefox for now but when i'm

520
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:37,160
on other platforms other than linux i tend to use chrome more i don't know all right

521
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,320
mr dominic uh give somebody something else to go get if they want a little more mic in

522
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:46,600
their life during the week uh go to add to my twitter and at the mad butter.com hey how

523
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:52,300
about that you can follow me i'm at chris las the whole network is at jupiter signal

524
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,160
and of course we have the subreddit coderadio.reddit.com try to check that before each episode and

525
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:13,320
our main show site at coder.show thanks for being here see you next week
