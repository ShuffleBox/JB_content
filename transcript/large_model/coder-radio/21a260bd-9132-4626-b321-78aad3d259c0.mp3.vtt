00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
This is Koto Radio, episode 326 for September 21st, 2018.

00:30.560 --> 00:34.480
Hi everyone, and welcome to Koto Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:34.480 --> 00:37.920
taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development

00:37.920 --> 00:42.560
and its related technologies. My name is Chris, we have no sponsors anymore,

00:42.560 --> 00:45.440
so I'll bring in our host, that man established down in the bayou,

00:46.080 --> 00:48.240
well at least in Florida, it's Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike!

00:48.960 --> 00:53.440
Well good afternoon and welcome back from death, Mr. Vice President.

00:55.040 --> 00:57.360
Thank you, although making me laugh actually hurts, so...

00:57.360 --> 00:59.040
Whoops, this...

00:59.040 --> 01:03.280
It's good to be back. Yeah, this is my first coder since I wound up in the hospital.

01:03.840 --> 01:07.440
Quick version, had appendicitis, didn't realize it for three weeks,

01:07.440 --> 01:11.040
thought I could just push through it like an idiot, stopped by the ER

01:11.040 --> 01:14.160
after things started getting rough, they didn't catch it, they said I was clear

01:14.160 --> 01:19.920
to fly down to Texas. I fly down to Texas to seal the deal on all the business arrangement stuff,

01:19.920 --> 01:23.120
my appendix ruptures, I end up in the hospital for a week,

01:23.120 --> 01:27.680
Wes fills in like a gentleman, and now I'm back for an excellent edition

01:27.680 --> 01:32.480
of the Coder Radio Program, perhaps the most excellent edition of the Coder Radio Program.

01:33.280 --> 01:38.240
You had some issues going on earlier this week too, so we couldn't do our Monday recording,

01:38.240 --> 01:41.600
I apologize to everybody, but it's good to be back, Mr. Dominic.

01:41.600 --> 01:46.800
I've been looking forward to it all week, I ordered three HomePods while we were gone,

01:46.800 --> 01:49.200
no I'm kidding, I did not order any. Did you color coordinate, or is it like

01:49.200 --> 01:52.400
two black, one white, we have to know. I would go all, I think I would go with

01:52.400 --> 01:55.440
all one color if I was going to be a multi-HomePod home, but I'm just kidding,

01:55.440 --> 02:00.000
no HomePods were ordered. Did get the new phone, I did,

02:00.000 --> 02:06.560
because I'm on the upgrade program, so I could pay $55 a month, which includes the

02:06.560 --> 02:11.600
higher storage tier, AppleCare Plus, and the phone, and I could do that for the X,

02:11.600 --> 02:14.960
or I could just do that for the XS too, so I just, a little underwhelmed,

02:14.960 --> 02:17.040
but I decided to pull the trigger and do the upgrade.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.760
So it should have been here yesterday, but there was a UPS snafu.

02:19.760 --> 02:23.120
So instead, I figured we'd just have a nice traditional show and just avoid talking about

02:23.120 --> 02:26.480
the whole topic altogether, what do you say? Yeah, because there's really nothing to say.

02:26.480 --> 02:31.120
There really isn't. Well, let's start with L-Feedback, which I like this one,

02:31.120 --> 02:35.120
comes in from Wyatt of Vulkan, and he says, hey Chris and Mike, I thought about passing

02:35.120 --> 02:37.920
this article along to you guys to talk about on the show, it's an interesting read,

02:37.920 --> 02:43.200
especially if one is a 3D or graphics programmer. Even though I'm not either of those two,

02:43.200 --> 02:47.280
I believe Vulkan is the future of 3D and graphics programming.

02:47.280 --> 02:52.000
I think having a memory model, which is the link that he just introduced to us, is a big deal.

02:52.800 --> 02:58.960
So the group behind Vulkan is called the Khronos Group, and they've recently announced,

02:58.960 --> 03:03.440
I think it was September 13th, a memory model or a memory consistency model,

03:03.440 --> 03:08.160
which for a programming language describes how threads in a parallel processing system

03:08.160 --> 03:12.960
could access shared data and synchronize with each other while allowing compilers and the hardware

03:12.960 --> 03:20.160
the freedom to reorder and optimize memory access. They do this by precisely specifying

03:20.160 --> 03:26.400
where and how instructions and memory operations can be reordered, and what the order effect of

03:26.400 --> 03:31.440
those memory operations can become, and if they can be visible or not to other threads as well.

03:32.640 --> 03:38.160
So, you know, memory models, I think probably the audience is familiar with that. They're, I guess,

03:38.160 --> 03:43.840
in the grand scheme of things, semi-new, but not really. But there really hasn't been anything like

03:43.840 --> 03:51.920
this for GPUs and a graphics API. So that's the big story here, is on the 13th, Vulkan has become

03:51.920 --> 03:58.400
the world's first graphics API to include a formal memory model for its associated programming

03:58.400 --> 04:03.200
languages. They label it as a significant announcement, and I've been hearing from people

04:03.200 --> 04:06.800
in the audience throughout the week that they think it's kind of a big deal. And so what they

04:06.800 --> 04:11.920
think is kind of a big deal. And so Wyatt passes this along to us, and he asks us the question,

04:11.920 --> 04:19.200
with Vulkan having universal support on Windows, Linux, and Android, and now with this introduction

04:19.200 --> 04:25.520
of a memory model, is this the future? And where does that leave the Apple platforms? What do you

04:25.520 --> 04:30.960
think? It's very odd now. I guess we could see a, and maybe there already is, I'll have to look,

04:30.960 --> 04:37.120
a Vulkan to Metal translation layer or something. I'll look that up. But what do you think about

04:37.120 --> 04:42.480
Vulkan in the future for a 3D graphics API? Is it going to be all Vulkan?

04:43.600 --> 04:47.520
Well, I don't think it's going to be all anything, right? Vulkan is definitely,

04:48.960 --> 04:52.240
it's definitely looking more and more impressive. The problem is,

04:53.920 --> 04:57.200
you know, when we're thinking about graphics programming, we're probably in most cases going

04:57.200 --> 05:03.280
to be thinking about game development. And you just, most people don't directly program to the

05:03.280 --> 05:10.160
graphics API, right? They use something like Unity, or Cocos 2D, or I'm dating myself here,

05:10.160 --> 05:16.400
Torque 2D, Torque 3D, or if you have money on Unreal Engine, that under the hood translates

05:16.400 --> 05:24.800
into Vulkan Metal, or, you know, the OpenGL, or DirectX on Windows. I would prefer that you

05:24.800 --> 05:29.360
be correct, that Vulkan be, because Vulkan is more, like, Metal is not an open standard. Metal

05:29.360 --> 05:32.320
is a completely proprietary Apple thing. Same with DirectX.

05:33.760 --> 05:41.040
Yeah, but I mean, who cares about DirectX anymore? Whoops. They're both impressive. I tend to think

05:41.040 --> 05:46.800
that the trend of history is towards more open source and open platform is winning. I would

05:46.800 --> 05:54.640
wager that Vulkan will definitely be substantial. My only hesitation on that is, Apple is weirdly

05:54.640 --> 06:02.400
stubborn when it comes to adopting other people's standards. So, they could literally just, like,

06:02.400 --> 06:08.960
not allow it on iOS. They're super stubborn until they just do it, like, with the Qi charging,

06:08.960 --> 06:12.720
or using NFC for Apple Pay. Like, every now and then they just go, like, yeah, all right,

06:12.720 --> 06:19.040
we'll just do the industry standard thing. Yeah, it's when their alternative proprietary

06:19.040 --> 06:23.920
standard fails, they go to the open standard. So, yeah, no, I think Vulkan's awesome.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.920
It does look like there's, and we've actually mentioned on the show before, but I just,

06:27.920 --> 06:34.640
we don't talk about it enough, MoltenVK, which is a runtime that maps Vulkan to Apple's Metal

06:34.640 --> 06:40.880
Graphics Framework for iOS and macOS. And it is available as a free open source project on GitHub.

06:40.880 --> 06:48.560
So, you have MoltenVK, MoltenVK, and there's also MoltenGL, which is an implementation of OpenGL ES

06:48.560 --> 06:54.160
2.0 API for the Metal Graphics Framework, which would probably be more predominant on iOS.

06:54.160 --> 06:59.200
But that is actually kind of encouraging, because then that means you can still essentially use

06:59.200 --> 07:04.960
Vulkan on the Apple platforms, and that might seal the deal for the Macs and the iOS devices.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.720
Yeah, I mean, but isn't it just a translation layer?

07:10.720 --> 07:14.800
It's not, yeah. They use the term runtime that maps the calls, is the term that they're using.

07:14.800 --> 07:19.280
Right, so it's almost like a wine sort of situation, right? You're,

07:19.840 --> 07:23.040
at the end of the day, you're actually calling the Metal APIs.

07:23.040 --> 07:27.200
Right, the translation proxy or agent, whatever you want to call it is.

07:27.840 --> 07:32.320
Jonathan writes in, he thinks he's found something rotten. He says, I'm a new developer,

07:33.360 --> 07:38.480
I'm a new developer in, and they're trying me out as a contractor. You know, I think these are kind

07:38.480 --> 07:43.840
of common. You start a job, the nine month, six month contract, maybe even a year, everything was

07:43.840 --> 07:49.520
good until I got access to work on their Linux boxes. I got an Excel sheet of all the usernames

07:49.520 --> 07:54.960
and password, and I felt sick when I got that. But I got really sick, yeah, I got really sick

07:54.960 --> 08:01.680
when I saw the boxes that I'll be working on still had Linux kernel 2.6. It's a classic.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.320
I went to my team lead and was told that if the client does not want to pay for upgrades,

08:06.320 --> 08:12.640
then they do not get the upgrades. What is the best way for me to tell my team, my lead,

08:12.640 --> 08:17.920
my boss or my department why and how bad of an idea this is?

08:21.440 --> 08:28.000
Oh boy, Jonathan, you know, I feel like he's asking the wrong question

08:28.000 --> 08:31.360
to tell you the truth. I think the question he should be asking is, should I care?

08:33.280 --> 08:39.840
I know we all care. We care when things are not secure, when people are mismanaging technology,

08:39.840 --> 08:44.800
when infrastructure is weak, we care. It goes against the hacker ethos. You're supposed to

08:44.800 --> 08:51.920
take care of this stuff. You are a steward of this stuff. These machines are Jonathan's flock,

08:51.920 --> 08:59.600
and his flock is sick and unprotected, and it bothers him quite a bit. The thing is, Jonathan,

08:59.600 --> 09:05.520
is this is how it is in every single company you will ever work at for your entire life.

09:05.520 --> 09:12.480
Yeah, it really, I mean, although this is pretty extreme. I definitely agree,

09:12.480 --> 09:16.640
except there's one thing that's kind of stuck in my craw about it. He said he's a contractor.

09:18.640 --> 09:24.800
If he was an employee, he wouldn't be liable. There is such a thing as malpractice for what

09:24.800 --> 09:31.200
we all do here. That's why people spend money on errors and omissions insurance. In fact,

09:31.200 --> 09:38.560
some companies actually just call it malpractice insurance. I would argue, and I'm not an attorney,

09:38.560 --> 09:44.560
so I don't know where you're, because we're not regular engineers, but I definitely do think you

09:44.560 --> 09:52.000
have a duty to raise an objection. If you get shut down, you get shut down. If they just say,

09:52.000 --> 09:58.240
well, no, we don't care, then so be it. I don't know. This feels really bad.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.720
It's a bad situation.

10:00.720 --> 10:05.360
It depends on what the system is. If there is any kind of mission critical data or

10:05.360 --> 10:12.080
confidential customer data or employee data, now there is real concern there.

10:12.960 --> 10:19.280
Here's what I would advise Jonathan does is I would try to look at this in two ways. First

10:19.280 --> 10:25.120
of all, like Mike said, it might be worth covering your own ass, and you can do that with notes.

10:25.120 --> 10:29.280
Start taking notes. I don't care if you handwrite them. I don't care if you type them.

10:29.280 --> 10:33.760
Start keeping notes of what you discover and who you've talked to about it and your thoughts at

10:33.760 --> 10:40.160
the time about the risk. Date it. Make sure that's clear, that it's timestamped. That is one great

10:40.160 --> 10:44.400
way to cover your own ass. Now here's the next thing I would do, though. I would come to them

10:44.400 --> 10:50.000
with a solution and not a problem, because if we're talking a largish infrastructure at this

10:50.000 --> 10:56.320
point, the task of bringing all of those systems up to date, fixing the incompatibilities that arise

10:56.320 --> 11:01.680
from the changes, working with the vendors perhaps for whatever reason that might be slowing down the

11:01.680 --> 11:06.640
progress of updates, educating the clients on why it's a good idea, selling it to them, because

11:06.640 --> 11:11.680
they're going to have to be sold on the idea of spending money. And I've done that a lot.

11:11.680 --> 11:16.560
Nobody likes to be told about maintenance costs, so you have to sell it in a way that talks about

11:16.560 --> 11:22.640
keeping things secure, more stable, long-term, sustainable. You have to use phrases like that.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.160
Not, hey, we got to go fix this thing on this box because it's what needs to be done.

11:26.160 --> 11:32.000
It doesn't work as well. So come to the management and your team, or your department heads, whatever,

11:32.000 --> 11:37.520
with a solution. Maybe a suggested plan of action, even if it's not complete. Come to them with

11:37.520 --> 11:42.720
something that solves the problem. Don't bring a big problem to them. You'll probably get more

11:42.720 --> 11:48.320
traction with that. You combine that with keeping good notes to cover your arse, recommending best

11:48.320 --> 11:54.320
practices in those notes, and also try to create a dialogue where perhaps you can triage this thing

11:54.320 --> 11:57.920
or something. Think about what is going to be most comfortable for your organization, and then come

11:57.920 --> 12:01.360
to them with that solution. That's probably the best you can do, Jonathan.

12:01.360 --> 12:09.440
Yeah. I mean, one line of argument that has helped me in similar situations is an analogy to

12:09.440 --> 12:13.120
physical health, right? Like, try to get them to understand that-

12:13.120 --> 12:14.320
It's a hygiene issue.

12:14.320 --> 12:20.320
Hygiene. It's hygiene. What you're suggesting is that they brush their teeth, floss, and don't eat

12:20.320 --> 12:27.600
candy all day. And if that is annoying, whatever, but the cost of losing your teeth, it could be

12:27.600 --> 12:31.840
anything, right? It could be being a fat guy like me and taking a heart attack, right? Just whatever.

12:31.840 --> 12:37.680
Tell them that there's these little costs that have to happen all the time are just like dental

12:37.680 --> 12:41.360
or physical maintenance, or even maintenance on a car, if you prefer not to mention health.

12:41.360 --> 12:48.560
It's a big problem because it's going to be software patches, it's going to be vendor software

12:48.560 --> 12:52.960
that has to get updated, and it's going to be really solving the username and password

12:52.960 --> 12:57.600
management solution. Probably passwords haven't been rotated in a long time for some accounts.

12:57.600 --> 13:01.280
They're in a spreadsheet, which I'm sure isn't like Google Drive or SharePoint somewhere.

13:02.720 --> 13:06.160
Or just getting emailed around the office so a copy sits in each person's inbox.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.080
Oh, it's terrifying.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.680
It's like a bunch of emoji replies.

13:09.680 --> 13:16.800
Right. A bunch of thumbs up and flames. All right. So this isn't really an email from the audience,

13:16.800 --> 13:23.360
but this is follow up from a discussion we had in the episode after it was announced that Microsoft

13:23.360 --> 13:28.480
had acquired GitHub. And I think it was either myself, probably Mike, somebody said, hey,

13:28.480 --> 13:33.760
you know what's going to happen here. One of us said, this is going to get turned into a massive

13:34.400 --> 13:38.320
hiring apparatus with all of the data of contributions and the projects people work

13:38.320 --> 13:44.000
on in their social connections. Microsoft's going to use this to do basically a jobs board.

13:44.800 --> 13:51.360
Well, turns out we nailed that prediction. I mean, we called that day up. We got a couple

13:51.360 --> 14:00.800
of bills for that one. So GitHub's VP of worldwide sales, Paul St. John, was at an event and he was

14:00.800 --> 14:04.000
talking about what he's going to be talking about at the next event he's going to be at.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.280
And he was coy about the details, but his comments came after discussion about the role GitHub,

14:09.280 --> 14:15.200
having been acquired by Microsoft, plays in connecting open source developers

14:15.200 --> 14:22.720
with prospective employers. In that context, he says businesses use open source libraries and

14:22.720 --> 14:27.600
then they make applications from them and then they need someone to work on them. He goes on to

14:27.600 --> 14:33.200
say they will email people at GitHub and they will come to GitHub itself and say, quote,

14:33.200 --> 14:37.200
we need somebody to come and work on this application built off this open source library.

14:37.200 --> 14:41.760
Can you find anybody in the community that will come work on it? It happens all the time, he says.

14:43.520 --> 14:47.520
That was his response to will GitHub be a hiring platform.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.800
Recruiters are coming.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.400
Yeah. Yeah. Well, Microsoft is going to be the new recruiter. They'll be looking at

14:54.400 --> 14:58.160
what expertise you have and what other projects you have. And then when employers come,

14:58.160 --> 14:59.680
they'll sell that data to employers.

14:59.680 --> 15:04.880
And so I'm going to make a recommendation right now. Go into your GitHub profile

15:05.440 --> 15:08.240
and don't show your email address. Make sure your email is hidden.

15:08.240 --> 15:15.360
Is this I mean, is this necessarily bad? Maybe this is the way to do it.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.680
It's totally bad. It's going to be terrible.

15:17.680 --> 15:22.000
Because it because it means people start gaming GitHub or like, what's your concern? Because

15:22.000 --> 15:25.600
to me, it seems like maybe it would be matching the right candidates with the right business.

15:25.600 --> 15:33.520
My concern is your see, ideally, if it was like, you know, you know, ACME company needs to hire a

15:33.520 --> 15:34.400
a Django developer.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.440
Yeah, I mean, here's an example. Yeah. His example, let's say they build some big

15:38.400 --> 15:40.960
some big applications dependent on that framework.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.240
That's like not what's going to happen.

15:42.240 --> 15:42.720
No.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.520
Right. So, you know, he says it happens all the time.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.680
No, he's a VP.

15:47.680 --> 15:53.360
Hey, now, I'm no offense to present company. But, you know, I'm just thinking of a few other

15:53.360 --> 15:56.400
VPs in the world, you know, wasn't Nixon a VP at one point?

15:56.400 --> 16:00.640
Oh, man. Is this a Pence joke? Is this a long Pence joke? Is that we're going here?

16:02.080 --> 16:06.000
You know, sometimes I think Mike Pence is waiting for me to get fired and take my job.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.320
I'm just always around. No.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.040
Jackass.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.840
Oh, Barack. I miss you. Although I really don't.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.080
Oh, he'll be back.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.280
Okay. Oh, just like Dracula.

16:19.280 --> 16:23.760
So when Stack Overflow first added their developer profile thing that they've now called

16:24.560 --> 16:28.320
careers of Stack Overflow, they did this. This is we're going back. We're going back in time.

16:28.320 --> 16:28.820
Okay.

16:29.520 --> 16:35.920
They allowed you to put contact information on there. And what immediately happened was

16:36.720 --> 16:45.520
one brave Borg like recruiter found it and the spam did not stop. It's not going to be

16:45.520 --> 16:49.840
Linux Academy is looking to hire somebody on GitHub. Of course, that may be sometimes be a thing

16:49.840 --> 16:54.800
or that, you know, Acme company is looking to hire somebody. It's going to be predominantly

16:55.520 --> 16:59.280
recruiters and it's going to be just a nightmare. Like I can, I,

17:00.560 --> 17:03.680
I could actually see what you're saying. Definitely. The companies will outsource it to

17:03.680 --> 17:04.180
recruiters.

17:05.040 --> 17:05.920
Well, that's what they already do.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.000
Yeah, exactly. Of course. Of course.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.600
Like some recruiters are great. Don't get me wrong. I'm not like, you know, I don't like

17:11.600 --> 17:15.680
hate recruiters, but there's like also those weird ones who call you from like across the world that

17:15.680 --> 17:18.720
are like super unethical and they'll just keep calling and calling and calling and calling.

17:20.080 --> 17:26.800
Yeah, that's not something. And also I kind of don't like it as someone who employs developers

17:26.800 --> 17:35.360
because, so now GitHub who, I mean, I'm using GitLab now, but we have some open source on GitHub

17:35.360 --> 17:42.160
is going to advertise what talents my people have to people who want to poach them.

17:42.160 --> 17:47.120
Like one of my issues is hiring people and like having them not get poached.

17:47.120 --> 17:47.620
Yes.

17:47.620 --> 17:50.720
Since I've been down here, it's poaching has been an actual real problem.

17:50.720 --> 17:54.640
I didn't realize until recently having a few conversations with a couple of different folks,

17:54.640 --> 17:59.600
how bad it's gotten. Like the person is supposed to show up for their first day of work. Oh, nope,

17:59.600 --> 18:02.240
they got a better offer because they're going to get a better job.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.600
They're supposed to show up for their first day of work. Oh, nope, they got a better offer

18:05.600 --> 18:09.280
because they can leverage the offers against each other.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.680
That's exactly what happens.

18:11.680 --> 18:17.680
You know, I mean, it's good for the employee, right? They're getting the best situation possible.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.720
It's just, we're looking at it from an owner standpoint, right? So that's our bias.

18:22.720 --> 18:27.120
Well, and like, it's really bad for small businesses because you don't, you know,

18:27.120 --> 18:32.320
have, you just don't have the perks, right? You don't have that, you know, for instance,

18:32.320 --> 18:37.120
Amazon is down here and they poach people all the time. Amazon offers people more money than

18:37.120 --> 18:38.640
actually exists in the state of Florida.

18:39.920 --> 18:43.040
Yeah. I've heard a couple of stories of Microsoft doing the same thing recently.

18:43.040 --> 18:47.360
Yeah. And they're down here too. So it's kind of like, okay, so basically take out all the top

18:47.360 --> 18:53.120
tier developers that graduate a college every year, can't hire them. And you're left with,

18:53.120 --> 18:58.000
you really end up getting creative doing things like going to events, bootcamps. But, you know,

18:58.000 --> 19:02.320
I've had recruiters and the tangent, but I just told Chris, I want you to understand now that

19:02.320 --> 19:06.160
you're a big corporate guy, you should understand recruiters are shameless.

19:07.120 --> 19:07.440
Yeah.

19:07.440 --> 19:11.520
I've had them call my office when we're all on site trying to poach someone.

19:12.480 --> 19:17.840
Wow. Yeah. You know, I have, I remember when I first started, when I was in IT still and I

19:17.840 --> 19:21.280
started getting in recruiter calls at first, I felt like it was an ego boost. Like,

19:21.280 --> 19:26.160
I'm so great. I've shown up on somebody's radar. And then that quickly fades away to frustration

19:26.160 --> 19:32.800
because it really is just, it's a bombardment. And you're right. You're right. Oh man. I was all,

19:32.800 --> 19:35.600
I was all fired up about this. Like the right candidates will be connected with the right

19:35.600 --> 19:38.240
companies, but you're right. It's just going to be a recruiting fuel.

19:39.360 --> 19:43.680
To be fair to Microsoft and GitHub, they could just like say, you know, recruiters,

19:43.680 --> 19:48.400
right? They could verify, but now we're talking about work and recruit. Yeah. And their money's

19:48.400 --> 19:53.280
green too. So. Exactly. Yeah. Plus the gift, the companies are legitimately hiring those

19:53.280 --> 19:58.320
recruiters to do the work on the behalf of the companies. That's, you know, that checks out.

19:59.120 --> 20:04.640
That's yeah. Recruiters exist for a reason, right? Like I can't say I've never used one. So.

20:04.640 --> 20:08.240
Well, you have a little bit of news. Why don't we make our own hoopla? I think since the last

20:08.240 --> 20:14.640
time you talked, you and I talked at least, you released a new product that runs on

20:14.640 --> 20:21.600
modern versions of windows and Linux. And it's not a bot. In fact, it's not even probably what

20:21.600 --> 20:29.280
people guess. It's something for essentially, unless I'm wrong, the, what's the industry

20:29.280 --> 20:35.200
called? Not the aerospace industry, but the it's, it's, it's for people flying military aviation.

20:35.200 --> 20:39.440
Yeah. Okay. There you go. Military aviation. It's a radar display platform, including tactical

20:39.440 --> 20:44.560
displays. And I don't even know what this word means. R W R like you've gone deep warning.

20:44.560 --> 20:52.240
Radar. Wow, man. You've gone deep. Real deep. So it's, it's, it's pronounced. How do you graph

20:52.240 --> 20:56.800
on? How do you pronounce it? Griffin Griffin. Oh, awesome. Griffin radar.com. If people want to

20:56.800 --> 21:02.320
learn more about it. Uh, well that's a huge congratulations. And thank you. Yeah. It's a,

21:02.320 --> 21:05.840
this is why you've been doing some of the travel recently. Yeah. That's why I've been doing some

21:05.840 --> 21:11.600
of the travel. That's why I've been so, so this, so this links to something else, by the way,

21:11.600 --> 21:16.640
if you want to check it out, go to Griffin radar.com. Um, and of course I, uh, you know,

21:16.640 --> 21:21.760
all my sites are pretty. Yeah. You do always have great sites. This is the, and this is something

21:21.760 --> 21:26.960
else we should cover. This was the project that I wanted to do in cute. Right. That was originally

21:26.960 --> 21:33.920
written in cute and then had to be brought over to a.net. Right. Um, yeah. So in fact, there's

21:33.920 --> 21:38.320
been some developments on that cause I don't know if you saw cute actually replied to me on Twitter.

21:38.320 --> 21:41.360
You know, you mentioned, I didn't see the thread though. I didn't get a chance to see it. How did

21:41.360 --> 21:49.120
that go? What was their response? Uh, the response was like a, a, a response that didn't quite answer

21:49.120 --> 21:57.200
the question. So there is some disagreement on what is considered embedded. That's where we are

21:57.200 --> 22:03.280
right now. Oh, really? And the ironic thing is the, the response that they tweeted to me

22:03.280 --> 22:12.800
contradicts the conversation I had with their rep. So it is possible. In fact, I would, I tried to

22:12.800 --> 22:17.360
encourage them to say a little, you know, cause I guess they, they heard the show, which sorry,

22:18.400 --> 22:23.760
you know, I, I try to invited the rep on. I said, you know, this is very confusing. I've talked to

22:23.760 --> 22:29.280
three different people from your company and I've gotten two very different answers. I said, and,

22:29.280 --> 22:36.800
you know, now we have this much on Twitter, which, which I think is correct, but the official

22:36.800 --> 22:44.240
proposal I got from you was the exact opposite. And the question being, is a windows or Linux tablet

22:45.120 --> 22:49.040
that's running standards, windows or Linux, right? So let's just say Debian,

22:50.160 --> 22:55.520
is that considered if it's mounted in a, in a either airplane or anything like that,

22:55.520 --> 23:00.960
is that considered embedded? I thought not, but as we went through that process, the rep said,

23:00.960 --> 23:05.360
yeah, we consider that embedded. So the, so the question that really is at the core of this is

23:05.360 --> 23:10.880
what defines an embedded device? Is it an embedded OS or is it how it's installed?

23:10.880 --> 23:14.720
That was my argument. It would be that it, it would be the op, it would be, you know, running

23:15.440 --> 23:18.000
a headless Linux machine. I would say sure embedded.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.720
I mean, just for the sake of argument, what if they had an HP tower in the airplane that fed

23:24.720 --> 23:30.640
to an LCD monitor that was secured in the cockpit with like a mounting system that wouldn't, that

23:30.640 --> 23:35.680
would clearly not be embedded because it would be, it'd be a DVI cord running down to, or a

23:35.680 --> 23:41.520
DisplayPort cord running down to a HP PC tower running windows 10 professional. And that would

23:41.520 --> 23:46.960
clearly not be embedded, but because now they've been able to fit all of that same stuff in

23:46.960 --> 23:51.840
something like a surface that makes it an embedded device. I don't think I agree with that. It's,

23:51.840 --> 23:57.120
and it's x86 windows in this case, it's standard, it's standards windows 10 or standard Debian,

23:57.120 --> 24:02.240
right? We could, yeah, I'm calling shenanigans on that. Yeah. Well, and it's funny because the,

24:02.240 --> 24:06.240
the public reply on Twitter was basically in agreement with me, but also like, you know,

24:06.240 --> 24:10.080
somewhat annoyed that I guess they don't, you don't like it. Well, they don't like it when

24:10.080 --> 24:14.880
you talk about it publicly, you know, they don't like that too much. It seems like what happened

24:14.880 --> 24:20.240
is like a sales rep made a mistake, but because we're so small, didn't want to take a lot of time

24:20.240 --> 24:28.960
to escalate the issue. And I got annoyed. So, so yeah, but it is still to this day that I have

24:28.960 --> 24:36.880
still not gotten a straight answer on if you just have a tablet running a non embedded operating

24:36.880 --> 24:42.640
system. So straight windows, straight Linux, is that considered embedded or not? And it's still

24:42.640 --> 24:48.960
still unclear. Geez, that is these cute people come on the show. It's really, even if the answer

24:48.960 --> 24:54.160
is yes, we consider it embedded, better to have it out there that, you know, this is our policy.

24:54.160 --> 24:58.240
But hey, I would, I would like to know what the audience thinks. I wonder if they could make the

24:58.240 --> 25:05.120
case for, for that, to say it's embedded. And the other, the other funny thing is technically,

25:05.120 --> 25:12.960
again, not a lawyer, the LGPL doesn't care, right? If you can dynamically link the libraries,

25:12.960 --> 25:17.120
you should be fine as far as the LGPL is concerned. It's interesting that they even have

25:17.120 --> 25:20.800
this distinction. Well, it's because maybe folks like you don't want to link, right?

25:22.080 --> 25:26.480
No, I was willing to link. I was a dynamically link. Oh, you were. Okay. I misunderstood. Oh,

25:26.480 --> 25:32.320
okay. So first I wanted to pay commercial. Yeah. And then I briefly thought about using the LGPL,

25:32.880 --> 25:35.840
but the conversation, this is where the conversation got weird. Like, well, if it's

25:35.840 --> 25:44.880
embedded, you can't, which makes no sense. So even with that rather major road bump that you've hit,

25:44.880 --> 25:50.400
that, you know, you're still churning over in your head, you were still able to hit the ship date.

25:50.400 --> 25:57.520
And I assume you were able to do the demos. How, how stressful was that? And how did you actually

25:57.520 --> 26:03.280
manage to pull that off? So the wonderful thing about Visual Studio is it basically writes the

26:03.280 --> 26:08.640
code for you. It was, yeah, it was pretty stressful. We ended up having to basically

26:08.640 --> 26:12.960
double up resources on the project and just, just go, go, go to get it out the door.

26:12.960 --> 26:18.720
There's a, there's a little secret in there for the Linux version called Avalonia. Yeah. But oh,

26:18.720 --> 26:24.160
yeah. Oh yeah. Which the Mad Botter is now actually sponsoring. So, oh yeah, I saw that too.

26:24.160 --> 26:27.760
All right. So how do I get it for a good news slash Linux? Do I just, is there any way for

26:27.760 --> 26:32.400
me to contact you? Is that how I get it? Yeah. It's a, it's a callous situation. Oh, you dirty

26:32.400 --> 26:39.040
dog. You dirty dog. Yeah. So how, okay. Okay. But I guess the elephant in the room really is

26:39.040 --> 26:45.600
how the hell did you narrow in on this particular market on, as they would say, on this vertical?

26:45.600 --> 26:51.680
How did you go there? Because Mad Botter, right, is working on a productivity bot.

26:52.640 --> 26:59.200
And then of course I've seen that idea take off like crazy. And so you're looking at other places

26:59.200 --> 27:04.720
where perhaps you could niche down on that vertical, as they say. And I'm just wondering

27:04.720 --> 27:11.840
how the hell a military aerospace is where you landed. That's, that's a, that's a big leap.

27:12.400 --> 27:16.560
With you being missing for so long, I was, I was seriously thinking we needed some sort of rescue

27:16.560 --> 27:22.720
operation. No. So actually a lot of the consulting work isn't that vertical already that we've been

27:22.720 --> 27:28.960
doing for some time. Oh. So there was just an opportunity to work with a partner and yeah,

27:28.960 --> 27:34.480
it was, went ahead and I see you already had feelers in that area. So it was just sort of a natural slip

27:34.480 --> 27:41.040
right in. Nice. Slip it right in. Nice, dude. Well, congratulations on shipping. Yeah. Like you said,

27:41.040 --> 27:47.280
it's a Griffin radar, right? Did I say that right? Griffin radar.com. Yep. Griffin radar.com. Nice.

27:47.280 --> 27:52.960
Well, congratulations. That's a big deal. I'm going to, I'll talk, you know, if people are

27:52.960 --> 27:57.840
interested, I thought I figured I'd talk a little bit about, you know, what's going on in the

27:57.840 --> 28:03.440
industry. And then I'll talk a little bit about, uh, my business thing that's pretty huge for me

28:03.440 --> 28:10.000
is the transition from being an independent owner of Jupiter broadcasting and really being,

28:10.000 --> 28:16.080
having to be extremely scrappy and fight it out in the streets with, uh, other podcasts that are,

28:16.080 --> 28:20.000
you know, advertisers supported and trying to work, you know, try to encourage people to do

28:20.000 --> 28:24.720
our Patreon and just really just pulling it every string we can to stay alive. And now we've made

28:24.720 --> 28:33.200
formerly a part of Linux Academy and, um, a huge part of Linux Academy's core values is

28:34.000 --> 28:40.160
the community because they themselves as Linux users recognize that if you're going to build

28:40.160 --> 28:45.680
a large, successful company that makes revenue off of Linux, then it's in your best interest

28:45.680 --> 28:51.040
when you get to a certain size to be an active participant in that community, reinvesting back

28:51.040 --> 28:55.760
in the very community that's made you successful. And so that's always been a big part of what Linux

28:55.760 --> 29:01.200
Academy has been about, but it's sort of been everyone's job, which only works at a certain

29:01.200 --> 29:05.920
scale when everybody is really busy. You know, it's, it's easy to say community is important.

29:05.920 --> 29:10.080
So, uh, at some point they made the, they did make the determination that we need to have an

29:10.080 --> 29:15.600
actual community department and we need to have a VP of community. And, uh, that is the role that I

29:15.600 --> 29:21.360
have taken on. And the podcasts are part of that giving back to the community. It's their contribution.

29:21.360 --> 29:26.800
That's why they removed the ads from the podcasts is they want them to be something free that goes

29:26.800 --> 29:31.920
back to the community that gets people excited about Linux and open source or just technology

29:31.920 --> 29:36.800
in general, which maybe once you get, you know, you get to get to a point, you think, I, I'm ready

29:36.800 --> 29:41.280
to learn more. You think Linux Academy, and we've been out here getting people excited about Linux

29:41.280 --> 29:47.440
and open source for 13 years. So we're pretty, we're pretty used to doing that mission. So yeah,

29:47.440 --> 29:50.960
I, when we, when we sat down and talked it, you know, you know, it's funny is that originally,

29:50.960 --> 29:56.080
it originally started as what are some ways we could just work together more, you know,

29:56.080 --> 30:00.640
because we're both kind of doing the same thing. The funny thing about most professions

30:01.360 --> 30:05.360
is from the outside, you think you have an idea of what it takes to do the work.

30:05.360 --> 30:11.600
But then when you go into an industry or you go into a profession, you realize there's so

30:11.600 --> 30:17.600
much more to it than what people see publicly, which were what people could even, you know,

30:17.600 --> 30:25.280
assume publicly, and you just don't know until you're doing it. And that is, that is maybe the

30:25.280 --> 30:31.760
most true for the content industry, the amount of work. I mean, you hear about, you hear about,

30:31.760 --> 30:36.560
you know, famous people who are strung out on drugs and pushing themselves to the limit or

30:36.560 --> 30:46.320
alcoholics. It takes an unbelievable amount out of you. And, you know, I would say 90% of my job

30:46.320 --> 30:53.280
is no, that's, that's, that's an under 98% of my job is off microphone. The easiest thing I do

30:53.280 --> 31:01.120
is record these shows. That is the easiest aspect of my job. And it's really hard to even understand

31:01.120 --> 31:04.960
what could he be spending all his time on? What could he be doing? But once you get into the

31:04.960 --> 31:08.160
industry and you're running a business, you realize there's so much more to it.

31:08.160 --> 31:16.320
So now I'm making this transition to where I have a marketing department that I can contact now.

31:16.320 --> 31:22.800
And there is a development department that I can contact. And there are people on staff who are

31:22.800 --> 31:30.800
super knowledgeable about AWS and Azure and Linux security. Some of them have come from Amazon and

31:30.800 --> 31:35.360
other areas of the industry. Like they are really experts on this stuff. So it's like, all of a

31:35.360 --> 31:42.320
sudden, I can't even really wrap my head around it. I've gone from scrappy little, like cut every

31:42.320 --> 31:50.800
edge, every corner we can to save money, work 60 hours a week to now I have like an actual full-time

31:50.800 --> 31:58.240
small team that works for me. And I have a bunch of other resources in a much larger organization

31:58.960 --> 32:04.880
that, you know, working with a PMO, I can task and get things out of. Like we're talking about

32:05.760 --> 32:12.560
a kickoff meeting next week to just update our art because our art is old. The Koda Radio artwork

32:12.560 --> 32:17.440
has not changed in six years or whatever, five years. How long we've been doing this? It's just

32:17.440 --> 32:23.600
been the same. We started in 2012. And it's just simply because of budget reasons, right? It's just

32:23.600 --> 32:30.560
a cost money to hire people to refresh the art. And really it's lower resolution than it should

32:30.560 --> 32:36.000
be for high DPI displays and all that stuff. Like it's just an area that was not even under

32:36.000 --> 32:40.880
consideration. And now next week, I'm going to be meeting with an art team to start kicking around

32:40.880 --> 32:49.120
ideas and just give things a refresh. It's this massive head change for me. And there's a lot to

32:49.120 --> 32:54.720
do as a VP that I didn't really have a full picture of because how could I, until I got into

32:54.720 --> 32:58.240
that position. And now I'm involved in a lot of meetings. You know, I'm a stakeholder now.

33:00.000 --> 33:00.560
Oh no.

33:00.560 --> 33:06.800
Yeah, I'm a stakeholder. And so it's like every day there's usually a meeting I'm involved in.

33:06.800 --> 33:12.160
So there's been a lot of new work too, that I'm picking up while I'm recovering. But since I'm

33:12.160 --> 33:16.560
not doing as many shows while I'm recovering, I've had more time to do the VP stuff. It's

33:16.560 --> 33:21.840
been, it's a type of transition that I'm still processing really, you know, like I'm still fully

33:21.840 --> 33:22.800
adjusting to it.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.640
Right. So you're, you're adjusting to now being the grand Viceroy of community.

33:26.640 --> 33:27.760
Right. Yeah.

33:27.760 --> 33:32.960
It seems like the perfect marriage. How did you trick Anthony into doing this?

33:32.960 --> 33:39.360
Well, so let's, I think we should explore the why a little bit because, you know, we've, and yeah,

33:39.360 --> 33:44.320
like I was saying, it did start as just like, maybe we could do, you know, like a collaboration

33:44.320 --> 33:49.840
on a show or something. And then the conversation over Texas Linux Fest just sort of, just sort of

33:49.840 --> 33:54.240
expanded from there. And at one point it's like, well, well, maybe we should just buy Jupiter

33:54.240 --> 33:58.560
Broadcasting. Cause you know, if we're going to be doing two or so, you know, and they also at the

33:58.560 --> 34:03.440
same time want to launch several shows that they've, you know, they've bought studio space

34:03.440 --> 34:08.480
for, they've created studio space for, they've recorded test episodes, but they can't really,

34:09.440 --> 34:13.760
there's a lot involved to it, to making shows, to making them weekly, to publishing them on the

34:13.760 --> 34:18.960
different platforms. Like there's just, we just, you know, we essentially have a ton of industry

34:18.960 --> 34:24.400
knowledge in this area. And so we would, we would just be providing a lot of, at first it was going

34:24.400 --> 34:28.480
to be providing a lot of consulting, but then it, then the conversation expanded from there. But

34:28.480 --> 34:38.320
going back to the why. So, you know, I was really at a point where, just very frankly, the last

34:38.320 --> 34:46.240
three years, I've, I've been living off of fumes. Just, I'm not complaining really, because this is

34:46.240 --> 34:52.800
my choice. I enjoy the work and I would rather be broke and do something else. I'm not complaining

34:52.800 --> 34:58.800
to be broke and do something I enjoy than make a ton of money and hate the work that I've, because

34:58.800 --> 35:05.200
I've done that before. I did that for a long time and I know that doesn't work for me. So I'm, I

35:05.200 --> 35:09.760
preface this with, I'm not complaining and I'm thankful that I could do it at all. But you know,

35:09.760 --> 35:16.000
I don't even have, I don't have running water at home because it costs $320 to turn on running

35:16.000 --> 35:24.000
water. And I couldn't afford that. And so I've been living for over, you know, a year or two now

35:24.000 --> 35:29.680
with, without running water. And I, I have this big bladder that holds 30 gallons at a time,

35:29.680 --> 35:35.200
and I fill that with water. And then I have a pump and I transfer that into the tank in my RV.

35:35.200 --> 35:39.920
And then my RV has a pump and that runs the toilets and the sinks, but it's not sanitary.

35:39.920 --> 35:44.080
We can't drink that water. You know, we brush our teeth with it, but probably even that's pushing

35:44.080 --> 35:52.880
it. Like that was my reality. And the only way I could see to improve it was to bring on more

35:52.880 --> 36:00.080
sponsors or replace the sponsors with higher paying sponsors. But I wasn't really, I'm not,

36:00.080 --> 36:04.720
I wasn't inclined to do that because it's about, it's, it's, it's a sales process and it can take

36:04.720 --> 36:09.760
up to six months or more to close a sale. And I would have four or five of them I would have to

36:09.760 --> 36:16.000
do that with. And I also really, you know, I, I worked hard to hand choose those sponsors and

36:16.000 --> 36:20.240
work with them. And I was a customer of each one of those sponsors and I had a, I had a history

36:20.240 --> 36:25.840
with them and I wasn't really keen on replacing them, but I couldn't launch more shows to feature

36:25.840 --> 36:30.800
new sponsors because there was no revenue to do that. Plus switching to higher paying sponsors

36:31.520 --> 36:37.760
is just locking in a more rigid production schedule that can't be missed. And it just raises

36:37.760 --> 36:42.320
the stakes that I'm there for every episode, that I'm healthy, that, you know, I never take a break.

36:42.320 --> 36:47.280
Like it just raises the stakes on all of those. So that didn't feel sustainable. Plus higher paying

36:47.280 --> 36:52.640
sponsors are now, because the podcast industry has grown so much, are looking for a minimum

36:52.640 --> 36:56.160
of 50,000 downloads. And if you want something that's going to actually make a difference in

36:56.160 --> 37:03.360
your life, they're looking for 75,000 downloads. Now our shows will reach that monthly. Like,

37:03.360 --> 37:09.200
you know, I think this month as an example, Linux action news will be downloaded by 130,000 unique

37:09.200 --> 37:13.440
people in one month. That's a, that's a fantastic number that I'm very proud of.

37:14.000 --> 37:21.520
They want 50 to 70,000 per episode per week. Right. Not just the average overall. Right.

37:21.520 --> 37:26.640
And I don't believe when you look at the Linux and open source and free software market,

37:26.640 --> 37:31.600
and then the audience in which in that would listen to podcasts and then the audience in which

37:31.600 --> 37:37.920
that would choose to listen to our podcasts. I don't believe once you niche down into that

37:37.920 --> 37:44.720
vertical that much, that you can have 75,000 downloads per week per episode. You can have a

37:44.720 --> 37:51.760
couple of lucky episodes, but unless you're going hard on the clickbait emotion, basically YouTube

37:51.760 --> 37:56.480
crap, you're not going to get there in a podcast. Podcasts don't get shared the way blogs and YouTube

37:56.480 --> 38:03.760
videos do. It's much more organic, slow discovery. People don't link other people to a point in a

38:03.760 --> 38:10.240
podcast. They'll link people to a YouTube video or a text article. And so discovery and growth

38:10.240 --> 38:14.960
has been a slow process for the last 13 years. And I'm very proud of where we've gotten because

38:14.960 --> 38:18.160
it's, you know, these are magazine numbers. These are larger than magazine distribution

38:18.160 --> 38:23.280
numbers. Like they're larger than local small to medium market radio station numbers. Like,

38:23.280 --> 38:29.760
I'm proud of these numbers, but they're not 75,000 per week. In fact, most of them that are that

38:29.760 --> 38:35.760
large are associated with larger organizations or celebrities. And so it was going to be an uphill

38:35.760 --> 38:42.320
battle. Plus there are a lot of Linux podcasts now that I would be, essentially we're all competing

38:42.320 --> 38:49.200
for the same sponsor dollar. And then there's just the, there just be that we would just be

38:49.200 --> 38:56.080
making a slight improvement on our revenue and our quality of life while being even more stuck to a

38:56.080 --> 38:59.600
rigid production schedule. And that just didn't seem-

38:59.600 --> 39:00.880
It sounds like this gives you- Go ahead.

39:00.880 --> 39:06.720
Gives you a lot of freedom. No, it sounds like, so our new Linux Academy overlords all bow to

39:06.720 --> 39:10.720
the penguin. It's giving you just a tremendous amount of freedom and runway.

39:10.720 --> 39:19.360
Yeah. And it's a matter of being able to work with a larger group of people who understand how

39:19.360 --> 39:23.920
much work content creation is because they're content creators too. And that, I don't think

39:23.920 --> 39:29.760
I would have found anywhere else. Like if you look at, say like you look at our other sponsors,

39:29.760 --> 39:35.200
like Digital Ocean, or their area is servers, right? But Linux Academy's area is content

39:35.200 --> 39:40.960
creation and they have a house full of staff whose entire purpose is content creation.

39:40.960 --> 39:47.200
Anthony himself was one of the original content creators for Linux Academy back in 2014. So he

39:47.200 --> 39:52.160
himself is intimately familiar with the content creation process and how much damn work it is.

39:52.160 --> 40:00.000
So that insight is, I just, it's almost invaluable because it's the difference between them

40:00.000 --> 40:05.120
understanding why sometimes it takes a while to produce a show and them packing on tons of

40:05.120 --> 40:11.280
expectations and all of this. So that was, when I started considering that aspect of the

40:11.280 --> 40:16.960
relationship, that sort of seemed like a, well, this is the shot I have. I could probably keep

40:16.960 --> 40:26.400
going doing it the way we were, but I'm really, I just, I'm exhausted by being so poor. I couldn't

40:26.400 --> 40:32.320
get my truck fixed. I couldn't replace my tires. I couldn't fix up the RV. It's exhausting being

40:32.320 --> 40:38.320
so broke all the time. And I know people have been worse off for me, but there was literally

40:38.320 --> 40:43.040
weeks where I'm like, I'm like, well, I can no longer afford to get gas anymore. I don't know

40:43.040 --> 40:48.160
how I'm going to make, my truck gets, did, I've replaced it now. It was getting 16 miles to the

40:48.160 --> 40:52.800
gallon and I'm like, I think I'm sleeping at the studio tonight so that way I can be there to do

40:52.800 --> 41:00.320
shows the next day. That's just, it just is exhausting. And so to be able to go into an

41:00.320 --> 41:07.840
organization who is just growing like crazy and has the runway to do things like finance trips

41:07.840 --> 41:13.760
to events or put gas in the RV, which can be thousands of dollars when I take it to an event

41:13.760 --> 41:19.360
or fly and pay for my hotel stay, like it opens up my possibilities of what I can do

41:19.360 --> 41:25.360
to create future content tenfold. Because now I'm working with a company that has an expense process

41:25.360 --> 41:29.280
that has hired me with the intention of being able to travel and go to community events

41:29.280 --> 41:35.040
and meet up with people and is encouraging me to do so. It no longer becomes a how are we going to

41:35.040 --> 41:38.080
even be able to afford to do this? Are we going to make six months of payments on a credit card

41:38.080 --> 41:43.760
after I returned from a trip? It's, this is part of my process now. And the other thing that's meant

41:43.760 --> 41:52.480
is being able to bring Joe and Wes on full time. The timing of that was sort of miraculous because

41:52.480 --> 42:00.080
the week that Wes started, so Wes started full time on a Wednesday and he and I flew down to

42:00.080 --> 42:04.720
Texas because new employees that go down to Linux Academy HQ and they go through an onboarding

42:04.720 --> 42:10.240
process. And so I was down there to button up the final details on the merger announcement

42:10.240 --> 42:15.760
and Wes was down there to do onboarding. So I'm in Texas when my appendix ruptures and he flies home

42:15.760 --> 42:19.680
because at that point I'm like, I'm just not feeling well, I'm going to go sleep. And so I just

42:19.680 --> 42:25.840
started sleeping a lot. And so I booked Wes a flight home and he flew home and he started full

42:25.840 --> 42:33.600
time that Monday that I went in and I went to the hospital Sunday. And so Joe and Wes were able to

42:33.600 --> 42:39.040
keep the shows going. Angela was able to provide historical context and direction in areas where

42:39.040 --> 42:43.840
they needed help. And it was, we had that, we had a full like team that was able to just step up and

42:43.840 --> 42:48.240
keep the shows. So we didn't miss any shows while I was gone, while I was in the hospital.

42:48.240 --> 42:53.680
I was gone while I was in the hospital for a week and then recovering now for several weeks. We

42:53.680 --> 42:57.920
haven't missed a single show, you know, unless some other circumstances have come up and that

42:58.720 --> 43:06.320
we nailed that by one day. Like that's how, like that, that kind of, if we had missed that by a

43:06.320 --> 43:11.520
week, then it would have all been on me. There would have been nobody here bringing sponsor

43:11.520 --> 43:17.680
revenue in. There would have been no shows going out. The network just would have gone silent for

43:17.680 --> 43:26.080
a couple of weeks possibly. And so it's just, it's totally changing my game. It's totally changing

43:26.080 --> 43:30.720
my game. And now the other thing is it means is that Wes and Joe can commit themselves full time

43:31.760 --> 43:38.160
to this. So that means Wes has been available on a Sunday. He's been available on a Thursday midday.

43:38.160 --> 43:42.560
You know, we don't have to worry about his day job anymore. And so it's made it way more possible

43:42.560 --> 43:50.240
to do all of this stuff. And not to mention, I got health care two weeks before I ended up in the ER.

43:51.040 --> 43:54.720
Oh, you lucky duck. I mean, you're unlucky that you went to the ER, but the health care is...

43:55.840 --> 43:59.760
And I was, you know, we'd talked about on the show, you know, you and I had both had to go this

43:59.760 --> 44:04.480
year health care free because of the cost and I just couldn't afford it. And I thought, well,

44:04.480 --> 44:08.480
I'm healthy. You know, I haven't gone to the doctor in seven, eight years. I got nothing wrong with me.

44:08.480 --> 44:13.280
I'll be fine for one more year is what I thought. And I didn't even make it through the year.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.120
You didn't make it. You didn't make it.

44:15.120 --> 44:19.040
I didn't. And I, you know, I'm still going to be paying out the nose for the stuff that's just out

44:19.040 --> 44:23.360
of just the cost of stuff out of network is freaking me out. It's going to be possibly

44:23.360 --> 44:29.120
tens of thousands of dollars. And at least you have something. I mean, yeah, I would be I would

44:29.120 --> 44:35.200
I would have been I would have been completely destroyed financially. So, you know, I've had

44:35.200 --> 44:39.520
a few weeks to reflect on this. And it just seems like what I was doing before was pure insanity.

44:40.480 --> 44:45.200
I mean, the reason why I walked around and what I'm currently doing. Yeah. I mean, the reason I

44:45.200 --> 44:49.600
walked around for three weeks with appendicitis and and then ruptured my appendix. I mean,

44:49.600 --> 44:57.440
I pushed through one of the most miserable. I was so sick. I was feverish. I was I was exhausted.

44:57.440 --> 45:02.640
And I pushed through it for three weeks because that's how the old business was designed is I

45:02.640 --> 45:07.360
had to be there to keep to keep doing the shows, to keep the sponsor revenue coming in, to keep

45:07.360 --> 45:13.360
stuff going out the door. And plus, I was trying to finish this business deal. It was it was just

45:13.360 --> 45:18.240
totally unsustainable. And I pushed it too far to the point where I got way more sick than I

45:18.240 --> 45:23.120
should have. I if I would have gone in into the hospital the first week, they probably would have

45:23.120 --> 45:27.520
just been able to do an appendectomy and just put a couple little holes in me and got my appendix

45:27.520 --> 45:31.600
out. But instead, I pushed through it for three weeks and I traveled to Texas and I ruptured my

45:31.600 --> 45:38.240
appendix. And in doing so, and apparently I likely spent several days, if not maybe a week with a

45:38.240 --> 45:44.240
ruptured appendix. And the bacteria of that appendix went throughout my body and wrecked my

45:44.240 --> 45:49.520
right hip and those muscles. And it went and the muscles that hold my stomach in place on the

45:49.520 --> 45:57.360
bottom were poisoned and nearly destroyed. And then the areas around where my appendix was has

45:57.360 --> 46:02.400
been severely damaged. It's the doctor described it as just this most horrible, horrible looking

46:02.400 --> 46:08.960
thing. And all of that damage would have been prevented if I had gone to the hospital sooner.

46:08.960 --> 46:14.160
But I was so focused on work and pushing through this because I've had a light when things get

46:14.160 --> 46:17.120
really stressful and things really get going, you know, sometimes my health begins to fail me. And

46:17.120 --> 46:20.800
that's not that's been something that's happened quite a bit over the last three years. And

46:20.800 --> 46:26.000
generally, I managed to push through it after a few days. But this time, it wasn't what that

46:26.000 --> 46:30.800
wasn't what was happening. And just to make it clear, I did go to the ER at one point and they

46:30.800 --> 46:35.600
missed it. So I did, I did try to go in and they just they happened to miss it. They didn't do any

46:35.600 --> 46:42.480
imagery. And so and cleared me to travel to Texas. So I did try it. But that still is like two weeks

46:42.480 --> 46:47.600
into it. It took me two, two and a half weeks to get to that point. And it's just because I didn't

46:47.600 --> 46:52.800
have health insurance at the time. Actually, I did it just at that point. But I wasn't used to

46:52.800 --> 46:56.960
I wasn't used to thinking like I have health insurance. I had the mindset of I have to avoid

46:56.960 --> 47:02.080
going to the doctor and I was just locked into that. So much of what you're saying,

47:03.280 --> 47:07.360
and you know, from our private conversations is completely like one to one with with me.

47:08.800 --> 47:16.400
Yeah, it's but brighter future, right? So all Linux all the time. Yeah, I mean, it is it has it

47:16.400 --> 47:24.560
it it has it's it there's a bit of sadness of losing, you know, like the being a business

47:24.560 --> 47:28.000
owner and being, you know, quote unquote, entrepreneur, whatever. I didn't really ever

47:28.000 --> 47:32.160
consider myself that but being like a self sufficient. I own my own business. I've created

47:32.160 --> 47:37.280
this thing and now it sustains me. But the reality was, is I was sustaining it and it was it was not

47:37.280 --> 47:43.360
sustaining me. Right. And so that's where this this transition, I think, has been really good for me.

47:43.360 --> 47:46.800
I think it will be good for me personally, once I'm through all this medical stuff and all of that.

47:47.360 --> 47:53.760
But it does mean playing a new game now. Like, I think one of the reasons why I'm going to be okay

47:53.760 --> 47:59.280
at this is because I spent seven years working at a bank that was extremely bureaucratic. I've

47:59.280 --> 48:05.040
shared some of the stories on this show before, and very, very political. And so by comparison,

48:05.040 --> 48:13.680
Linux Academy with its like 115 employees, and its remote work culture is a cakewalk. Like,

48:13.680 --> 48:18.480
it's kept me busy every day. And I've spent like I had to spend multiple days like doing expense

48:18.480 --> 48:22.240
reports and stuff like that. Like, I feel like I've had to do a few TPS reports. But at the same

48:22.240 --> 48:30.480
time, compared to the seven years I spent in that bank, this is easy. And I was surprised at how

48:30.480 --> 48:35.520
quickly I could recall those skills. I figured I was, and I think I've said before, I am unemployable

48:35.520 --> 48:41.600
now. Because I'm so used to having unilateral decisions. Like, if I need to subscribe to a

48:41.600 --> 48:47.120
service to do my job, I subscribe to that service. It takes me 10 minutes, and I move on with my day.

48:47.120 --> 48:51.600
But now I got a hem and haw, and I got to seek approval for a certain amount. You know, like,

48:51.600 --> 48:56.800
there's different things that have changed. I don't think it's for the worst, but I wasn't,

48:56.800 --> 49:01.520
I didn't think I was cut out for it. I didn't think I could deal with that crap anymore.

49:02.240 --> 49:09.440
But the reality is, it's been to my surprise, like riding a bike. I'm kind of a natural at it,

49:09.440 --> 49:13.120
I guess. It's sort of horrible to say it. I kind of feel bad saying it. But like,

49:13.120 --> 49:16.480
I'm pretty good at playing the politics game and making sure that the right people are staying

49:16.480 --> 49:20.080
informed and that I'm, you know, I'm making sure I'm checking with the right people and showing a

49:20.080 --> 49:24.960
certain amount of presence in the group discussion. And there's other roles I have as a VP in

49:24.960 --> 49:30.160
management areas where I, you know, have to be actively participating. But it's been

49:30.160 --> 49:34.720
significantly easier, in a way, because I haven't been doing as many shows, and I've been recovering

49:34.720 --> 49:40.000
and taking it slow. So I've been able to just sort of focus on that stuff. But it has been way easier

49:40.000 --> 49:46.000
than I expected to integrate back into a corporate structure. The Linux Academy one is pretty easy

49:46.000 --> 49:53.280
going, you know, it's as far as it's pretty modern in its structure and in its remote work culture.

49:53.280 --> 49:57.920
So it sort of works well for me since I'm up here in Seattle. Well, most of the team is all around

49:57.920 --> 50:02.560
the world. So I'm not like some weirdo who's outside the office, and I'm the only outsider.

50:02.560 --> 50:08.160
It's pretty common for most people to be out. And they have a policy where if you ever want to visit

50:08.160 --> 50:11.360
the office, you fly in, they'll put you up at a hotel, they'll pay for the flight, and you can

50:11.360 --> 50:17.120
stay and work at the office as long as you want. And to that end, even, we're building a studio

50:17.120 --> 50:23.760
there, essentially a JB2, which will have a lot of the same gear. So I can jump on a plane, three

50:23.760 --> 50:30.720
hour flight down to Texas, and I've left myself a go bag there. So I can literally just jump in the

50:30.720 --> 50:35.520
car, go to the airport, I don't have to pack a thing. I hop on the plane, I fly down there,

50:35.520 --> 50:39.440
and I've got a go bag stash down there waiting for me, packed, clean clothes, ready to go with

50:39.440 --> 50:44.240
all my toiletries and everything I like, even a razor. And I can get right to work at a studio

50:44.240 --> 50:48.480
that's down there, and then when I'm ready to go, I jump on a plane, fly back, three hours,

50:48.480 --> 50:54.320
three, four hours, and back in Washington. That's really cool. So it's working so far,

50:54.320 --> 50:59.120
but you know, long term, we'll see. I think long term is, I think it's going to be a matter of

51:01.680 --> 51:09.200
balancing the VP role with balancing the content creation role. But I'm really looking forward to

51:09.200 --> 51:14.480
getting to travel to more events. That's the number one thing when they told me it's going

51:14.480 --> 51:18.160
to be a multi-month recovery, I'm like, no, I've got two events scheduled I want to go to.

51:18.960 --> 51:21.120
In the next two months, I've got two different events I want to go to.

51:21.920 --> 51:25.280
You're not going anywhere. You're grounded.

51:25.280 --> 51:34.000
Yeah. And for me, it's a relief not to do sponsorships. I think we had great sponsors,

51:34.000 --> 51:40.000
and I really appreciate them keeping us going for as long as they did. But I've told everybody about

51:40.000 --> 51:46.400
DigitalOcean and Ting a few times now. And it means with this show, we can just sit here and

51:46.400 --> 51:52.160
chat. We can just have an uninterrupted conversation. And I think that's pretty great.

51:52.160 --> 51:55.920
And I think I'm going to try to find ways to still make it valuable for Linux Academy. So

51:57.040 --> 52:00.800
I'll probably mention, oh, actually, in fact, here's an example of something I'm going to try

52:00.800 --> 52:08.160
to do. They have a Ruby developer position that is open right now. And so I'm going to try and get

52:08.160 --> 52:13.840
that information out from time to time. I'll put a link in the show notes at coder.show slash 326.

52:13.840 --> 52:18.240
They are looking for a full stack node developer, which is a remote position, a Ruby developer,

52:18.240 --> 52:22.480
which is a remote position, and a Ruby on Rails developer, which is a remote position.

52:22.480 --> 52:24.560
It looks like they are looking for- Go ahead.

52:25.360 --> 52:26.880
Are all their positions remote?

52:26.880 --> 52:30.080
No, I was just going to say it looks like they're looking for a senior iOS developer

52:30.080 --> 52:35.520
that might, yeah, that's out of the office. They're looking for a PMO, a scrum master,

52:35.520 --> 52:38.240
which is out of the office, and a technical writer, which would be remote,

52:39.200 --> 52:43.600
and an R&D web developer, which they're looking for someone in New York for that,

52:43.600 --> 52:49.520
interestingly enough. But I'll put a link to this in the show notes if anybody is like a node

52:50.320 --> 52:55.920
developer or a Ruby developer and looking for remote work, they have a position open.

52:55.920 --> 52:59.760
So I'm going to try and probably integrate that kind of stuff. So it's still bringing

52:59.760 --> 53:03.760
some value to Linux Academy, but it's also bringing value to the audience is sort of my plan.

53:04.800 --> 53:08.640
And we'll see how that works because I am hoping that's a good balance that everybody's happy with.

53:09.360 --> 53:13.120
And you know what else it's meant, which is I'm actually really, really excited about because

53:13.120 --> 53:18.080
people have basically asked me on a daily basis since we took it off the air. But it means that

53:18.080 --> 53:22.960
we now have the resources and staff to bring back user error. So we've relaunched the user error

53:22.960 --> 53:28.320
program, which is really kind of one of the audience favorites, I guess, because you get to

53:28.320 --> 53:31.200
hear some of the same hosts that you listen to on the other shows. But, you know, they let their

53:31.200 --> 53:36.800
hair down and take their pants off and sit around and talk about life, the universe, and Linux.

53:38.080 --> 53:38.880
And Linux.

53:38.880 --> 53:43.520
Yeah. So User Error 48, Living the Dream is out. It's error.show.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.320
Very good.

53:44.320 --> 53:47.520
Yeah, you got a chance to listen to it. Error.show. Yep. I like those guys,

53:47.520 --> 53:53.520
Popey and Dan and Joe's on there. And I'll probably be on the next one and I'll tell

53:53.520 --> 53:57.600
the full story because, you know, there's some aspects to it that are just they're not worth

53:57.600 --> 54:02.320
going into on this show. But, oh, man, are they mind benders. Oh, man, there's so many mind benders

54:02.320 --> 54:07.680
in this whole process. So I think I'll come on the next user error and on 49 and share my story.

54:09.360 --> 54:16.160
So something I've noticed is a lot like you mentioned, Dan, a lot of elementary love going on.

54:16.160 --> 54:23.520
Yeah. Yeah, I think I think they are larger than Fedora in user base by about 100,000 users now.

54:23.520 --> 54:29.920
And I think people are noticing that they are a trend line of improvement. Like you can look

54:29.920 --> 54:35.280
at each elementary OS and you can see that they've held a singular vision and it's been

54:35.280 --> 54:42.400
getting more and more refined each time. And they're also very active, like Cassidy and Daniel,

54:42.400 --> 54:47.520
are very active in the community. Like they just were both at the Libre application summit. They

54:47.520 --> 54:53.280
are usually at some other major event every few months. You know, so they're really participating

54:53.280 --> 55:01.280
in the in the overall discussion a lot. And so I think it's sort of like this multifaceted approach

55:01.280 --> 55:06.640
they've taken by continuing to put out good stuff, by being active in the community, and by trying

55:06.640 --> 55:12.720
to change the status quo a little bit and being now pretty clear and communicating fairly well

55:12.720 --> 55:17.920
after some hard lessons learned on communicating that status quo change. I think it's paying

55:17.920 --> 55:25.520
dividends. And also, not to toot my own horn, but they have been much more active in talking about

55:25.520 --> 55:30.720
some of the things behind the scenes on Linux Unplugged. And I think that does something for

55:30.720 --> 55:36.560
these projects. I think when they come on the show and they don't go for the sale, they go for,

55:36.560 --> 55:40.240
this is the challenge that I'm working on. This is the thing we're trying to solve. Like,

55:40.240 --> 55:45.520
Dan came on one time and talked about how they're building this centralized location service for

55:45.520 --> 55:50.800
the desktop for any application needs location awareness that is controllable by the user. That's,

55:50.800 --> 55:57.520
you know, it's by default very secure and you can manage the privacy. And much like on iOS,

55:57.520 --> 56:00.720
you can go into one central spot and deny location for certain applications. They're building

56:00.720 --> 56:04.400
something like that in there. And he talked about why they're doing it and the challenges they've

56:04.400 --> 56:08.240
had and the reason why they decided to go this approach and what they think the good

56:08.240 --> 56:12.080
sides of location and bad sides of location services are. And, you know, he's not on there

56:12.080 --> 56:16.240
pitching it as a new feature. He's just on there talking about the code that he's been struggling

56:16.240 --> 56:22.160
with recently. And I think that resonates with the audience. People appreciate the hard work that

56:22.160 --> 56:28.640
they're putting into this and then you see the results. And yeah, yeah, they just had an AMA on

56:28.640 --> 56:32.240
r slash Linux and there's lots of love in there. Lots of complimentary discussion in there.

56:32.240 --> 56:36.800
Yeah. Yeah, no, I saw that very interesting. What do you think? Have you thought about giving it a go?

56:36.800 --> 56:44.800
Are you sticking with pop OS? So I actually did take a dive into elementary. Oh, really? I was,

56:44.800 --> 56:50.400
I was intrigued by the elementary app store and frankly, Vala, to be honest with you. Yeah, yeah.

56:51.360 --> 56:58.320
Also, it's damn pretty, right? Like, it's it's clean, right? And it's fast. It looks good.

56:58.320 --> 57:03.360
I'm not going to say that it's that it's a snow leopard, but it's definitely like a, you know,

57:03.360 --> 57:11.200
like a slush leopard so far. We could get there. All right. Okay. That was a little elementary OS

57:11.200 --> 57:17.120
slush leopard. Yeah, I'm first of all, I was surprised how small the team is over there.

57:17.840 --> 57:23.840
I mean, it's obviously I see over there. It's an open source project so far. So good. I mean, I,

57:23.840 --> 57:30.720
I am running it in a VM, so there's some weirdness. I don't know. Oh, that's too bad.

57:30.720 --> 57:35.680
It's so smooth on physical hardware. Like, I imagine it is. It is like that. Just the way

57:35.680 --> 57:39.920
even the windows open and move around is really smooth. It's I think it's much nicer than Nome

57:39.920 --> 57:50.080
Shell. Yeah, it definitely looks better. Yeah. Slush leopard. That's so funny. I, I, I will

57:50.080 --> 57:55.280
also just give a little plug. They've just released the new beta. I think last night of me,

57:55.280 --> 58:02.400
I'm checking to see if I have a link of Juno, which is their 1804 base with a bunch of other.

58:02.400 --> 58:06.720
Yeah, yeah, here it is. Yeah, I'll put a link to this in the show notes too. So the new Juno

58:06.720 --> 58:10.720
release is the one that Dan's been talking to us on Unplugged for quite a bit about, and it's

58:10.720 --> 58:15.600
looking really solid. And the thing, the other thing that I like that they do is they don't do

58:15.600 --> 58:20.960
a time-based, they do a open issues based release schedule. So they just, they sit there and they

58:20.960 --> 58:25.360
burn down the open bugs and issues. And then once they get them all cleaned up, that's when they do

58:25.360 --> 58:28.960
a release. And so they get to that point, then they release a beta. And then they get to that

58:28.960 --> 58:33.120
point again, they release beta 2 and then they're going to do an RC, close all down the bugs, and

58:33.120 --> 58:38.560
then they'll do a final release. It's not like we're going to ship it on October 1st. It's,

58:38.560 --> 58:41.760
we ship it when we've cleared up as many of the bugs as we possibly can. Wait,

58:41.760 --> 58:47.440
ship software when it's actually done instead of for an arbitrary date? Chris, this is revolutionary.

58:47.440 --> 58:54.960
You know, it kind of works because my son has been using a two or even maybe almost, I don't know,

58:54.960 --> 59:00.080
three, it's one or two releases old of elementary. He's like on a two or three-year-old install

59:00.080 --> 59:05.280
on his laptop of elementary OS. And you know, he's not like, he's not trashing it, but you know,

59:05.280 --> 59:08.560
kids and computers, like they'll turn them off randomly, you know, and they're like,

59:08.560 --> 59:14.720
he's not super hard on it, but he's not easy on it either. And that flawless,

59:14.720 --> 59:20.800
flawless. In fact, it's been better than the used iMac that one of the other kids has used.

59:20.800 --> 59:25.040
It's, you know, it's just been totally flawless. And he runs Minecraft on it all the time. He hooks

59:25.040 --> 59:29.600
up secondary displays. It's just been, he does a monthly, he runs the monthly updates

59:30.240 --> 59:34.880
and they just built a really good product. I'm sure there's other districts that are

59:34.880 --> 59:40.160
just as good as that, but it's, it really, you know, that to me has been one of the big tests

59:40.160 --> 59:45.120
and it's really held up. I think it's a, I think it's a good workstation development environment.

59:45.120 --> 59:50.000
It's clean. It's out of your way. They've got a good notification system. It gets even better

59:50.000 --> 59:55.520
in Juno. I like their terminal a lot. And if you, if you're mostly just working in a text editor

59:55.520 --> 01:00:00.800
and in a shell, I really would strongly consider people take a look at it. And I,

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.720
I don't like it when people say it's a macOS ripoff. I think that's really unfair. I think they're just

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:09.040
going for a good design aesthetic. And I think they now have a more consistent look than macOS

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:13.920
does. So I think they've surpassed what, you know, people originally accused them of. And it's,

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:18.800
it's worth a go. And it's, again, it's based on Ubuntu. So pretty much you can get any software

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.360
installed on it that you could install on Ubuntu. You can app yourself to glory. Right. So that's

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:30.800
nice. I've, I have a, I've, I went into a, I did a review in a Linux unplugged 267, but just as a

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:39.200
quick addendum, I now am the proud owner of a ThinkPad T480. Very nice. How is it? Exceeds my

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:45.440
expectations by a fair margin. It is, it is really nice. So it's got, it's a 14 inch screen. I went

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.680
for 1080p instead of 4k, because it's just a little bit easier still with Linux. I put KDE

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:57.680
Neon 1804 on there and it's got gigabit ethernet. It's got USB-C Thunderbolt 3. It has audio in and

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:05.840
out. It has an SD card reader. It has USB-A. It's 3.6 or 3.9 pounds. And then one of the things that

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:11.760
I fricking love about it is it's, it's about a 10 hour battery life under Linux with this thing.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.000
It is an all, all night battery life is how I use it. I leave it plugged in all day at work.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.080
And then I go, I go home, I don't even bring a power adapter with me because I have 10 hours.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.080
And I, if I need my laptop for 10 hours at work in the evening, I'm doing something wrong. So I,

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:30.240
uh, I, I just have been thrilled. I've also used like my old Mac book power, a USB-C power adapter

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:35.840
with it works great. And I'm able to run our, you know, our VoIP software that we use to connect

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:40.000
between hosts. I'm able to run that and it doesn't kick up my fans, which was really the thing I was

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.840
going for. I got an i7 in this thing. And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:53.360
it's, it's, it's a thing that runs at 1.9 gigahertz, but can, can turbo up to 4.2 gigahertz, four core,

01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:00.080
32 gigs of Ram. So I was hoping it could run a Chrome app without kicking the fans up and it has

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:06.400
indeed successfully done that. Plasma is just so great. I've really gotten down to customizing it

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:11.920
super quick. I am now at peak plasma efficiency. I've got, I'm using window rules to make sure

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:18.480
And my calendar and my email applications always open up on the right desktops and with

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.120
the right size and proportions every single time.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:27.400
My Chrome browser, which I've switched back to from Firefox, is now, it always opens up

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.360
on desk one in the proportions so that I can still see my CPU usage and all of that kind

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.800
of stuff perfectly.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:39.760
And it's just, you combine that with the built-in K-Runner, which is like a launcher that you

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:44.760
might get from macOS like Alfred or Quicksilver or use Spotlight, they've got something even

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.120
better built into Plasma.

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:49.400
It's even faster and you can run commands.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.880
It's just the greatest environment for me.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.560
I'm really happy with it.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.800
The fans don't kick up unless I'm really pushing the machine.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.960
10-hour battery life is just more than I could have hoped for under Linux.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.600
And it's got a terabyte MV and E drive in it, so the disk is super fast too.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.960
I think it's one of the best computers I've ever used.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.360
I don't know if I, I'm very, very happy that I got it.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.680
It was my Linux Academy work machine, so Linux Academy actually bought it.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.600
If I was buying a machine for home, like I want to use on the couch and just kind of

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:23.100
fart around, I may have gone with a Galago Pro or an XPS 13 after your positive review

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:27.000
of the Galago, because I could then still get Ethernet in that really rare circumstance

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.040
I might need it.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:34.640
Or the XPS 13 so I could just go the USB-C lifestyle and that gorgeous Infinity display.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:41.000
But for work, I need legacy ports because all of my current audio gear uses, quote,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.080
legacy ports.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:46.680
So I have to have USB-A. Otherwise, I'm in Dongletown up the wazoo, and I have to have

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.680
Ethernet because it makes VoIP connections and video connections more stable, and it

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.300
also makes it simpler to transfer large files.

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:58.040
These are must-have items, and I wanted excellent Linux compatibility with a great keyboard

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.720
because I was really just done with the MacBook keyboard.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.080
And I got it all.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:08.520
And I think the ThinkPad T480, not the S, but the T480 is just, it's a blowaway.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.680
It's a blowaway machine.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.320
Customer sat is high.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.320
Very high.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.320
And I...

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.320
Customer sat, Tim?

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320
Yeah.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.960
And I recommend, if people are considering it, one of the things it does that I love,

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.960
it's got two batteries.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:25.680
It's got a built-in three-cell inside the laptop, and then I've got a six-cell external.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.000
And because you've got two batteries, you can hot swap that external battery, and you

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.200
can run like for an hour or two off of the internal three-cell.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.240
Oh, very cool.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.240
Yeah.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.240
It's just, I think the internal three-cell might have more wattage than your old Galego

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.240
battery did.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.240
I don't know about your current Galego.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.920
So it's, you know, three or so hour battery, and you can then, you click on an external

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.200
one, and you get...

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.400
If you've got a couple of those batteries, you could just go forever, basically, because

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.880
I get 10 hours out of one of them.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:05:01.640
Anyways, I would say that I have, I think, solved my long hardware conundrum that I have

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:05.640
struggled with, as documented in this show, for a long time.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.480
I feel like I've reached a conclusion.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.880
There's still some software stuff I have to pull off to do all fancy on-the-road recording,

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.240
but I got time to figure that out because I'm not going anywhere for a while.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.320
And it feels great.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.320
It's just wonderful.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:21.540
It's wonderful to be super happy with a setup, and to feel like I didn't have to compromise

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:22.760
on the hardware.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.720
You know, I could have lived with 16 gigs of RAM, but 32 gigs of RAM gives me a lot

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.400
more headroom.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.800
And I didn't get it with dedicated graphics, but I planned down the road to get an eGPU,

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.800
and I'll just invest in that.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:43.380
So I think Thunderbolt 3, and going 1080p, will be the biggest long-term game changers

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:47.300
for me, because I can go with higher resolution monitors externally if I want, I can hook

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.580
up Thunderbolt docs if I want, I can hook up eGPUs.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:55.520
So it seems like, you match that with 32 gigs of RAM, and an i7 that has four cores that

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.080
can turbo up to 4.2 gigahertz, I think it's got a lot of runway.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.920
So I can really invest in getting this thing set up right.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.280
Pumped about it.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.280
Sounds awesome.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:08.880
Yeah, if you pop an eGPU, like it's not in there next to it.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.880
How's your Mac?

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.880
I can see being a pretty...

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:11.880
Your Macbook holding up?

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:12.880
Yeah.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.880
What?

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880
No?

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:15.880
No?

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:16.880
Problems?

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:23.720
Yeah, so this is a replacement Macbook, and the keyboard does not function.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:28.360
So this is a newer replacement machine, and you're already using a new keyboard?

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:34.960
Yeah, it was from I think a month ago I took the other one in, because it was having issues.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.280
And they kindly just gave me basically the same computer, right?

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.920
They just swapped it out.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:44.800
Although I did not know that when they do that, I guess I should have known, it's always

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.360
a refurb usually.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.120
Yes.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:52.160
And I can tell you why this computer was given back to the Genius Bar.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160
Keyboard.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.160
Keyboard.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:58.680
The irony is I'm traveling again next week, and I have an Apple thing I need to do.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.280
It's an iOS thing.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:05.160
So I literally have to stand at the Genius Bar probably most of the day tomorrow.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.640
That is so frustrating.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.640
Yeah.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.240
Well, and this is something I learned the hard way.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:18.200
So I have the 15-inch 2017, but the high-end one.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:23.760
Not all Apple stores keep many of them in stock, and they will not replace it with a

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:28.400
different computer, nor, and this is the best, nor will they replace it with a 2018.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.400
Yes.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.400
Yeah.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.760
And it gets even more complicated if you do a bunch of fancy build-to-order options online,

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:34.760
you know?

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.760
Like if you upgrade a bunch of stuff.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.760
Yeah.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.760
Well, that's why I just did the high everything, well, not everything, but the standard.

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.760
You just did the default high, but even that, they don't stock.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.760
Yeah.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.760
They don't stock.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.560
And because it's the year-old model, they don't stock it at all.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:50.120
So I'm going to be in this weird situation of I have to get this crap done.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.840
And then when I say done, like deploy it onto the App Store.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:57.040
This is the only Mac I have, and it doesn't work.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.040
The VNC, baby.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.240
No, I joke, but because that's-

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.800
Honestly, if I was hoping they were going to release new Mac minis, and I was just going

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:10.400
to do a headless one and absolutely just, you know what, SSH in, write some build scripts

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.400
and do it.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.400
Just keep my Galaga would be my road machine.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.400
Yeah.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.400
Really, they should be.

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.800
You should do all this on an iPad Pro by now, and it's kind of ridiculous at this point.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.920
Well, the iPad Pros are faster than most of the Macs they sell.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:23.920
I know.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.920
Exactly.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:25.920
It really is.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:26.920
Yeah.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.440
I know what the answer to this problem is because they have that very liberal 30-day

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.440
return policy.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.440
It's I buy another one.

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.440
Oh.

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.440
Take it on the trip.

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.440
Yeah.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.920
Use it for the week I'm on the trip and just return it.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.800
Would you, though, or do you think... I could see myself being like, I like this machine.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:43.800
I'm taking it back.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.800
You know what I mean?

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.800
I don't know if I would take it back.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.800
No.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.800
You know what?

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.440
I have to say, I've had so... People email the show, and you see it.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:57.800
They tweet me just laughing about how much of a hard time I've had with these laptops.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.880
I think they're just badly made.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.880
Yeah.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.040
That keyboard was just a bad idea from the beginning, really.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.580
This is the second replacement I will have to do.

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:11.280
The Hulk says that maybe you should look into hackintoshing the Galago.

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.320
The Galago's not beefy enough, I think.

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.320
Well, maybe.

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.320
Maybe.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.800
I've hackintoshed some... Actually, laptops are the hardest thing to hackintosh, but...

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.800
Yeah.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.200
And that there's some weird stuff.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.440
Well, man, that really does stink.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.720
That really is no good.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:31.400
It's one of those situations, too, where you have this dependency on a particular type

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:35.320
of work tool, and it's, of course, one of the most expensive tools that you have.

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.120
So that's what makes it extra frustrating.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.120
And you're right, they don't...

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.120
It actually... I did the math.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.120
It literally is.

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.120
Yeah.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.120
So, yeah.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.120
Yeah.

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:48.480
It's... There is a temptation to just buy a 2018, because supposedly...

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.960
That new keyboard with that new film on there.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.320
The film fixes all these problems, but...

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.320
Yeah, I could see it.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.680
I mean, I could see that.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.480
That does seem to be what their patent implies, too.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.760
Yeah, but that would be throwing away $3,000, which is basically the original.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:03.760
Yeah.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:06.320
Yeah, they almost need to have an upgrade program like they have for the cell phones,

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.320
you know?

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.360
Or they could build better keyboards, but let's move on.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.360
Yeah, that's true.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.360
That could happen.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360
Yeah.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.880
So, one last thing before we call it.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:14.880
Sure, sure.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.560
Real quick, what are your thoughts on Linus' announcement regarding...

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.560
Oh, man.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.560
Yeah.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.560
Five minutes or less, though.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.560
So, between us.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.560
Wow.

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:34.240
You know, this story has dominated the bulk of my brain space all week, so it has been,

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.840
when the news dropped, I was floored.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.400
I've never seen Linus do anything like this before.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:47.080
Plus, he always seemed very, very convinced in his particular style of management.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:52.640
It seemed like it was sort of his personal mantra, and that he was never going to change.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:58.200
But having now followed this story very, very closely, probably to an obsessive degree,

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:03.960
I would say, and you can piece together various parts of the story, and we actually have a

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.600
timeline that's very fascinating.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:11.500
So it would appear that Linus was contacted by the New Yorker and asked some questions

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:16.840
last week about abusive behavior and behavior that prevents women from participating in

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.380
Linux kernel development.

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:23.960
At this point, last week, Linus knew that they were going to publish this article, and

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.760
I'm sure he was genuinely embarrassed by that and probably has a sincere desire to change

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.840
now that this has become very public and that he's been in the wrong.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:35.520
He has been verbally aggressive to an extreme degree.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.400
Greg KH has called him childish for it.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:42.880
He says that Linus has the language of some children, but they've generally been fairly

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.600
good-natured about it.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.920
So it would appear that then after being contacted by the New Yorker, Linus talked to various

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:54.840
top-level kernel developers, got Greg KH to agree to take over and finish up the 4.19

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.760
development cycle so Linus could take some time off and maybe return some point, maybe

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.720
4.20, maybe after.

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:07.380
Then a code of conduct was quickly chosen, and it was committed.

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:11.520
It was agreed to by a very small handful of developers.

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.160
I think it was signed off by six or four developers.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.640
If you don't include Linus and Greg, I think three other developers, where their previous

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:25.440
code of conflict was signed off by 30 or 40 developers, a much larger group.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.920
Linus then makes his public announcement, and then everybody starts reacting.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:35.200
It seems that this has really been something that's been building and been going to catch

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.120
up with Linus for a very, very long time.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:44.360
Some of the people involved have thrown down with Linus before, SageSharp and others,

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.040
years ago on the Linux kernel mailing list.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:54.000
SageSharp was then known as SarahSharp, and she was a contributor to the USB 3.0 stack,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.320
so she was an active participant in the development process, and got into a heated argument with

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.240
Linus about his behavior.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.880
It's really been on everyone's radar pretty much since that SarahSharp moment, and this

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.920
has all been building.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:13.640
All it appears, individuals went to the New Yorker to expose Linus for his abusive behavior,

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:18.720
and the New Yorker has a very strict policy of contacting any subject that is part of

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.720
an article they're writing.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.760
In fact, if I remember correctly, the New Yorker has a policy that they will at a minimum

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:30.600
try to contact you three times to the best of their ability to get statements from you.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:34.320
That is what tipped off Linus that this was coming.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.360
The New Yorker article has been published, but it was slightly modified to also reflect

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.080
his standing down, so sort of a hodgepodge article.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:45.740
When you read it, it starts with, this is what's happened, and then it takes this massive

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:54.080
turn to calling Linus a sexist abuser, which was going to be the original article.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:14:01.320
I think the question has become, will Linus even return, and will there be a fork of the

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.960
kernel that doesn't have this code of conduct?

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:08.120
The code of conduct is a separate issue, and I don't really feel like getting into it.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:11.880
I feel like it's up to the project individuals.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.160
If the individuals involved with the project that work on it day to day felt like they

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.000
needed a code of conduct, then they're probably in the best position to make that determination,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.120
not some yokel that's just watching from the outside.

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.840
I think maybe my only criticism might be the specific code of conduct they chose, because

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:31.980
it's very politically charged, especially the individuals around it are sort of lightning

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:40.120
rods for social justice issues, and it is inherently a very politically charged document

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:46.280
that is sort of infamous for these political issues.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:50.480
They picked a very well-known code of conduct, but they also picked one that comes with quite

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.280
a bit of controversy around it.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.120
It has a lot of baggage.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:00.560
The bigger picture here is Linus's apology.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:11.720
I read his apology on Linux Unplugged 267, and he seemed legitimately, genuinely sorry,

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.860
and that he'd really realized he had been...

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:19.320
He writes in there that he thought in the effort for the best patch that this was excusable,

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:23.720
and now he says he realizes that wasn't true, and he sincerely apologizes.

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:28.080
That could have ripple effects throughout open source.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:36.320
I think a lot of projects have taken the meritocracy inspiration from all great Linus, and have

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:41.960
sort of used that as their justification to maybe be a little abusive, which is a charged

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:49.760
word, but my thinking about this with Linus's behavior was, imagine if I treated West Joe

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:56.200
or Angela or you that way when there was a mistake made in the show.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:59.840
Because these are live productions, these go out to thousands of people, it's how we

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:00.840
make our living.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:03.240
If you make a mistake, it's a big deal.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.920
How the eff could you do something like this?

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:08.520
You're effing destroying us.

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:12.880
It would create a toxic work environment here.

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.120
Everybody would hate me.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.960
I would be feared, not liked.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:22.080
It would be an awful work environment if every time you made a mistake, I flew off the handle

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.320
and started cussing you out.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.480
And I know that does happen in private industry.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:32.000
We all know some famous CEOs that are well known for doing it, but it doesn't make it

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
okay.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.560
It makes it awful for everybody else that has to get that shit rained on them.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:42.840
And so when I put myself in Linus's position, and imagine myself behaving that way, it felt

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.840
wrong.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:44.840
It felt like that was-

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:45.840
Too much.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:46.840
Abusive.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.160
It is abusive, I guess.

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.800
It's verbally abusive.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.520
It's just not a good way to run a business either.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:17:03.200
So I respect and appreciate that he seems to have had a self-reflective moment and is

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:08.280
owning it, saying it's his fault, and then apologizing for it.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:14.240
And taking time away to really reflect on it and not be focused on work, but be focused

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.240
on himself.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:19.680
He even implies that he may be getting professional help.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.800
I think that's respectable, and I think that is an applaudable move.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:32.640
And he is an important contributor to technology, and I think if somebody in his position can

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:36.880
do this, I think it sets a good example for people in other open source projects, and

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:39.680
maybe even in corporations.

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:46.640
So I think him acknowledging this and stepping aside as long as he comes back is a good thing.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.960
If he doesn't come back, I think it would be a loss.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:54.840
See, that's the part that wasn't clear to me.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:58.160
I actually kind of agree with- I do agree with the criticism on Linus.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:03.080
I always felt that, especially as I've gotten more and more involved in going to Linux events

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:07.640
and stuff, there's just like a- People just aren't nice, I don't even know what to say.

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:13.400
There's a few personalities that yeah, kind of like, you know how Apple guys fake, act

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.320
like Steve Jobs, kind of guys who just act like Linus and like yell at everybody, right?

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:21.440
Oh, you're a moron if you don't know how to do this or whatever.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:33.920
But for him to be permanently like out seems- I don't know, I don't- I guess, it just seems

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:34.920
like too much.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.840
The other thing, and this is what I would be more concerned with, I hope there's not

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:42.320
serious talk about a fork.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.120
I think people are waiting to see what happens.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.600
Yeah, that would be awful.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.640
And how could you- That would be a shit show.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.200
There would probably be mini forks if that happens.

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.320
Right.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:53.240
Maybe each major distro forks.

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:59.880
Well, and also we have a lot of these big commercial players in the community now, I'm

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:02.920
thinking of you, Microsoft.

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:07.000
It seems like the community shooting itself in the foot.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.560
Like I've seen some of the, I'm sure you have too, the forums and the-

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.560
Oh man.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.560
Yeah.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.560
Woo.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.560
Yeah.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:19.040
It's worse than the systemdy stuff.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.600
Not as bad as the unity stuff though.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:27.720
I think it's not likely because the way these code of conducts are applied is literally

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:31.340
a patch is applied to the kernel source tree.

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:36.640
And you could apply future patches that could be a revision too that maybe use more clarifying

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:41.800
language and outline perhaps more roles of the enforcers.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:46.120
So the enforcers is the technical advisory board, which I think is 10 people at the Linux

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:47.760
foundation.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:53.320
And there's really nothing outlined there and what their clear responsibilities are.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.880
It's just, if you have an issue, email them.

01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:00.960
It's very vague and it's very vague on what their reach and extent is.

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:08.240
So I think they could do a patch that is a rev two that maybe changes some of this or

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:10.640
reclarify some of the language.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:13.200
It's based on the covenant code of conduct.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:16.160
It doesn't have to be the exact copy of it.

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:22.520
So yeah, I would hope that that is the route this goes is that they just refine the document

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:30.880
to be better reflective and better, more specific and then avoid a fork.

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:36.480
It's just a patch, I don't know.

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.480
I hope so.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.480
I hope so.

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:45.000
Just some of the rhetoric around it's getting a little already just a little heated, but

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
we'll see.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I think it was time.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.840
I think we're seeing this a lot of open source communities too.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.840
That's it.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:55.440
I've worked in environments where inside a company where there's been somebody who is

01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:01.700
just, they're a cursor, they're a yeller and it's their way of managing a lot of stuff

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:02.960
coming in.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:07.120
You cut down the people that don't do right and I think there's people, I think we all

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:12.920
know this is a common thing that does happen, but it feels like Linux being 27 years old

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:17.920
is at a point where it can sustain another transition.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:24.880
We can afford to be a little more inclusive because it's not a make or break diehard scrappy

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:32.400
little project that's going up against NetWare and Unix and Microsoft Windows NT.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.580
It has won.

01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:38.220
It's taken over the industry and so, and Linus himself says this in his post, there are other

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:42.620
what he calls pain points where they've had to make transitions and switch to Git from

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:48.080
Bitbucket or move around the way the patches work and who's in charge of it.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:52.920
There's been other pain points that were massive, massive transitions they've had to make.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:56.160
They just weren't as political as this one.

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.640
So that's why I do hope he makes it back because he's been there for all those other transitions

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:05.640
and he has weathered those storms and I think properly stewarded the kernel to the next

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:06.640
phase.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.880
And so he has proven that he has a track record of being able to do that.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:16.040
He's proven he has a track record of building one of the world's best kernels ever and the

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:20.040
market has rewarded him and Linux for it.

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:23.200
There's also people now that are attacking the foundation trying to call for people to

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:28.200
harass the sponsors to get someone thrown off the technical advisory board.

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:32.840
And there is also people that are posting the salaries of Linus and Greg and everybody

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.360
else and making a big stink about it.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:41.120
Everybody's freaked out and blown away that Linus in 2016 or something like that made

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.960
$1.6 million or $1.3 million as a salary.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.520
But to me, relatively yes, that's a lot of money but to the industry, for anybody high

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.440
up in the industry, it's not.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:59.760
You know, as an example, in 2016, Johnny Ive just got a $30 million bonus, or it might

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.560
have even been $60 million.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.560
Just a bonus.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.560
It was just ridiculous.

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:04.560
Yeah.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:07.840
And he's got hundreds of millions in stock options.

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:11.720
And my point is Tim Cook's doing all right too.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:17.400
The Linux foundation and this entire industry that runs Linux would not exist without Linus.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:21.200
So the fact that the foundation and all those fat cats at the foundation that are sitting

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.040
around doing management stuff wouldn't have a payroll.

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:27.380
They would have to go out and do other jobs if it wasn't for Linus.

01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:34.120
So the fact that the top guy who created this thing is making 1.6 mil is not a great deal.

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.360
That's not relatively as much money as it could be.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.320
In 2000, Steve Jobs offered him a job to come work for Apple.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:45.640
He'd probably be way, way richer if he had taken Steve Jobs' job offer in 2000.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:50.360
So yeah, 1.6 is a lot, but I don't think it's worth the witch hunt that's brewing over it

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.360
on Twitter right now.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.360
I agree.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:56.440
Well, Mr. Dominic, anything else you feel like getting off your chest before we get

01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:57.440
out of here?

01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.400
Or are you ready to go stand in line at that Apple store?

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.640
I'm ready to go stand in line at the Genius Bar.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:06.820
Well, in the meantime, people should go check out the new project, griffinradar.com.

01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:08.140
Is that what it was?

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:09.220
That's right.

01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:11.320
And anything else you want to plug?

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.280
At Domenico on Twitter and Linux Academy.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.280
There you go.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:20.080
Linux Academy has a $2.99 sale going on, and I mention this because they extended it.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:25.120
That's less than $30 a month, and it locks that price in forever, as long as you remember,

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.900
for all their new content and everything.

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:27.900
It's going on right now.

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.940
I think it ends on the 24th.

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.360
It's a pretty good deal, so it's worth checking out.

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.540
I'm at Chris LAS.

01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:35.620
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:36.620
Go follow him at Domenico.

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:41.520
And a big thank you to Mr. Payne, Mr. Wes Payne, for filling in while I was out.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.760
Much appreciated.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.760
Everybody loves Wes.

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:44.760
Thank you.

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:45.760
Maybe we'll read some of those love letters next week.

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.760
Oh, yeah.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:25:13.840
Thanks, everybody.
