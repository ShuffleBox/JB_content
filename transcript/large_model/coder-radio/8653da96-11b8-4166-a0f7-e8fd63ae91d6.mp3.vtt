00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 449 for January 17th, 2022.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Hello friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
and the world of technology.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
My name is Chris and joining us right now, right at his microphone,

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
it's our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Hello, hello, hello.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Oh, listen to you. You sound good. You sound strong. You sound well fed.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
I'm well fed. I'm on 64 gigs of RAM on my Pangolin.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
I am rocking it out. As my son would say, I am rocking this party.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Let's go. That's what my son says all the time. Everything's let's go.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I think it's a YouTube thing.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Mine is, let's rock. He saw Sing, the old one, the first one.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
And I guess somebody must say, let's rock this party.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Okay. All right. Okay. Now I was just making references to,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
here I am scrolling on my Twitter and Twitter really wants me to see

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
your delicious steak that you're grilling up these days.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
It was epic.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I kind of feel like you're on a roll with the food.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
I mean, have you entered a new phase of like cooking?

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Is this like our buddy Brent, he likes to cook to like clear his mind, right?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
He gets Zen when he's cooking.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
I love grilling. And since I live in Florida, otherwise known as,

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
is it summer still?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Is it always summer there? I don't,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
I can't remember the last time I saw the sky to be honest with you.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I put on a sweater and long pants because it was 60 degrees.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
You bastard.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
And it wasn't just a sweater. Can we still say this?

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
It was full on Cosby sweater. Like it was, it wasn't like a light little thing.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
No, it was.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Well, can I just say that I really liked that visual.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I mean, my Cosby sweater grilling.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yes. Yes.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
And I slept in the, in the coder robe,

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
which I will say for heat retention is what you want.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Oh yeah.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
You want to wrap an Xbox 360 in it.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
People who come visit me at the studio have to just live with the fact that I'm

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
rocking a robe all the time.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
They just got to get their heads around that cause it's, it's what's happening.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
So we got some emails into the show from last week's episode.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
We kind of were given the wall street journal a hard time for saying that Apple

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
was bullying people with the blue dots in iMessage.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Well, Liam writes in and he says the green shame is real.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
He says, Hey geezers, as someone who went to high school, the post in the post

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
iPhone world, I can confirm the green bubble bullying does exist for the clicks

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
that care iPhones are a status symbol.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
And in some people's eyes, you'll be seen as quote a poor.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
If you don't send blue bubbles, he goes on to point out that, yeah, of course,

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
SMS and MMS is a huge disaster.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Google is incompetent, but he wraps it up with this.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
It's Americans' refusals to abandon SMS.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Apple wanted to do more than SMS offered and saw a fantastic way to market their

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
platform.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Google wanted to copy their success, but got bored after a few years.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
The problem with both platforms is SMS was still dragged along to communicate

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
with each other.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
I've managed to convert most of my friends to Telegram over the years, but I

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
doubt most Americans will ever switch away from SMS, iMessage or whatever a big

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
platform slash market buys next.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
We had several in this regard, but we had one more that I thought we should touch

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
on.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Isn't people rejecting green bubbles?

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Aren't they actually rejecting the crappy functionality of SMS?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Isn't that what's actually happening?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
And it's represented as a green bubble.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
And perhaps they don't understand that it's the show that is SMS.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
But that's really what's happening is consumers are saying you're degrading our

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
experience.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
We want everyone to have a blue bubble.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
And then what they're really saying is we don't want anybody using SMS.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
I mean, teenagers, I know a lot's changed in the world, but teenagers are still

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
kind of dicks, right?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
And always have been.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
So if it wasn't this, I think they would just find something else.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
I mean, I remember when I was a kid, the BMX biking was like the new thing,

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
right?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
You know, the Dave Muir, all that kind of stuff.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Sure.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
The rich kids like had the whatever.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
I don't remember the name of the brand right now, but the brand name bike,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
right?

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
You know, the fancy bike was whatever Tony Hawk's brand of skateboard,

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
all that kind of crap.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
And the normal kids had like Walmart, right?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Like Mongoose was the Walmart brand.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
I guess I feel like kids are just jerks and are going to make fun of kids who

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
don't have what they have.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
There is an element of that.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
So Rundle wrote in and said, you know, it's really bad in the group chats.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
One on one, you know, it's not so bad the platforms can kind of coexist.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
But in group chats, that's kind of where the whole bullying dynamic gets

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
created because it's sort of it's an inclusion issue where some don't really

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
get to participate and some even get excluded from a group chat because they

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
don't have the functionality.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
And we also had a listener write in that said that they are aware of stories

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
where teenagers threaten self-harm if they didn't get iPhones because there's

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
so much social pressure around this.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
The general sentiment was you and I were just not young enough to appreciate

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
how much of a real issue this is.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
But I'm still not convinced by any of these emails that Apple necessarily has

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
a special blame here.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
First of all, they invested billions to make their brand kind of a prestigious

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
brand, and they built a good user experience.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
And what's the point of doing all that if not to leverage it all to create

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
something that people like more than SMS?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Google wishes they could do this, right?

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
They wish they were in this position, and they absolutely would be trying to

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
keep people on their own chat platform if they could.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And since we've been on the air, they've launched two more chat platforms.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
What would obviously solve this, and I think would be a very savvy move on

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Apple's part, is release an iMessage app for Android.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I know there was those emails where they debated it, and that's where some of

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
this bullying angle comes from.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
So I'm in this place where we had a few listeners who were kind of like,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
okay, old guys, but this is upsetting and it's bad for us.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
And I don't want to poop on their experiences here.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
But is this not the same thing, and I can use an example because there's a

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
teenage girl who lives in my house and I now understand the horror that is

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
that, you know, who has the coach bag versus the insert generic target brand

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
here, right?

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
Isn't it like the same thing or just like, you know, who has the PS5?

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
It just feels like normal kid crap that I'm happy to blame Apple for lots of

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
stuff, but this is like they did a good job.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
They made the luxury version of the product, and now you're asking them to

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
not be a luxury brand.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
It's like, would you ask Neiman Marcus to be more like Walmart because like

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Neiman Marcus is fancy and people might be snooty about it.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
One aspect of this is having kids myself.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
I've watched them as they get older become aware of brands.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
You know, they kind of go from being completely oblivious to brands or such

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
a thing to becoming aware of brands.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
And then in some cases, giving a lot of thought of what brands do I like?

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
You know, that's an interesting psychological thing that they go through

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
where they start kind of attaching themselves to different brands as time

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
goes on and thinking about it from that perspective.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
So I can understand the cultural issue there.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
But the other thing that's difficult here is if it's that big of an issue.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
Well, then I mean, like I got my kids an iPod touch on eBay for 80 bucks.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
An iPhone XR is still a fantastic phone.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
It's going to get updates for years.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
You can get it for $180 on eBay.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
I don't even really buy the price argument really.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I can only really understand two reasons why people wouldn't do it.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
Philosophical, they refuse to participate in Apple or they don't know.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
They're uneducated.

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
They are an uneducated consumer and that is rife with issues.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
I could think of another reason, actually, for a kid.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
I know this is like blasphemy, especially for a tech dude.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I don't and maybe I'll beat my words.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
I don't know that giving young kids smartphones is appropriate.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
But if they're on an Android device and they have green bubbles,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
I think that's already been that that hurdles already been.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Well, you've already right. You've OK. You've already crossed that line.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah. Then when does it stop?

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Are you buying like a bootleg console now?

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
Like you saw you saw the email that the listener wrote in that said that

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
they know of a kid that got a brand new brand new Galaxy

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
and they wanted to take him back for an iPhone.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
I don't know. I mean, Apple did a good job with branding.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah, I'm still struggling. It feels really like Google blew it and Apple didn't.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
And now what happens is people kind of I hate this.

08:36.000 --> 08:45.000
But human nature seems to be to like use shame to get people to adopt the cultural norms.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
And it's gross. But what we and we kind of notice it when it happens in a new area.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
But we kind of turn a blind eye once we've all kind of adopted that new norm

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
and we don't really pay attention and notice it anymore.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
And I don't like it at all.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
And I think in part why things like WhatsApp and Telegram do really well.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
And I think one of the reasons why they do really well outside the states

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
is because SMS and Americans it was a weird adoption with texting.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
It took us a while to get it.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
And when we finally did get it, it was SMS that stuck.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
Where other nations kind of took cellular technology to a new level faster.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
They adopted it at a different point and they adopted messaging a lot faster as well.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
And so when something like WhatsApp or Telegram comes along,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
they're really proficient in these domains.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Where Americans are kind of stuck in the early days of cell with our carriers,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
with the way we treat our phones, all of it.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
In fact, there's even still really just unspoken weird norms between generations.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
I'm shocked when my phone just rings and somebody's calling me out of nowhere,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
which is generally somebody, one of the older members of my family.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Because anybody my age usually sends me a text first, say, hey, are you around?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Can we chat?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
You know, we usually do that kind of thing.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
And then, you know, and my kids, my kids, they don't really ever call each other

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
unless they're gaming.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
And then they FaceTime each other.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
It's like they have the weird, they're always texting unless it's gaming time.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I've noticed that it's so strange to me.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
The solution is, is to educate people to get off of any of these proprietary

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
platform specific chat applications.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Oh, dude.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Do some research, find the one that works for you and move.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
You know, it just takes somebody in your group to have a little leadership.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
We've drug people between Viber and Slack and Telegram.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
I mean, like, you know, it's just, you've got to just set a path

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
and get people to move.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I know it sounds impossible, especially with kids.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
I'm being idealistic there, but Discord has gotten, has picked up a lot of this too.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
You know, Discord has benefited a lot.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
So we're seeing a real fracturing in the market.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
People, I think around our age, at least in my family and kind of friend group,

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
are using like Slack or Teams, literally depending on what their organization bought, right?

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
There's weirdos like me and you who still use IRC, but that's such a dying.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
I mean, but all the younger folks that I know, especially my like teenagers, like relatives,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
they're in Discord all damn day, all day.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
And it's like their one program, Discord, their one chat program.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Yeah.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It's Slack for all the casuals.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Right.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
Listener Chris writes in, and we were talking last week about FakerJS and ColorJS

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
and how they took down the GitHub account and kind of brought us onto the topic

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
of how we've really more and more over the years landed on,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
if you really need something, you got to host it yourself.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
And listener Chris writes, I agree, but isn't there a way to enjoy the best of both worlds?

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Like for example, put your code up on GitHub and then mirror it on your own instance

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
with GitLab or GitT or whatever you use so that when they do take it down,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
it's their loss, not yours.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Is there a sweet spot?

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
When I thought about this question, I tried to zoom it out to, you know, small operations,

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
but operations like yours and mine have infrastructure, you know,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
so that means more infrastructure.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Where do you draw the line?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Something I've been thinking about recently,

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
as we're rebuilding a couple of our servers here at the studio,

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
we have nearly 45 servers in the cloud, and we have one server now,

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
and we're going to two, maybe even three servers here in the studio for storage purposes,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
just to kind of cache stuff locally.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
So my infrastructure and how much I'm willing to invest in all of this

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
and where I allocate, that's all been on my mind recently,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
especially, I guess, because it's the beginning of the year,

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
and I'm thinking like, okay, this is the time to really sort this out.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
You know, more and more, I find myself going more towards self-hosting.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I used to be cloud all the things.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
Now I'm kind of getting, well, but, you know, in the cloud,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
somebody else ultimately holds the data and gets to decide when,

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
if ever things get deleted, hint, it's almost never,

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
you have to pay an ongoing fee, and if you have the expertise at some point,

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
so like I self-host GitLab, right, and it just ends up being cheaper

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
for what I need than using GitHub, you know, enterprise.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Now granted, I self-host GitLab CE, so that's whatever.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
The big thing I think is my email, and the problem with that,

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
it's so hard to get out of Google for a business once you've been in it for years

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
that I don't even know how I would do that migration.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Yeah, I hear you on that.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
Because there's like documents, there's contracts, there's documentation.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
You mess the DNS up and you don't get email for a couple of days.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Right.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Well, and it's just having that searchability and drive, honestly,

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
to be like, you know, this customer came back from like a year and a half ago

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
and they want an update, I don't even remember like this, you know,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
what we did, right, what the configuration was.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
So being able to go and see, oh, okay, so this is running like Python, whatever,

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Rails, whatever, go from there.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
Having said that, I find myself more and more kind of creeped out

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
by just the pent-opticon I appear to be living in.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
I think if I were to do it all over again, if there was like a, you know,

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
we did Alice in Wonderland this time, so let's say like a Wizard of Oz

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
themed company, it probably would be self-hosted.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
And I would listen to self-hosted every week to get my tips.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Heyo, self-hosted.show.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
I have a lot more comfort with something that, say, I host up on Linode

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
that I build or install the application and I run a thing there

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
than something where I go to a company and I pay a service for that application.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
I think in part because it feels more like my own infrastructure.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
But where it gets tricky for me is the sweet spot for self-hosting

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
is things that require a lot of storage or we're also considering

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
doing some of our encoding here just because then we don't even have to

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
bring the files up to the cloud, we can just do it all here,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
which would have some advantages.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
So we're looking at that kind of workflow stuff and where to kind of

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
split the difference.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
And over the night, one of the services that is hosted on,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
I don't want to out them because they're friends of the show,

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
our website's old.

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
It's been running on this service for, I don't know, 12 years.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It's old school.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
A friend of the network set it up for us over there,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
really helped us out a lot over the years.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
But there was like an explosion in Canada last night and it took out

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
their fiber lines to their data center.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
So the Jupiter Broadcasting website was down from about the point

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
we published Linux Unplugged until about 4 a.m. this morning.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
That stinks, right?

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
And it's like one point of failure and it's on an old stack.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
And my thought right there was if I was self-hosting this,

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
I would just probably spin this up on another Linode in a different area

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
or something or I would fire it up here and open up the port.

15:40.000 --> 15:48.000
You have that kind of self-control and governance when you have that.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
There's not much I could do other than – well, I couldn't –

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
the backups are stored there too actually now that I think about it.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
That's not good.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
But so yeah, I don't even really have a –

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
I couldn't really even get to the backup.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
It's stored on a different system,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
but you still have to connect to the same data center.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
So yeah, there's not much I could do and I just had to wait it out.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
And considering an explosion knocked it out

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
and they got it back up within 24 hours, I suppose that's a good thing.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
But it made me think a little bit about in the future

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
when we address that old infrastructure, which we're going to try to do this year,

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
how do I really want to run it and do I want to self-host?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
And I think I do.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
I think for that, for our website, I think I do

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
because I want to do something a lot simpler too.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
So it shouldn't be a big bunch of overhead.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
I don't know.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I'm still on the fence.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
I'd like to know what the audience thinks too.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Yeah.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
One last email before we wrap up the feedback section.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Josh writes it.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Hey guys, I recently found out about JetBrains' new VS Code competitor, Fleet.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Right now it's in closed beta, but there's a few videos out there showcasing it.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
What are your thoughts on it?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Do you think it'll replace VS Code for you guys?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Keep up the good show, Josh.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
Would you be willing to give JetBrains' text editor, it's an IDE really, a go?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Yeah, I'm definitely going to try it out.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
Am I going to drop VS Code?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Probably not.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
I mean, I'm always looking for the best tool for the job.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
You know, as we've said for going on 13 years now,

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
I have to say for a paid tool, they have a hell of a bar to hit.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
Since VS Code has effectively replaced PyCharm and RubyMine for me,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
which are also JetBrains products.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
And clearly they need a Mario extension, you know, to compete with VS Code.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Yes.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
That's so great.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
And I'll be amazed if Nintendo hasn't DMCA'd it yet,

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
but that you can place the original Mario Brothers in VS Code.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
It's a TypeScript extension.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Yeah, that's pretty great.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
Okay, so there's like weird innovation and competition going on in the text editor.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
And honestly, the terminal space, I didn't even put this in the doc because I was lazy today,

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
but I'm using a terminal that Wes recommended called Tabby when I'm on Linux.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
It's pretty good.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And I'm using Warp on Mac.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
I don't know what's going on, but dev tools have never been better.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
So to answer the writer's question, yeah, I'm definitely going to try Fleet.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
And if it hits a, you know, a spot that I need it, I'll use it.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
I mean, I have no, you know, like weird loyalty to VS Code.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
I just, you know, the big caveat is VS Code is free.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah, the real question is what does it take now to unseat VS Code?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
How good does the product have to be?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
They do have a few things in here.

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
They have it built in to connect to remote machines and do like the build on a remote machine.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
They have Google Docs like integration, so you can create a shared workspace.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
You can have people join yours, real time collaboration in there, that kind of stuff.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
It's all integrated.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
And of course, they write built from scratch based on 20 years of our experience developing IDEs.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
And of course, they've baked in IntelliJ, so that's all in there.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Yeah, I mean, it's a Java editor, right?

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
Like all their products are, so that's fine, I guess.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
VS Code is like, I don't know.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
It just seems like such a high par.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Yeah.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
And I really want it to work.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
But I'm trying to think, like, what would they have to?

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
Okay, the only annoying thing in VS Code is the same annoying thing I think all the apps have on Linux.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
That it doesn't seem like it's zoomed in right.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
It's always seems small.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Thank you.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Freaking thank you.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
I feel like I'm an old man going into the accessibility and it's still not all, even when I crank it up, it's still not appropriate.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
It's something not right.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
But it's fine on Mac, which is weird.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
It's like, fine.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
It adopts the system.

19:38.000 --> 19:47.000
But on Linux, like I ended up pumping the font up until I realized there's just a, it's like control plus to zoom in the editor section.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And then it looks like it makes sense.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
You got to do both, right?

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
You got to pump the font a little bit and then pop up the whole UI one.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
But then sometimes I swear to God, it runs slower when you do that.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
It does.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
I shouldn't have said anything.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
But I have a feeling that's one of those like weird Linux issues where the people like electron just doesn't really care.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Here's what they say about fleet in the frequently asked questions.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
The question is, will fleet be open source?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Here's their answer.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
No, we are considering open sourcing parts of the product or the technology behind it.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Stay tuned for details.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Doesn't that sound like open court?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah, we can't call it that.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
No, they're going to open source enough that people build extension because that's really the strength of VSCode, right?

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Is that somebody literally took the time to write a Mario extension.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Yeah.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
God bless them.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Good luck.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Linode.com slash coder.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit and you go there to support the show.

20:42.000 --> 20:51.000
If you just need a simple personal server for a blog or a portfolio, maybe a game server or you're looking to set up a VPN, you can trust Linode has you covered.

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
But if your business needs something that's reliable and can scale when you go viral, well, Linode can help there as well.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
In fact, they reliably serve millions of visitors every single day.

21:01.000 --> 21:08.000
And unlike entry level hosting services that lock you into their platform, Linode gives you the full back end access and customize.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
So you can control your server in a way that fits your needs.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
And over time, I've only had to do that a couple of times where I've really got down to the metal.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
But I've always been impressed with what they let me do and what they trust their users with.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
And their DNS manager allows you to easily switch your domain over to a new server.

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
You can manage SSL certificates and all of the tooling is open source.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Their back end is fast.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
They have 11 data centers for you to choose from.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
In fact, they could be perfect for a multi cloud strategy in that regard as well.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
So why not try that $100 to test it out?

21:39.000 --> 21:45.000
Maybe use it as an opportunity to performance test your network because they have 40 gigabit connections coming into their systems.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
So you could really test things and learn about things.

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
And they have tutorials to help you get up and going like with something like Iper, for example, if you do want to do some diagnostics.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
We use it for everything we've deployed in the last two and a half years.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
And with pricing 30% to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers,

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
it's kind of obvious why 66% of companies out there are looking to save money with a mix of alternative cloud providers

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
instead of relying on just one locked in hyperscaler.

22:11.000 --> 22:18.000
Go check out Linode, support the show and get $100 to kick the tires. linode.com slash coder.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Do you have a home server?

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
The concept maybe is a little normal now, especially for developers or people in IT.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
But there was a time where Microsoft was trying to sell a product called the home server.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
And I got a little audio for you guys.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
This is something really special.

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
Picture Microsoft trying to convince the general public that they need a server at home.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
Hey, Billy. Daddy and I brought home a Windows Home Server to help organize our family.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
What's that?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Well, Billy, a server is...

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Me! I'm a stay-at-home server!

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Wow!

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
Let's go, Billy. I'll show you what a stay-at-home server is all about.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
I'll have him home by dinner.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Eh, keep him till morning.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Okay.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
Servers work in offices, helping to connect and protect the information of the people who work there.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Why don't you work in an office?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Your home is my office.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
I work for your family, doing the same types of things that those servers do in the office.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
They think they're so special with their striped pantaloons and business jargon.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Staying home is a full-time job!

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Okay, let's go.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
Now, with Windows Home Server, your grandma can see pictures from your last soccer game she missed.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
She had Bridge Club.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
Well, grandma did lose some dough on a pony named Bridge.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I love ponies!

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
So does grandma.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
So that was Microsoft's, like, convince you to buy a Home Server ad from back in the day.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
And I got one of these things. Did you ever see these?

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
They were about a book tall, they weren't very big, and you could stuff several drives in them?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I mean, I know about the meme, but...

24:00.000 --> 24:07.000
It was a typical Microsoft thing, where they tried to work with a few OEMs, so HP put out a bunch of hype, a couple of others did,

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
and then Microsoft, I think, worked with HP to produce this Home Server,

24:11.000 --> 24:18.000
and they even did a special version of Windows Server where they pooled the disk together and they created media shares,

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
and that's how I could stream videos to my PlayStation for a bit.

24:22.000 --> 24:28.000
And the product wasn't really that bad, but only about two years in or so, Microsoft eventually killed it,

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
even though a rather large community grew up that was deploying and developing applications to run on it,

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
and there was a whole ecosystem being created.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
But Microsoft just felt like they couldn't convince the public to run a Home Server.

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
And now here we are, you know, some seven or eight years later, maybe ten years, and self-hosting,

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
and people running things on a Raspberry Pi or a spare PC is more popular than ever.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
You have things like Plex, and there's a ginormous category of open-source applications

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
just for the purpose of running on people's home network on their Home Server.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
So do you have anything like this at home?

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
Kind of. I mean, it's not used for the family, but I have a Mac Mini build server.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
You don't throw Plex on there or something?

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
No, I always want to get into the Plex thing, and then I'm too lazy to actually...

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
Oh, it's great. Jellyfin, also quite great. Free version.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Which one is Jellyfin?

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
Jellyfin is essentially a community rebuild of Plex without the subscription parts.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Oh.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
Yeah, and I think Plex has a little bit more polish,

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
but Plex also has to kind of go down the rabbit hole of trying to look legitimate,

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
so they're trying to do lots of partnerships with junky movies and streaming stuff,

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
and Jellyfin doesn't bother with any of that. Just let you stream your stuff on your server.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
So Jellyfin's like, put all your pirated sh** on me and we'll be fine.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Great.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
But something that I've been wondering, and I think this would be something the audience

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
probably could give us some feedback on, is I'm considering taking a box

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
and just setting it up as a VM server, probably using something called Proxmox,

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
which is essentially a Linux distro that just creates a tool that you can create new VMs

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
or containers on. It gives you a whole web UI to manage everything, kind of like VMware ESX.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
Then I thought from there I could do a lot of fun experimentation stuff,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
but I don't really have anything specific in mind yet,

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
but that's kind of where I'm drifting towards is a big VM server with some storage,

26:25.000 --> 26:31.000
and then just spin up stuff, testing on demand, that kind of thing.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
But I'll put a link to that. Mommy, why is there a server in the house animation video?

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
There's some weird innuendos in there.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
I think Microsoft was trying to like shock people a little bit to get them to share it.

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
Yeah, the mom being like, keep them overnight. I'm like, I don't know about that.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
Yeah, and then like the grandma really likes ponies.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
And then there's like another one later on.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Because grandpa's on like a horse. Is that what you're going for?

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
No, no, I don't think so. My God, dude. I don't know.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I don't know what the implication was.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
Listen, Balmer did a lot of weird shit.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
I was going to mention too that Blizzard just did a big layoff.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
They just laid off like 40 employees or something like that recently.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Wow. Yeah, I don't know what's going on.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
I don't know if it's, I think it's some like scandal thing.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
I don't think it's like a financial thing.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Aren't they in like trouble again?

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Because they're Activision, right? Doesn't Activision own Blizzard?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
I think so.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
Yeah, so they're in some kind of, I don't, we were the wrong show to talk about this.

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
But I could have sworn they got in some kind of like legal issue with the state of California.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
Oh, probably. That sounds about right. That sounds about right.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
Speaking of getting in trouble in the state of California, a Twitter thread cropped up just a little bit

27:40.000 --> 27:46.000
after we recorded last week that were screenshots of emails from Apple execs where they're basically debating,

27:46.000 --> 27:52.000
I think we should be getting a 30% cut of Lyft and Uber's membership programs.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
Like not just in-app purchases, but the membership programs that of course,

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
they knew Uber and Lyft were inevitably about to launch.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
So that is about to happen.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
June 26, 2018, Apple's going back and forth debating if they should get a cut or not.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Like they're the king, you know?

28:09.000 --> 28:16.000
Yeah, so it's also Monday and I saw you taking a victory lap.

28:16.000 --> 28:22.000
Listen, I have been a bit of a B-I-T-C-H about this because I was right the entire time.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
And yeah, so they want to put up a little toll booth and be on the iPhone and be like,

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
yo, you're taking money. We'll take 30% of that.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Oh, or maybe 15. Sorry.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
So, you know, around the world, there is a lot of legal action against Apple and Google.

28:37.000 --> 28:43.000
Some of it is in regards to how in-app purchases are handled, if third-party payment services are allowed.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
This has happened in South Korea. It's happened in the Netherlands.

28:46.000 --> 28:54.000
And we have some details on how Apple and Google plan to handle this kind of situation

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
where they have to, by law, allow a third-party payment system.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
And it's truly twisted.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
You know, it's brilliant. It's amazing.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
It is. It's diabolical.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
Apple's approach to allowing third-party payments for in-app purchases in the Netherlands

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
will follow Google's approach in South Korea.

29:15.000 --> 29:21.000
So, like we expected on the show, Google set the framework with their approach in South Korea,

29:21.000 --> 29:28.000
exactly like we called it, and now Apple is going to allow developers to use these third-party payment systems,

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
and they will still need to pay Apple a fee, even if they use Stripe, etc.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
And when you consider that they still have to pay Apple a fee,

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
and now they have to pay Stripe a fee in total, they're going to be paying more.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Apple and Google are going to tell developers, basically,

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
fine, instead of giving us a 30% cut, the fee is now 26%.

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
Once you give Stripe their 2.9% and plus 30% per transaction with a worse user experience,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
you're overall going to be worse off.

29:57.000 --> 30:03.000
It's a diabolical way where Apple and Google have figured out a way to meet the letter of the law, but not the spirit.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
So you essentially end up as a developer paying more.

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
You get a worse user experience, and Apple and Google get to claim that they followed the law

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
and that they're all good. They can go back now to their work.

30:15.000 --> 30:23.000
You have to at least appreciate the truly satanic level of elegance in this system,

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
because you know that they're also going to have some API,

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
that all these third-party processors have to use.

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
Just like when you get a W2 or a 1099, the IRS already knows what you made.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
There's literally no reason for you to fill out a tax return unless you own a business.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
But they want to see if you're going to try to lie, and they're going to fine you.

30:43.000 --> 30:50.000
Apple's just going to let you fork yourself over, and they may in fact make more money.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Seriously, it's unbelievable.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah, it's just now Stripe also gets a piece of the pie.

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
And your 2.9% goes right to hell the minute somebody whips out an Amex, by the way.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
Oh, man. Way to go.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
It's beautiful.

31:07.000 --> 31:13.000
The message kind of is, is don't f*** with us because this is what we're going to do, and you're going to be worse off.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
Yeah, I mean, they effectively won the Epic case, right?

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
Like, they won. I don't know what to say. They're going to win.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
We have thoughts about the EU, Ms. Nuland, if you're there.

31:23.000 --> 31:28.000
Wow, really? I don't know. I mean, is that? OK, I'm going to do it, but...

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
F*** the EU.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
That's right.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
Nobody's going to get that reference, though. You know, they're just going to think we're, you know...

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
You know, people really don't get it.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
I tried to explain to some folks who were over this weekend why I find that so hilarious.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
And they asked me if I've been, like, doing crack. So that's how that conversation ended.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Victoria Nuland. That's who you go look up. Victoria Nuland. You can look it up.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
Do you know what else Ms. Nuland would hate?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
What?

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
AR and VR headsets, baby.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
That's true. That's very true.

31:57.000 --> 32:07.000
Yeah, what do you think of this? The rumor is M1 Pro-like performance, 8K display, and a $2,000 price tag for an Apple AR VR headset.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
This is coming from Gurman. So, of course, everybody in the Apple community snapped up and listened.

32:12.000 --> 32:18.000
I mean, I have not yet been convinced that this is something anybody should want. So...

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
True.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
I totally buy, like, the HoloLens, the enterprise, like, industrial use for these things.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
And I think that's very, very interesting and, like, a cool place for development.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
So gaming would be the obvious use, right? For consumers.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
Yeah, you know they're going to lean on the Apple Arcade developers to port over.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
Have you played many Apple Arcade game circuits?

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
I mean, a couple of them are good. A couple of them.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Yeah, I mean, two grand is a lot of money.

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
Oh, I agree. The price needs to be $600 all-in, like, with accessories that you need and everything.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Yeah, first of all, it'll never be $600 all-in from Apple.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
No, no.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
I mean, I feel like this is a thing where everybody wants this to happen, and by everybody I mean Apple and Facebook,

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
and I will go to my deathbed as calling them Facebook because that's who they are.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
By the way, according to Gurman, he says,

33:05.000 --> 33:15.000
I've been told pretty directly that the idea of a completely virtual world where users escape to, like what they might do in the meta platforms, that's off limits from Apple.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
That's what Gurman writes.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
So then, what is it?

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
I'll tell you. And I'll tell you why you're going to buy it, too.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Oh, because I'll drink too much and have my credit card out with it.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
That's why I'm going to buy anything.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
You know who the customer is? Anybody who bought AirPod Maxes.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Son of a bitch. That's me.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.000
I know. And I'll tell you why. Imagine a world where we've actually kind of resumed travel again,

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
and you can slip on your AirPod Maxes and this headset.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
So you got like nearly $2,800 worth of Apple gear on your head.

33:46.000 --> 33:53.000
But when you're on the airplane, you are in the most awesome, amazing theater with great experience

33:53.000 --> 34:00.000
where Apple has worked with content developers and creators to create movie experiences and television experiences specifically for this device.

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
You've got your AirPod Maxes sound with their virtual surround sound, which is actually quite legit,

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
and you've got the noise canceling in there.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
You have got the greatest experience for a theater on the plane you could possibly think of.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
It's going to make traveling so much better in that regard.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
Secondarily, and I've mentioned this to you before, if you had a real big Zoom culture,

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
everybody was doing video meetings all the time, this would be a lot better experience.

34:25.000 --> 34:32.000
And say you could buy some like Android version for $600, and you and I could be in a virtual studio right now.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
And because we don't actually have to worry about the acoustics of the virtual room,

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
we could even have an audience with chairs where people could come and actually attend a virtual Coda radio event

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
with you and I sitting there. I could have a virtual mixer in there.

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
And we could be putting on a show in a virtual reality where you could see my movements, my hand.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
I'm moving my hands about right now as I talk, and you would see me doing that.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
And we could flag each other. When we're doing shows in the studio, the hosts that are in studio with me,

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
we have hand gestures and flags when somebody says, hey, I want to get a word in or something like that.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Or we can just look at each other.

35:03.000 --> 35:10.000
Just that kind of unspoken body language while you're recording makes the show flow so much smoother.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
You don't have people talking over each other. There's no weird pauses. It's just fantastic.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
And you could get that in a virtual environment, and you could have people attend.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
It could be like a real thing that we put on on the regular.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
So you kind of think about it in like the context of like company meetings

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
where everybody goes to a meeting or a Zoom event where you're collaborating.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
And you start thinking it's already happening.

35:30.000 --> 35:36.000
I mean, like the Home Assistant open source project was a massive project that's really moving very aggressively.

35:36.000 --> 35:41.000
They do all of their content and development planning in VR now as a team.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
They said it's been very effective because one of the things is that it's lower latency

35:46.000 --> 35:52.000
because you're not streaming H.264 video bits. You're streaming just the positional data.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
And so you get a lower latency experience as well.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
And you can see when someone's looking down at their laptop or doing whatever.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
So it's those kinds of use cases.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
And I could see Apple being particularly good at it with the App Store model.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
You got family sharing. You've got the fact that if you maybe buy it,

36:08.000 --> 36:14.000
if you buy the app for your VR headset thing, you also have the iPhone equivalent thing or watch controls.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
You could see them integrating it pretty good with the ecosystem.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Better than probably anybody else could.

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
So if I make a cup of coffee, are they going to charge me 30% if I'm in my VR meetings with you?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
We talked about this last week. Excuse me.

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
I definitely could see because we live in a nightmare hellscape of a time,

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
us doing like a JB, I don't know, conference, right?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Theater.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
Right. Like where we get all the hosts together and it's like I'm ragging on the BSD guys,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
even though I don't think they're still around.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
We have Alan there just so we can make fun of him, right?

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Just so we can make fun of him.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
The BSD now hasn't been shown a while, but we're going to do it anyway.

36:50.000 --> 36:56.000
But two grand for like regular people who aren't producing content that they run ads on,

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
that seems, I don't know, man, it seems like a lot.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Way too high.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Especially when you know Zuck is going to give this shit away to people who don't know better.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
You know that's where this has to go.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
Eventually there has to be a real cheap device,

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
something that corporations can afford to buy four, five, six, a thousand of at a time.

37:13.000 --> 37:18.000
Yeah. I mean, and also the idea of doing a VR meeting at the mat botter would just end up in a fight

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
about text editors and where the brackets go after an if statement.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
So I don't.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
Yeah. JB would be an argument about which platform to use.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
As you tout Linux from your M1 Mac.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Right.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
And I'm on the Pangolin saying how good Mac is.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Yes.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
With my M1 powered headset with my watch.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Yeah.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
With your watch.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
It really gets kind of ridiculous.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
I agree. And I don't I'm not convinced it's going to be successful.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
If they could get the price right.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
I could see I could see a couple of use cases in that regard.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
I know this sounds really kind of dystopian, but you know, like I have a couple of grandparents.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
It's like it's probably their last.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
I mean, I mean, the last couple of years and I haven't seen them for two years because of COVID.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
This is not going to happen.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
This is not likely.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
But, you know, a generation or two, if there's a situation where you could get together as a family

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
and at least be in VR, that might be better.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
I don't know.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
Because we tried the Zoom thing and it it I just wanted to get off that Zoom call so fast.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
I don't know. I could see some use cases, but you're right.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
Apple's going to is going to price it way too high.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
But I think you have to have something that feels nice because it's going to be on you.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
And I think you got to have those 8K displays.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
And the other thing they're going to build in is like this.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
They're going to build in, according to Gurman, support for prescription lenses, too.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I don't buy it.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
You just basically took a wish list of what you would want an AR headset.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
I think Gurman maybe this is what they would like to do.

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
You know, I feel like people have people checked Gurman's record recently.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
I mean, I know I feel like he's got a one out of three right now, but I might be wrong.

38:46.000 --> 38:53.000
I don't I mean, I don't really track it, but he's usually close, but not the details he gets.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
And the timing.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
I think he did nail the arm rollout.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
He nailed the arm rollout.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Yeah, he has more on the arm.

38:59.000 --> 39:06.000
He's he isn't he the dude who made that like super ambitious that by 2023, they're going to be all arm, including the pro.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
I could absolutely see them experimenting.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
I mean, if you see where this is going, this is how Apple's going to think about it.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Where else can we get the app store?

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Oh, Jesus Christ.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
You're right, but it's terrible, right?

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
Exactly. So they're from there from the perspective of where else can we deploy the app store?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Where else can I get my 30%?

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Yep. All right. So just taking a breath.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
People keep telling me that this is where it's going.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
All this AR VR stuff.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Meta metaverse.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
But is it like is there really a desire for this?

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
Or is this something that these companies just want to make a thing because they need a new goldmine?

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Oh, very much.

39:47.000 --> 39:52.000
Yeah. You know what it feels like is when the TV industry really wanted 3D to be a thing really bad.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
They had to have that go.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Consumers are just not interested.

39:58.000 --> 40:05.000
Honestly, when I see the art concepts of the quote unquote metaverse, it looks so much like the mid 90s,

40:05.000 --> 40:11.000
early 90s information superhighway renderings and drawings that people fantasize the Internet might look like.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Have you read any William Gibson?

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Yeah.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Because that's what they're talking about.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
I have two thoughts really on this.

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
Number one is I think ultimately something in the middle of what we're looking at is what's going to shake out.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
I could see with it seems like there's some trends.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
You've got remote work.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
You've got people looking for ways to collaborate better.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Like that's clear.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
And there's always people looking for the ultimate content experience.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
Maybe you're in the market to get a 8K television.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
Well, then all of a sudden 2000 bucks doesn't seem so bad.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
So you could see a couple of bits of the market on the high end where there's a justification for it.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
And it's going to be eventually somewhere in a more reasonable price range, probably the cost of an iPhone.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Sure.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
But there's a big caveat in the price there.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
That 8K TV is for your entire household and friends.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
That 2K is per person.

41:00.000 --> 41:06.000
Now, I'm thinking like somebody who's just maybe they live by themselves and they got some cash to burn kind of situation.

41:06.000 --> 41:13.000
But where I think it gets a little dystopian is it came out yesterday that Walmart has filed for trademarks

41:13.000 --> 41:19.000
and other things at the patent office for a Walmart cryptocurrency, Walmart NFTs,

41:19.000 --> 41:29.000
and the ability to basically sell any kind of virtual good from lawn ornaments to shoes to all everything that they sell at Walmart.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Now they want to sell virtually.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Oh, no.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
Nike is planning to start selling virtual Nike shoes that you'll get for your virtual avatar.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Here's what I think it is.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
And this is where it kind of gets a little dark.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
I think we look around and things are kind of crumbling.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
And so the idea is, well, let's just get everybody buying and selling virtual goods.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
We don't have to make anything real anymore.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
And we can plug people in.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
We've got everybody hooked up to the Internet now.

41:55.000 --> 42:04.000
And they can come do these virtual things and they can live in squalor and have crap, but they can have a great virtual identity.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
So we just went from William Gibson to Aldous Huxley.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Let's give them the Soma and let them chill out.

42:09.000 --> 42:16.000
And then don't you think it's also kind of interesting when people are really concerned right now or a group of people,

42:16.000 --> 42:22.000
you know, not everyone, but some people are very concerned about how they're perceived online, how you refer to them.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
They think a lot about their avatars.

42:24.000 --> 42:33.000
Those kind of tendencies seem like they would incline someone to want to create a virtual identity that could be anything they want it to be.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
Like if I were to create a virtual avatar of myself, I might create it looking like me.

42:36.000 --> 42:41.000
But there's probably a lot of people out there that would prefer to look like something else.

42:41.000 --> 42:49.000
And this is going to give them that opportunity to participate in a virtual space where they can represent their true identity as they'll probably see it.

42:49.000 --> 42:57.000
I could see that making someone inclined to want to just live in that existence because you could kind of imagine sort of the dissatisfaction when you disconnect from that

42:57.000 --> 43:05.000
and you come back to your real life where you're actually that different physical shape or thing or whatever, right, whatever the difference might be.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
You know, maybe you like to be a flying cat. I don't know.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Are you nine cat? Is that what you are?

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
And then when you get back in real life, you're not a flying cat. And that's pretty that's pretty boring and disappointing.

43:15.000 --> 43:24.000
You have just described a person who is living a horrifically miserable life and probably needs some help.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
And if you're right, that means these big companies are basically going to monetize despair.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
They don't already. But maybe don't you think that's a sad thing?

43:32.000 --> 43:37.000
You just like a sad kind of situation to be in.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
That's why I hope it's something it's something more in between.

43:41.000 --> 43:53.000
Like it becomes a better way for us to connect as a as a globe where we kind of treat each other more like real people like, you know, I know Optimus Gray in the chat room because I met him in Denver.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Oh, cool.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
And I wonder if we could maybe have more.

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
Maybe VR would give us more of that kind of connection and maybe that'd be a good thing. So maybe there's an upside to it.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
It may not go full Ready Player One, right?

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
That's just it seems like kind of.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
You know, Nike can make unlimited virtual shoes and there's no slaves involved.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
There's no environmental impact, right?

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
As a company, that's a lot of upside.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
Yes, but not not being in the slave trade, I assume is on somebody's Excel sheet.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Oh, my God, dude, this took a turn.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Yeah, I know. I know.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
And and so I think that's why Apple is trying to message it right from the very beginning.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
We're not trying to metaverse here.

44:34.000 --> 44:40.000
Remember the 90s when like it was going to be a decentralized network and we were all going to like live in this la la la happy.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
We'd have our little digital storefronts.

44:41.000 --> 44:51.000
And remember that anybody know, you know, if this were really to happen, don't you think there would just be a counter movement to like embrace real life and exercise?

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
Like you almost wonder if you wouldn't have like a counter movement begin that actually gains momentum.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Like nothing ever just happens like this.

44:59.000 --> 45:06.000
There's always naysayers and, you know, just never is never a smooth transition where we just all get sucked in.

45:06.000 --> 45:12.000
I mean, of course, there will be a counter movement, but will it be successful on the whole to the best of the population?

45:12.000 --> 45:20.000
No, ever since we went real hard on Web three, I've I've been kind of going down the rabbit hole and I've been reading about these different companies and their different initiatives.

45:20.000 --> 45:25.000
And there are a lot of big, big players behind some of these metaverse companies.

45:25.000 --> 45:37.000
And some companies are announcing like real estate and offices like companies that have recently announced that they're going to work from home only have now also announced that they're opening an office in a metaverse.

45:37.000 --> 45:43.000
And of course, the metaverse right now is just different companies, virtual reality environments that you got to connect to via an app on a Oculus.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Hey, you know what? Fine.

45:45.000 --> 45:49.000
Sue me, Disney. We got to do the Jar Jar Coder NFT.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Totally, dude.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
We just have to do it. Let's see if we can get some money. I'll split it. Let's do 50 50.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Yeah, let's do it on one day.

45:56.000 --> 46:03.000
I probably will do it like a J.B., not a not like a currency, but just like a coin, you know, because we did do challenge coins before.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
But I got to wait for all this to shake out. Do something legit.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
We should do if this metaverse crap actually takes off.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
We sell the code, the coder robe right for your app.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
Of course, man.

46:14.000 --> 46:19.000
People can get a robe and you don't have to spend like four months torturing yourself. See?

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
Dude, we could we'd have a swag shop that you could visit in the metaverse.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
Absolutely.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
I could have a creepy little room that's all Alice in Wonderland themed.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Yep.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
You buy the robe on the back end. It's an NFT kind of thing.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
But as an end user, you know, you don't ever know.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
And the price of the robe. We make it like the block chain, like crypto.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Sure.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
Gets more expensive as people buy it. Thus, we incentivize people to buy it early.

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
And for every 200 robes sold, I will find a Snow Leopard disc.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
Digital NFT one, of course, and send it to you.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
We wouldn't want a physical one. We'd clutter things up.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
No, those are mine and I snuggle with them when I'm sent.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
I think this is brilliant, you know, and everybody can get their robes and hold.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
And then one day they'll be worth millions.

47:01.000 --> 47:09.000
No, they won't be worth anything because the planet will die and all these servers will go down and we'll all just realize this was just data bits, ones and zeros and servers.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
But hey, listen.

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
You know, actually, maybe the only thing that survives, you know, somebody else, some alien aliens will come by.

47:14.000 --> 47:21.000
They'll power up the server and it'll be all our virtual crap that survived and everything else has fallen apart and degraded.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Wow. Oh, wow.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
Well, anyways, don't you want to keep this going?

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
Coder QA dot code to join our membership program.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
You get access to the Coderly report, which is coming up.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
We're about to record when you support the show and you can add free feed.
