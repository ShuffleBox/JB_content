00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTORadio, episode 336 for December 17th, 2018.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,400
Hello everyone and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,040
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and its related technologies.

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,360
I'm here in the Pacific Northwest and our host every single week is joining us live

5
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,200
from the beautiful shores of Florida, no doubt, in a nice 75 degrees, no rain, no traffic,

6
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,200
it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,720
Hello Mike.

8
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,000
There's a gator in my pants.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,800
Okay, alright, come on, did you really, have you ever seen a gator since you've been down

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
there?

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Once.

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Really?

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
But it was underwater, yeah.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,160
Was he looking at you kind of weird, like I'd like to eat you?

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,960
No, they kind of like standard water and poke their eyes up.

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Yeah.

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,120
It was on a golf course.

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,600
So if you ever go golfing in Florida and there are water holes, you're almost certainly going

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
to see a gator.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,280
So you are technically our Florida man, as Pixel Pimp points out in our live chat.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,240
You are the Florida man on the Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,120
I'm not sure that that's a mantle, I'm not particularly equality.

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,280
But I don't think you get a choice because you are in Florida.

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,920
Well, but I'm drinking Heineken, not Miller Lite.

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,560
Yeah I chilled Heineken at that too.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,560
So those are the most tasty.

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
It was in the freezer.

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Yes, that's right.

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,740
You know, in some parts of the world, they don't drink cold beer because it stuns the

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,560
taste buds and you can't fully appreciate the entire flavor profile.

31
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,640
But if you drink cold beer, you can drink more and then you can become a Supreme Court

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
justice.

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,360
Can I, oh, can I be honest with you?

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
No lie.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,280
I just, I just discovered like double distilled or double filtered or whatever it is gin where

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,480
it tastes like 25% less Christmas tree.

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
Have you, have you seen this?

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,060
It's, it's a slightly different color, but it's gin, but it, it doesn't taste exactly

39
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,060
like a Christmas tree.

40
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,200
It tastes a little bit less.

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
That's what I discovered this week.

42
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Had a good week.

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Went over to system 76.

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Had a good week.

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
You know what?

46
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,920
I am so jealous of you.

47
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:30,040
I also got invited and yet, you know, I, I, I, I spawned into the process and let me tell

48
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,480
you the last like two and a half years, this process has been taking up a lot of RAM.

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
Yeah.

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
It's a memory leak.

51
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,160
I'll tell you the thing there is, this is, I'm going to get, I'm going to get real honest

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
with you for a moment.

53
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Break it down for me.

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,040
The best time to have children is when you're young, you know, the, the age that you and

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,960
I are, you know, relatively young, but it is also your best time to travel, to have

56
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,040
good health, to have the most energy you're ever going to have, to feel the best physically

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,320
you're ever going to feel.

58
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,320
It's when you have the most physical leverage.

59
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,840
It's when you can afford to burn the candle at both ends the most.

60
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,920
It's when you bounce back.

61
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,480
I healed two and a half, three weeks faster than the doctors thought I would heal because

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,560
I'm a healthy mid thirties male that hasn't, you know, lived.

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm not 60 years old having my, my spleen and all, or my appendix, I mean, rupture.

64
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:24,940
And yet the harsh reality is it's also your best time to establish a family and create

65
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,760
a life for yourself and have a home and have children, which ties you down and restricts

66
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,560
your flexibility.

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,760
And I, the only reason I mentioned this is because it was, I feel like my, the, the,

68
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,080
the 10 years that, well, 13 years I've been doing Jupiter broadcasting, it has been the,

69
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,080
the number one balancing act that I've had the, the, the, the most time with the hardest,

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,640
the hardest time, the hardest time with, and the most time I've spent agonizing over.

71
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
You know what I mean?

72
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,900
Like you joke, but in a way you miss out on an opportunity, but you also have an opportunity

73
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,800
to spend time with the kid.

74
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,300
It's like it both are good and both also are not good.

75
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,640
It's a, it's very hard for somebody like me because I'm always beating up on myself.

76
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,400
Well there's so much more to that too.

77
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,320
It's not just like that, but your appetite for risk dramatically goes down.

78
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Yeah.

79
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
Yes.

80
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Right?

81
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,540
Like when you're like, oh, this way more on the line, right?

82
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,840
This kid needs like food and diapers and health insurance and you know, all these things

83
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,280
that cost a tremendous amount of money as I'm, as you know, of course.

84
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,600
This is old, old dad's wine radio.

85
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,320
Well, I think, I don't know, you know, it was a variable that I couldn't fully appreciate

86
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,280
when I was younger and so I go into this with a full head of steam.

87
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,000
And then I think, do you know that I almost went anyway though I almost brought the kid

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,160
with me that, you know, I, I think that actually would have been okay.

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,560
You know, a certain a pink queen at system 76 Emma offered to babysit.

90
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,160
Like I was this, I was this close just like buying it cause he's still young enough that

91
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
he doesn't need a seat.

92
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Yeah.

93
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
He could be a lap child.

94
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Yeah.

95
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
I'm like, can I do it?

96
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
And I thought, you know what?

97
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,720
No, I, who knows what will happen.

98
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,140
It depends what you wanted to get out of it.

99
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,240
Did you want a nice father son kind of like experience or did you want so young though?

100
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Right.

101
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
He won't remember it.

102
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
He won't remember.

103
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
Yeah.

104
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,680
And then you also, you're, you're not focused on sort of the business side of why you're

105
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,680
there.

106
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Right.

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
So tell me about it.

108
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,720
How, how, uh, now how many, uh, system 76 Thelios or Thelios as they say, uh, it is

109
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
now.

110
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Yep.

111
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Yeah.

112
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
It is Thelio.

113
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
I was corrected.

114
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
And then I double checked.

115
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,560
How many did you smuggle in your carry on?

116
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,960
Well, so first of all, uh, okay, where to start with this?

117
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,800
Um, I think if we're going to just put all our cards on the table here, um, assuming

118
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,600
they're listening to this, but also our audience has been listening now for a while.

119
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Uh, you have been pretty, pretty like, um, open to the idea of Papa West.

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,480
You've been open to the idea of them launching their own manufacturing plant.

121
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,360
Um, and you've even put your money where your mouth is and you've bought system 76 machines

122
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
since this change.

123
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Yeah.

124
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,960
So at least just, just for the, for the record here, I've bought, let's see, a Ray tell two

125
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,240
Gallagos and Oryx, who was that four machines?

126
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Yeah.

127
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
You, you maniac.

128
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Yeah.

129
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,240
I've definitely put my money where my mouth is.

130
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,320
I, on the other hand, went a different direction.

131
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:32,520
I, I sort of, I sort of went, Oh shit, this could be the beginning of the end for system

132
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,040
76.

133
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,360
And I think, I think it's funny because I think normally you and I would have been reversed

134
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,200
in our opinions because to me, I looked at this and I went, these are a bunch of Linux

135
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,800
geeks that work out of a pretty nice office in downtown Denver.

136
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,920
And what the hell do they know about building a factory?

137
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,520
What the hell do they even know about buying a building, let alone putting it with laser

138
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:07,440
cutters, acid dippers, powder coat machines, huge ovens, assembly lines, managing inventory.

139
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,840
What do these guys know?

140
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
What do they know?

141
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Right?

142
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
They've been, they've been managed.

143
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
They've been working out of an office.

144
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
They build PCs to order.

145
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,520
They work with upstream OEMs to customize laptops.

146
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,120
What do, what do these guys know about building?

147
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Like that could sink a company, the, just the rent, just the rent on this place could

148
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,440
sink a company.

149
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,920
As a small business owner, and I had this conversation with Carl, as a small business

150
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,040
owner, I just, the risk just overwhelmed me.

151
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,760
Like it was an, it was, it is, it is, it is moving an entire company into a domain they

152
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,240
have no knowledge of.

153
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,000
It is something that entire corp companies exist to manage.

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,440
That's why Apple doesn't even build their own machines.

155
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,000
What's a company out of Denver going to do to pull this off out of Denver?

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,480
Like they're not, they're not, they're not offshoring the build.

157
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,460
They're not cutting costs that way.

158
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,360
They're hiring people in Denver, Colorado, which is not one of the cheapest places in

159
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,960
the nation, and they're buying or renting real estate and setting up a factory.

160
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,400
So to say, and, and then, because that's not enough, they're launching an operating system

161
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
and they're also going to become an OS vendor.

162
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,920
I just thought, I just thought it was too much.

163
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,800
And I thought a company that I had been a customer for, for 10 years was going to go

164
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,220
under.

165
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,360
And so I just sort of pulled back and I just thought, well, I'll go into await and see

166
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
mode.

167
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,160
I do know that the people that are very talented, maybe they can pull this off.

168
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,580
Maybe they can make this work, but the odds are way against them.

169
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,220
But maybe, maybe, maybe.

170
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,360
So it's, it's been, you know, an interesting 2018 watching them.

171
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,400
So coming, that is, that is the, that is the mindset that I went in with though.

172
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,320
So before you, before you dive in, I just want to say for our end of the year show,

173
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,680
I have a lot about that because what that sounds to me, and I don't want to put words

174
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
in your mouth.

175
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,240
You were asking about Ken, a little company like this scale.

176
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,700
Yeah, but it's not just like scale.

177
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,560
It's scale where the, where there's a global economy at play and manufacturing is particularly

178
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
there.

179
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Yeah.

180
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,180
I mean, I'm not, scale is maybe the wrong word, but can they compete in a, in a big

181
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,960
world, can a little, can, well, we had an episode, remember they're selling to a niche

182
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
too, right?

183
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,520
It's not, they're not making it up in the margins.

184
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,480
No, they're not.

185
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,040
So what did you see?

186
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,920
So when I got down there, I, there's a couple of things that were kind of obvious to me.

187
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,760
First of all, it's been a very hard three months or so for them.

188
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,320
The last three months have been pretty tough.

189
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,740
They launched Thelio pre-orders or Thelio pre-orders at the beginning of November.

190
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,960
It is now as we record, you know, mid-ish December and people are starting to get a

191
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
little antsy.

192
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,240
They haven't gotten their shipments yet.

193
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,720
So when I got in there, what I saw was a company who had just, and I mean just like by the

194
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,500
hour cleared the biggest hurdle they've ever faced.

195
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:20,200
What they had, they had timed this event so that the factory floor was online.

196
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,420
There were a stack of Thelio systems ready to ship out to customers.

197
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,100
They set up this beer garden area where we could sit and watch presentations and enjoy

198
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,560
a drink and all of that in the factory.

199
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,640
And that seemed really fresh.

200
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,360
Like the, like the tables had just been built.

201
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,000
They were just assembled.

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,280
It was really, really fresh, but there was a, a wall size stack of Thelio workstations

203
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
ready to go.

204
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:52,120
And the first batch of machines went out the door that day, were you able to demo one?

205
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Oh yeah.

206
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
Several of them were ready to go.

207
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Yeah.

208
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
Did you happen to try a rising thread ripper configuration?

209
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,640
I think that was one of the ones they showed us where they were showing the cooling system

210
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,240
and they maxed it out at a hundred percent load and then blew smoke through it with an

211
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,280
acrylic side so we could see how it cools itself.

212
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,040
And it was so quiet that I'm pretty positive it hasn't showed up.

213
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,520
The sound of the machine did not show up on the recording.

214
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Okay.

215
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Yeah.

216
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,320
And they went through a lot of their thought process.

217
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,280
They were working on building the system for three years and this is going to be a decade

218
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,400
long platform for them.

219
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,400
This is going to be their desktops for the next 10 years.

220
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,580
And they have a Thel, they have Thelio and then they have Thelio.

221
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,160
They're going to have a Thelio minor, which is like the size of a NUC.

222
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,200
They're going to build a Thelio like a NUC.

223
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,360
And then they'll have a Thelio major and ones in between that are huge, massive desktops

224
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,600
with multiple Xeon processors and tons of disk and all of that.

225
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,000
But the standard Thelio workstation is really small.

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,500
It's almost the size of a mini ITX.

227
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,680
I'm showing pictures on the live stream if people are watching live right now.

228
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,760
And that was probably the biggest surprise when I got there is how small this thing was

229
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:17,800
and how much thought was put into little tiny details that even Johnny I would be impressed

230
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,320
that they sweated over.

231
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,680
So they've been transitioning this company.

232
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,040
They've been moving this company to a place that figures out how to cut this stuff.

233
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,860
A place that figures out how to paint this stuff.

234
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,360
They had to figure out how to make the screw holes smooth enough that it was a pleasant

235
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,200
experience to screw the individual thumb screws in.

236
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,600
It has been a massive learning process.

237
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,640
And they demoed different acrylic systems that they built as a training exercise.

238
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,480
They build systems out of acrylic before they go to metal.

239
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,520
And they're using 3D printers to fashion temporary parts or sometimes really nice parts that

240
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,240
just make it safer to ship.

241
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,920
And they've designed a daughter board that controls thermals in a somewhat intelligent

242
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,160
way that PCs don't normally do.

243
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,800
It manages the power but it also controls the thermals because it uses the sensors from

244
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,800
the motherboard and it uses data from the operating system.

245
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,880
And that's handy because the motherboard doesn't actually know what the temperature of the

246
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,040
GPU is.

247
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,640
And the motherboard doesn't know when the GPU is at 100% load.

248
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,560
Their daughter board design has been one of the more interesting schematics they've released.

249
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,640
The hardware being open source.

250
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,360
I won't say it's brand new because it's frankly not.

251
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Other people have done things like this.

252
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
Well, that's something the Mac does.

253
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
The Mac does.

254
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
That's what the SMC controller.

255
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Yeah.

256
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
The Mac OS does this.

257
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,360
But I think the way they're doing it for a Linux manufacturer is pretty, I won't say

258
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,040
novel, but pretty impressive.

259
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
But go ahead.

260
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Yeah.

261
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
That's really it.

262
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,320
It is able to combine data from the motherboard, data from the operating system, and then it

263
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,320
makes intelligent cooling decisions, aggregating all those different data points together.

264
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,760
And you combine that with like 140 millimeter fan on the bottom and 120 millimeter exhaust

265
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,100
fan and the damn thing's just silent.

266
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,640
And then the board also is sort of a SATA pass-through backplane, so it does SASP essentially.

267
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Yeah.

268
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
I don't know.

269
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,500
I guess in a way, I kind of want to talk to you more about like this massive transition

270
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,100
that they've made as a company.

271
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,960
They've gone from sort of management of PC manufacturing to hands-on cutting the individual

272
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,760
ports out, acid dripping the systems, running them through a baker, and then assembling

273
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
and testing them.

274
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,920
Like it's just, it's a whole other scale.

275
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,140
Like it's a different business now.

276
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,520
One of my disappointments in not going, and not that I mind spending time with my son,

277
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,440
of course, I don't want anybody to write in saying, oh, you're a bad dad.

278
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
That's not the case.

279
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,120
Be, you know, whatever, happy to be home.

280
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,920
And for those who didn't listen last week, the kid was sick is why I stayed home.

281
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,520
I have been through a similar process that I'm hoping on our end of the year episode

282
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,760
to go over of like attempting to, I'm calling it scaling, but I think you're right.

283
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,200
It's actually like gaining breadth and depth and all those kinds of things.

284
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,120
And it has been difficult to say the least.

285
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,600
And one of the things I did wonder when I got the invitation, Chris, a few weeks ago

286
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,280
was, this seems kind of cray cray.

287
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,680
I mean, you know, like the, I'm sorry, but the YouTube commenters and Reddit commenters

288
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,180
rightly say that I have a soft spot for system 76, right?

289
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,840
Like I like what they're doing.

290
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
I like their hardware.

291
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,360
You know, I'm 50% in Mac OS and 50% in Linux.

292
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,780
And when I'm on Linux, it's usually my Galago, right?

293
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,440
And frankly, I broke my Galago, was able to go buy parts and fix it.

294
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,760
Now, granted it's not as like nice, cause you know, my craftsmanship isn't frankly where

295
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,360
their overseas workers were for the Galago.

296
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,980
But if I had to buy another desktop, I would certainly consider Athelio or Thaleo.

297
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,640
Is that Thaleo?

298
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Having said all of that, like all the nice stuff, this seems like a big, big, big jump

299
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,320
for me.

300
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,400
Like you are, like first I thought, you know, I think it's fair to say the Linux community

301
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,680
was a little raised eyebrows on Pop OS, like you guys are going to take on writing your

302
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
own OS.

303
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,680
And you know, Pop, I like Pop, I run Pop.

304
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,560
Pop is a skin on Ubuntu, right?

305
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,080
Right now that's what it is.

306
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,200
It's a good skin.

307
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:50,400
It suits my needs, but then to go into full bore manufacturing and in the United States,

308
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:58,780
I mean, listen, I'll slap on a MAGA hat if I have to, but I've had some failed endeavors

309
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,520
in some, and we'll talk about it in our end of the year episode, some IoT chip manufacturing

310
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,240
down here in Florida.

311
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,540
And if Carl knows how to do this, then Carl, please buy us and I'll just retire.

312
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:21,280
Like buy me out because that seems incredibly challenging from a cost per unit perspective.

313
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,000
And you know, we don't, so my understanding, Chris, is that none of the failures have actually

314
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,920
shipped into customers' hands.

315
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,240
Maybe they've shipped, but no customer has.

316
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,440
They did the night we were there.

317
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
They shipped out.

318
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,160
But no customer has one yet.

319
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,880
They are probably getting them today, tomorrow.

320
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,520
So one thing when you're manufacturing hardware is, and then I kind of learned this the hard

321
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,760
way, failure rate, right?

322
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,760
It just is the case when you're manufacturing your own boards that a certain percentage

323
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
will fail.

324
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
Yeah.

325
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,440
And I think they have a bigger problem with the casing and things like that because they

326
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,060
are shipping inside Thaleo.

327
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,500
It is a gigabyte motherboard.

328
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,660
It is a part that they've sourced and they can test outside of the Thaleo casing and

329
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,360
all of that before they build the system.

330
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,920
But I would say a significant, significant amount of the underappreciated engineering

331
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,060
that will go into Thaleo is how many things they have custom built to make sure the damn

332
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,600
thing survives shipping.

333
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,000
Like they have a 3D printer that custom builds brackets to hold like GPUs and cables in place

334
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:37,840
and all of these things that they have learned over the 12 years they've been shipping systems.

335
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,600
They put those lessons into Thaleo to get it through.

336
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,160
It's funny because I asked twice just to clarify, I'm like, just so I understand, what you consider

337
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,960
as a company as the most traumatic, difficult, most deadly period of life for the entire

338
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,240
lifespan of your systems is the shipping period to customers?

339
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,880
And they said, yeah, getting these systems to survive shipping is the number one challenge.

340
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,520
And so they're able to build certain things now that their previous system didn't have.

341
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,480
I completely get that actually.

342
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,920
Like have you ever dealt with UPS on a company to company scale?

343
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Yeah.

344
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Yeah.

345
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,440
It's not yet.

346
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,080
Like shit just disappears, right?

347
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,480
We've lost, we've lost entire gear shipping it for conferences.

348
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Just gone.

349
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,520
Just gone into the void, really like, and then you have this awkward choice.

350
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,960
Do you call your insurance company or not?

351
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,800
Or did you buy insurance with the thing?

352
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Will they cover it?

353
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Or did you buy UPS insurance?

354
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Which I never did.

355
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
So I just ate the losses.

356
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Yeah.

357
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,880
A $3,000 backbook into the void.

358
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Seriously.

359
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Nice.

360
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Yeah.

361
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
Encrypted hard drive.

362
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Okay.

363
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
I keep interrupting.

364
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
I'm sorry, Chris.

365
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
No.

366
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
So what else did you see?

367
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
See, I'm jealous.

368
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,100
And first of all, this picture, if you're not listening live, by the way, you are missing

369
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,080
the full code radio experience.

370
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Carl's beard.

371
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
Yeah, I know.

372
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
Can we just stop for a minute?

373
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Yeah.

374
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
I saw him a couple, what is it?

375
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,600
A year ago, two years ago.

376
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,760
It was all brown.

377
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,560
It was like, you know, it was a respectable beard, but now it's got a little bit of salt

378
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
in there.

379
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
It's got some gray.

380
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Yeah.

381
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,740
I tell you, this guy looks like he's ready for the Linux community.

382
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,920
So Carl is a really interesting CEO.

383
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,120
I think he's one of the more interesting CEOs that I've met because-

384
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,180
I'm personally insulted, but keep going.

385
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:36,640
He's got a, System76 has a very strong, very unique culture and it starts with Carl.

386
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,760
It absolutely does start with Carl.

387
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:45,120
And Carl is one of those CEOs that he can be in the middle of a big speech and one of

388
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,440
his employees can interrupt him and he'll stop and he'll listen.

389
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,940
And he doesn't even, doesn't even faze him.

390
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:59,720
He's one of those people that once he enters the room, everyone listens and Carl is very

391
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,840
soft spoken and the room goes silent so that everyone can hear Carl.

392
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:14,240
And he is, he's one of those individuals that operates at a higher plane than the rest of

393
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,080
us that are doing day-to-day stuff operate.

394
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:25,400
He lives at the big picture and yet he is maybe the one that is the most anal about

395
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,440
the details.

396
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,280
Every first hundred Thaleo systems or so that have been built, he's personally gone hands

397
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,240
on, made sure like the wood lines up correctly, that the screw holes, I'm not joking when

398
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,700
I say that they've developed a process to make sure that the screw holes are the correct

399
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,640
smoothness so that way the feel of when you tighten the screws feels right.

400
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,400
I mean this is the level of detail they're going down to now.

401
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,120
Carl is the one showing people how to put some of these things together and in fact

402
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,600
he took a good chunk of time away from the tour when we stopped and we had a break and

403
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,320
we were just kind of going around chatting with the employees.

404
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,800
We got full access to everybody.

405
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,720
There was no restrictions and what he did with that time is he went through the production

406
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,080
line and checked on every system at every stage of production to make sure every single

407
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,720
detail had been seen to.

408
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:21,080
And he's trying to get his staff to absorb these principles and I think he's dialing

409
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,160
down as they increase production.

410
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,080
But Carl is maybe the most fascinating thing about System 76.

411
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,520
Also the other thing that I've noticed about the company is their retention is very high.

412
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,740
A lot of people that are working there, some of them have been working there since about

413
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,880
the beginning of the company still and they're still there.

414
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,720
The people we mentioned on the show have been working there forever now.

415
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,680
The people that have started working there since I've been following them still work

416
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
there.

417
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
There's been some churn.

418
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,800
There's been some people that have poured one out for Ryan Sipes but there's been some

419
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
churn.

420
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,920
Ryan Sipes is great and frankly no one wears a cape and a top hat like he does.

421
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,760
Let's keep going.

422
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,400
But that says something about the culture of the company too.

423
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,520
They're friends there.

424
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,640
It's a cultural unit.

425
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,040
In fact, this is a weird thing about them.

426
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:20,000
A lot of them, like the support department, the software development, a lot of them have

427
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,520
the opportunity to just work from home and yet they still choose to come into the office

428
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,240
so they can hang out with everybody.

429
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,760
See, oh damn, okay, first of all, do you understand I'm going to have you sent to federal prison

430
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,600
because you keep wiretapping my home and office.

431
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,200
I just had this conversation this morning about one of the weaknesses at TMB is that

432
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,800
we haven't built a great internal corporate culture because you know what, most everybody

433
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:51,760
basically works from home and it's kind of a very mercenary situation.

434
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,080
We just don't have that like...

435
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,220
I was thinking about this this morning too.

436
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,140
In fact, I'm thinking I'm going to do a quarterly department meeting at the Linux Academy building

437
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:07,240
so everybody has to come in, everybody flies in so it's like a shared experience and do

438
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,980
a quarterly team building thing because we just had that company holiday party and everybody

439
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,840
walked away from that feeling super fired up.

440
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,440
Everybody was like, man, this is a great company.

441
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
The people here are great.

442
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,120
This is going to be an amazing year.

443
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,340
I get just energized everybody and I'm like, well, they spent hundreds of thousands of

444
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,640
dollars to pull that off but if we could do that at a department level, yeah, and the

445
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,120
same with your company.

446
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,000
It's like the same thing with a small business is it...

447
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
It's a much more scale, right?

448
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:41,160
So flying people from the few people from New Jersey to Florida is not a big deal, seriously.

449
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,360
It's just a question of...

450
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,040
One of the things we've had is we've been doing this a long time and there's one person

451
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:53,960
who stuck with me through frankly before the show started and remember when the show started,

452
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
when Zeus and...

453
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
No.

454
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Yeah, no one does.

455
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,320
There's only one person left from that era and there's all these in jokes he and I have

456
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,600
that mean nothing to anybody.

457
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Do you know what I mean?

458
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
They mean nothing.

459
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Yeah.

460
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
So, yeah.

461
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Carl, I'm very jealous.

462
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Yeah.

463
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:21,920
He's done a good job but they are not out of the woods yet in terms of this huge transition

464
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,320
or the other way to put it is they're not out of the learning curve yet.

465
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,760
They're still in the learning curve but if they're not a year ahead, then I thought,

466
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,240
like they're on the upper end of that hockey puck.

467
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,560
They're on the upper end of that hockey puck.

468
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,400
I thought they would be like, you know, way down before even it starts to curve up.

469
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,600
I thought it would take at least a year at least to even get this far and they're farther

470
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,400
than I expected.

471
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,560
So I wouldn't be surprised and I would say after going there, everybody should probably

472
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:59,280
set their expectations a little lower.

473
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,440
I take it back.

474
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
That's your favorite.

475
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
It is.

476
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
You're right.

477
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
You know what?

478
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
That's mine too.

479
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
I play it for my customers.

480
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,840
I just want to make this certainly clear.

481
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,720
The ship dates a little fuzzy.

482
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,440
I would say lower your expectations on when the laptops are going to come.

483
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,160
It could be a year and a half, two year process to learn how to do that.

484
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

485
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
Laptops?

486
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Oh yeah.

487
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Slow your roll buddy boy.

488
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
Yeah.

489
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
That's the ultimate goal.

490
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
They sell more laptops.

491
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
So I asked him about this.

492
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,440
I said, Hey Carl, you sell more desktops or you sell more laptops?

493
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
Thinking he'd say laptops.

494
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,280
He said, yeah, we sell more laptops.

495
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,780
But he says, this is what he says, this is what he says, Mike, he says, the desktop sales

496
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,360
have paid for this warehouse transition.

497
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,480
I think the desktop's got to be higher margin.

498
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,480
Yeah.

499
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Right?

500
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
Yeah.

501
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,160
So now they're going to look at how to pull off laptops, but that's after they figure

502
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,160
out really how to do this part.

503
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,040
And you know, there's a lot to this.

504
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:00,120
There's the, there's the, it's hard to explain really, like they, they have analyzed all

505
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,760
of the parts and they, they figure out what they can mass manufacture.

506
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,200
So they can do this in batches, right?

507
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,860
They can, they can build the Thaleo casing and assemble all of that before they've ever

508
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,000
put a single part into it.

509
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,720
So there's parts where they can optimize and they're learning all of that now.

510
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,360
And then they can apply it to laptops.

511
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,700
And they're, you know, they're experimenting with that Thaleo custom IO board with some

512
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,720
of their own custom boards, but maybe that goes a little further down the road.

513
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Who knows?

514
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Okay.

515
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Yeah.

516
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
All right.

517
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
It was an interesting trip.

518
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,800
I, I walked away wanting one of these machines pretty badly.

519
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,960
I'd say I, if I bought one of these, I think it'd be probably the best desktop I ever owned.

520
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,800
Well, first of all, as a big shot corporate vice president, doesn't your assistant buy

521
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
it for you?

522
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,000
I mean, isn't that how this works?

523
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,680
I got to get one of those first.

524
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,800
That's what I got to do is I got to get me an assistant.

525
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Yeah.

526
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,880
If there's anyone out there in the audience that's been following me for a really long

527
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,120
time and has figured out how I work and want to be my assistant, let me know.

528
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,300
All right.

529
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:04,040
So overall impressions, you're, you, you would not, you would not deter anyone from picking

530
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
up a Thaleo.

531
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
No, I want one.

532
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Yeah.

533
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,200
But what finish the dark walnut or the, you know, I liked the dark in person.

534
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,000
I thought I'd like the lighter one and they sell a lot more of the dark.

535
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It turns out.

536
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah.

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yeah.

538
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I, you know what?

539
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,200
I almost pulled the trigger on one tonight.

540
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,840
The, the manufacturing I'm showing right now on the stream involves a lot of modern shit,

541
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,720
like a 3d printing, like I mentioned, and they have, they have a laser, they have an

542
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:38,640
80 amp laser cutter that has a, has a laser beam that will cut through pretty much anything

543
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,560
that steps in front of it, including your legs.

544
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:48,440
So like, Oh yeah, they're using really advanced and modern technology to build this thing.

545
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,920
So they're not, they have an interesting advantage that they don't have a manufacturing legacy.

546
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,080
They're coming at it with a perspective of how can we use Linux?

547
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,840
How can we use 3d printing?

548
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,200
How can we use lasers and that kind of, so they can buy the newest equipment instead

549
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,080
of being like, well, but that's the other thing I think is I think they've been able

550
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,720
to buy some of this stuff used, but it, the market is established enough now that you

551
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,480
can buy a used laser cutter.

552
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,720
You can, you can, you know, and the 3d printer that is large enough to do this is, is not

553
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
$20,000.

554
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,280
It's $10,000.

555
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
That kind of stuff.

556
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Yeah.

557
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:27,120
It's really fascinating to watch a company that their strong suit before was customer

558
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,020
service software and, and management of parts to now actually building them.

559
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,720
And to see the other thing as a, as a former now small business owner is to see how different

560
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:44,080
individuals of the team have stepped up to you know, like in the, I'm showing a picture

561
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,080
of Kate here.

562
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,080
You know, it was the industrial designer of this thing.

563
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,240
People each individual members of the team that did something in the past have now had

564
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,900
to step up to do something that they didn't do before.

565
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,640
And they had to grow as a team to pull this off.

566
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,760
So it wasn't just that the, you know, Carl and a few others, but the entire team had

567
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,120
to add something new to their repertoire.

568
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
And they all did it.

569
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
That's the thing.

570
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,000
Like they all, like, I don't, I think that's it.

571
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,400
I think that's the lesson I'm taking away from this is if cult, if the culture wasn't

572
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,080
as strong and if the bonds between the people there weren't as strong, this would not have

573
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,720
worked because you can't do this.

574
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,280
You cannot pull this off.

575
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,120
It's not possible to do what they did.

576
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,920
It isn't, it isn't doable unless everybody is pulling in the same direction and people

577
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,920
are willing to pull a new weight that they didn't have to pull before.

578
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,760
And maybe they're willing to have a really shitty three months or maybe they're willing

579
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,160
to have a really shitty six months.

580
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:46,200
And if the team, the entire, if the CEO can be willing to do it, but the team isn't necessarily

581
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,280
willing to do it.

582
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:53,360
And when the entire team is willing to do it, you can do something that I swear to God

583
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
is not possible.

584
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,200
And it's just, it's really remarkable.

585
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Very impressive.

586
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
I think that's what it is.

587
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Yeah.

588
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
It's a culture.

589
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,960
They have a shared goal, a shared idea, and they're all in it together.

590
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Maniacs.

591
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,680
Well, it's nice.

592
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,120
It's something you envy.

593
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,960
You know, you go there and you're like, gosh, the army wouldn't be man being part of this,

594
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
you know?

595
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
I envy it deeply.

596
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:20,720
I mean, this is, oh, there's so much here that I don't want to dive into until our end

597
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:29,280
of the year episode, but there is something to be said from being in a market, a geographical

598
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:37,040
market, that's in a certain state where you can have a culture of like-minded people and

599
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,520
take a lot of risk towards a certain goal.

600
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,360
Right in this case, it would be an open desktop Linux platform.

601
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,360
Yeah.

602
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,360
Yeah.

603
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,080
They joked about having a mutual suicide pact.

604
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
Well, yeah.

605
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,080
Yeah.

606
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
Yeah.

607
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Yeah.

608
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
Yeah.

609
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
It is.

610
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,360
It is.

611
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,280
It's humbling to see it because they roll with their weird.

612
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,680
And I think having Kate on their team, she's their designer.

613
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,240
She's their Johnny Ives, really.

614
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,760
And she's really helped with the, yeah, she's helped with the branding so much and they've

615
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,920
she's helped them embody what they all as a team represent with, you know, the robots

616
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,300
and the kind of sci-fi look.

617
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,920
And I appreciate that as somebody who named his company Jupiter Broadcasting.

618
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:30,280
I saw a lot of that is they're now communicating, they're communicating their unique style via

619
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,320
their branding now via their hardware.

620
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,680
And I believe within a year or two, I think that's capable this team could pull it off

621
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,060
with Pop OS too.

622
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,880
And Pop OS is getting close too, but that's where Pop OS fits into this whole thing is

623
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,800
it's part of communicating System 76 as well as solving problems for customers because

624
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,600
they, they have their own support data.

625
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,960
You know, they have their own customer base.

626
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,480
They know what these people want.

627
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,840
They also know what kind of hardware they want to ship and they know what they need

628
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,520
to do to ship that.

629
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:02,160
And it all kind of comes together with the branding, the story, the hardware and the

630
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
OS.

631
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,600
And when they're eventually in a couple of years making their own laptops, it will complete

632
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
the circle.

633
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,700
It sort of closes the loop.

634
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:18,960
And the crazy thing is, and Carl reaffirmed this is they haven't taken any outside investing.

635
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,040
This isn't, this is being done with this, with the financing of the sales of their existing

636
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,400
Linux products.

637
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:32,380
They're financing this with the sale of Linux hardware and Linux desktops, which in itself

638
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,240
is a bit of a success story for Linux that doesn't get talked about very much.

639
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,600
Well, I think that's the best place to leave it.

640
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
All right.

641
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Yeah.

642
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,160
So, and I'll have, I'll talk more about some of the hardware details and the software details

643
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,360
that I saw in Linux Unplugged tomorrow too.

644
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,720
So I've saved some of that for the Linux Unplugged show too, cause there's lots to share, lots

645
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
to share.

646
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:00,080
But, you know, we joke a lot about Yoda on this show, but there was a, what would you

647
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
call it?

648
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
A retrofactor?

649
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
A retrofactor?

650
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
I don't know.

651
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,160
Just kind of like a profile piece on Donald Knuth, one of the founding fathers of computer

652
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
science.

653
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,920
I'd just like to wrap up the show today.

654
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:16,200
I know we've talked a lot about Linux and System76 and next week's episode is our end

655
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
of the year.

656
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,120
So these are two kind of non-codey code radios.

657
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:27,060
But if you want to know like the deep low level of coding, I was once forced to read

658
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:34,120
The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth and it's thick, like a very dry steak.

659
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,880
But let me tell you something.

660
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:41,560
He is, the New York Times calls him the Yoda of computer programming and frankly that's

661
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,900
what he is.

662
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:48,840
If you're looking for someone's papers and he's written books, he's written a bunch of

663
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,320
academic materials for you to study.

664
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,040
If you're looking for someone to get a little deeper, let's say you're a web developer and

665
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,960
you want to learn more about, oh jeez, see it's hard for me not to slap around JavaScript

666
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
developers.

667
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,680
Actual, let's just say if you want to learn more low level stuff, I would encourage you

668
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,680
to read some Knuth.

669
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,680
Okay.

670
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,480
Knuth, Knuth, put it this way.

671
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,160
When I was a young whippersnapper, Knuth is key, it's one of the first things I was taught.

672
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,000
And a gift I got was the entire set of The Art of Computer Programming.

673
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,600
Oh, that's a value of like almost $300 my friend.

674
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,800
Yes, which I was then compelled to read and report on.

675
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Okay.

676
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Very good.

677
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
It's worth it.

678
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
It's a nice piece.

679
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,440
It's got good photos too.

680
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,680
I was just skimming it as you were talking about it.

681
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
The Yoda's are looking good.

682
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
Well, it's universal, right?

683
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,200
It's not like, you know, JavaScript for dummies or C sharp for dummies.

684
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,240
It's literally The Art of Computer Programming.

685
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,920
When the show's title is The Art and Business of Software Development, well, he's the art

686
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
of software development.

687
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
This is the guy.

688
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
There you go.

689
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
There you go.

690
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
Thank you.

691
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,680
I strongly recommend that everybody read his, at least volumes one and two.

692
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,640
The subsequent volumes and he has Fast Seals, which he calls them, which are like little

693
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:09,800
editions, can get a little rough and very like data mathy, but the first two I think

694
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
are very important.

695
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
You know what?

696
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,600
I will put links to some of the eBooks and this article in the show notes so people can

697
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,880
go grab and make it easy for the lazy web, coder.show slash three three six for that.

698
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,880
Mr. Dominic, is there anybody you want to link to anything you want to plug before we

699
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
get out of here this week?

700
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,800
I'd like to plug a Carl O'Chel's beard.

701
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
No kidding.

702
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
I'm a little jealous.

703
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
No.

704
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,960
Go to at Domenico on Twitter and the bad fodder dot com.

705
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,480
You know what the worst thing about Carl is, is that he's working his butt off and he's

706
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
still in great shape.

707
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
And it's the.

708
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
It looks amazing.

709
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
It's so frustrating.

710
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
It's so frustrating.

711
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
What a jerk, right?

712
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,480
I don't know how he pulls it off.

713
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,760
Actually, I know how he pulls it off because he stayed in shape since like his early 20s.

714
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
He's like a workout enthusiast.

715
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,720
I tell you what, that's the trick.

716
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
I'm so lazy.

717
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,480
Anyways, you know what I would do if you're lazy, just want to get these episodes every

718
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
single week.

719
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,520
I go to coder.show slash subscribe.

720
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,440
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

721
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,400
You get the week's episode whenever we put it out on a Monday.

722
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
We put on Tuesday.

723
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
We put on a Friday.

724
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
You get it.

725
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Coder dot show slash subscribe.

726
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,120
Also, we'd love to have you participate in our subreddit coder radio dot reddit dot com.

727
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:19,080
