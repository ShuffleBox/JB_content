This is KOTOR Radio, episode 435 for October 11th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,520
Hello friends, welcome to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,720
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,520
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,280
You know, they have that cloud playground, Azure, AWS, or Google cloud sandboxes on ACG's

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,320
credit card, not yours.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,280
My name is Chris and joining us every single week is the man who's been burning the midnight

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,440
oil, but taking a nap before the show.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,840
It's our host, Mr. Dominic.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Hello, Mike.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
Hello, Mr. Fisher.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,260
I like this employment of the nap strategy.

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,400
So you know, you know, you got to be fresh for the show.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,100
I mean, that's like pro move.

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,100
It's pro.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,720
I'm impressed.

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,440
You know, I just came out of the woods this morning, I went in for my reading weekend,

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,080
and I only got through a book and a half didn't really work out the way I wanted.

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,240
But it was still really enjoyable.

21
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,880
I was I was actually looking forward to hearing about that.

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,040
I enjoyed it a lot.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,040
And I think the concept is sound.

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,100
I just need to clear my schedule a little bit more, I guess, because I ended up having

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,720
to drive in and you know, the whole thing.

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,920
But I still really enjoyed the time I did get out there.

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,360
Oh, the other thing that was kind of funny is I'm used to going out there and it just

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,040
being no one around for like miles.

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,160
But I guess it's like salmon season right now in the Pacific Northwest.

30
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,040
So all the fishermen were out in the woods, like finding the good fishing spots along

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,760
the riverbed and and then, you know, they drink while they fish all day.

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,040
And then when the sun sets, they load up in their trucks and they go bombing through the

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,440
woods, running into crap and driving 35 miles per hour, having a good old time, blasting

34
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,480
their music in the dark.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,600
And it was quite the experience.

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,840
So I learned pretty quickly, like when when the sun sets, I'm going to get inside for

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,660
a bit, let the fishermen clear out, let them have their time.

38
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,720
But I came out of the woods and I saw a pretty big announcement from you.

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,920
It's like it's here.

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,080
It's real.

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,240
And we're going to talk about it today.

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,560
I don't know how much you want to say now, but it seems like a pretty big congratulations

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
is in order.

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
Thank you.

45
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
Yes.

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:35,400
So finally, finally, after 5000 years, Alice is at a one point state launched to do.

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,160
If you've noticed the Python content, she's in Python.

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, I mean, I know we have some more stuff on it, but yeah, basically it's a Rosetta

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
stone for data.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,720
So it's like, you know, I've been trying to do these automation things for a while.

51
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,120
I found that dealing with people's proprietary data from like whatever insane system that

52
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,940
somebody built for them and, you know, the odds, the early odds was always like the problem.

53
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,640
So what she does, I call it universal data fluency, which it's really catchy for like

54
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
the PM types.

55
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,160
So if you're a PM and you like it, thank you.

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,200
Where she can analyze data, compare it to known data types and try to understand it

57
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,720
based on what she already knows.

58
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,440
Obviously the idea is as I introduce more integrations, more types of data, she learns

59
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,040
more stuff, more, learns more stuff, right?

60
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
Yeah.

61
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Yeah.

62
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,840
So we'll probably talk more about that in a little bit.

63
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Thank you.

64
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Well, congratulations again.

65
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
Yes, we will.

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,320
We're definitely going to talk more about that, but we had a couple of emails come in

67
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,240
that we felt like, ah, we got to answer these.

68
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,440
So we're going to, we're going to stick to the format for a bit and there's also some

69
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,860
hoopla, but then we're, we're going to dive in.

70
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,120
So stick around for that.

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,320
First, let's start with Ethan.

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,000
Ethan kind of feels, I think like he's run out of time.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,120
He says, Hey guys, I'm riding in because I'm facing a bit of a dilemma.

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,280
I'm a computer science student trying to get a job before I graduate.

75
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,520
However, I don't have any on the job experience.

76
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,800
I've been trying for internships, but in this last year of school, it looks like all of

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,520
them are booked out until summer of 2022.

78
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,360
I feel like my skills are diverse, but I'm trying to find a job for either positions

79
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,520
that I could possibly work in, which would be an embedded systems programmer or perhaps

80
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
an OS developer.

81
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,880
I just don't necessarily have all the skills yet.

82
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,880
I have been working on a operating system as a side project and I have tried applying

83
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,840
for some dev ops internships.

84
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,460
However, nothing's really clicked.

85
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,160
I've had some projects stall because of various bugs involving something that come up or maybe

86
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,920
something just doesn't work out.

87
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,120
I know a few different programming languages, including C++, Python, Go and Rust.

88
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,600
I have some sys admin experience for both Linux and windows, and I have a bit of database

89
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,480
experience, but I don't really understand what the majority of the jobs I find.

90
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,020
Seem to require like automation skill sets like SaltStack or Kubernetes or Ansible.

91
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,640
At this point, I'm just not really sure where to start looking or even if I'm looking in

92
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
the right place.

93
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,860
Overall, I'm wondering if my skills are the right skills for the kind of jobs I want,

94
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,640
if I'm looking in the right place, if I should just go for internships in 2022, if there's

95
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,240
something I'm overlooking, any advice you guys could offer, I'd appreciate.

96
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,060
And the email is kind of all over the place, Mike, and I read through it and before the

97
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:17,360
show and the vibe I got from this was he's sort of a jack of all trades, master of none

98
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,440
kind of guy, and he's also not really following through like he's got two projects that he's

99
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,080
put on the shelf because like a roadblock was encountered and he kind of just ran out

100
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
of steam on them.

101
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,800
And it kind of seems like he's just all over the place with the skill sets.

102
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,280
And I think maybe that's his core issue.

103
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
What are your thoughts?

104
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,160
Yeah, I mean, a little bit of focus on that might make it a little easier to, I hate the

105
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,100
word marketable when it comes to people, but I think that's the right word here, right?

106
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,480
To be a little more marketable.

107
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,600
This is almost worthless advice, but you got to stick to it, right?

108
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Yeah.

109
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,040
I mean, I might even have different versions of my resume that like paint me, not lying,

110
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
right, but slightly.

111
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,200
Different focuses.

112
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Different focuses, right?

113
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,240
Featuring like the DevOps stuff in one and something else in another.

114
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,000
Or the embedded stuff in another and really kind of sell yourself as somebody who focuses

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,080
in on that and then tailor it for that particular job that you're applying for.

116
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,480
That's exactly what he's got to do, huh?

117
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,280
Well, just like, you know, anybody, anybody selling a product or anything like they kind

118
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,280
of have different pitches based on who they're talking to.

119
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,540
And I think to Ethan's young enough that he may find that if he does find a job or an

120
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,200
internship or an open source project that he wants to work with, he may either discover

121
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,400
he really enjoys that kind of work or he doesn't yet enjoy that kind of work.

122
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,400
And so I don't, I don't, you know, reading through his email, he feels like he's in a

123
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,880
bit of a rush, like he's looking at summer 2022 and that's not soon enough.

124
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,720
And I don't think he's actually in the position he thinks he's in.

125
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,480
I would encourage him to follow Mike's advice to the letter is maybe even if you're not

126
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,680
ready to focus yourself, focus your resumes, focus your tactic.

127
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,520
Don't come in as just somebody who's capable of doing everything, whatever you need me

128
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,440
to do, because that just says that just screams project to a hiring manager.

129
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Just makes you sound like a project.

130
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Yeah.

131
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
All right.

132
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
Solve that one.

133
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,800
Tyler writes in, he's got two situations he wants to run past us.

134
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Tyler's also a high school student.

135
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
I should point out.

136
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,840
So, uh, this is, that's interesting today.

137
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Both emails.

138
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
Hmm.

139
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Tyler writes, I feel like the attacks on large corporations generally have good underlying

140
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,560
intentions and he's referring to like, uh, the employees, you know, like there's like

141
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,560
this Apple to hashtag now on Twitter where people are sharing their, their Apple stories

142
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,680
about, you know, employment issues and stuff like that.

143
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,800
Uh, but Tyler says, I think that many people fail to grasp that the arguments only have

144
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,720
validity when someone else is creating a platform for others to build on.

145
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,840
Competition is essential to a functioning economy and therefore to function as a society.

146
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,680
If you create a platform and you call it fair, but then cunningly deceive your clients, that's

147
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,880
uncool and that should be banned.

148
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,520
However, if you try to create these anti-monopoly laws in the wrong way, we could very well

149
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,000
end up in a position to dastardly to recover from.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,320
I feel bad that Tyler has to worry about these kinds of things.

151
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,800
I think what he's trying to say is, wow, when they do something wrong that has to be stopped,

152
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,480
we could very well go too far.

153
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,420
In fact, you might argue that Microsoft was a good example of this for a while.

154
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,240
They really seem to have their hands tied behind their backs and got lapped by the rest

155
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,300
of the market and the kind of missed out on the mobile situation that kind of missed out

156
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,200
on the beginning of the internet situation.

157
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,800
And when Satya Nadella came on board, the other thing that happened around that timeframe

158
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,640
and maybe it played a role, maybe it didn't is some of the overseeing structure that was

159
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,260
in place by the government was removed that time it expired.

160
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,600
And so the monopoly watchdog that was like, you know, installed at Microsoft left, they

161
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,840
were done.

162
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,200
And Microsoft figured out how to play game, play ball with the federal government and

163
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,840
buddy up and make contracts and accommodate special national security needs.

164
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,960
And they did all the right things.

165
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,880
And now they're, you know, they're doing better than ever.

166
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,440
So I don't know, I think what Tyler's trying to say is we could screw it up too much if

167
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,480
we try to overmanage it.

168
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,200
But he has another note and he wants to get your opinion on Mike.

169
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,240
He says, as a high school student, I love programming and I pretty much love doing nothing

170
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,800
else but maybe some gaming.

171
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,400
I'm curious, this is a programmer, how high in a company can I reasonably expect to rise?

172
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
He's asking as a developer.

173
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,560
I mean, I don't really want to end up as a server administrator, but I also want to progress,

174
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,400
grow and make some money in the process.

175
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,200
I'd love to hear your takes on what avenues I should pursue to find a job where he could

176
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,380
reasonably rise up in the ranks and make good money.

177
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,680
So he wants a good day job, something he could raise up in the ranks, huh?

178
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,520
Probably means you're gonna look for a company of a certain size.

179
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,560
I don't know, what else would you look for?

180
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,400
Well, you want to look at the history of the company, right?

181
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,160
So one, when you say rise up in the ranks, there's rank and there's money.

182
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,920
There are companies that don't promote developers into necessarily upper management, but they

183
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,400
have like steps on the developer track where you end up just making a ton of money, right?

184
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
It's possible.

185
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,040
There are companies like Microsoft that a good way, unless you're Balmer, which I don't

186
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,280
think they want to repeat that, a good way to get to the upper C-suite is to be technical,

187
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
right?

188
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,960
Especially if you get on the right projects at the right time.

189
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,320
That's often what happens in these companies is you're working in one group, that group

190
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,840
does really well, so they kind of tap you for the next big project.

191
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,040
And if that project takes off, your career tends to go along with it.

192
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,680
I just want to say, by all accounts, Satya Nadella is a lovely dude, super nice, great

193
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,920
to work with, but he's probably CEO today because he was the boss of Azure, which just

194
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
prints money.

195
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Right?

196
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,440
I mean, it helps to be like in the right place.

197
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, it also was a very strong message to Wall Street that this is the future direction

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
of Microsoft by putting Satya there.

199
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah.

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,520
I mean, we don't have it in the show, but this is a bit of a diversion, but you know,

201
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:04,420
Windows 11, not a huge upgrade, unless you want like WSL, then it is, right?

202
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,420
Then it's really nice.

203
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,240
That's like the best feature of it from what I can tell.

204
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,240
It's like the best feature.

205
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,600
That, and it looks a little more like Plasma, the Plasma desktop.

206
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
I like that too.

207
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,840
I mean, everything has to steal from KDE there.

208
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,240
I said one nice thing about KDE, that's it for the next year.

209
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,200
Oh, I said, you know, look at the company's organization, you know, a company that its

210
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,600
business is technical or engineering focused is probably going to be more open to, you

211
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,100
know, a good promotion track for that kind of role.

212
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,780
My point being like, if you work at like a law firm as like the guy who runs their website,

213
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,640
that's probably not the best choice for you.

214
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Yeah.

215
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
That's my point.

216
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,360
Having said that you're super young, you're probably going to switch organizations a bunch

217
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
of times.

218
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,000
So I wouldn't even worry necessarily about it just yet.

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,680
He's probably not even going to make it until the crash.

220
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Let's be honest.

221
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
He's going to be a, wait, what?

222
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
The dot com bubble 2.0?

223
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
What?

224
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,840
Please don't say that now.

225
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,480
Linode.com slash coder.

226
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,120
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

227
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
show.

228
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,280
I host everything on Linode these days.

229
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,060
They've got servers all over the world, 11 different data centers, and to make things

230
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,080
really sing, they became their own ISP.

231
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,160
So they control the links between their own data centers.

232
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,920
They've recently reinvested in their MVME storage.

233
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,400
So it's faster than ever.

234
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,600
And their high end CPU systems have AMD epic processors.

235
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,000
It screams with 40 gigabit connections coming into their hypervisors, a beautiful dashboard

236
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,080
to manage it all and tons of one click applications.

237
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,400
Maybe for example, you'd like to deploy VS code server.

238
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,800
Why not have your own VS code editor in the cloud?

239
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,480
But under your control on your own box, they have a one click deployment for VS code web

240
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
server.

241
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
It's great.

242
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,400
Also like next cloud, Jitsi, tons of projects.

243
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,440
Maybe you just want to get started on and don't want to spend time setting up.

244
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,080
They've got one click deployments for that.

245
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,160
But if you're a DIY kind of person, they got you covered and it's easy to use their S3

246
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,320
compatible object storage, managed cloud firewalls, they have DDoS protection, a powerful DNS

247
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
manager, and so much more.

248
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,000
Linode is all about the community too.

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,440
Their community support runs deep.

250
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,920
They've invested in projects that make what we do possible, distributions that I use every

251
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,160
single day, and they made our road trip possible.

252
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,920
And I bring this up because it's like being a good environmental citizen.

253
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,960
They're taking care of their neighborhood.

254
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,940
They're taking care of their community.

255
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,520
They invest in all the important aspects of their business.

256
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,000
They've been doing this since 2003.

257
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,520
They know how to do it right.

258
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,240
But I think you got to go check it out for yourself because there's a lot of places you

259
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,080
can host stuff, but nobody checks all the boxes like Linode.

260
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,940
So go over there and take advantage of our $100 credit and support the show.

261
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,040
It's linode.com slash coder.

262
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:57,000
Get $100 for 60 days on a new account and support the show linode.com slash coder.

263
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,440
Well speaking of antitrust and just weird things that don't feel quite right when it

264
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:09,320
comes to these large tech giants, of course, as absolutely 100% expected, Apple is appealing

265
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:16,520
the Epic Games ruling, you know, the one in which it pretty much won every single claim

266
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,560
except for a single claim.

267
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,960
It is appealing that single claim.

268
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,520
Obviously a 99.9% victory is unacceptable.

269
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,160
But there was just that one problem, you know, is that was that one little finding that said

270
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,520
that Apple violated California's anti-steering rules and demanded that Apple let developers

271
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,100
linked outside payments.

272
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,960
So it's kind of why they're fighting that one.

273
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,160
It's kind of the one they care about the most too.

274
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,080
And then they're using the excuse, which I suppose is legit, of ongoing litigations against

275
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,480
Epic to not allow them back into the app store.

276
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,560
They're like, you wanted to bring this against us?

277
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Well guess what?

278
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
You're not getting back in now.

279
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,280
And Epic's asked to be back in and Apple said, nope.

280
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,520
I don't understand why Epic thought that we're going to get back in.

281
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,980
No, this is just beginning.

282
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,520
So like Apple has asked to have this appeal.

283
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,600
The court has not yet granted the appeal.

284
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,560
And if they do, then they will grant a stay.

285
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,000
That stay will push out this this change that Apple have to implement to at least until

286
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,160
December.

287
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,360
Apple's plan is to argue.

288
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,720
Remember that chicken compromise that they announced a few weeks ago before the epic

289
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
trial finished?

290
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Yeah, yeah.

291
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,200
They're going to argue it's moot because they already offered a compromise.

292
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,840
Yes, they're going to go into court and they're going to point to that announcement.

293
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,840
This is their plan.

294
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,440
And they're going to say, look, we've already agreed to some of this stuff.

295
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,120
So we not only not only do we think this is bogus, but we don't even think it's necessary.

296
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
It's a bunch of ticks.

297
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,440
I think the judge is going to buy it.

298
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
I think so, too.

299
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
That's so bad.

300
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Oh, man.

301
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,920
And Apple is just going to laugh all the way to the bank and Epic's going to be screwed

302
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
in the meantime.

303
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,040
I bet Apple lets them in after all this is done, but it could be a long time.

304
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,240
Well, I mean, Epic is, quote, screwed.

305
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,160
I mean, I don't know.

306
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,920
Even you know, the court documents, iOS is not that huge for market for real time feedback

307
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,880
is bite bitten points out in the chat room.

308
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:06,600
The Netherlands is getting nudged or the Netherlands is nudging Apple for their app store payment

309
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
options.

310
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,280
And then today, as you and I were going on the air, the Wall Street Journal published

311
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,520
a report that the U.S. Justice Department is quietly hush hush putting together antitrust

312
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,800
enforcement against Apple.

313
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,880
I guess like they're working with the Biden administration, the White House would go for

314
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,720
it and I'll have a link in the show notes.

315
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,920
But they're basically putting together a low key antitrust case against Apple right now

316
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,720
in the Justice Department.

317
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,600
And that should be interesting.

318
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,120
This all feels super weird to me because like Apple's got to know they're not going to get

319
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,080
away with this forever.

320
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,840
Remind me again how they're a monopoly.

321
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,720
With 20 percent of the phone market.

322
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Remind me again.

323
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,360
It seems pretty clear that they're going to have to give something on the app store payments.

324
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,680
I guess so.

325
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,520
I'm trying to I'm trying to think about it.

326
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,900
I mean, I agree they should.

327
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,200
But are they truly the monopoly of the market?

328
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,040
That just seems like we've completely lost focus on how large Android is as a platform.

329
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,720
It just doesn't seem well, I mean, as many sad lawyers have made the argument, right?

330
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,720
The problem with Android is it is the share monopoly, but not the revenue monopoly.

331
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
I'm sorry.

332
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,360
It is the share majority, but not the revenue majority.

333
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,080
Like I wouldn't write a native Android app anytime soon unless somebody paid me to do

334
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,080
it.

335
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Yeah.

336
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
From from a revenue standpoint.

337
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,080
Yeah.

338
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
Yeah, you're right.

339
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Yeah.

340
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Yeah.

341
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
I mean, that's kind of crazy.

342
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
So although I don't think that's a valid argument, I'm not a lawyer, but I can't imagine going

343
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
into court.

344
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
But yes, Your Honor.

345
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,600
But that 80 percent of the market won't buy my smurf berries.

346
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:45,920
It just kind of feels like saying that Disneyland has a monopoly on, you know, event parks.

347
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,280
Well, that's true.

348
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,040
Like they are the biggest and they're the most expensive.

349
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,480
And when you go in, it is all Disney from top to bottom.

350
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
But there's six flags.

351
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,840
There's, you know, Splash Mountain.

352
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
There's there's other stuff out there.

353
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,080
There's Silverwoods in Idaho.

354
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,600
There's all there's other Universal Studios.

355
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
They will.

356
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
If you live in Florida, they will send you a letter every month until you sign up for

357
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,680
their pass, reminding you that they're there.

358
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm guessing wildly, but I bet you if you looked up at the overall percentage of different

359
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,520
types of fairgrounds in parks like that, Disney was probably the minority.

360
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,000
If you look around the world, you know, it's like claiming that Disney is has a monopoly

361
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
on this market.

362
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,300
And I, I agree that if you go into Disney's Park, Disney has a monopoly.

363
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,120
But you chose to go into Disney's Park.

364
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,640
And I know this is an old argument, but I'm just trying to I'm just trying to grasp quite

365
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,800
how serious this is, because this is a really weird angle to take on it.

366
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,680
But like if you take if we screw this up, like just thinking about Tyler's email and

367
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,840
we say we take Apple down, what has been changed?

368
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,880
What's been accomplished is now on 20 to 30 percent of the mobile market.

369
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,040
There's more flexible payment options.

370
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
That's what we're going to accomplish.

371
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,720
I mean, that's a good thing, I guess.

372
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,160
But I don't know.

373
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,280
Seems like you give Apple five to 12 years and they're going to be there themselves anyways.

374
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,640
I mean, maybe not, but it just doesn't seem like it doesn't solve the overall problem.

375
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,180
That's like these five tech companies control our entire lives and you literally cannot

376
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,360
go through modern life without touching one of them.

377
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,080
That's the real problem we have now.

378
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,840
Not that, you know, that 20 percent of the market can't use Stripe to pay for an app.

379
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,640
I mean, it's an issue, but is it really the issue that the Justice Department?

380
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
I don't know.

381
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
Well, that's what I was going to say.

382
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,600
The real problem is that to solve the problem, you just stated that these five monoliths

383
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,040
are basically a presence of everyone's life that they cannot realistically avoid.

384
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,640
You would need functioning government, which we don't have.

385
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,440
So that people are just trying to like use the courts as a way to, you know, conjure

386
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,880
litigation and to do that, the only route, because honestly, if you want to like dunk

387
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,920
on Android people, sorry, most of the audience who has Android.

388
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,040
Another way to look at it is why don't Android users spend more money?

389
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Right.

390
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,160
And you can you actually market to them differently?

391
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,840
I think that's a very complicated, very complicated problem.

392
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,880
It's a complicated thing.

393
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,080
And there's a strong case that if you're on the Apple side of life, you just say, it is

394
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
not my problem.

395
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,320
It is not my job to make your software successful if you don't like our platform, go to the

396
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
other platform.

397
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
Yeah.

398
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
I don't know.

399
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,360
I like I sort of want that not to be true because like my issue is more all the restrictions

400
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,800
on what developers can do less than 30 percent, even though it is ridiculous.

401
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,300
You know, and maybe I'm wrong, Gus 77 in the chat room linked me to counterpoint market

402
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,480
share data that was published on August 16th of 2021.

403
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
And it shows that for the last this just goes back to Q1 2020.

404
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,480
But basically, it just shows a steady growth of iPhone for the last year, really kind of

405
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,760
since the pandemic began going to today.

406
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,080
The iPhone has just gobbled up market share and according to these stats that now has

407
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,640
a 53 percent market.

408
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,840
Now this I don't know if this is true, because they also at one point claimed at a 65 percent

409
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,000
market share and then it dropped down to 55 and now it's 53.

410
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,560
So I don't know, maybe it's going back down.

411
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,120
But according to these stats, it's at it's at over 50 percent of the market.

412
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,080
So I guess you could start considering a monopoly at that point.

413
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,020
However, it seems pretty tenuous if if just three quarters ago is at 65 percent and now

414
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,800
it's at 53 percent.

415
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,320
Seems pretty tenuous monopoly to me.

416
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,240
Oh, well, this will be another three years.

417
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Chrissy wrote in.

418
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
He wants to learn.

419
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,920
He says, I know this is not always topical, but it's a bit of an evergreen question, something

420
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,680
I thought you guys might have some thoughts on.

421
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,520
I'm an RN by employment, but I self identify as a general purpose nerd, really.

422
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,480
And I've always been more of a hardware guy.

423
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,720
I like to solder and, you know, I like to do my own custom sensors and hook them up

424
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
to home assistant.

425
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Ha ha.

426
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
Atta boy, Chrissy.

427
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,680
He goes on to say, for example, I like to wire up the various configurations and always

428
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,080
make sure I get the best speed bump.

429
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,480
I'd like to learn some basic coding, though, to fill in the gaps of my knowledge.

430
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,880
I've got no formal training anything aside from one credit of VB I took in high school.

431
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,280
That's the most important class.

432
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,080
So also dating himself slightly.

433
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,760
I'm not trying to write standalone software or anything.

434
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,200
So any thoughts on like maybe what I could do?

435
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,440
Remember, I'm somebody with a negative amount of free time or really hardly disposable income.

436
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,120
But I can learn some basic coding and programming.

437
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,120
But what can I do with zero prior knowledge?

438
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,840
And that just sounds like a fun challenge.

439
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,360
I thought maybe since Chris was working with Home Assistant.

440
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,020
I thought this could be an excellent opportunity to learn Python because the Home Assistant

441
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,520
project is written in Python.

442
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,720
No, that's exactly what I was going to suggest.

443
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,680
Do some of your your home automation stuff in Python.

444
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,800
I mean, talk about a great language to jump into.

445
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:56,600
There's so many, so many resources to learn Python to you found a really, a really good

446
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,280
one that it's a type of resource that completely clicks with the way I learn.

447
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,800
I like this.

448
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,320
It's called understanding all of Python through its built ins.

449
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,320
So this is an idea of just learning quite a lot about what Python is capable of and

450
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,840
its various features by just learning what all of the built in options are and what they

451
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
do.

452
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Yeah.

453
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,800
Basically telling you what features obviously is not, you know, comprehensive, but what

454
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,240
features the designers of language think were so important that they had to have like special

455
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,800
built in functionality for I have to say, it's a pretty novel way.

456
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,280
I've never thought of it this way, but you know what?

457
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,800
For someone, someone like the writer coming in kind of technical, but doesn't, you know,

458
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,000
not really a programmer, that's probably a good good blog post to look over.

459
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh, man.

460
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,360
It's so extensive.

461
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,440
It's so extensive.

462
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,680
It's so well done too and formatted really, really well too.

463
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,200
So it's very easy to read the actual code and understand what it's doing.

464
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,800
It's top notch.

465
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,320
The other thing, and this might be a, maybe he's too advanced for this now, but a spark

466
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,800
fun, they sell like boards and stuff, but they have a whole like burn section where

467
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,280
they do, they have like videos on how to, you know, you buy the lighter sensor.

468
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
How do you program it?

469
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
How do you set it together?

470
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
How do you do the soldering?

471
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,080
I know for him, he already can do the soldering it sounds like, but that might be a route

472
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,560
for folks trying to learn how to do this kind of thing.

473
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,120
That could be a really fun way to do it.

474
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,880
If you're more of a hands-on visual style learner, that could be a great resource.

475
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,820
I'll mention that our friends over at a cloud guru have an entry-level Python programmer

476
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,480
course that'll help you get a certification as well.

477
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,240
The certified entry-level Python programmer certification is what it's called.

478
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,600
And it's a great place to start when getting started with Python, or if you even want to

479
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,020
consider getting a Python certification.

480
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Go check it out.

481
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,800
They'll go over Python data types, control flow structures, data collections, functions

482
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
and generators.

483
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,320
By the time you complete the course, you should be more than comfortable with Python.

484
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,840
I'll have a link to that in the sponsored section of the show notes, or you can go over

485
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,760
to a cloud guru and search for certified entry-level Python programmer certification, quite the

486
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,880
mouthful link in the show notes at a cloud guru.com.

487
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,280
And that could be a great way to get started perhaps.

488
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,480
What do you think, Mr. Dominic?

489
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Are you ready?

490
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
Should we, should we talk about the big news?

491
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,960
Do you feel like we've, we've done our duty for the people?

492
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,440
I feel like we've done our duty.

493
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
We've dutied.

494
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,440
So tell us about Alice and, and what Alice is and I don't know, I personally love to

495
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
hear the backstory stuff.

496
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,400
So maybe any of that kind of you want stuff you want to share too.

497
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Yeah.

498
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,680
So it's a, it's a conversational UI, right?

499
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,680
So that's probably a big part.

500
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,320
It lives in Slack and MS teams.

501
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,840
So you interact with it via speech or not speech, but typing.

502
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,120
People might notice a couple of weeks ago, I was talking about and tweeting my NLT key

503
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:50,640
NLT kit using that fast API, async IO rust via a very, very cool library called Pio three,

504
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,680
which lets you take a rust.

505
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,480
I always, I always mix up how they say this, but basically, you know, a rust module and

506
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,280
make it into a Python module that you call and it feels and looks like Python from, you

507
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,400
know, from the consumer's perspective, right?

508
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,420
The consuming developer's perspective.

509
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,800
So that's kind of the technical underpinnings, a lot of WebSockety stuff, particularly for

510
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:22,360
Slack because Slack is amazing and has a great WebSocket API that actually works unlike others.

511
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,820
Just on top of that too, it's, it's a tool that so many people already have.

512
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,600
So it's just, it's like just plugging into something that's already part of their workflow.

513
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Exactly.

514
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Exactly.

515
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,880
So the whole idea here is to, let's say you're a midsize business, right?

516
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:45,800
You have some system, some contractor probably wrote in VB6 and it's sitting there holding

517
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
you back, right?

518
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,520
You want to move on to more, you know, more modern technologies.

519
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,800
A big need that I kept seeing people kind of calling and reaching out was because of

520
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,080
COVID, they're trying to do like more either hybrid working or just straight remote working.

521
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,440
And these systems that are like behind the firewall, weird VB application are causing

522
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
all kinds of problems.

523
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,080
So Alice can also live behind the firewall.

524
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
That's kind of the key.

525
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,980
This is not like a SAS that you subscribe to.

526
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,360
This is something where there's an installation implementation.

527
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,120
And from there, basically we take a look at what kind of weird psychedelic data is your

528
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,440
proprietary system coming out with.

529
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,200
She'll compare it to what she already understands and we'll get a close approximation.

530
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,160
We call it universal data fluency.

531
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,820
If we have to tweak it, we will, and we'll go from there.

532
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,520
And the key is once she understands the data, we can then convert it into all the other

533
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,960
formats she knows.

534
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
I love this.

535
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,520
So this is universal data fluency is this concept that your business application may

536
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:52,320
spit out something that really no other application can do anything with, but Alice can understand

537
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,400
it and then translate it into something that is usable.

538
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,840
Am I following you so far?

539
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Right.

540
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
So she tries to figure it out, right?

541
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,560
She gets it and then she keeps comparing it.

542
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:05,440
We have to have a couple of expected outputs, but we go from there and piece by piece she

543
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,120
puts together the structure.

544
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:14,160
But then let's say, so the value that you add as a company is if it's something so esoteric,

545
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,000
Alice doesn't really recognize what to do with it.

546
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,360
You provide the ability to customize Alice in a way to help her work specifically with

547
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,520
that format.

548
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,460
So the business could reach out to you, contract you to do that bit of work, and then they

549
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,680
have that forever.

550
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Correct.

551
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
Right.

552
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,960
If you have some like really insane thing that is unlike anything else we've ever seen,

553
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,160
we can just do that as part of the implementation.

554
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
That's awesome.

555
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,100
That's great for you because it means that from time to time you're going to get a contract

556
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,440
to do some work and make some revenue that, you know, makes it worth reinvesting back

557
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,760
into Alice.

558
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,420
And for Pete, for businesses, you know, like the business I've worked with, they'd absolutely,

559
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,360
that's a, it's a great concept for them because it's like a, it's like we, we just have to

560
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,660
hire this chunk of work.

561
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,580
It's not like this ongoing thing that they'll have to do forever.

562
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,640
So it's not going to be like this endless pit of money.

563
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,840
It's you get the software, you hire them for some, from our, some hours of time to do this

564
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
for us.

565
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,080
It's, it's pretty straightforward.

566
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Yeah.

567
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
That's, that's the whole idea.

568
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,360
I mean, the, the other advantage is once we have an understanding, a comprehension of

569
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,680
your, your, you know, proprietary data format, well then we can do all the automation stuff

570
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,100
that you would expect from any automation tool, right?

571
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,480
Like a Zapier or something like that, where it's like, Oh, I want to automatically, you

572
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,200
know, get this data out of my system and create tickets and Trello, or I want to create, you

573
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,280
know, a report or I want to write an Excel document, stuff like that, or remind a message

574
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,480
in Slack or send a message in Slack.

575
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Yeah.

576
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Save a file and drive, right?

577
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,400
All that stuff.

578
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,200
The key is that first step though, right?

579
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,320
Of deciphering the actual crazy format.

580
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,900
That's why I, that's why I liked the Rosetta Stone analogy because that's, this is a weird

581
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,200
history nerd thing.

582
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,280
But when the Rosetta Stone was found, there was a, I think I believe a French archeologists,

583
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,600
they were able to start translating Egyptian hieroglyphics, which they never could do because

584
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,480
the other languages on the Rosetta Stone were known to them.

585
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,600
So that's the whole, that's the whole point, right?

586
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
So that's, yeah.

587
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,320
And this seems like a, it seems like it's gotta be a pretty common business problem

588
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,320
because I don't think I've been in a single business that doesn't have a problem just

589
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,200
like this, where it's either some old app they've purchased, some old application I

590
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,840
should say, or it's something they've built or something like that.

591
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,720
And it's just time to move, time to migrate or time to integrate.

592
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,440
And it's just like this roadblock they always hit.

593
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Yeah.

594
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,880
It was kind of how this idea came about.

595
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,080
I would constantly be in these sales conversations for projects that went something like this.

596
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,540
We have this insane proprietary database we bought from some company.

597
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,560
That company is now out of business.

598
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,840
We don't know how to work with this.

599
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,800
So we're stuck on this old application.

600
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,640
We want you to write a new one.

601
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,740
What's that going to cost?

602
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:57,200
And the answer was always, well, we can't get your data out or the cost was just most

603
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,320
likely too much for them to want to pursue.

604
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,080
This solves that second problem, right?

605
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,780
Well, it solves both.

606
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,480
This is a cheaper solution because it's, you're just licensing it.

607
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,520
And voila here, but welcome to the modern world.

608
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Yeah.

609
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,900
Well, and for you as a development shop, it means you don't have to build the customer

610
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,400
a GUI that sits on top of this data translation tool that you're one off building for them.

611
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Correct.

612
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
That's great.

613
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,040
I mean, it helps you scale across multiple problems without having to invent some sort

614
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,840
of graphical interface every single time.

615
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,960
And oh man, I think that's really clever.

616
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
I like it.

617
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,300
Do you have an idea of what kind of size, like, is this like a small business tool?

618
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,560
Is this like a government tool?

619
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,840
Like what do you, what's your idea on that kind of like ideal customer?

620
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Yeah.

621
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,160
I think it's more than the medium to smaller enterprise, not small business, but like you

622
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,840
got 50 to like a hundred people ish, right.

623
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,920
Where you're, you're big enough that you have custom systems already that are probably kind

624
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
of older.

625
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,000
And you could probably use some workflow automation, but you're not like, you don't have that giant

626
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,740
enterprise contracts with like, you know, Microsoft or or Oracle or whoever, right.

627
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:13,520
And they're probably using some sort of team communication tool and cloud storage and all

628
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,520
that.

629
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
Yeah.

630
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
That's pretty good.

631
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,080
So, uh, we should, we should mention if people want to check it out for themselves, alice.dev

632
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,720
and we'll have a link in the show notes.

633
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,880
It looks so slick.

634
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,880
I, whoever's doing your, uh, your Alice artwork, you got to hook me up because that's not a

635
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
problem.

636
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
You know what I'm saying?

637
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,400
I want some of that work always comes out good.

638
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,640
So there was a little, a little hiccup though.

639
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,200
Oh, so somehow my domain got flagged as malware.

640
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Yes.

641
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Right.

642
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Right.

643
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
Right.

644
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Right.

645
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
As you're like about to launch to this weekend.

646
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Yeah.

647
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Right.

648
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Oh man.

649
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
So I ran around with like a chicken with his head cut off all weekend.

650
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,920
So I've been like Dick Tracy and the underbelly of these cyber security companies that, ah,

651
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,960
so that's why you got a new Apple watch.

652
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,960
I did not get a new Apple watch.

653
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,160
I learned something very disturbing and that is one of the ways these companies decide if

654
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,800
your site is malicious is they just look at each other and say, did the other one say

655
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:21,600
it's malicious, which creates a cascading false positive, which is exactly what happened

656
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
here.

657
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Yeah.

658
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,360
So you're, in other words, not only did you have like issues with one, but you had issues

659
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,640
with multiple social media sites like Facebook and Twitter were blocking you at the same

660
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
time, right?

661
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
Uh, yes.

662
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,040
I will give Facebook some credit though.

663
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:38,240
They're their tool to like put in the URL and like ask them to manually check it.

664
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,920
They were, they were very fast.

665
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
They did it.

666
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
You were fine.

667
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,080
And I guess the Genesis is, is that at one point there was like something wonky on the

668
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,600
site, something, something flagged it, but then it just, you just get passed around on

669
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,040
these lists even after it's fixed.

670
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,760
I think what happened is at one point last year I had to have an XE for someone to download

671
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
and I just put it on the server.

672
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Oh, that's right.

673
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

674
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Right.

675
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,000
I think that's like a no, no, you can't really, you're not supposed to do that.

676
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

677
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
The demo XE.

678
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yep.

679
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
That, that's right.

680
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,780
And then you got flagged and now it's in a database and it takes months for these databases

681
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,440
to propagate is the other thing.

682
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,000
Oh man, you know, uh, you should use Linode object storage for that.

683
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I really should.

684
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,320
That's like the best, the solution to this problem.

685
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
Amazing.

686
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,480
Well, um, so that's like super last minute stress.

687
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,720
I mean, think about everybody, put yourself in Mike's shoes for a second.

688
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,120
You've been pushing for weeks, you've been building towards something.

689
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,960
It's now finally time to release it to the world, to go public, to launch it and your

690
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,040
site gets blacklisted by social media, which when there's no events going on is like the

691
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,760
primary platform to promote something like this.

692
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,240
I mean, you must have been extremely pissed.

693
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:58,880
Uh, I was more pissed when I realized that Twitter, um, their support option is you tweet

694
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,240
at them and they ignore you.

695
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
Yeah.

696
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
That's also the problem.

697
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,960
It's much like the Google Python script of go pounce and yeah.

698
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,280
Yeah, they arbitrarily decide to censor you for whatever reason.

699
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,580
And then there's really no, there's no like repercussions.

700
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,580
You can take these.

701
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,580
Okay.

702
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:19,480
Well at the same time, emailing me, emailing me to see if I'm ready to run the ads, which

703
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
I thought was hilarious.

704
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
Oh yeah.

705
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
That's great.

706
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
Yeah.

707
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
They'll happily take your ad money.

708
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
Right.

709
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,680
I was like, uh, let's just wait.

710
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,320
So that the only thing not resolved.

711
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,760
So the Alice site never had a problem.

712
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,080
The mad botter site now doesn't, but Twitter has not caught up yet.

713
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,120
So unless it has, you know, in the last couple of hours, but yeah.

714
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
All right.

715
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,960
So I know optimus gray, there was no malware on the site.

716
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,380
It's just crap forever.

717
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,080
Now here's my question.

718
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,420
When you started this, this, this project, you must have expected that by now trade shows

719
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,800
would be a thing and that you'd be out there shucking and jive and shaking hands.

720
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,680
I have a box of coasters.

721
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,000
Yes, I, I did in the stickers and stuff like that.

722
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,920
I was, uh, yeah, I was thinking, all right, we'll be going to like, like, you know, South

723
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,960
East Linux or somewhere in Denver, right?

724
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
We'll be doing something.

725
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,720
No, no, we're not.

726
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,440
So do you feel like that's going to be a, uh, an impedance?

727
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,480
Like it's going to be a softer launch because of that?

728
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,720
Um, I, I don't know.

729
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
Right.

730
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,160
This is where I, I'm a little out of my depth.

731
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,480
So I, I hired a kind of like PR consultant lady.

732
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,840
And when I told her that you couldn't tweet the link to the company site, I could hear

733
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,360
her head explode on the phone.

734
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
She's like, I quit.

735
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
She's like, I hate it.

736
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
What did you do?

737
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,000
She's like, I was like, nothing.

738
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,560
So the, the marketing strategy is going to be a social media targeting, giving the big

739
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,920
bad blue app money.

740
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,640
Both big bad blue apps actually.

741
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
Yeah.

742
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,420
I historically do not believe in this.

743
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,800
So this is kind of a maiden voyage for me.

744
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Hmm.

745
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,240
You know, I'm, I'm, I've got like savvy cow running.

746
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
I'm, I'm all hip now.

747
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,320
Chris, I'm, it's gone or the martini bar, you know, side deals at the trade show days.

748
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,440
Now you're schlepping it with the rest of us on the internet.

749
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,920
I'm, I'm like thinking about CPM and I'm like, I don't, I don't like how this works.

750
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,400
It sounds like I'm going to spend a lot of money.

751
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Yeah.

752
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,900
You said you started thinking like, well, okay, so then, okay, how much is each person

753
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,900
worth to me?

754
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,080
And I don't know about that line of thinking, you know,

755
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,880
And I'm like, do I want to like advertise this on like tech podcasts or is everybody

756
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,480
be like, ah, we could do this in a weekend as developers will.

757
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,480
That's a good question.

758
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
Huh?

759
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,680
So I'm, I'm trying, actually, I got to talk to you about that too, but I'm probably going

760
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,140
to hold my horses until the end of the month, see what happens organically.

761
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:53,040
And I have some existing customers I'm reaching out to, you know, I feel icky giving Facebook

762
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
money.

763
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Yeah.

764
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,360
That's the one I've been advised and it's just like disturbing how granular you can

765
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
get.

766
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,620
I mean, it must work or else CBS and the wall street journal and the New York times wouldn't

767
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,920
be going after Facebook on a daily basis anymore.

768
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
You know, it must work.

769
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,560
It's, it seems kind of like, okay, so, you know, we're, we're a, we're a small business.

770
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,340
So we want to target people we can reasonably kind of access, right?

771
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,440
So okay, let's just say the Southeast United States and like the New York, New Jersey metropolitan

772
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,820
area where I have, you know, existing relationships, stuff like that.

773
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,680
And the company, like company size, you can target the title of the person or what type

774
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,060
of work they do.

775
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,460
Do they have a dog?

776
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,160
I mean, it's, it's really, it's pretty impressive, huh?

777
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
It's disturbing.

778
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
Yeah.

779
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,720
But I'm going to try it because it's, you know, I would much rather go to like Linux

780
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,800
Fest Northwest, even though I wouldn't be presenting there and just like bump into somebody

781
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,040
who might want something, right?

782
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,640
Or you know, one of the kind of more business oriented chambers of commerce shows I used,

783
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,120
I used to do down here.

784
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,960
If you came to Linux Fest Northwest, you could just sit at the JB table and you would have

785
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,720
a line of people who want to talk to you.

786
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
That's yeah.

787
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Yeah.

788
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
It's true.

789
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:21,680
You know, I think, you know, you're, you're right in a sense, like I could see you trying

790
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,880
to pitch us at a tech audience and then be like, Oh, I could, I could build a shell script

791
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,680
that would take that data file and convert, but the reality is the value that you're really

792
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,580
offering is the ability to here's a done thing.

793
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:40,660
And for a set fixed amount of cost, we can customize said thing and then we can provide

794
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,460
support for that if there needs to be a change for future applications compatibility down

795
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:52,680
the road, that bulk of work ain't nobody in it got time for nobody with a job today has

796
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,680
time for that.

797
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,160
And the people who would be willing to go home and spend their evenings building that

798
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,160
for their company, I hope they're getting paid a lot because they're very, very, very

799
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,920
dedicated and valuable to that company.

800
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,360
But your real value there is you're, you've solved, if not the entire problem, 90% of

801
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:15,600
the problem and then you, because you're not slack, because you're not some huge company,

802
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:21,520
because you are a development shop that is, you know, approachable by a hundred to 200

803
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,480
person company, you can, you can interface with them and have a business relationship

804
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,000
that they can't have with a larger solution or a, you know, a guy named Ted who spent

805
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,800
the night building a bash script.

806
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
That's the real value, right?

807
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,960
And we're also not coming in with some platform that's going to like, you know, you don't

808
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,600
have, you don't have to go full Oracle.

809
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,640
I pick an Oracle because it's Oracle, right?

810
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,800
You don't, you don't, you don't have to like replace everything you have, including your

811
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
coffee machine.

812
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,960
It's like, no, just Alice kind of just sits there and helps you out.

813
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,520
You want to stick with whatever weird, by the way, the amount of huge businesses that

814
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:03,000
I have spoken to in my very, very lame sales attempts that are just running on access and

815
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,480
they're ashamed.

816
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
You can hear it.

817
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,000
Well, actually that's a, that's, that's, that's access.

818
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,080
Like the IT guy knows what he's doing as well.

819
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,840
You know what the sad thing is?

820
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,840
They're a notch above the folks that are running it all out of a spreadsheet.

821
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,560
That's the sad reality.

822
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,560
Yeah.

823
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:27,800
I have people in my family, uh, ma who are, I don't know what I would call this, but it's

824
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Excel sorcery.

825
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Sure.

826
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Yeah.

827
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,120
Like I have seen spreadsheets do things that I did not think were possible.

828
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
Yeah.

829
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,180
They like have their whole, a whole environment in there.

830
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,180
Yeah.

831
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,180
They're running VB six.

832
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,520
Of course they just don't know it.

833
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,120
This is a, this is exciting because it's a project that you're shipping that is like

834
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,160
the realization of a lot of the technologies we've been covering over the last six months

835
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,320
on the show.

836
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,960
And so now it's like, we're going to see how they actually do in practice.

837
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,960
Yes, we are.

838
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,920
And of course it's done, but obviously I'm adding more integrations, which means more

839
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,880
data formats and we're just going to keep on trucking.

840

It doesn't get better than that Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

861
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,880
Well before we get out of here, I wanted to pontificate something at you, okay?

862
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,280
You heard about this big old Twitch leak that happened where they got the source code and

863
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,520
did you see the commit notes?

864
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,520
Oh man.

865
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,520
No, I didn't.

866
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
Glorious.

867
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
Oh yeah.

868
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,200
One guy committed, I don't know why this works.

869
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
Awesome.

870
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,440
Way to go Amazon, goodbye.

871
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,220
So what I thought was interesting is when I read through some numbers that the Wall

872
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,680
Street Journal went through, they did some math.

873
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,760
I was getting a lot of App Store vibes from this and the situation that we've been talking

874
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:09,760
about with developers I think is happening at an even faster rate with even less oversight

875
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,400
to content creators.

876
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,960
Now check this out, okay?

877
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:20,000
The top 1% of Twitch streamers made over half of all the money paid out in 2021 so far.

878
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,080
Doesn't that sound like exactly how it works with the App Store?

879
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,360
Are they also selling Smurf Berries?

880
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:33,080
189 million so far this year, up from 517 million over the same period last year.

881
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,680
Three quarters of the users making any money this year have made less than $120.

882
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,240
Three quarters of the users have made less than $120.

883
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,780
Wow, that sounds like the Android App Store.

884
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:51,720
And here's what's even wild is the Wall Street Journal's analysis excluded 896,000 accounts

885
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,760
that have either made less than $120 or actually owe Twitch money for some reason.

886
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:04,480
There's 890 accounts, 890,000 accounts that they basically are excluding from this analysis.

887
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,320
The best paid streamer on Twitch made more than $5 million this year so far.

888
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,600
This is just into September.

889
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:20,120
Only 0.06% of Twitch streamers received over the US median house income of $67,000.

890
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:24,000
A quarter of all revenue was earned by the top 1,000 accounts.

891
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,640
The top 1% of Twitch streamers made over half of all money paid out in 2021.

892
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,580
These might be worse than the App Store numbers.

893
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,580
That's what I'm saying.

894
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,080
And it's happening at a faster pace, too.

895
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,400
Amazon's only owned Twitch for a few years.

896
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,560
I'm frantically trying to look up the App Store numbers, but I'm not gonna be able to

897
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,560
do it fast enough.

898
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,860
And let me tell you, my friend, the situation's not great with Spotify and podcasts either.

899
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,160
They're trying to do the same exact thing.

900
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,680
I was just gonna say, Marco Arment was just on Twitter going off about Gimlet, Glimlet,

901
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,680
something like that.

902
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,680
Oh, yeah.

903
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,680
Yeah.

904
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,680
Doesn't Spotify own them now?

905
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,680
Yeah.

906
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,120
And it's apparently he was like an investor and they're doing this kind of lockdown stuff

907
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,600
or paywall, whatever.

908
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
Yeah, that's right.

909
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,400
He got a payout when Spotify bought them.

910
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,400
Oh, good for him.

911
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
I mean, that's right.

912
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
Yeah.

913
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
Yeah.

914
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
Isn't that nice?

915
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Yeah.

916
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,920
It's happening to content at a pretty rapid pace.

917
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,680
I mean, I just want to say, Mr. Fisher, build that wall.

918
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,680
I know.

919
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,400
Well, Spotify did hit me up with a proposal.

920
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,880
It was like super low ad rates, but it was like guaranteed three ads a show and you get

921
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,720
access to our music library.

922
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,720
And I went, what?

923
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,120
Let me think about that.

924
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,120
But no, I'm not.

925
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,120
No.

926
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,120
Wait, wait.

927
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,120
To like do a DJ show?

928
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,120
No.

929
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,120
But you could.

930
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,120
But yeah, like if you use their...

931
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,080
So you have to switch your publishing platform.

932
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,400
You have to switch to their feed servers and all that kind of stuff.

933
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,360
But if you publish through, I'm not sure about this.

934
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,220
I think you can still have a public RSS feed, but you have to publish through their system.

935
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:59,360
But if you do that, they give you license like a radio station to their music library.

936
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:04,760
So you could do a DJ show or we could have like your favorite song as our intro music,

937
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,040
that kind of thing.

938
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,880
But you have to sell your soul.

939
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,880
They own you.

940
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,560
They own the content and they own all the ad deals and they give you a very small cut,

941
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,880
but they give you a lot of small cuts.

942
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,080
I mean, have you ever read the Apple developer agreement?

943
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,640
The soul's already got a couple of markers on it.

944
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,640
I know.

945
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,600
And Twitch is doing the same thing.

946
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,120
YouTube is going down its dark route.

947
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:33,520
I tell you, the only thing that's really going to save podcasting is if listeners continue

948
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,680
to use and insist they use their own podcast apps, their favorite podcast app.

949
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,240
If they use these, you know, and I, we have people listening on Spotify and I am grateful

950
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,840
they listen, especially if it's the best way or only way for you to listen.

951
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,280
But the best thing you could do is subscribe to the show at coder.show slash subscribe

952
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,340
in an independent podcast app.

953
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,880
That isn't owned by Apple or Amazon or Spotify.

954
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,880
I love overcast.

955
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,880
Right?

956
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,880
It's great.

957
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,880
You'll pry it from my cold dead hands.

958
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,080
Hey, whatever happened to pocket cast?

959
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,080
Are they still around?

960
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,080
Yeah.

961
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,440
They were bought by like a group that NPR was part of and now they're selling it.

962
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,760
They're selling it again.

963
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,080
So that group is selling it off.

964
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,440
They used to be Indie, right?

965
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,560
They were like a couple of folks, I could have sworn, wasn't it shifty jelly was the

966
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,560
name of the corporation.

967
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,560
Good memory.

968
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,560
Yeah.

969
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:30,720
And then they got bought by NPR and this group of like public radio stations and other folks.

970
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:37,640
And then NPR pushed hard for tracking in app tracking that would basically ping an HTTP

971
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,540
address when you pause, rewind, fast forward, skip, you know, that kind of stuff to try

972
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,640
to create metrics of where people are listening and not listening.

973
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,440
And they wanted to create an industry standard of tracking in the podcast apps and they wanted

974
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,920
to deploy that in pocket cast first and have pocket cast sort of roll it out and everybody

975
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,960
followed suit.

976
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:59,440
And thankfully we have enough independent podcast app creators that said no, and they

977
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,800
have enough market share that they could say no.

978
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,120
And so it never took off and the tracking standard never was adopted.

979
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,200
And so I think NPR got kind of frustrated and their group and they've just decided to

980
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,200
sell it.

981
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,200
This sounds a little awful lot like streaming video content where if you want to watch a

982
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,640
Star Trek discovery, God damn it, CBS.

983
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,960
That's exactly what they want to do.

984
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,520
And if you, if you listen in the Spotify app, they have metrics of where you listen, what

985
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,120
you, what you rewind, what you skip.

986
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,880
They know everything.

987
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,880
That's a bit creepy.

988
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,880
Let's see.

989
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,880
Just let me have my pot.

990
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,200
I mean, podcast ads used to be, at least on me, the most, one of the most effective ways

991
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,200
to advertise.

992
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,240
Like, yeah, I buy stuff off pocket ads even today all the time.

993
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,960
I think it's the kind we do though, right?

994
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,340
Like when you hear, like when you, when you turn on a planet money or something and they

995
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:55,280
blast you with two pre-produced ads that aren't even from the hosts that do the show, like

996
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,060
they don't stick at all for me.

997
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,360
They, they don't register at all.

998
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:05,600
But if somebody comes on and you know, like, you know, at the beginning of the year I bought

999
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,160
some Warby Parker pants.

1000
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,360
I think it's Warby Parker, right?

1001
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,360
No, no.

1002
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,360
They make pants?

1003
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,360
I thought they make glasses.

1004
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,360
No, no, no, no, no.

1005
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,360
I'm getting them mixed up.

1006
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,360
But that's the advertising.

1007
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,360
It works.

1008
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,360
Warby Parker is the glasses.

1009
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,360
Exactly.

1010
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,360
But that was an ad.

1011
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,360
But no, I'm thinking of Mack Weldon.

1012
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,780
I bid on a Mack Weldon deal in a podcast ad, you know, but I don't normally buy it on those

1013
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,800
ads that are just pre-rolls and pre-produced and all of that.

1014
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,920
I mean, I buy stuff off JB ads all the time, as should you.

1015
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,920
That's right.

1016
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,920
That's right.

1017
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,920
Absolutely.

1018
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,920
That's how you do it.

1019
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,920
That's how you pay for the tea.

1020
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,920
Links in the show notes.

1021
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,520
I'm just worried about this and where it's going because really it's just sort of the

1022
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,440
trend of everything to get centralized like this.

1023
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:48,400
And I don't know, I guess thankfully we have a very geeky audience, so they're likely to

1024
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,960
continue to want things like open RSS feeds and web pages with show notes and stuff like

1025
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,760
that.

1026
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,120
But maybe not, maybe the average listener won't or maybe it'll change how people consume

1027
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,120
the media.

1028
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:06,360
Well, you know, all those Linux guys buying the M1s, that's the gateway drug right there,

1029
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,360
Chris.

1030
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,360
I have a confession to make.

1031
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,360
Yes.

1032
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:16,040
Oh my God, this would be the best show ever.

1033
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,160
You bought an M1.

1034
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,000
I ordered an M1 last night.

1035
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Which one?

1036
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,920
I got the Mac Mini fully decked.

1037
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,920
Fully decked.

1038
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,920
Yes.

1039
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:32,280
Because I've gotten words from the developers of, I'm trying to say it right, Asahi Linux.

1040
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,240
They've put the word out that they are very, very close, that they've got a functional

1041
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,960
usable desktop right now.

1042
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,240
I saw that too.

1043
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,240
Yeah.

1044
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,800
And they're working on an image and an installer.

1045
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,080
It'll probably be out soon.

1046
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,080
So I did it.

1047
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,080
I did it.

1048
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,660
I'm going to, I want to get it in time to try it out when they release it.

1049
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,160
So because there's a bit of a delay right now, it's like the end of the month is when

1050
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,160
it's going to ship.

1051
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:58,440
If I got it all stock with the crappy amount of storage that they include and the crappy

1052
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,440
amount of RAM.

1053
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,440
Yeah.

1054
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,240
Apple doesn't believe in Photoshop files or audio files or video.

1055
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,240
No.

1056
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,240
No.

1057
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
I know.

1058
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,240
Right?

1059
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,240
And it's like the way it's going to work right now is you have to dual boot.

1060
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,320
There isn't like get rid of macOS.

1061
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,160
And you'd want to keep macOS for firmware updates and whatnot.

1062
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,960
So you need enough disk space to have enough room for both operating systems to live happily.

1063
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,960
So you got to upgrade it.

1064
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,960
You know?

1065
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,960
So I have a confession.

1066
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Oh.

1067
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:27,600
I have a problem that I don't know how to solve without selling and replacing my air.

1068
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,280
Oh, I have run out of storage.

1069
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,280
Yeah.

1070
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:37,320
And when I say I've run out, I had to update macOS there and I had to delete stuff to update

1071
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,320
macOS.

1072
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,200
Have you tried cloud storage?

1073
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Yeah.

1074
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,200
No.

1075
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:52,440
I really don't understand Apple's just like ridiculous markup on hard drives.

1076
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,240
It's so bad still.

1077
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,240
And memory.

1078
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,240
It's so bad.

1079
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,240
It's so, so bad.

1080
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,240
It's so bad.

1081
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:04,600
I mean, I bought the M1 because if it can run Linux effectively, and I think it will,

1082
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,840
I may transition it eventually to my home server in my RV, which is currently a couple

1083
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,120
of Raspberry Pis.

1084
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,120
Right.

1085
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,160
And you know, the Mac mini has a pretty good power draw even at full load.

1086
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,160
It's like 33 watts and it has pretty low noise and it has really good thermals.

1087
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:28,840
And I could easily pull my two or three Raspberry Pis and put one M1 Mac mini running arch

1088
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,160
and let it just, you know, be my powerhouse.

1089
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,560
So I think that might be the ultimate trajectory.

1090
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:38,800
So my bet on Asahi Linux is that I just can run it as a headless Linux box.

1091
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,680
I mean, I think they'll get the graphical environment accelerated, but even if they

1092
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,760
don't, it's still a win for me.

1093
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,120
So I decided to pull the trigger.

1094
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:50,960
I don't think the M1 as they are today could function as a desktop for me because absolutely,

1095
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,600
especially if I was using a Mac, I would, I would need a lot of virtualization capacity.

1096
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,720
So yeah, that we're talking a minimum 32 gigs of RAM, cause you know, I'm probably legitimately,

1097
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,320
I often have two or three different VMs going on depending on what I'm working on for, you

1098
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,520
know, a show or something like that.

1099
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,440
It can be a lot.

1100
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,400
So I got, yeah, that'd have to be a factor, but you know, it's coming soon.

1101
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:19,200
I suspect you could always, uh, could always gift this, the air to the kid or to the girlfriend

1102
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,600
and then get yourself an M1 X or something.

1103
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,960
Why would you ever encourage my podcast ads to buy?

1104
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,520
I know I'm the worst.

1105
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,520
I'm the worst.

1106
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,520
Oh boy.

1107
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,000
But yeah, um, I'm excited to try it out.

1108
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,320
Although if it comes in a different color or shape, I'll have to, I'll have to give

1109
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,280
it a go with macOS for a couple of days just to get a feel for it.

1110
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,160
But I suspect by the time I'm receiving it, the Linux project will be ready with their

1111
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,160
installers.

1112
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,720
I am going to tell you macOS, why did Apple break Safari on iOS?

1113
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,920
Oh, you having a hard time?

1114
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,320
Well, if I have a field such as the Google for work or whatever they call it now, G suite,

1115
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:02,820
whatever sign in page, and I don't want to be on that page, but somehow the password

1116
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:09,240
field got focus, the keyboard blocks my ability because they've put the URL bar in the bottom

1117
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:14,560
to actually get out of that without having to do a very unintuitive top of the screen,

1118
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,240
like slap swipe thing.

1119
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,380
There's way too much going on down there now.

1120
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:20,800
It's very non-intuitive.

1121
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,800
I don't understand.

1122
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,760
I feel like it's something I would do to people as a prank at like a cocktail party.

1123
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,640
It does seem like a prank.

1124
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,600
I turn on like colorblind mode on people's phones when they leave them unlocked.

1125
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,960
Like I honestly thought someone was screwing with me.

1126
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,080
I'm like, Reese, you're five.

1127
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,080
You're amazing.

1128
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,080
Did you just like break my phone?

1129
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,960
They put the window selection down there, the URL, URL bar selection down there.

1130
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,000
If you're on the iPad with a keyboard, there's a little keyboard thing that's down there

1131
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,720
and the task switchers down there.

1132
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,040
Oh, they did it to the iPad too.

1133
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,520
I didn't update my iPad yet.

1134
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,520
Oh God.

1135
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:56,400
It's like, I tweeted a couple of weeks ago about Safari on Mac being just what the hell?

1136
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,240
Like a psychedelic nightmare of tabs changing colors.

1137
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,240
I think it's great.

1138
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,680
I'm just letting you know, you are, you are coming from the sublime world of KDE.

1139
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,680
Yeah.

1140
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,680
Yeah.

1141
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,680
It's true.

1142
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,680
You're going to, you're going to hate it.

1143
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,680
I tell you, I, I, I use Safari very sparingly, so it doesn't really, it doesn't hit me very

1144
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,680
hard.

1145
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,680
Like I had a dream.

1146
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,640
I'm like, maybe Apple should just buy elementary, like seriously, just huh.

1147
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,640
Like elementary.

1148
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:24,240
I know they don't love this comparison, but it's like a good version of Mac OS.

1149
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,240
Yeah.

1150
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,240
Back when it was good.

1151
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,240
Right.

1152
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,240
It's like, it's prettier snow leopard, right?

1153
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,240
They, I mean, they've done modern improvements.

1154
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,480
Of course, snow leopard's super old now, but.

1155
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,440
It's like back when Mac OS was designed to be a good interface and not trying to keep

1156
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,200
up with yearly trends of design themes that the design department comes up with.

1157
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,680
I don't think anybody, like, and I mean literally anybody was like, you know what would be great

1158
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,160
in my web browser?

1159
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:52,020
The inability to see that I have other tabs open unless I magically remember.

1160
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:57,160
And also why don't we change my screen's color to neon orange and then black and then blue

1161
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,840
and then red because the branding and the best is, so then I of course had to check

1162
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,840
the Alice site.

1163
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,840
Cause I'm like, is this obnoxiously blue?

1164
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,840
It is not.

1165
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,400
I don't know why it's not.

1166
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,480
I went to the Mad Botter site.

1167
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,280
Is it going to be like crazy purple?

1168
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,720
It is not.

1169
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:21,000
But somehow my GitLab instance is the most aggressive form of fire orange that I have

1170
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
ever seen in my life.

1171
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Yeah.

1172
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
It's great.

1173
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's just great.

1174
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,600
I'm Safari and I claim Safari and I GitLab.

1175
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,600
Johnny I would never let this ship.

1176
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,560
He would be like, what are you doing?

1177
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,560
Make it Chrome and you put the Adobe program down.

1178
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,560
Sorry.

1179
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,560
I miss Johnny.

1180
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,860
I want to say thank you to our Coder QA team out there.

1181
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:47,080
The new Coderly has been recorded and it will be edited as soon as Drew is available.

1182
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,400
He's a busy guy and we just sort of slipped that in on him, but it'll be out in the feeds

1183
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,400
sooner than later.

1184
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,400

1187
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,280
Mr. Dominic, where do you want to send people this week?

1188
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,160
Go to Alice.dev and if you all could do me a favor, any little bit of help in this scary

1189
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,840
new world of social media helps or retweet, whatever, I appreciate it a lot.

1190
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,840
Yeah.

1191
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,420
Help celebrate by helping spread the word.

1192
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:20,600
Seems like we need it more than ever these days between getting blocked by social media

1193
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,920
and there being no events, definitely could use the help.

1194
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,720
You can also find them on Twitter at Dumanuco, his company's at the Mad Botter Inc.
