00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTORadio, episode 466 for May 16, 2022.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:18,680
Hey, good looking and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,880
pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,760
My name is Chris, and joining us every single week from his command bunker, it's our host,

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,760
Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,760
On screen.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,760
Full magnification.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,760
Enhance.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
Enhance.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
I love that.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,760
And I always love when somebody like rings the doorbell.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Enter.

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
Enter.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,680
There are four lights.

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,680
That was for the days.

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
That was for the days.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,680
Ah, man.

19
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,680
Oh, man.

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,720
So I might sound a little off, I might sound a little different.

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,640
I am in Southern Oregon, getting my RV ready for another summer road trip.

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,080
And we still had a few last suspension fixes from the last trip that had to get done.

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,520
So it's about 400 miles from the studio, some about 400 miles south.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,360
And it's a totally different climate down here.

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,280
It's so nice.

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,200
Mid 70s, low 70s today.

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Sunshine.

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, I forgot that stuff exists, man.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,160
You live up in the Pacific Northwest, and it's just like gray clouds all the time.

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,460
Not to complain about the weather on the show, but I legitimately feel like I'm in a better

31
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,460
mood down here.

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,460
It's nice.

33
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,760
I know you wouldn't understand, Mr. Florida.

34
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
I know.

35
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,880
I mean, you don't just hang out with snakes and alligators all day, like, chilling?

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
Right.

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,040
Meanwhile, you're blowing up my Twitter this week, working on Alice and prepping her for

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,560
OpenCore and geeking out on Python.

39
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,160
Like I had a busy Twitter week.

40
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,600
You even had a busier one.

41
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
I know.

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
It's been a hell of a week.

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,640
I'm trying to figure out this whole OpenCore, you know, GPL thing, and God, it's very complicated.

44
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,880
I heard a new term this last week.

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,760
It was something like Core Open or something.

46
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,520
They just flipped the term.

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,360
Is that a new term or is that like string reverse, but fancier?

48
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
Yeah.

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,400
I was like, can they do that?

50
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Does that work?

51
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,320
I don't know about that.

52
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:15,120
Oh, man, we got so many messages about Microsoft Access last week.

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,760
You know, I won't out them, but we got an email from a listener who works at Microsoft

54
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,440
and they had to look up what Access was after listening to the show.

55
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,480
How does that make you feel?

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,200
Well, you got to remember too, at Access, not all accesses are the same.

57
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,920
It's just like a name.

58
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,400
It's it's it's I'm going to you know what?

59
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,000
No, we've spent too much time discussing Microsoft Access on this show.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,040
One of the choice ones was 97 and Five writes in, he says, look, man, I needed to eat.

61
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,240
But he writes, my role at a company in the past was converting Access 97 database apps

62
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
to VB.net.

63
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,600
Oh, for sure.

64
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,280
Some of these applications had all of the data within an access file, which, as you

65
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,560
might know, does not do a one to one transfer to Microsoft SQL.

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,560
Sometimes I would get lucky and some of the data would already live in Microsoft SQL.

67
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,980
But most of the code didn't translate well either.

68
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,380
So I typically had to recreate the application from scratch.

69
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,440
The team continued building access applications while I was in the process of converting them

70
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,000
and access 97 didn't use proper locking methods.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,220
And that was actually one of the reasons why the team didn't want to move to a new version

72
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,220
of access.

73
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,220
It just kept kicking users out.

74
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,880
They didn't want locking anyways.

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,840
Sometimes you just have to make your way through life and sometimes you have to do shameful

76
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,880
things to be able to eat.

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,600
I now code like a gentleman with Python.

78
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Is Python the sort of like blue blooded open doors for ladies and always tuck your shirt

79
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
in language?

80
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
I thought that was closure.

81
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
It's the language.

82
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,120
It's the language you take home to your parents.

83
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Yeah, that enclosure.

84
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Yeah.

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
I see.

86
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,880
So you have like a bender, a romantic bender for a couple of years at Objective-C. Although

87
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,800
Objective-C would be the cougar of languages.

88
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,080
Oh, I was going to say Objective-C was the one that your grandparents brought home for

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
dinner.

90
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
Oh.

91
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,640
You know, this could get worse.

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,920
The Objective-C is like, I knew your dad very well, in fact.

93
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Oh.

94
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
Yeah.

95
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,800
And then you realize your dad has a history that you never knew about.

96
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Yeah.

97
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
We don't want to go there.

98
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
My poor son.

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Let's just keep going.

100
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Oh, my God.

101
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,080
All right.

102
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,640
So Dan writes in and he says he's kind of tired of hearing about the podcasting 2.0

103
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
stuff.

104
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,880
He means it with all due respect and he does get value from the show.

105
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,200
So he became a member to support the network a few months ago and he's happy with that.

106
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,280
But he's really, really disliking the boost because he feels like they're ads.

107
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,800
He says, I respect Chris and I understand that you choose to evangelize this as an alternative

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,920
to memberships.

109
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
And that's fair enough.

110
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,040
He says, I don't think it should be placed in the members feed.

111
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,440
I like paying for Netflix and I get that adding value for value is important.

112
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Sorry for the rant.

113
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
It's meant with respect.

114
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,440
Oh, no, Dan, don't feel bad at all.

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
I wanted to cover this.

116
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,520
So Dan writes and he's like, I'm tired of hearing about this.

117
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,200
And I think I messed up.

118
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,160
When I initially started talking about podcasting 2.0 and stuff like that, I just was so excited

119
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,080
that I just ran my mouth, you know, just jumped in the term that the community has over there

120
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,920
is running with scissors.

121
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,560
And it is just that it is running with scissors for sure.

122
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,920
But I probably messed up the pitch, right, because and I've decided what I'm going to

123
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,280
do is I'm just going to kind of stop talking about it too much in the other shows.

124
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,320
I'll still push it forward and talk about it from here there.

125
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,560
But office hours is really where that's going to be my outlet to a degree.

126
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,440
But I want to mention why I'm very excited about this and then I'm going to just drop

127
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
it on the show.

128
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,120
I mean, I will bring it up from time to time, but I won't bring it up every week.

129
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,420
Podcasting 2.0 is more than just value for value and boosts.

130
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,680
It's an important part of it, but it is a spec.

131
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,200
Here's a couple of the things that I really like about it that I think would be great

132
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
for podcasting.

133
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,760
Number one transcripts that's good for SEO and accessibility.

134
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,360
Number two chapters, we need a standard way of doing this number three soundbites, shareability

135
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,240
of podcasts is very poor right now.

136
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,560
YouTube crushes this seasons.

137
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,840
Right now we have like a proprietary way where Apple has created a tag, they've modified

138
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
the RSS spec.

139
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,280
Well, they've just added this tag and other people have just sort of clumsily implemented

140
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
it.

141
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,320
And that's how we get seasons of podcasts right now.

142
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,680
The spec has a standardized way to do this.

143
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Alternate enclosures.

144
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,880
This is another really good one.

145
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,120
One feed entry, multiple file types, low bit rate, high bit rate, video, opus, all in one

146
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,140
feed entry images.

147
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,220
The ability to show the occasional image at the particular time in the show when we're

148
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,840
talking about something could be nice, wouldn't want to overuse it, but it's nice to have

149
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,520
live.

150
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,800
They have and are working on the ability for podcasting 2.0 apps to support live streams

151
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,040
in your podcast app.

152
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,780
So you open up your podcast app and in your list of shows, Coder Radio will be listed

153
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,900
with a on air or live badge next to it.

154
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,000
And you could just tap that and tune into Coder Radio live from your existing podcast

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
app.

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know why we've never had that.

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,320
We clearly need that.

158
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,800
Social interact.

159
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,000
This is a part of the spec that is a cross app, cross platform, activity, pub driven

160
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
comment system.

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,200
So you could have universal comments across apps and services for podcasts and then the

162
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,080
channel disclosure tag.

163
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,240
This allows a podcaster to signal when perhaps there's going to be no more episodes released

164
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,020
in a feed or other kinds of information about a feed that a podcast app could consume.

165
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,400
And then lastly, amongst many other things that I haven't even gotten to are the value

166
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,320
and the boosts.

167
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,620
Podcasting 2.0 brings a range of features that podcasting has needed for a decade.

168
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,000
And it does it in an open source community driven way instead of Apple or Spotify coming

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,760
up with proprietary RSS tag improvements that is there's no spec for the developers just

170
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,900
kind of clumsily implement.

171
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,900
That's it.

172
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,680
I'll talk more about this in office hours because that's where I'm going to talk about

173
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,680
a lot of our long term strategy stuff and answer questions and stuff like this.

174
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,760
I plan for JB to go all in on podcasting 2.0 and so as people pick up new podcast apps,

175
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,720
they're going to start to see new features show up and boosts are one of them.

176
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,640
And that was the one that I got the most excited about the quickest because it solves the monetization

177
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,480
problem for both podcasts and free software.

178
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,800
And it does it at a time when advertising is retracting, the economy is slowing and

179
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,840
this system is growing, right?

180
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,760
So that's what I led with.

181
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,360
But I think you'll see that stuff like the podcasting 2.0 spec is necessary for podcasting

182
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,820
to stay healthy and to compete with Apple, Spotify, YouTube and others.

183
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,640
But the good news is for everybody who's sick of me talking about it in coder, I'm going

184
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,680
to try to keep most of this contained to office hours as time goes on.

185
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,960
So there's that.

186
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,840
And I understand Dan and mostly the whole boost thing and all of the podcasting 2.0

187
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,240
stuff is not meant to replace anything that exists now.

188
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,540
So if you're listening to a podcast and you're listening to it in your favorite app and you

189
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,440
don't plan to adopt any of this stuff, your experience won't change.

190
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,500
That's the idea.

191
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,840
All of this stuff is additional.

192
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,600
It benefits, it supports, it boosts, it doesn't replace.

193
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
That's the idea.

194
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,060
It's hard to talk about, you know, because it's something I'm really excited about as

195
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,140
a as a project.

196
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,800
But I understand the audience.

197
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,040
It's like a it's like me talking about how we make the sausage basically.

198
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,920
We make it with hickory smoked pork.

199
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,320
We weren't gonna actually talk about sausage.

200
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,720
No, well, I mean, we could talk about sausage.

201
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I don't know.

202
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Would you get what I have?

203
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,880
You ever had this where you're like, I mean, I think this is what a lot of the show probably

204
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,520
has been when it comes to the app store stuff.

205
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,640
So it's like, yeah, you recognize something that your industry needs to get their head

206
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,400
out of their ass about.

207
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,280
And you kind of need your audience or, you know, your customer base on board, too, because

208
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,340
you need them to adopt these new features to create the demand.

209
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,840
So that way, other apps like antenna pod and overcast, they start adding these features,

210
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,580
which they never will unless their users ask for them.

211
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,380
So it's a real chicken and the egg problem.

212
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,260
And so I have to be the jerk sticking his neck out there, pushing it forward, because

213
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,640
otherwise we just sort of have a stalemate.

214
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Yeah.

215
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,320
And more than that, it's I think about the app store stuff from, you know, when I was

216
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,140
bitching about it in 2012, 2013 ish.

217
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,920
That case is what happens if it doesn't work, right?

218
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,560
If the community does not kind of, you know, step up and say, hey, this is kind of messed

219
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,820
up, you get monopolies.

220
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:26,480
And I could see something very similar happening in podcasting in terms of monetization of

221
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
podcasts, right?

222
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Yeah.

223
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,740
And the right now, any new thing that podcasts have gotten like seasons, or chapters, it's

224
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,420
all just sort of been a ragtag implementation, maybe like Apple created a tag, or some Germans

225
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,780
created a way you can cram something in like the ID three information.

226
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,540
And it's just sort of out of spec, but we all just do it that way.

227
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,660
The susa developers created a new XML tag.

228
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,300
Yeah, that's essentially what it is.

229
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,220
And then we all we basically just get enough people using it that it becomes the new standard,

230
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,740
but there's no community input.

231
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,060
There's nobody driving them iterating them.

232
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,260
The actual core podcasting spec for the RSS feed, as far as I know, I could have this

233
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
wrong.

234
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,140
But as far as I know, it hasn't been updated since 2009, in any official sort of standard

235
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,140
way.

236
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,380
What we've gotten since 2009, has mostly been whatever whatever Apple crams in there and

237
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,060
then other people just kind of implement.

238
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,060
I do get it.

239
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,060
It is a tricky thing.

240
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,900
And when you're a consumer of something, you have a different relationship with a problem

241
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,180
than when you are in the industry working with it.

242
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,860
So and I blew the initial communication on it, because I saw a much bigger problem when

243
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,700
it comes to monetizing free software that I thought maybe we could address by building

244
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,060
a network out around lightning, but it is what it is.

245
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,660
I'm only human and I learn and I iterate.

246
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,100
lino.com slash coder go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you

247
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
go there to support the show.

248
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,220
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting for developers, you got to try it for your next

249
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,220
project.

250
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,940
It's what we've used for everything we've built in the last couple of years.

251
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,460
And Linode has been rolling out upgrades, they're always rolling out upgrades for as

252
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,300
long as they've been a customer, it seems like they're always updating the infrastructure,

253
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:16,460
keeping it super competitive, 11 data centers around the world, MVME storage, AMD epic processors,

254
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,420
40 gigabit connections coming into the machines.

255
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,420
It's really high performance and the UI is smooth, clean, easy to get going.

256
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,500
If you're a newbie or a pro, I'm talking like one click deployments or like super custom

257
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,660
rigs, however you like to roll.

258
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,340
And then they have the best support to back it up so you can feel safe and comfortable

259
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,620
putting your important stuff on there.

260
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,380
And go say hi to Linode at KubeCon EU if you're going to be there, they'll be there in Spain

261
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,300
May 16 through the 20th.

262
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,060
If you want to go say holler to the folks over at Linode, go find them over there and

263
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,100
tell them that the Coder radio program sent you.

264
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,300
So if you're a performance hound, or if you like stability, or if you like great support,

265
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,900
or a nice clean API that integrates with tools and libraries that you're already familiar

266
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,180
with, Linode is a great option.

267
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,520
You see, they've been doing this for over 19 years, or at least almost 19 years now,

268
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
they're somewhere in that range.

269
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,260
I used to say 18 years, but I realized that was a year ago.

270
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,260
Because Linode's been great.

271
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,700
They've been supporting the Coder radio show for a while.

272
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,700
Because they get it.

273
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,060
And they know that you guys out there are the perfect audience for something like this.

274
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,060
So go try it for yourself.

275
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,240
Go see it's real.

276
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,300
Go build something, go test something, go learn something, and use it for your next

277
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
project.

278
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,180
You go to linode.com slash coder.

279
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,640
That's where you go to get the $100 in 60 day credit.

280
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,560
And it's how you support the show, linode.com slash coder.

281
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,380
So apparently, we have a Heroku takedown.

282
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,340
And I can't disagree with pretty much any of this.

283
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,880
The piece is titled Why Did Heroku Fail?

284
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,500
If you don't remember Heroku started what, 15 years ago?

285
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Something like that.

286
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Yeah.

287
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Yeah.

288
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,460
They did a whole rebuild in 2009.

289
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,620
And then in 2010, they were sold to Salesforce for 212 million.

290
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,260
And Heroku always had a pricing problem, in my opinion, and every time we've talked about

291
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,580
it, that's always been one of the issues kind of underlying it is because they're running

292
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,460
on top of EC2, their run costs are high.

293
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,100
And they were higher back then, of course.

294
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Right.

295
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,340
Yeah, they've addressed some of that now.

296
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:19,980
But you look at Heroku and you think to yourself, I mean, I could do this kind of on a linode

297
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,980
now.

298
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,380
And I wonder if that isn't part of the problem is they're just not as needed as they once

299
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,380
were.

300
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,820
Because now you've got a lot of options for deploying software anywhere you want and really

301
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,820
abstracting it away.

302
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,820
Yeah.

303
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
I think there's a few things.

304
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:37,260
But you know, for me, my introduction to Heroku was when I was first getting into Rails.

305
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,300
And at the time, Heroku was very Rails centric.

306
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Totally.

307
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
And that, you know, it sounds silly.

308
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,920
And I know the hardcore, you have to put yourself back then, right?

309
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,380
There wasn't like, Docker Hub, where you could just pull random stuff that you need.

310
00:14:52,380 --> 00:15:00,480
The whole DevOps, even on a small scale infrastructure, just it was still pretty obnoxious.

311
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,260
Heroku had that beautiful marketplace.

312
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,980
You want to add paper trail for logging for your app?

313
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,980
Go ahead.

314
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,420
And here's a two thing, two line thing you have to do to the Rails config to make it

315
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,420
work.

316
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,420
Oh, and we're Heroku.

317
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,140
So we do all the DNS and all that for you.

318
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,140
So we gotcha.

319
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,140
Don't worry.

320
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:22,500
I kind of feel like the pain point was when they, correctly, because Rails is popularity,

321
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,620
you know, it wasn't going to take them everywhere they needed to go, in terms of just market

322
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,140
penetration.

323
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:34,420
Well, once they went more generic, and they tried to add other stacks, it really, it just

324
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,220
made it worse, I think, in a lot of ways.

325
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,440
And of course, the pricing where the dinos were expensive.

326
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,520
And I think we'd be remiss if we don't mention just some of the massive security breaches

327
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
they just had.

328
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,940
Yeah, that definitely doesn't help with the whole publicity and adoption.

329
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:56,220
I don't know, I feel like also, a lot of what made it so slick was what they took care of

330
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:03,260
and get up actions came along and a lot of ci pipelines that just sort of come out of

331
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,500
the box came along and one click deployments of entire applications became a lot more common

332
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,860
and there just started to be one less reason after one less reason.

333
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,980
I mean, they're still around, right?

334
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,980
They're still going.

335
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,220
I mean, they've made it 15 years in so in some ways, maybe it's not a failure.

336
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,580
But when you look at the adoption trend, when you look at where they're going, you look

337
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,260
at their revenue, it kind of looks like days are limited, especially now that they're owned

338
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,260
by Salesforce.

339
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,660
Like, are they really committed to just dumping more and more money in this thing to compete

340
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,860
with AWS, Azure, Linode and, and those guys?

341
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,500
Oh, I don't, I don't think they have to I think Heroku is like, it's fine being owned

342
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,560
by Salesforce, I would argue is almost part of the problem, right?

343
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,860
They didn't take bets they ought to have taken because, you know, you know how it is when

344
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,820
a startup gets bought by a big company, you get a brain drain of the people who, oh, you

345
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:00,780
want me to fill out some like, compliance form, because your HR has this policy.

346
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,860
Oh, there's mandatory training.

347
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,500
I mean, you've come on, you've you've definitely seen this before,

348
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,740
the inclination to take risks, kind of just vaporizes, right, because when you work in

349
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,900
an organization like that, there's no one really who owns a particular initiative.

350
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,260
So no one's, no one's really on the line if something doesn't go through.

351
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,340
And so we that just sort of as a culture that prevents risk taking, in my opinion,

352
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,340
go for sure.

353
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:32,800
I mean, I definitely would argue that the your incentives flip from we need to stay

354
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,340
ahead of the curve and be competitive to we need to be stable and avoid lawsuits.

355
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,340
Right?

356
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,260
Yeah, we've got people that are paying for this, don't you know?

357
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,860
Well, and like, we're big enough now that Oh, maybe it is worth somebody actually suing

358
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
us.

359
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,820
So, you know, maybe it's the spring air here in southern Oregon that I'm smelling the flowers

360
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,300
bloom, or maybe it's that new fresh release candidate of TypeScript.

361
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,620
Oh, look at that, the boys got a new TypeScript.

362
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,620
That's right.

363
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,620
It's a beta release.

364
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,900
Well, I guess it's released candidate now.

365
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
But it's close.

366
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
It's not the final version.

367
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,020
But it's really, it's nigh.

368
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,520
I think probably the thing that they're at least the most excited about outwardly.

369
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,460
This release also includes a new preview editor for the command go to source definition.

370
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,780
I guess this can be helpful in cases where an ordinary go to definition command would

371
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,860
take you to a declaration file, instead of the actual JavaScript or TypeScript source,

372
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,380
which is annoying.

373
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,620
And it also seems like they're starting to target node 16, even though they call it node

374
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,620
12.

375
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,560
In this release that part I don't get but there's there's a weird node versioning thing

376
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,140
that's been going on for a while.

377
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,280
But I mean, overall, I don't want to complain.

378
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,900
I don't I'm not complaining.

379
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,900
It's not my problem.

380
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,900
I don't have to figure it out.

381
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
So

382
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,060
Yeah, you know, I write a fair amount of TypeScript.

383
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,500
I mean, I find myself because I'm, you know, crotchety, falling back on because TypeScript

384
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,620
is a pure superset of JavaScript, so you can only you know, all JavaScript is valid TypeScript.

385
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,520
Finding myself wanting to ignore some of the TypeScript stuff.

386
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,660
Because I'm lazy and trust me compiler, I do know what I'm doing, except I don't but

387
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,500
I just want to like hit F5 and have this work.

388
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,060
Still the language, you know, the language is younger than the show.

389
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,260
I'm pretty sure.

390
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,660
Yeah, I think so.

391
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,660
Wow.

392
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,620
It started off as syntactic sugar to JavaScript to do like soft type annotations or not solve

393
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,480
a pretty, you know, it did to do typing, right?

394
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,700
It reminds me a lot of, frankly, the Python three stuff where, you know, they have the

395
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,060
type hinting, but it's super weak, and there's all kinds of weird cases in it.

396
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,540
Well, TypeScript has just gone in and I out statically typed and all that goodness.

397
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,620
You know, I'm not a TypeScript is the future of web development.

398
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,880
Never ever do pure JavaScript again kind of guy, but it's starting to look like a more

399
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,940
robust language.

400
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,420
I mean, it looks a hell of a lot like C sharp these days.

401
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,220
A lot of positive sentiment towards TypeScript out there these days.

402
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,100
It's also the same guy who created C sharp.

403
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,380
They've earned a special spot TypeScript 4.7 is nigh.

404
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,740
We'll put a link in the show notes if you'd like to read more about it.

405
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:14,180
We both had an interesting and perhaps underwhelmed takeaway from Google IO.

406
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,260
I thought I noticed that your top thing was Flutter three was announced.

407
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,280
You know, Flutter is one of these projects that people keep telling me about and I keep

408
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,700
saying, oh, that looks really cool.

409
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,940
Oh, it's made by Google.

410
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,940
Waiting for it to die.

411
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,660
Yeah, I'm just like waiting for it to to to go.

412
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,540
I mean, shall we say the names reader wave?

413
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,540
We could do that.

414
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:41,180
Yeah, I think what gives Flutter a fighting chance is that it is, I think, tied in with

415
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,640
their overall fuchsia initiatives, too.

416
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,860
And they've been sticking with us.

417
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,260
They like they've never really officially made a big stink about fuchsia other than

418
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,660
a few blog posts and, you know, put it on a few of their devices.

419
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:58,060
It seems like fuchsia is like this long term skunkworks project, probably ultimately to

420
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,780
replace Linux.

421
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:05,920
And Flutter is maybe important for the client side of that or for the front end UI stuff.

422
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,620
So I think I think I might be wrong, but I think fuchsia and Dart have to die for Flutter

423
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,620
to die.

424
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,140
Maybe they could kill Flutter without killing those things.

425
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
I might be wrong.

426
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,620
I don't think fuchsia is going anywhere.

427
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,620
Yeah.

428
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,020
Well, I mean, you never know.

429
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,140
There's the most proto Microsoft company out there these days.

430
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,860
They are Microsoft of a different era with more money.

431
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:35,100
And I actually felt like Google I.O. 2022 really put that on display.

432
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,200
It really brought that home to me.

433
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,800
It was a very cohesive Google I.O.

434
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,100
It felt like it was put together by one team.

435
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,600
Google I.O. usually feels very disparate, very disorganized, disjointed, like different

436
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,600
fiefdoms create different parts of their keynote and then they go up there and present it to

437
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,860
each other, whereas this year it felt cohesive.

438
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,940
It felt like a singular, boring corporate message.

439
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,740
And I'm kind of sad to see it.

440
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,620
They needed to get there.

441
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:14,460
But this must have been the most low key, low hype Google I.O. I've ever seen.

442
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:22,260
And by my account, we got seven product announcements and none of them are very interesting.

443
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,860
This is a week year.

444
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,740
And I agree with you that it was boring as hell, but should we just go through the seven

445
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,740
highlights?

446
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,740
Sure.

447
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,740
Yeah.

448
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,220
So off the bat, this is actually my favorite one.

449
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,340
Automatic summaries to Google Docs and chat, and I'm aware we don't call it Google Docs

450
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,340
anymore.

451
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,340
I don't think we do.

452
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,340
Who knows?

453
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,340
They change the name every week.

454
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,340
That's kind of cool.

455
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,980
Again, it's not super developer centric.

456
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,860
There's a new face lighting effect in Meet.

457
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,860
Awesome.

458
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,500
The more you can copy Apple, the better.

459
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,860
Wallet on Wear OS.

460
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,860
Wear OS.

461
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,340
OK, I can't believe I can't believe they didn't have that already.

462
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,340
Yeah.

463
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,340
Pixel watch.

464
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,900
Great.

465
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,100
I guess Pixel six and seven.

466
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,100
I'm sorry.

467
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,300
Pixel six, a Pixel seven and Pixel Pro.

468
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,980
This one was weird to me because, like, they made such a fuss about the six coming out

469
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,820
and they've kind of immediately shot their own product in the face.

470
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,820
Right.

471
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,660
And they're not going to sell any of the Pixel sixes now that the six and the seven and seven

472
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,700
Pro have been announced, like they've just killed all of their future sales.

473
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,060
Google Pixel tablet.

474
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,620
This is a little interesting because I could see it in enterprise environments being like

475
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:39,220
you want to run tablet software in your factory or, you know, produce production facility

476
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,480
and you don't want to deal with Apple side learning problems.

477
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,700
But again, there's no guarantee of what exactly that's going to be.

478
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,940
And I like how you put this Google AirPods.

479
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,900
Yeah, I just want to say Samsung has had them.

480
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,900
Bose has them.

481
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,900
Right.

482
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,900
Sony.

483
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,900
Sony has really good ones.

484
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:04,700
It's incredible that Google has just has no capability of recognizing that the market

485
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,540
already has this solved and that they have no shot.

486
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,180
And then they just go for it.

487
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,620
And then they get like, you know, 200000 sales.

488
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,620
That's it.

489
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,620
Yeah.

490
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,620
This is really wild.

491
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,340
Also, I don't know if you caught this, but the Pixel watch, it's going to be a round

492
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,340
play.

493
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,340
Yeah, that's.

494
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,220
Yeah, that's I mean, although the Android Wear watches, it's nice.

495
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,220
It's nice looking.

496
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
Yeah.

497
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,220
I don't know.

498
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,800
I've had both Android Wear circle, you know, circular watches and I've had Android Wear

499
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,460
square watches and the circular watches always are always cutting off parts of the UI.

500
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,180
It never has really worked very well.

501
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,580
So I'm pretty skeptical of the circular watch display.

502
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,260
Obviously, Google has the opportunity here to customize the UI.

503
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,580
The question is, will they or will it just be like a top layer and then you get down

504
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,380
into the Wear OS and it's UI elements are getting cut off.

505
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,540
Also, I don't know if you notice this, they promoted this like it's a benefit, but I think

506
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,860
it's actually going to be a pain in the butt.

507
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,380
They're integrating Fitbit with the watch, but you still have to maintain a separate

508
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,380
Fitbit account.

509
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,140
So you have your Google account, you have to get on the watch and you have to log into

510
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:08,500
your Fitbit account on the watch to use them, even though Google owns Fitbit.

511
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,140
Maybe it's a regulatory requirement.

512
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,540
I don't know, but it just sounds messy.

513
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:20,920
The tablet, the 7, the 7 Pro, and I believe the 6A, and I believe the AirPods, all just

514
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,700
got kind of, and the Pixel Watch, all just got like, you know, probably in the fall,

515
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,740
in the future, we're going to release these products.

516
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,000
Only one or two of these things they announced at Google IO are even going to ship probably

517
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,860
before the end of the year.

518
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,220
When have we seen this before?

519
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,300
And a number of these are going to get canceled.

520
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,320
And they're going to suck.

521
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,940
And then there was the other aspect of this IO, the entire IO that bugged me.

522
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:50,300
And I think all companies do this, but they're really trying to position themselves as like

523
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:56,140
this feel good, warm, we're doing this for the good of the people company, you know,

524
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,720
that all big corporations are trying to do now.

525
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,540
But it really felt over the top when at the very end of the keynote, it's not very classy,

526
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,220
but they basically do a one more thing moment, you know, they ape Steve Jobs there for a

527
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,220
second.

528
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,100
They do have one more thing.

529
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:18,500
And it was yet another, even further out in the future, absolutely no timeline product.

530
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,540
We have no idea where this is coming.

531
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,640
And they teased Google AR glasses.

532
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,640
And I grabbed like a minute of the presentation.

533
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,480
I just want to play it for you so you can get an idea of like the vibe they're trying

534
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,740
to go for and the feelings they're trying to get you to feel.

535
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,020
It all felt very manipulative.

536
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:52,140
My mother speaks Mandarin, and I speak English, which is a strange thing.

537
00:26:52,140 --> 00:27:00,100
We'd love to be able to share with you a new prototype we've been working on.

538
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,100
You should be seeing what I'm saying, just transcribed for you in real time, kind of

539
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,780
like subtitles for the world.

540
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:14,380
What we're working on is technology that enables us to break down language barriers, taking

541
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:18,860
years of research in Google Translate and bringing that to glasses.

542
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
You see me?

543
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,860
Oh, si, si, te veo.

544
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,300
Oh, my God.

545
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,700
I'm actually looking straight into your eyes, and it seems like you're looking right at

546
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,700
me.

547
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,740
Oh, si, si, estoy viendo lo que estas diciendo para yo.

548
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:36,100
Making access to information just instant and intuitive, by doing that, technology fades

549
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:46,020
into the background, and we're more connected with the people and the things around us.

550
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,020
Google wants you to know that they can out AR anybody.

551
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,940
They are so into AR.

552
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,140
Google VR, forget all about that.

553
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,540
Google is so into AR.

554
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:02,260
I mean, listen, when it comes to cheap, low-rent emotional manipulation, you've seen Apple.

555
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,540
Wait till you meet Google.

556
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,260
I would love to think that that demo was real.

557
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:14,340
Yeah, they faked past demos.

558
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:19,340
I wonder if we'll ever get these developer conferences to feel like developer conferences

559
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,780
again, or if they're just always going to be consumer device pitches, always now.

560
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,780
So it's worse than that, right?

561
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:33,020
It's always consumer device pitches, and since COVID, they're really like glossy, you know,

562
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,540
this is who we are, like identity opportunities for the marketing department.

563
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,980
Yeah, yeah, and they really put it, they really gave it all in this one.

564
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,220
They put it all in there.

565
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,100
They packed it, and the only justification you could even claim that this is for developers

566
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:51,100
is that in a remote, roundabout way, it's giving developers a heads up about devices

567
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,180
they could be able to build apps for possibly, but with no details, you know, just vague

568
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,180
recollection and idea.

569
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
Maybe right?

570
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
Like it's all maybe.

571
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
Yeah.

572
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,780
So I mean, geez, I guess we've just maybe normalized it with Apple.

573
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:12,980
But where it does seem a little bit different is Apple does seem to remember is for developers,

574
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,380
and they do, even during the main keynote, which is for the press, they do drop more

575
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,460
developer focused stuff in there about the API and about when that kit is going to be

576
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,460
available.

577
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,600
And that is at least useful.

578
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,280
But the other thing is, and you put it really well, is what Google's doing there feels like

579
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,980
low rent emotional manipulation.

580
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:37,940
And when Apple does it, it feels like they paid a Hollywood movie crew $10 million to

581
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,460
make that five minute video segment, you know, and it's just a, it's a whole different scale

582
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,900
of manipulation.

583
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,940
It's luxury emotional manipulation.

584
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,660
tailscale.com slash coder.

585
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,980
Go there for a free personal account for up to 20 devices and you go there to support

586
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,980
the show.

587
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:03,300
tailscale is a zero config VPN, it installs on any device in minutes, it'll manage your

588
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,180
firewall rules, and it'll even work with those dreaded double net situations.

589
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,140
It really works from anywhere.

590
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,960
I literally have not found a place where it does not work yet.

591
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,580
Devices connect directly to each other using wire guards noise protocol encryption.

592
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:24,060
So you build a flat mesh network based around the best security in the business.

593
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,260
Wire guard has changed the game, and tailscale brings it to the people.

594
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:34,060
You can easily and quickly create a secure network between your servers, computers, cloud

595
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,460
instances, virtual machines, and so on.

596
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,600
Even when you have firewalls and subnets and all that stuff between you tailscale makes

597
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
it work.

598
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,740
I've got it run everything from arch servers on x86 boxes to Raspberry Pi is running open

599
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,200
Suse and my iPad, I'm remote right now.

600
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,880
And I have the ability to connect to all of my systems in the studio so I can continue

601
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,160
all of my show production stuff, manage my mixer, even remote live stream all through

602
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
tailscale.

603
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,860
I'm doing it right now.

604
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,540
As I record this.

605
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,540
It's so powerful.

606
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,600
It's changed the way I work.

607
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,880
I'll never go back.

608
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,780
And by the way, in the most recent episode of Linux unplugged, we featured a great in

609
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,880
depth conversation with one of the co founders of tailscale.

610
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,800
And it gave me new insights into how tailscale is sustainable, and how it's built and set

611
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,800
up differently than almost any tech company in the last decade, really insightful conversation

612
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
with Avery.

613
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,880
So go check out the most recent Linux unplugged, because that was tops.

614
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,960
We also talked about the new Nvidia stuff in there.

615
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,300
I love tailscale.

616
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,000
My connections are always on.

617
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,800
I just now have bookmarks for all my different web dashboards and stuff that are on the tailscale

618
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
IP.

619
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,620
So no matter where I'm at, I just use the same bookmarks in my web browser.

620
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,480
It's so flawless.

621
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,500
And you can try it for free for up to 20 machines.

622
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,620
And they've built the service so that way that plan can last.

623
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,720
Go check it out and support the show and give it a go.

624
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,560
You go to tailscale.com slash coder.

625
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
You'll thank me.

626
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,000
Trust me, once you get this up and running, you will thank me try it out tailscale.com

627
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,200
slash coder.

628
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,800
It's official remote work has zero, absolutely zero negative impacts on your productivity.

629
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:22,400
According to a research team from Texas A&M University School of Public Health, it's concluded

630
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,480
in this study that employees and company resiliency is actually enhanced through remote work.

631
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,800
And they published a statement last Friday.

632
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,980
The study went beyond just assessing the productivity to examine the causes of workplace injuries

633
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:41,640
and they actually found that it was important for employees to take regular breaks.

634
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:49,680
And if they work from home, workplace injuries drop dramatically.

635
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,080
Because they're not workplace injuries.

636
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
I know.

637
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,880
But what do you think of this?

638
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Their study?

639
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,240
I mean, I got to imagine you just disagree up up and down, but their study says it zero

640
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,120
negative impact on productivity.

641
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,080
I feel like that statement has to be false.

642
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,200
One, anecdotal, right, my own experience and two, you know, it's such an absolute statement.

643
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,160
You know, zero, all right.

644
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,000
No, I don't agree.

645
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,720
I mean, I I've come to terms with the realities of remote work.

646
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,720
Now.

647
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
It's funny.

648
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
I was an early proponent.

649
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
I think as were you, right?

650
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,200
And then as everybody did it, I realized one of the things I liked about it was that it

651
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,600
was a nice perk to have in the hiring process.

652
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Now that it's not, it's like, Oh, what a panda, but yeah, it does have its drawbacks.

653
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,400
They say, though, that in the study, almost all of the employees were right back up to

654
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,920
the same level of output as they were during or before Hurricane Harvey.

655
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,640
That's when they were checking this.

656
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,320
And they say the huge message for employers right now is employees should be able to work

657
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,160
remotely or they should be able to work in a hybrid schedule because the productivity

658
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,920
gains are definitely there.

659
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,880
And I was thinking about this and wondering, well, if they if Texas A&M actually studied

660
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,760
this, what were they finding?

661
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:06,840
And I think they were finding that there is indeed some work that is better from home.

662
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,880
I've done a little bit of a study myself.

663
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,560
I have a little bit of empirical data and it's it's as simple as this.

664
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,300
I have taken this RV that I'm sitting in right now and I have parked it right next to buildings

665
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,200
that I have worked out of.

666
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,120
And I did this a lot at Linux Academy.

667
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,520
And there were definitely times where I would step outside my RV and I would walk five minutes

668
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,160
into the building, key card in, go into an office and I would have meetings and I would

669
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,360
do work there in the office.

670
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,360
And then there were other times in the day where I'd walk outside the building and I'd

671
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:44,820
walk into the RV and I do a totally different kind of work in the RV, like like phone calls

672
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,880
and emails and show prep.

673
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,160
I did better in the RV, but in office I did better when I was working on the new art and

674
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,640
logo designs with people there.

675
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,960
I had a better I had better interactions at the meeting tables with people and then we

676
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,800
would go to lunch together and that kind of stuff.

677
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,040
And so for me, I really found benefits in both.

678
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,560
But I realized that large companies, they have a hard time with these nuances.

679
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,320
And Apple is one of them.

680
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,320
And they've really laid down the law and said, you're coming back to work.

681
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,080
And as a result, their director of machine learning has resigned.

682
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,600
And he says it's due to the return to office policy.

683
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:23,480
I just want to say, even I think this is a huge fork up on Apple's part, massive, massive,

684
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,320
like somebody of that caliber.

685
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,000
It's not just a random dev that's going to be like slinging C sharp or Python or whatever

686
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,120
this it was a big win for them when they got this dude, right?

687
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,600
They were crowing about it.

688
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,800
Yeah, Ian Goodfellow.

689
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Yeah.

690
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,480
So he's supposedly the guy who created GAN, which is generative adversarial network, which

691
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,760
is a huge innovation in the field of deep learning and machine learning into the whole

692
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,000
adversarial network idea is sort of key.

693
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,300
He created it, Apple swooped him up.

694
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,920
It was a big deal.

695
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,680
I think he was born in the late 80s.

696
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,040
So you know, he's in his 30s.

697
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,280
And he's immensely hirable.

698
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,780
And he wrote in his resignation email, quote, I believe strongly that more flexibility would

699
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,720
have been the best policy for my team.

700
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:12,400
And he's out Microsoft and basically every other tech, I'm like, my homie.

701
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
Yeah.

702
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Come over here.

703
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,420
You'll you can work remote for us, right?

704
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,920
Have you considered calling a Cortana?

705
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
Sorry.

706
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Yeah.

707
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
There is a bit of an irony.

708
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,240
Fig jam on Twitter pointed this out to us.

709
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,600
He says these tech companies have created all of this hardware and software to connect

710
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,600
people and enable them to collaborate and create from all over the world, but yet they

711
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,640
can't use these tools themselves.

712
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,800
What happened to eating your own dog food?

713
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,840
And I think fig jam has a point.

714
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:44,080
If anybody should be able to make remote work work, shouldn't it be Apple?

715
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,580
Shouldn't it be these companies like Facebook and Microsoft that are telling all these employees

716
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
to come back?

717
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,640
I mean, Microsoft created teams, or at least, you know, adopted, and then we keep hitting

718
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,700
this pretty hard almost every couple weeks.

719
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,320
The reality is for small businesses, I think remote work is going to be a fact of life,

720
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,040
especially in the tech field, because it's too hard to be competitive without it now.

721
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,600
I can see why, especially a company like Apple would be pretty aggressively trying to bring

722
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
people back.

723
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,540
See, I'm wondering if the reason I used to think it worked better was because it wasn't

724
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,600
forced on me, right?

725
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,840
And it was like a perk I could give, people were enthusiastic about it, they'd really

726
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,280
go all in.

727
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,400
Now that it's like something that basically is expected.

728
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,840
The power dynamic has changed.

729
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:31,640
It goes from something that you can grant for periods of time, but still have control

730
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,000
over, to now something that they're expecting of you, and you're trying to claw back a little

731
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
bit of that control.

732
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,960
I wouldn't even know if it's really a power dynamic, it's more, you know, I found that

733
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,520
people were so excited to work from home, that they would really like put in the extra

734
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,000
mile and be super communicative.

735
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,920
And I'm just, you know, I'm interviewing people.

736
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,000
And it's like, of course, it's work from home, like everybody just expects it now.

737
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,080
It's not as much of a deal sealer, I guess.

738
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Hmm.

739
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Well, all right.

740
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,640
I think the reason why I wanted to bring it up is because of Goodwin quitting Apple over

741
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,640
it.

742
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,940
And you know how these companies are so about their machine learning, and all of their products

743
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,600
being improved with it, and now, Goodfellas out.

744
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,200
It seems like if Apple wasn't willing to bend for them, they're probably not going to bend

745
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,420
for anybody on this.

746
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,560
And I thought Fig-Chan made a good point.

747
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,560
All right.

748
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,360
So let's, you mentioned a book this week in our Slack chat called Python Distilled.

749
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
Yeah.

750
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,080
For the gentlemen and gentle ladies out there looking to do a little Python.

751
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,200
For any snake charmers or prospective snake charmers.

752
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
It's pretty good.

753
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,920
You know, it has that kind of few intro chapters that are, you know, you're probably gonna

754
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,320
skip if you've done any real development.

755
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,640
But if not, that's cool, too.

756
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,000
But I like the perspective, the guy's name is Beasley.

757
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,560
I hope I'm not butchering it, David Beasley.

758
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,000
He takes a very practical, very, this is a feature of Python you could use.

759
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,720
It's starting with, I think, 3.8, if I'm not mistaken.

760
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,440
So like modern Python.

761
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,200
And these are real world problems where this makes sense.

762
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
Great pick.

763
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,200
We'll put a link to that at coder.show slash, what is this, 466?

764
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Yeah.

765
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
666.

766
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
Or 466.

767
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Ah.

768
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
I know.

769
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,200
You know, but it does mean we've rounded the corner to 500.

770
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,200
You realize.

771
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
That's a lot.

772
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
I know.

773
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
What do you even do for 500?

774
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
What do you even do?

775
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,080
Invert the show into a next theme show.

776
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
And a video show, right?

777
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,740
All YouTube, all the time.

778
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,240
We can switch from Boost to Super Chats.

779
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,240
That'd be great.

780
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,240
Now we go on Twitch.

781
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,480
Yeah, ask everybody to become members or whatever it is over there.

782
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,800
Wait, can't we just like dance and go on TikTok?

783
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Yeah.

784
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,240
Or, you know, I think if you just stand in a pool, you can wear a bathing suit and it's

785
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,840
legit.

786
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,320
I don't think that works for us.

787
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,720
Oh, maybe not.

788
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,840
And what if your hair gets wet?

789
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,600
Yeah, it doesn't look as good.

790
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,760
It bounces back quick.

791
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,120
But while it's wet, it doesn't look so good.

792
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
Well, naturally, of course.

793
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:51,780
I mean, you know what I've discovered traveling again, is it really is the greatest gift when

794
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,800
it comes to my email, because I get so much damn email.

795
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,520
And so I can just tell people, oh, sorry, I'm traveling.

796
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,960
I'm a little slow on my email right now, even though I'm always slow on my email, right?

797
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm always slow on my email, but now I have a reason for it.

798
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,480
And it feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, you know, on the lamb from

799
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,480
your email.

800
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
I mean, what the fuck?

801
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,020
I think you well, I think you forget what it's like to travel.

802
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,200
Like this is a nice aspect of traveling is like, oh, yeah, no, I'm sorry, I'm totally

803
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,200
behind on that.

804
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
And it's true.

805
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,200
I am.

806
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
I'm not lying.

807
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,220
But I at least feel like clearly the rest of the world is is better at two life skills

808
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,220
than I am.

809
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:34,780
And one of them is committing to anything beyond three days, because my friends and

810
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,360
family asked me to commit to stuff two, three weeks ahead of time.

811
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
I know I hate that.

812
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,620
Oh, it is honestly a struggle.

813
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:44,560
I really don't understand how the rest of humanity has any idea what they're doing in

814
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
two weeks.

815
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,160
It just it doesn't make any sense.

816
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,560
And I constantly am in that trap and I struggle and I say yes, and then I regret it.

817
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,560
And it's the worst.

818
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,060
And the other thing, the number two thing that I think humanity on a whole does better

819
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,920
than me is getting back to their email.

820
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,720
I turns out in the only person in the world who doesn't like just getting jobs dropped

821
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,080
in my inbox with totally just arbitrary expectations of how fast I'm going to read, how fast I'm

822
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,460
going to respond and how fast I'm going to take action on their question that they asked

823
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,080
me to do in the email.

824
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,520
And see, in my world, I see and this is where I'm so wrong because it's only me that thinks

825
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
this way.

826
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,700
In my world, I think I'm going to get to that on my terms when I have time to read my email.

827
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,720
And if they're asking me to do something, I'm going to do that when I have time to do

828
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,440
it, which might not be for a couple of days.

829
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,720
But you see, the rest of the world, that's not how they think.

830
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,340
They think I have sent this thing to Chris.

831
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,040
It requires action on his part.

832
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,880
I imagine he'll get it back to me in the next couple of hours.

833
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,480
And then if a day or so goes by and I haven't gotten back to them, I then and this happens

834
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
all the time.

835
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,220
I get another email asking, hey, hey, I'm just following up, didn't hear back from you.

836
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:59,740
And so by the time I often get to my email, I can have two or three like, hey, I really

837
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,760
need this done or hey, I was wondering.

838
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,360
And it's like, you know, been maybe three or four days since I saw their last email.

839
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,880
And I'm the only person that's a problem with because clearly, everybody else does fine

840
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,880
with that.

841
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,360
Otherwise, people would stop it.

842
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:17,820
And those two things, I feel like when I'm traveling, I'm off the hook on like I it's

843
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,560
okay that I can't tell you where I'm going to be or if I can do something in a week because

844
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,800
you know what I'm traveling.

845
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,020
And so I'll just have to get back to you when I get back.

846
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,020
And you know what?

847
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,160
Sorry, I didn't take action on that and get that back to you within, you know, three hours

848
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,880
I'm traveling and yesterday was a 10 hour drive day.

849
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,000
And so I just didn't check my email.

850
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,760
And like I have actual reasons and I feel like I'm not a failure.

851
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,560
Email is a source of constant stress and anxiety for me.

852
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,320
And I go through periods where it's better.

853
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,580
And I go through periods where it's worse.

854
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:49,620
And right now I'm going through one of the worst periods where it's just it's too much.

855
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,560
And if I could do it over again, I would ask for I would ask for a system where I can just

856
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,440
not accept emails for a while.

857
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,000
Like sorry, for the next three days, Chris is not accepting new emails.

858
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,780
Please try again when he arrives back.

859
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,360
Why haven't we built that?

860
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,160
And out of office is not enough.

861
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,520
I don't know.

862
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,360
I was crying.

863
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,320
I think we just can't have it right.

864
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,320
We can't have nice things.

865
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320
Can we?

866
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
No.

867
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,320
That's why.

868
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
That's why I like boost.

869
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:21,720
All right, Freak boosted in right as we were starting the show, actually, with 10000 sats.

870
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,080
He says Star Trek Picard season two has its cringe.

871
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:30,120
But at the end, with Q is very much Anne Rind meets Breaking Bad.

872
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
But in a good way.

873
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,600
I don't know what that means.

874
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,200
But I was I was satisfied with the ending.

875
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,640
I don't think we got to spoil it.

876
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,100
Did you watch the end of Picard?

877
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,100
I did not.

878
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,100
So I lack the competence to answer this.

879
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:45,200
They tied up a lot of the loose ends better than they do in most new Trek shows.

880
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,800
So have you started the strange new worlds?

881
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,920
No, I think it's the best.

882
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,320
I'm watching the original series.

883
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,320
I'm on season.

884
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
I went back.

885
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,320
Oh, yeah.

886
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,320
Yeah, yeah.

887
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,320
That's what we did, too.

888
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,640
I think strange new worlds may have its issues, but I think it's the best of the new batch

889
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,880
so far.

890
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,880
It's worth it.

891
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,960
Yeah, I think it's probably worth it.

892
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,960
Boost.

893
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,440
Dave Jones boosted in with 1000 sats.

894
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,960
He says, Oh, I know of Microsoft Access.

895
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,160
We actually have a secretary who insists on keeping her own version of our entire customer

896
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,980
database in an access database.

897
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:25,120
So she just types it all in there and keeps it updated by hand.

898
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,840
Samuel Blair also boosted in with 500 sats.

899
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,340
I know about Microsoft Access.

900
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,400
I wasn't born yesterday.

901
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,200
And then the Golden Dragon came in with a row of ducks.

902
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,200
That's 2222 sats.

903
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,040
He said, Did I hear access?

904
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,640
I tried learning that eons ago.

905
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,040
My mother in law is an access ninja, where she works.

906
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,120
It's a huge part of what they do.

907
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,120
Even today.

908
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,620
Thanks for the shows.

909
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,960
That's the general theme is we were right.

910
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,400
Access is still in use.

911
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,040
I feel like there was a hard age line on the feedback we got on access, though.

912
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,040
I was gonna say that, too.

913
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,040
Yeah.

914
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,800
And did you notice the boosters seem to know what access is, but the emailers didn't, which

915
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,800
who knows what that's about.

916
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,800
But I just thought that was interesting.

917
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,800
Yeah.

918
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,800
I mean, boost is so new.

919
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,480
I don't know if that's Yeah, it's hard to say.

920
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,480
It's hard to say.

921
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,480
We got another one by Dave.

922
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,680
He says, You guys are dead on does look like the overall macro market is about to hurt

923
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,080
a lot of folks.

924
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,920
That's why I need a Bitcoin dad robe to properly ride this ship down.

925
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,960
You know, I mentioned the Bitcoin dad pod, but you know what, that like the Friday or

926
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,200
something before the recent downturn in the market, we totally called the Luna crash and

927
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,520
why it was going to go down, why why Tara would deep egg and why the rest of the market

928
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,520
would tumble.

929
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,520
Just saying.

930
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,520
Just saying.

931
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,520
Totally nailed it.

932
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,520
Is that a new J.B. show?

933
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,200
No, it is a show a friend of mine is doing.

934
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,200
And I am happily just taking on the co-host role for once.

935
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,200
Cool.

936
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,200
Yeah.

937
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,760
So I just get to sit back and, you know, pontificate.

938
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:03,520
It's actually it's really I can tell you, I like to pontificate even by myself.

939
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,480
And slurks a lot writes in, as always, with elite boost 1337 sats.

940
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,480
Nice.

941
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm a Linux Foss enthusiast and an I.T. veteran, but I don't consider myself a coder.

942
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,560
I do listen to all the J.B. shows and I'm a supporter on Patron, but I love being able

943
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,660
to boost.

944
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,660
So here you go.

945
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,560
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

946
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,120
Now the user boosted in asking us if we have any thoughts on I think it's.

947
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,400
Sorry, sorry.

948
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,400
Somebody else emailed me and I'm pretty suspicious that you're the same dude.

949
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,400
Not yet.

950
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,920
I haven't gotten to get my hands around it.

951
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,020
It's basically a alternative to electron, but very similar high level idea.

952
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,680
And you're missing one important part.

953
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,200
Oh, I didn't miss it.

954
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,200
I ignored it.

955
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,680
But go ahead.

956
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,680
It's got rust.

957
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,680
Yeah.

958
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,720
So the idea is you kind of use whatever you want on the front end, but the core is built

959
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,720
with rust.

960
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,720
Oh, that's not what I thought you were going to say.

961
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,720
Oh, node?

962
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,720
Nope.

963
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,720
You missed it.

964
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,720
What?

965
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,720
He has a special request.

966
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,720
A shout out to Egon.

967
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:09,920
Egon gets the shout out.

968
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,440
That's so great.

969
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,520
We also got some thank you bows from Cospeland from Freak.

970
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,440
He was just streaming Dim Sats as he listened.

971
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,940
And we got a bonus thank you boost from Dave Jones.

972
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,480
And Dave, I'm glad you're back listening again.

973
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,800
I hope that means everybody is doing well at home now and you're getting caught up on

974
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,800
your podcast.

975
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,760
Shout out to Dave because he was our triple booster this week.

976
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,800
And we we appreciate that, Dave.

977
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,520
Glad you're glad to have you back.

978
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,080
Can I say something?

979
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,080
Yeah.

980
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,700
So coding challenges are coming back in a weird form.

981
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,700
I love it.

982
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,760
I bought a book, bought my own money.

983
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,000
There's no like weird corrupt crap going on here called the Python workout.

984
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I'll find a link.

985
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,360
It's from Manning Press.

986
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:56,800
And it's 50 Python assignments starting from easy to pay me.

987
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,120
So if you want to follow along, I'm going to put up a GitHub thingamajig.

988
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,560
And I'm hoping to have the first one for next week.

989
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,560
You say Python workout?

990
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,560
I think I got a link to that.

991
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,560
I'll put it in the show notes.

992
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,560
OK.

993
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,560
Yeah.

994
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,920
It's got like a dude with like no shirt on, on the cover.

995
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,920
Right.

996
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,920
That's not you?

997
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,920
I wish.

998
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,920
It's got weird.

999
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,920
All right.

1000
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,920
Yeah.

1001
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,920
Link is now officially in the show notes.

1002
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,800
And I'll also drop it in the chat room if you're watching live because, you know, we do

1003
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,640
this here show on the Mondays at noon Pacific, 3 p.m.

1004
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,640
Eastern.

1005
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,640
And you can hang out in our chat room.

1006
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,840
Yeah, that handsomely tattooed man is me.

1007
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,840
Yes.

1008
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,840
Nicely done, sir.

1009
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,840
Oh, my goodness.

1010
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,280
I like how he has tattoos that enhance his muscles.

1011
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,840
I like the craftily placed robes, shall we say.

1012
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,840
Yeah.

1013
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,520
Boy, if that thing was off by even an inch, it'd be a totally different book.

1014
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,520
Let's just say.

1015
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,960
It would probably sell better, too, let's be honest.

1016
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,320
All right.

1017
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,360
Thank you to our members at CoderQA.co.

1018
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,060
You're going to get a Coderly soon.

1019
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,060
You join that.

1020
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:56,520
You get access to the show with no ads and you get the Coderly report.

1021
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,640
And it's a way to say, you know, thank you.

1022
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,780
And it's a way for us to say thank you, too, by giving you a few perks.

1023
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:05,200
It's a nice little setup and you can support the entire network and get access to all of

1024
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,260
the shows and all of their perks by going to Jupiter.party.

1025
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,800
So for this year's show, CoderQA.co and for the whole network, Jupiter.party.

1026
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,080
And of course, if you want to do a one off, you can just send us a boost with a message,

1027
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,800
which we always appreciate.

1028
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,960
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send the people before we wrap it up for more

1029
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,960
organ?

1030
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,000
If you go to tmb.inc, that's.inc slash careers, we are hiring.

1031
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,120
Very good.

1032
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,120
Very good.

1033
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,320
We should put a link to that in the show notes, too, just to make it easy for the peoples.

1034
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,960
Let's see if you want to get a hold of me.

1035
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,960
You can do it on Matrix.

1036
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,320
We do have a Coder Radio feedback channel over there and a general chat.

1037
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,160
Shout out to the Matrix folks listening live right now.

1038
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,480
And of course, I'm on Twitter at Chris Ellis and the whole podcast is at Coder Radio Show.

1039
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,000
And the network to get network announcements is at Jupiter Signal.

1040
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,560
And you know, I will give you a little hot tip before we wrap up.

1041
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,360
Even if you don't want to use the Twitter, but you still want to see what people are

1042
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,640
posting about and kind of use it as a news feed.

1043
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,540
Check out knitter and n-i-t-t-e-r dot net.

1044
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:13,720
It's a way you can just plug in a username like, you know, at Coder Radio Show and you

1045
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:19,200
can get a nice clean feed of everything that account is going on about without having to

1046
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,120
go to the dumpster fire that is actually Twitter.

1047
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,200
Well, that's a stalker's paradise right there.

1048
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,680
It is, but it's also just a nice way to, I see you go into it right now.

1049
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,680
Yeah, I'm like, whoo-hoo!

1050
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,600
That's so funny.

1051
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,440
Knitter is just a nice way to consume content that people post there because you just can't

1052
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,440
get away from it.

1053
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,320
You know, people put stuff on Twitter and...

1054
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,760
I don't know why Tay-Tay Taylor Swift blocked me.

1055
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,760
That's all I'm saying.

1056
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,760
No, who could guess?

1057
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,440
Nobody could probably even take a guess as to why.

1058
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,680
So I'll put a link to knitter in the show notes too.

1059
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,840
Again, those are at coder.show slash 466.

1060
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,800
They're always just the episode number and you know, you can grab a link to that.

1061
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,280
That way you don't have to do the Twitter thing if you don't want to.

1062
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,280
Huzzah.

1063
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,280
Exactly.

1064
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,280
Huzzah.

1065
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,280
Last but not least, I will mention we are live again.

1066
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,360
Come join us over at jblive.tv on a Monday.

1067
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:07,120
It gets converted to your time zone at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1068
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,840
Feedback, your opinions, your thoughts, your ideas, huge part of the show.

1069
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:14,840
Go to coder.show slash contact to send that information in to give us your thoughts, your

1070
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,840
ideas, your topics.

1071
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:21,120
And of course, you can always send us a boost with the new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

1072
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,440
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the Coder Radio program and we'll see you

1073
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:45,480
right back here next week.
