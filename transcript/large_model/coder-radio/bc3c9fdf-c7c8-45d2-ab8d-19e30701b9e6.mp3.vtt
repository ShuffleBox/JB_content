This is KOTORadio episode 328 for October 5th 2018.

00:30.560 --> 00:35.440
Hi everyone and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:35.440 --> 00:41.120
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies

00:41.120 --> 00:46.080
and you might say subjects. My name is Chris here in the beautiful Pacific Northwest and joining us

00:46.640 --> 00:52.240
every single week is our host, the man who is established in a secret headquarters spying on

00:52.240 --> 00:59.280
the large corporations of Florida. It's Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike. Hello and I'm editing

00:59.280 --> 01:04.400
my Bash RC live baby. Oh yeah? Oh yeah, this is the time to do it right now during the intro.

01:04.400 --> 01:08.480
It's the right time. It's just the right time. It's the only time. I love it. I love it. There's

01:08.480 --> 01:12.960
been there's been many projects completed during the show. You never know. Sometimes you just get

01:12.960 --> 01:18.160
an inspiration. You might be in the middle of podcasting. Let's see, hair.cs, okay.

01:19.200 --> 01:25.120
We're together on a Friday edition of the show. A rare treat because we often do the show earlier

01:25.120 --> 01:29.200
in the week but it didn't work out. You and I were so passionate. We said we got to do this. We got

01:29.200 --> 01:34.000
to get together. You were traveling like a maniac. How did all of that go? How did all your travel go?

01:34.000 --> 01:39.520
Did it all turn out okay? Always good. In two weeks, I'm going to Texas. Oh really? Whereabouts

01:39.520 --> 01:47.360
in Texas? San Antonio. In a couple of weeks, let's see, I'm going to meet BSD which I think is the

01:48.480 --> 01:53.200
19th and the 20th or the 20th. I think maybe it's the 20th and 21st. Anyways, it's coming up in just

01:53.200 --> 01:57.440
a couple of weekends. It'll be a weekend thing so it might impact that Monday but we'll figure that

01:57.440 --> 02:01.520
out. Yeah, Texas is a good time to go right now because it is getting gray and cold. Although

02:01.520 --> 02:05.840
you're in Florida so what the hell do you know? Anyways, we got a great show. Mike's been testing

02:05.840 --> 02:10.640
the testing and we're going to talk about those testing results. Also a little bit about automated

02:10.640 --> 02:15.440
build systems and if we get to we have some extended hoopla but why don't we start out with

02:15.440 --> 02:20.480
some feedback and follow up like we do to warm up here on the show. And this one I thought was a

02:20.480 --> 02:25.440
good one just to address. It's because it's been a while and this is from a listener in Russia. He

02:25.440 --> 02:29.280
says, hello Chris and Mike. I'm a longtime listener of the show. Appreciate what you do

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
and I like getting the weekly insights of not just the general topics but the things around

02:34.000 --> 02:40.800
software development and its related technology. Now, JB did help me after five years of wanting

02:40.800 --> 02:46.480
to switch to finally become a happy C++ developer and double my income. So I have a short question

02:46.480 --> 02:50.640
that I'm hoping you'll answer. I've listened to the show for a long time but I don't think I've

02:50.640 --> 02:56.880
ever heard the definition of what a dark matter developer is. Now, I never hear it but I hear you

02:56.880 --> 03:02.960
mention it a lot so I was hoping you would explain what it is. What do these mysterious devs actually

03:02.960 --> 03:07.840
do? He has an idea but he wanted to hear what is our definition when you toss around the dark

03:07.840 --> 03:12.880
matter devs. He says, I got a feeling that those are people working in corporations on narrow

03:12.880 --> 03:16.960
projects, never expected to leave their office and the projects are generally intended for internal

03:16.960 --> 03:23.040
use only. Well, you got that in one. Yeah, that's good right there. That's what we believe here.

03:23.040 --> 03:28.080
Our premise on the show is that is the vast majority of the software development industry

03:28.080 --> 03:32.640
is developers that are employed or contracted to work for a company that are building software for

03:32.640 --> 03:37.840
that company to use internally either as tools to process something or for staff to interact with.

03:37.840 --> 03:45.840
And those developers generally don't get to change and jump languages or toolkits or any fad.

03:45.840 --> 03:51.120
They don't get the fad hop, I guess is what I'm trying to say. They tool away at a job for a long

03:51.120 --> 03:56.800
time and it's a respectable trade if you think about it because there is a certain refining to

03:56.800 --> 04:03.200
that process. But they don't really get all of the fame and the glam and the glitz or whatever.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.480
You know what I'm trying to say? They don't get all the attention in the tech press.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.960
Yeah, they're often not working on, let's say, the newest technologies. They're usually

04:12.160 --> 04:16.880
maintaining some, God forbid, access application for 15 years.

04:16.880 --> 04:21.760
Yeah, struggling with some technical debt and they're generally not the people that the keynotes

04:23.600 --> 04:29.440
are directed at when Google or Microsoft goes up on stage. But what's funny is they're typically

04:29.440 --> 04:33.920
the customer base that's actually keeping those companies financed and buying their products and

04:33.920 --> 04:40.000
licensing their software and using their services. But they're targeting future customers. Yeah, so

04:40.000 --> 04:43.360
that's essentially what the Dark Matter Dev is. And it probably is a good idea that we define it

04:43.360 --> 04:47.920
every now and then. Once every couple of three years or something. Every three years, whether

04:47.920 --> 04:52.720
we need it or not. So I had two items of follow up with you because you know how I like to stalk you.

04:52.720 --> 04:58.320
And I noticed, number one, that it appears perhaps you got the Galago going. So congratulations. Good

04:58.320 --> 05:03.760
job. Thank you. Is the screen working? It's working? There's a minor pink blotch

05:03.760 --> 05:07.360
on the screen, but it's very small and it only appears when the background is dark.

05:08.480 --> 05:11.760
And it just so happens to be on the right side of the screen, which means, you know,

05:11.760 --> 05:18.240
the way editors format code. I don't really care. OK, so it's usable. That's good. And it's decent

05:18.240 --> 05:23.840
hardware still. So all right. So the other follow up is so I think I get it. I get the sense that

05:24.480 --> 05:28.320
Buccaneer or I guess no, I'm sorry. It's the Mad Botter Inc. Now I got to keep these things straight.

05:28.320 --> 05:32.800
I'm also got to remember that I'm part of Linux Academy. Like there's a lot. There's a lot going

05:32.800 --> 05:38.800
on, man. So the Mad Botter seems to be putting some feelers out there for some new hires.

05:38.800 --> 05:45.200
I saw you tweet about that. And I noticed, too, that you were mentioning how some of the people

05:45.200 --> 05:51.360
that were responding or interpreting Linux command line experience as the subset. And I think I'm

05:51.360 --> 05:57.280
getting this right as experience with the subsystem on Windows. What's with it? Is this is this a

05:57.280 --> 06:03.440
younger type of applicant? Like what's happening? So I just filled my more senior developer

06:03.440 --> 06:08.560
position. So the remaining position that I'm interviewing for is the calling a customer

06:08.560 --> 06:15.760
champion. It's a key way kind of customer service type role. So these are more junior people looking

06:15.760 --> 06:19.840
to kind of break into the industry. So QA when they're probably not dealing with a customer

06:19.840 --> 06:26.480
support issue. It kind of. Exactly. Exactly. Mostly I'm interviewing young folks out of USF,

06:26.480 --> 06:31.760
which is a local. You sound like such an old man when you say young folks. I know. You know what,

06:31.760 --> 06:41.760
old man? You're just as bad. Old guy radio. Yeah. And. Like, because I enjoy torturing junior people,

06:42.320 --> 06:50.160
I make them run Linux. It's a good test of their hardiness. This is a test of your spirit,

06:50.160 --> 06:56.960
son. No, it's more because I want them to know how to write scripts and not use wizards for

06:56.960 --> 07:01.360
everything. And more importantly, I know how to give them a bash script that does something so

07:02.000 --> 07:08.160
helpful. And I've been asking on these interviews, so tell me about like, you know,

07:08.160 --> 07:13.040
scripting on a Linux environment. Do you know Python is another very popular thing I'm hearing

07:13.040 --> 07:18.720
about. So one thing is a lot of these folks aren't really doing bash scripting per se.

07:18.720 --> 07:25.040
They're writing their little utility stuff in Python. But the and this isn't all,

07:25.920 --> 07:31.200
but this is a surprising plurality of these young people. When they say when I say Linux,

07:31.200 --> 07:34.480
I asked what distro and they say, well, what do you mean? I just use the subsystem.

07:36.640 --> 07:43.760
And my jaw dropped the first seven times I heard. Oh, I think the reason this is happening

07:43.760 --> 07:50.160
is because we have a very large Microsoft campus like right here. And they are like basically like

07:50.160 --> 07:54.240
major sponsors of most of the tech events and the student stuffs and the hackathons and all that

07:54.240 --> 08:01.040
good stuff. And I know they're very, very active on campus. So my assumption is that it's just

08:01.040 --> 08:06.400
proximity and Microsoft gives free Azure candy to kids like it's giving candy to kids. I have

08:06.400 --> 08:10.640
two thoughts on that. So it's funny because Joe just asked this question in the user air. I think

08:10.640 --> 08:14.880
it's forty nine that I was just on air dot show slash forty nine where I also went into detail

08:14.880 --> 08:19.200
about my whole medical thing, the whole triptych Texas and getting surgery.

08:21.120 --> 08:26.160
But he said, is Windows 10 going to be the biggest competition for desktop Linux now?

08:26.160 --> 08:30.640
And the premise is and I think it's a good one. Of course, we all argued with him. But the premise is

08:30.640 --> 08:36.880
that it's good enough to do some of this stuff and where students in the past would have been

08:36.880 --> 08:42.880
spinning up a VM to do part of the class inside of VM. They're doing it now in the subsystem.

08:42.880 --> 08:50.240
The subsystem is replacing VMs and that keeps you closer to Windows. You're not having to go

08:50.240 --> 08:54.560
through the Ubuntu installer and you're not seeing the Ubuntu desktop with the with their

08:54.560 --> 09:00.400
Nome theme and all. There's no browser. It's like inside the desktop environment. It's all just

09:00.400 --> 09:07.600
the command line sitting right on top of Windows 10. And he made that he made the his position

09:07.600 --> 09:12.960
essentially was is that over time that negates the need when you look at Chromebooks and you

09:12.960 --> 09:17.360
look at Windows 10, that negates the need for desktop Linux. And we all, of course, argued with

09:17.360 --> 09:21.600
it. But now here you are telling me the very thing that he was concerned about. Damn it.

09:21.600 --> 09:26.800
And it doesn't surprise me, to be honest, because it's it's a pain in the ass to really think about

09:26.800 --> 09:34.000
it, install some virtual software. So is it? Do you go with VirtualBox? Do you do you try to use

09:34.000 --> 09:39.280
like Windows 10 Pro and have Hyper-V? Is it a requirement of the class that you license something

09:39.280 --> 09:43.280
or are you trying to do something economical for the students? And the subsystem just solves all

09:43.280 --> 09:50.880
that. It's sort of sad, but it's sort of. It's sort of, I think, long term, it just sort of all

09:50.880 --> 09:56.000
works itself out in the wash because at the same time, they're learning some skills on bash.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.600
They're maybe learning the differences between the DIR command and the LS command.

10:01.600 --> 10:06.400
So it's still a valuable experience that could be translated to physical Linux,

10:06.400 --> 10:10.880
full Linux installation down the road. So I wouldn't totally discount it, but it does,

10:10.880 --> 10:14.400
to me, seem to signal that maybe Joe was right about being concerned about a new trend.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.640
I always hate it when Joe's right.

10:17.600 --> 10:22.800
What's weird is another thing I, you know, let's say four years ago was seeing people

10:22.800 --> 10:26.960
come in for interviews and almost everybody, I would say, what's your preferred environment,

10:26.960 --> 10:30.080
you know, Linux, Windows or Mac? And like 90 percent would just say Mac.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.040
Mac, yeah.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.800
I'm seeing almost like no MacBooks.

10:33.680 --> 10:38.080
That's got to be part and parcel to your location because I still see quite a bit

10:38.080 --> 10:44.240
of MacBooks out there. But, you know, at Linux Academy, they have a choose your own OS policy.

10:44.240 --> 10:51.280
And initially people were choosing MacBooks and it's transitioned to Linux machines. And now it's

10:51.280 --> 10:54.800
like, well, what do we get? Dells? Do we get ThinkPads? Like now there's confusion around

10:54.800 --> 11:01.600
all of that. And I think it is there are like ebbs and flows. The Red Hat CEO this morning tweeted

11:01.600 --> 11:08.320
that tech is a style of fashion, not like in the Apple Watch iPhone style, but like in how things

11:08.320 --> 11:13.920
do come into fad and then they last for a while and then we swing to another fad. And he was

11:13.920 --> 11:17.600
making the case that, you know, the last swing was cloud. Everything's going to the cloud.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.760
We're all cloud. And now it's all now the conversation has swung to hybrid between

11:21.760 --> 11:27.600
physical and cloud is clearly the future. And now we're now that's the new fad for

11:27.600 --> 11:33.600
server deployments. And the same thing is, I think, true with workstation operating systems.

11:33.600 --> 11:38.640
And these different OS's get more competitive. You have Ubuntu coming back into Gnome,

11:38.640 --> 11:43.920
sending all of their fixes upstream and building two really solid LTS is in a row. Actually,

11:43.920 --> 11:51.600
all of them from 1204 to 1404 to 1604 and now 1804, they had their issues here and there.

11:51.600 --> 11:57.360
But in totality, especially by their point one releases, they were really solid,

11:57.360 --> 12:02.880
rock solid LTS is. And so that's a lot of momentum. And I think it's caused some swing

12:02.880 --> 12:06.480
back the other direction when you also combine it with the availability of better hardware.

12:07.440 --> 12:12.960
But that I think also shifts by region. Depending on where you go, you have a much

12:12.960 --> 12:17.680
higher MacBook population. Like so for I'm almost done by the time you go to when you

12:17.680 --> 12:23.680
go to Southeast Linux Fest down there in Charlotte, North Carolina, they're all ThinkPads.

12:23.680 --> 12:27.200
Everybody that goes there for the most part, except for the presenters,

12:27.200 --> 12:30.080
are on ThinkPads. That's just sort of the culture in that area.

12:33.600 --> 12:38.080
That's a little weird. I thought the ThinkPad thing was like an old school sort of Linux

12:38.080 --> 12:43.200
spirit thing. You know, I just got to ThinkPad, right? I mean, I know you did. That's why I did

12:43.200 --> 12:51.200
that. I think it's, you know, there is something to not having a metal machine. So the MacBook that

12:51.200 --> 12:57.840
I had was metal and the XPS 13. So my work machine was this MacBook, the first TouchBar edition I got

12:57.840 --> 13:02.800
when my other MacBook died for Final Cut. And, you know, as I stopped editing video, I sort of

13:02.800 --> 13:08.080
used that MacBook less and less. And I increased my usage of the XPS 13. I started traveling with

13:08.080 --> 13:13.360
the XPS 13. And it was a great little machine, but I was delicate with it. Not only did I had

13:13.360 --> 13:17.840
I busted it by dropping it and the plastic had broken and it was sort of delicate in that way,

13:17.840 --> 13:22.960
but I also felt because it was metal and dentable and scratchable, I needed to be more careful with

13:22.960 --> 13:28.080
it. And so I would be very, very sort of delicate with it. But with the ThinkPad, I really don't

13:28.080 --> 13:32.880
have those concerns. It feels really much more like a workman's tool or a work lady's tool. Like

13:32.880 --> 13:38.320
it's something I throw in the bag. I've already put stickers all over it. Like, you know, I didn't

13:38.320 --> 13:44.800
know if I could never could really violate the aluminum of the XPS 13. But with the ThinkPad,

13:44.800 --> 13:50.320
it just looks like every other plastic ThinkPad. So I don't care. And I just, you know, decorated

13:50.320 --> 13:55.920
the way I like and now it feels personalized. There's something to your work tools being

13:55.920 --> 14:01.920
durable and not being these pieces of jewelry. I'm telling you, there's something to it. You

14:01.920 --> 14:07.440
know, remember when Apple used to make rubber MacBooks? I wish they still did. Yeah. All right.

14:07.440 --> 14:10.720
Well, moving on. That's not what we're here to. Well, actually, in a way, it's a good time to

14:10.720 --> 14:14.960
transition into talking about this particular problem. So nominally, we're going to be talking

14:14.960 --> 14:21.840
about building and QA and all of the integration processes there. And you did a little more digging,

14:21.840 --> 14:26.880
I believe, into automated builds for iOS without a Mac. And it looks like you've collected some

14:26.880 --> 14:33.680
resources. I know we've talked a little bit about Mac and cloud in the past, but I'm curious to see

14:33.680 --> 14:37.360
your thoughts on App Center and other services that are out there. Where are we at on this,

14:37.360 --> 14:43.440
Mr. Dominic? Yeah. So I ended up, you know, I got that MacBook for my trip, but I'm going to be

14:43.440 --> 14:51.040
returning it because I just don't want it. So and I would like my money back. So I'm going to

14:51.040 --> 14:57.280
go back. So I ended up getting a tweet before the last show we did from a listener named Emily,

14:57.280 --> 15:02.320
who suggested I check out Mac and cloud, which I did briefly look at, but I felt it was a little

15:02.320 --> 15:07.680
too much of a hassle. I also subsequently got a tweet, I believe, from someone actually an

15:07.680 --> 15:12.800
evangelist at Microsoft saying, hey, Dodo, you can totally do this in App Center. The catch is your

15:12.800 --> 15:18.960
first builds for iOS have to be done on a physical Mac and then App Center can take it from there.

15:18.960 --> 15:25.440
Oh, really? That's interesting. That is interesting because this scratches a few

15:25.440 --> 15:31.120
itches. One, like we didn't even mention it, but I'm currently on elementary at this very moment.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.720
Good for you. I think that is the desktop environment for you, especially Juno. I don't

15:34.720 --> 15:39.760
know. Are you using Juno? I'm on Juno. Good, good. I really think that's they got good app.

15:39.760 --> 15:43.440
The apps that they have are really good and solid. It's a clean environment. I think it's

15:43.440 --> 15:47.040
gotten a really bad rap for trying to be a Mac clone. It's not that at all. It's just they're

15:47.040 --> 15:53.840
trying to make a great UI and a great environment. It's one of my favorites. Sorry, now that I said

15:53.840 --> 16:02.240
all that, do you like it? I do like it. I don't know when it finally comes time to upgrade to

16:02.240 --> 16:11.040
a new tower. It would probably be either elementary or pop. I think it would be if I

16:11.040 --> 16:15.920
buy a Dell tower, it will be elementary because I don't love stock Ubuntu at the moment, even though

16:15.920 --> 16:21.520
pop is very close to it. And if I buy a 76 one, I will be lazy and just keep pop. The thing about

16:21.520 --> 16:28.160
elementary OS is just I love its terminal. They have the best notification system on desktop Linux

16:28.160 --> 16:35.600
and they're building this really complete guide for developers to follow to create applications

16:35.600 --> 16:39.840
for the platform. Then they have the app center where they have a monetized system where it's pay

16:39.840 --> 16:44.480
what you want. So developers can actually get paid for creating these applications.

16:44.480 --> 16:48.400
And there's some neat ones in there that are unique and specific in a way. There's other ways

16:48.400 --> 16:52.800
to get them. But in a sense, if you want the complete experience, they're unique to that

16:52.800 --> 17:00.960
distro. And it's so solid. They have this release approach where it's not date based, it's open bug

17:00.960 --> 17:05.440
based. And they just burn through all the issues until they have them sufficiently closed. And then

17:05.440 --> 17:11.920
that's when the next release gets cut. And I think that's why it's been so reliable for my son. He's

17:11.920 --> 17:18.240
been on it for almost three years now. The same install, my son on the same install, doing updates,

17:18.240 --> 17:25.200
installing Minecraft software. And it has been rock solid for him. And if you like GTK applications,

17:25.200 --> 17:30.640
which are gorgeous, it's a great way to run GTK applications on a desktop that is better

17:30.640 --> 17:35.280
architected than Gnome 3 Shell is. Anyways, that's my end of my pitch. I just think it's one I've

17:35.280 --> 17:38.800
been wanting you to try for a long time, but I just haven't been wanting. If you've been happy

17:38.800 --> 17:43.280
with pop or stock Ubuntu, I didn't want to push. Because you can go crazy hop in distros.

17:44.320 --> 17:47.520
Distro hopping. Well, I will say that my distro hopping days are probably done.

17:48.080 --> 17:53.040
Yeah, good. And I think we are going to be in a situation of, as long as I'm like,

17:53.760 --> 17:58.960
frogging around with this machine, it'll be elementary. And then whatever the, don't call

17:58.960 --> 18:07.760
it a Mac Pro alternative machine ends up being, will probably be by their pop or elementary.

18:07.760 --> 18:12.400
I can't see myself using stock Ubuntu at this point. Okay, so going back to Visual Studio

18:12.400 --> 18:18.000
App Center and code signing for iOS. So you get it signed and built once on a Mac. And then from

18:18.000 --> 18:24.800
then on, you use the App Center to do the deployments to the store and to actually build

18:24.800 --> 18:29.040
and sign it? Can you explain? This doesn't make sense to me. Right, but it's not just

18:29.040 --> 18:35.200
deployments to the store either. You can also use the App Center to, how can I put this,

18:35.200 --> 18:40.400
to do hockey app or test flight deployments to let's say customers or testers or anything like

18:40.400 --> 18:47.360
that. Which is kind of a big deal because it also can handle collecting the customer's UUID for

18:47.360 --> 18:53.600
their iPhones, which if you're using a hockey app is a tremendous pain in the ass. This has got to

18:53.600 --> 18:58.320
be pretty enticing to you. Are you giving this serious consideration? Yeah, I'm giving us some

18:58.320 --> 19:02.480
thought. And the reason being, one thing I've been considering doing for a while now is automated

19:02.480 --> 19:08.240
testing out of GitLab. So basically you would merge a branch, pull it somehow, create a binary,

19:08.240 --> 19:15.280
and run a bunch of automated UI tests and other kinds of just basically scripted tests. And

19:15.280 --> 19:22.160
that's always been something that's relatively easy on the web and incredibly annoying on mobile

19:23.120 --> 19:28.160
just because of the whole Mike's machine ends up being the build machine. And if Mike is busy,

19:28.160 --> 19:35.680
he doesn't want to sit there and run tests. So yeah, this is a, it's kind of a big change.

19:35.680 --> 19:40.960
One, because you don't need to lug around a MacBook. And I think even though the idea of

19:40.960 --> 19:45.360
just having a Mac mini somewhere hooked to a router was attractive, I think ultimately having

19:45.360 --> 19:53.360
this in the cloud is going to be more convenient. And the case of tests that I'm thinking of running

19:53.360 --> 20:00.560
are fairly easy to automate. Things like, are you missing assets? Are elements on the screen

20:00.560 --> 20:06.400
not lined up correctly? Things like that. Obviously Crashers and your basic heartbeat tests.

20:08.720 --> 20:15.280
But again, doing that manually is super time consuming. And I can already see the snarky

20:15.280 --> 20:23.360
YouTube comments coming, Mike discovers TDD. No, this is the stitching together of a new,

20:23.360 --> 20:29.440
I hate to use the term, but new cloud-based pipeline that, I mean, this is something Microsoft

20:29.440 --> 20:35.520
I think is just at the beginning of doing. What we are seeing today is going to be so more advanced

20:35.520 --> 20:42.880
by 2025. It's going to be obvious by that point. But if you look at how quick Microsoft is moving

20:42.880 --> 20:47.440
on their integration with GitHub, I've never really seen this company move this fast. Just

20:47.440 --> 20:52.320
as an example, if you go to docs.microsoft.com, now the entire comment system has been replaced

20:52.320 --> 20:57.680
with GitHub comments. You sign in with your GitHub account, and then they have open issues

20:57.680 --> 21:03.760
and closed issues in the comment section. They are integrating this stuff into Microsoft's pipeline

21:03.760 --> 21:10.160
very, very quickly. And there's going to be a clear future where it's all connected together

21:10.160 --> 21:15.200
very easily. And they're there now, but I mean, by 2025, this is going to be one of the tightest

21:15.200 --> 21:20.480
pipelines and developer resources out there. This is going to be great. And I could see why it'd be

21:20.480 --> 21:24.480
enticing now, even where they're just getting started. And here's the other crazy thing,

21:25.920 --> 21:29.040
and this wouldn't necessarily work for you because you don't want a Windows desktop,

21:29.040 --> 21:38.720
but this week Microsoft also announced Surface All Access, which is $24.99 a month for a Surface.

21:38.720 --> 21:43.520
And so it's Surface as a service, and they're actually going to be, I think, probably looking

21:43.520 --> 21:48.000
at it, that's how they're going to account for it as a service. So you get a book, you choose your

21:48.000 --> 21:51.600
favorite bundle, there's different bundles to pick from, and of course, they will change the price.

21:51.600 --> 21:57.040
So the price can go up to $150 per month if you wanted to say, get the Surface Studio iMac

21:57.040 --> 22:02.000
replacement, that'd be 150 bucks a month. Or if you wanted like the Surface laptop bundle,

22:02.000 --> 22:09.120
it's 46 bucks a month. But along with that, you get Dell support for some reason, Dell preferred

22:09.120 --> 22:14.640
supports, like Dell's top class support, and you get a subscription to Office 365. And you could

22:14.640 --> 22:18.240
see how they could easily spin this out in a developer's program, where you could also get

22:18.240 --> 22:24.560
access to Azure or certain aspects of Azure or access to the pipeline of some particular use.

22:24.560 --> 22:31.040
This is, to me, the perfect solution if I was working in this ecosystem. I'm actually a pretty

22:31.040 --> 22:35.280
big fan of the iPhone upgrade program, because the iPhone is just as useful as, actually,

22:35.280 --> 22:39.280
it's more useful than most of my computers. And so it's something that I'm interested in keeping

22:39.280 --> 22:43.920
up to date. And I also am interested in getting a new camera, because there's lots of uses for that.

22:43.920 --> 22:48.000
And so for me, it's actually pretty good as a subscription. And my laptop hardware and your

22:48.000 --> 22:53.520
laptop hardware also tends to get replaced about once a year, or for you, if you want to get a

22:53.520 --> 22:57.760
new camera, about once a year, or for you, even twice or three times a year, or four times a year.

22:58.880 --> 23:04.720
And so when you bundle these things with this top tier support warranty, and they'll replace it if

23:04.720 --> 23:10.000
you damage it, and you can get a new one when they release a new one, and you get bundled access to

23:10.000 --> 23:15.440
some of the services you might be using already in the cloud, they've got a really competitive

23:15.440 --> 23:20.160
offering for developers who don't have a ton of capital, who can't drop $3,000 on high-end

23:20.160 --> 23:24.960
hardware, but can afford $35 a month. Of course, a lot of people listening are going to go,

23:24.960 --> 23:29.680
oh my God, don't do that. You're financing a laptop. It's depreciating every day.

23:29.680 --> 23:34.720
But for some people, that is an arrangement that works. And when they have the ability now

23:34.720 --> 23:40.800
to bring all of this stuff together, Azure, and GitHub, and Surface as a Service, that's easy to

23:40.800 --> 23:45.920
say, that's a pretty competitive offering, especially since the Surface hardware, from all

23:45.920 --> 23:53.200
of that, is pretty decent. I don't know, man. Microsoft is just at the starting gates right now.

23:54.640 --> 24:00.720
So not to jump back too far, but to our conversation about the Windows subsystem for

24:00.720 --> 24:06.720
Linux, one of the more common things I'm seeing these students do is they're writing Python on

24:06.720 --> 24:10.480
Windows, which just blows my mind. Yeah, it's a thing.

24:10.480 --> 24:18.080
And like, yeah, it's creepy how good the iOS Apple development tools are from Microsoft.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.560
Yeah. And I'm running them on Linux.

24:22.560 --> 24:27.200
That is a funny thing. It's worth just spending a moment with, because it's

24:27.840 --> 24:34.080
not how things used to be. See, it is something to reflect on and go, wow, holy shit. This is

24:34.080 --> 24:40.400
really something. They really have moved so fast for a company their size, this is extremely

24:40.400 --> 24:44.240
nimble movement. It doesn't seem like it from the outside, but some of these things have been in

24:44.240 --> 24:51.120
development for years, like five-year timelines. And so they're moving. Wow. Well, so I guess

24:51.120 --> 24:55.200
this would probably be a good time to start talking about QA in general, your testing of

24:55.200 --> 25:02.960
the testing, because you've had some, let's say, on-again, off-again experiences in this area in

25:02.960 --> 25:08.560
the past? Yeah, so longtime listeners will know that I've drank and then thrown up the

25:08.560 --> 25:20.560
Kool-Aid on the automated testing more than once. So this is going to be a unpopular, not cool hip

25:20.560 --> 25:22.880
perspective on this problem. Ooh, those are my favorite.

25:24.000 --> 25:30.000
I do not believe that there is actually a virtue in having 100% test coverage.

25:30.720 --> 25:36.880
Okay. Because it's just not that hard to test certain things with the power of vision. And

25:36.880 --> 25:43.200
I also don't believe, as some people have wrote lengthy blogs about, that you can basically

25:43.200 --> 25:47.920
eliminate human testers via automated testing. Oh yeah.

25:47.920 --> 25:52.400
I also remember, Chris, let's talk about the late 90s for a moment, the early 2000s.

25:53.280 --> 25:57.200
There used to be entire teams of QA testers at companies.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.560
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

25:58.560 --> 26:03.920
Yeah. Yeah. And now a team that builds an app is like two or three people, right? So it's-

26:03.920 --> 26:09.360
Yeah. I would say in some cases, the QA was one of the large areas, not larger than support,

26:09.360 --> 26:13.040
but there were more QA testers than there were developers. That's for sure.

26:13.040 --> 26:19.200
Oh, for sure. Right. And the QA people, it was a really formalized process. I don't know how deep

26:19.200 --> 26:24.400
you went into it, but they had binders of QA scripts you had to follow. Yeah. And the best

26:24.400 --> 26:29.920
ones, there was usually someone there who was very persnickety about following the process.

26:29.920 --> 26:34.480
We have to follow the process. And because I was there as PC support, if something was preventing

26:34.480 --> 26:39.360
the process from going in its order, it was no good. And that was a big deal. And this room I'm

26:39.360 --> 26:46.480
talking about, for a company that had, I mean, three or four developers plus a contractor and

26:46.480 --> 26:52.880
maybe two contractors, they had a dozen QA in this one business that I was a contractor for,

26:52.880 --> 26:56.480
for two years. And the entire time, the QA department was an area they kept staffed.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.840
It was a bit challenging to keep it staffed though. That's for sure. A lot of turnover.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.960
Well, that was the thing though, right? The QA department was basically the stepping stone to

27:04.960 --> 27:10.640
becoming a programmer developer at a company. And this was, geez, that had been going on since the

27:10.640 --> 27:15.120
dawn of the industry, I think. I mean, these of us is old enough. Yeah. You look back at projects

27:15.120 --> 27:21.120
and the way they're structured, there was generally, I think a huge, well, comparatively to

27:21.120 --> 27:27.120
now, a huge commitment to QA that I guess to now just seems crazy. It seems like a huge staff cost

27:27.120 --> 27:35.440
that nobody would ever do. Well, that's the thing. I kind of think you do need QA.

27:35.440 --> 27:42.480
I've thought this for a long time, as we know. And I, again, get your YouTube comments ready.

27:42.480 --> 27:48.720
I actually questioned the wisdom of having developers be QA and having yourself rely

27:48.720 --> 27:54.320
completely, and I said completely, on automated, let's say, TDD testing. And we'll get into that

27:54.320 --> 27:57.520
because all different kinds of testing you could be doing in terms of automated testing.

27:59.280 --> 28:04.720
Because I would love to hear from anyone in the audience who works somewhere or has done

28:04.720 --> 28:11.200
a project themselves where it was never necessary to just run the app or whatever it is on an actual

28:11.200 --> 28:19.280
device and physically walk through the different screens or different user flows, regardless of how

28:19.280 --> 28:25.280
much automated testing you do or don't have. So the premise I'm rejecting is that I do not believe,

28:26.400 --> 28:31.040
again, I do not believe 100% test coverage will necessarily pay for itself.

28:32.160 --> 28:37.520
Let me see if I'm following you. Number one, it's hard to be your own editor. You write up

28:37.520 --> 28:40.480
something and you have somebody else read it and they'll have tons of editing suggestions.

28:40.480 --> 28:46.640
It's UI design is a lot like that. It's easy to overlook things that are just natural to you

28:46.640 --> 28:52.640
because you understand how it all works. So having somebody with a user's perspective and a clean,

28:52.640 --> 28:57.440
fresh perspective can catch things that would otherwise just have seemed obvious to you.

28:57.440 --> 29:01.120
So there's that aspect of it that I think you're trying to get at. But the other thing about it is

29:01.120 --> 29:09.680
100% automated testing would really require dedicated time to build new testing settings

29:09.680 --> 29:16.480
and systems all the time. But you think about what it would require to be able to fully automate

29:16.480 --> 29:24.560
all of that. It would either be a massive amount of pre-planning and an incredible amount of

29:24.560 --> 29:29.360
organization required to do it right, or it'd have to be an evolving thing that you're calling

29:29.360 --> 29:34.480
constantly adjusting and changing, which would be a big attention and time suck. So it seems like

29:34.480 --> 29:40.000
there's a balance there that you're saying maybe could be struck that it is worth having automated

29:40.000 --> 29:45.360
testing, but there is a balance where you will become consumed by managing the automated testing

29:45.360 --> 29:53.120
system. Am I following? Yeah, I would also argue that it's not just the cost of automating the

29:53.120 --> 30:00.000
test system. There's an economic thing where QA testers are generally junior and inexpensive,

30:00.720 --> 30:06.960
and intermediate to senior devs are generally going to be your highest cost, which means you're

30:06.960 --> 30:10.880
probably going to be very incentivized to try to build that time if you're in a type of business

30:10.880 --> 30:20.720
like I am. Okay. I'm not convinced that that is actually providing real value. Again,

30:20.720 --> 30:25.280
I'm not convinced that 100% coverage. I am not asserting that automated tests don't make sense

30:25.280 --> 30:31.280
at all. In fact, I think they do make sense. I just don't think being religious about 100%

30:31.280 --> 30:38.320
coverage is ultimately worthwhile. Yeah, I'm not going to argue that. I agree.

30:38.320 --> 30:43.600
Yeah. Well, it is kind of the whole position. I've been dipping my little toe back into this pool,

30:44.560 --> 30:47.680
and there's some very strange binary thing that's happening.

30:47.680 --> 30:52.800
My question to people has been, okay, so how much automated testing are you doing? We're doing some,

30:53.760 --> 31:01.760
but we're not writing tests to make sure the title of the page in iOS is correct,

31:01.760 --> 31:09.360
because we can just look. What I'm getting, particularly in developer forms, is just

31:10.400 --> 31:12.880
you're not doing testing unless you have 100% coverage.

31:12.880 --> 31:17.360
Which seems, that's like saying you're not using Linux unless you're completely false or GPO.

31:17.360 --> 31:21.520
Yeah, it's almost getting to a religious degree. It's a belief system. You will test.

31:21.520 --> 31:28.240
And then there's, if those are the RMSs, there's the, I don't know how you go past RMS, but

31:28.880 --> 31:31.920
there's the people who say you have to write your tests first.

31:31.920 --> 31:36.560
Right. Which sounds like complete madness to me.

31:36.560 --> 31:42.880
You know, I have been involved in a couple of conversations where the room of people that were

31:42.880 --> 31:48.080
building the thing, all of them seem to have collective buy-in on the idea that they could

31:48.080 --> 31:52.080
push it through a completely automated test system, a 100% automated test.

31:52.880 --> 32:00.160
And I never saw it completely work. It's funny, F-R-R-O-L in the chat room says,

32:00.160 --> 32:06.160
it's the 80-20 rule. 80% of use comes from 20% of the tests. And I would say that was the

32:06.160 --> 32:12.400
experience I walked away from, mainly from one particular group where I was involved in the

32:12.400 --> 32:18.720
conversation where I saw them concoct the idea. But I've also observed it from several, actually

32:18.720 --> 32:21.840
from several open source projects as well as clients, now that I think about it, where this

32:21.840 --> 32:26.400
mentality has crept in. And generally, I've seen it work. I've seen it work.

32:26.400 --> 32:30.240
As well as clients, now that I think about it, where this mentality has crept in and generally

32:30.800 --> 32:35.920
seems to have just become a never-ending quest. And I really, in my personal experience,

32:35.920 --> 32:39.440
it was about 20% of the tests. And they were the obvious ones that, of course,

32:39.440 --> 32:42.800
you'd want to check for, watch for regressions, make sure the damn thing doesn't crash,

32:43.520 --> 32:46.160
that kind of stuff. Well, it's like anything,

32:47.120 --> 32:50.160
the way I've taken it so far is like your mission-critical business logic,

32:50.880 --> 32:55.360
which in the type of software I tend to be writing now, is like transmitting data,

32:55.360 --> 33:01.680
doing calculation, doing conversions from like annoyingly small binary formats from the 80s.

33:02.400 --> 33:05.200
But that's all stuff that's easy to test because you can have a test script that like

33:05.760 --> 33:09.200
has a known input that you know what the output should be and just simply

33:10.160 --> 33:14.480
write a test that puts the input in and make sure as you get the correct output.

33:18.000 --> 33:25.040
But anything, I can give you a great example. I was talking to someone who was like testing

33:25.040 --> 33:32.720
CSS, which not only did I think was not possible, seems kind of crazy.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.800
Because how do you actually accomplish that?

33:36.560 --> 33:43.840
How do robots pick music? It's a design thing. It's a look and feel thing.

33:44.800 --> 33:49.120
And the answer to this question, by the way, is he went through extraordinary efforts to

33:49.120 --> 33:53.920
make that happen. And even then, I would argue, and the argument I did make to him was that I

33:53.920 --> 34:00.000
think your whole setup here is going to be super fragile. Like what happens if a browser, let's

34:00.000 --> 34:05.600
not call it Chrome, decides they want to change something, then do all your tests immediately

34:05.600 --> 34:14.320
fail? And his answer was probably. Yeah. And then back to work. That is exactly the thing.

34:16.720 --> 34:21.440
It's a rat race. What's the expression? You're chasing, you're following the leader constantly

34:21.440 --> 34:26.960
with that kind of testing. I strongly believe, and I should save this for a predictions episode,

34:26.960 --> 34:30.560
but I strongly believe when I was talking about Microsoft, now they're just getting started,

34:31.120 --> 34:36.160
this is an area they're going to expand on. And it's going to be one of those things that when

34:36.160 --> 34:41.760
you're all in and you're all connected up to their stuff, it's going to be extremely enticing to use

34:41.760 --> 34:46.560
because they'll automate a ton of this stuff. This is the next big area. I have heard a couple of

34:46.560 --> 34:52.000
open source projects that are thinking about building a service like this that is a full QA

34:52.000 --> 34:57.280
platform. And there are ones out there, but if a company like Microsoft could bring it all together

34:58.080 --> 35:03.840
with Azure and the ability to spin up virtual machines and test all kinds of applications

35:03.840 --> 35:11.440
from desktop applications all the way up to remote services and the full range, they could take it

35:11.440 --> 35:16.960
right from GitHub, they could build it, they could test it, and then they could go to the App Center

35:16.960 --> 35:21.680
and they could create the builds for iOS for you. The whole pipeline is there. There's just a few

35:21.680 --> 35:26.800
pieces they need to do some of the additional testing and to really make it easy to build those

35:26.800 --> 35:30.320
tests for the developers, to make that super accessible. There has to be work done there.

35:31.200 --> 35:35.120
But you know that's got to be a direction they're going to go in. So maybe this is my preemptive

35:35.120 --> 35:41.840
2019, end of 2019, 2020 prediction. Yeah, I would even piggyback on that. You know, now that I'm

35:41.840 --> 35:48.320
exploring this again for mobile apps, there is like a very common set of tests I would argue

35:48.320 --> 35:53.680
that you need for just about every iOS and Android app if you're going to do this. Why can't when I

35:53.680 --> 35:57.840
load up a built app center, Microsoft just simply say, hey, we have this suite of tests that we

35:57.840 --> 36:03.200
recommend you let us run and don't worry, you don't have to do anything. You know, so last week,

36:03.200 --> 36:09.440
Google announced that when you deploy a container on Google Cloud, any kind of like Docker container

36:09.440 --> 36:16.480
or anything like that, their system will now begin to analyze the system files and look at it to make

36:16.480 --> 36:23.200
sure there's no like Monero crypto miner in there. They're initiating a set of QA checks already for

36:23.200 --> 36:29.280
deployments on Google Cloud. And if you think about it, behind the scenes, they're already doing

36:29.280 --> 36:33.840
tons of QA stuff when you spin up a machine scripts that check to make sure services available.

36:34.320 --> 36:38.640
It is just going to be an expansion of that to a degree like internally for them. They probably

36:38.640 --> 36:43.040
already have infrastructure they can build on to make these services possible. And that's exactly

36:43.040 --> 36:48.800
even if it just starts at does it crash? Does the UI load? Could they perhaps maybe even simulate

36:48.800 --> 36:54.560
network conditions, create a simulated cellular network, create simulated degradation and packet

36:54.560 --> 36:59.200
loss? I think they could. And they could probably do it very simply compared to what you have to do

36:59.200 --> 37:03.280
to try to simulate that same thing on actual hardware. Of course, I guess they'd be a simulator.

37:03.280 --> 37:07.440
Anyways, I'm getting ahead of myself, but I think it's obvious where they're going to go. And it's

37:07.440 --> 37:12.000
going to be really interesting to see if that happens. How does the developer market react?

37:12.000 --> 37:16.480
And how much are they willing to shift to a Microsoft based tool chain? And maybe they're

37:16.480 --> 37:20.720
like you and they're doing that from Linux or they're doing it from Windows 10, or maybe even a

37:20.720 --> 37:28.320
Mac or God forbid, a Chromebook. And no, no, no, I don't do that. And Microsoft's acquisition of

37:28.320 --> 37:36.720
GitHub was just you think about it was pretty clever. Yeah, and also a little scary, but yeah,

37:36.720 --> 37:41.280
it's going to be you know what else is. OK, so just like off the top of your head, you got to

37:41.280 --> 37:46.960
answer quick. Don't think about it. So get ready. What company is scarier, Microsoft or Amazon?

37:46.960 --> 37:52.160
Amazon. Yeah, 100% right? Like 100% way. So I would rather like put all my stuff on Microsoft.

37:52.160 --> 37:56.560
Yeah, oh, for sure. Yeah. When it comes to like data storage and stuff. So I know what Microsoft

37:56.560 --> 38:02.080
wants, right? Yeah, I, I have been trying to make a case for a while on the show and I don't think

38:02.080 --> 38:07.600
I've gotten a lot of traction. But I'm going to bring it up one more time. I think there is gold

38:07.600 --> 38:15.520
in them, their hills of the echo. And the the different types of use cases that you're going to

38:15.520 --> 38:20.720
use now for the echo, I think expand the options for developers to create skills that eventually

38:20.720 --> 38:25.280
can be monetized. And this is not a commercial. I actually have really kind of stopped using. I

38:25.280 --> 38:31.200
have one here in the studio, but kind of stopped using echo tube. So I'm not I'm not here to sell.

38:31.840 --> 38:37.120
This is just my personal opinion. They just launched, I think a couple of weeks ago, a dozen

38:37.120 --> 38:42.880
different types of echoes. You've all heard about the microwave one. There's even the Billy, the

38:42.880 --> 38:47.760
bass, that rubber bass that sings on the wall. They've even made it. Are you kidding me? 100%

38:47.760 --> 38:51.840
serious. There's now an echo in that thing. Yeah, they made an echo of God. And the thing the worst

38:51.840 --> 38:57.120
two products together and the lips move with the voice of the bass. Yeah, they've they've done that.

38:57.120 --> 39:01.280
But they've also done a couple other really neat ones, including a much better video version one,

39:01.280 --> 39:06.320
but one that's built into a clock, like a wall clock. I think that's pretty clever. And they're

39:06.320 --> 39:11.440
also now testing one that goes in the car, which I've experimented with back when I just I just

39:11.440 --> 39:15.760
brought a my fi and a device with me. And I just tried to have the echo in the car just to see what

39:15.760 --> 39:25.040
that'd be like. And I think they are going to just hit this harder than Google or Apple can,

39:25.520 --> 39:31.200
because this is Amazon putting a store in your home. And it ties in with the security products

39:31.200 --> 39:36.000
that they've also announced. So all the devices work together, the echoes go into monitoring mode

39:36.000 --> 39:39.920
when you when you when you set your house alarm. And of course, they can tie it in with deliveries

39:39.920 --> 39:44.320
and down the road to tie in with other services that they launched like groceries. So the grocery

39:44.320 --> 39:50.640
delivery will come and the system will recognize them. This is a massive importance for Amazon,

39:50.640 --> 39:55.840
way beyond anything that Apple or Google can appreciate. Google obviously is a close number two

39:55.840 --> 40:01.040
with search and all the services that voice commands tie in with obviously, but I think for

40:01.040 --> 40:07.440
Amazon, this is better than opening a store in every town. This is opening a store in every home.

40:07.440 --> 40:14.560
And I I watched now as they continue to expand their developer monetization program, where if

40:14.560 --> 40:19.920
you get a successful skill, they're watching and they're starting to cut people checks. That's not

40:19.920 --> 40:24.960
a sustainable system, but I think that is an indicator that Amazon intends for this to be a

40:24.960 --> 40:30.160
way for people to make money. And until all of the pieces are in place, writing checks is how

40:30.160 --> 40:35.280
they're doing it. There are other ways of tying in with services. It's a great way to sell services,

40:35.280 --> 40:40.480
especially if you have or if you're already creating like audio content that would work

40:40.480 --> 40:45.200
really well on the echo. So there's other ways to monetize, but I feel like there are golden in

40:45.200 --> 40:51.600
their hills and for for Amazon, they're expanding this thing and it just is just very competitively.

40:51.600 --> 40:57.040
They've announced a bunch of different devices. Did I did I did I get did I reach you at all with

40:57.040 --> 41:04.000
that pitch? I mean, you reach me with the pitch every time, but then there's the problem of you

41:04.000 --> 41:08.880
only get paid if Uncle Jeff decides to send you a check. Well, it's not necessarily like I'd be

41:08.880 --> 41:14.160
willing to pay to have somebody create a really comprehensive skill for Jupiter broadcasting.

41:14.160 --> 41:18.560
Like there you could come to me with a certain like quote and I you know, I'd be like, okay,

41:18.560 --> 41:22.560
that's what we're talking about. Actually, like so there like there's there's several ways to monetize

41:22.560 --> 41:27.520
this. If you look at all of the podcasts that are out there, all the radio stations, everybody wants

41:27.520 --> 41:34.160
you to be able to call up their thing on it on a scale. There's even an angle for you with the

41:34.160 --> 41:38.480
mad botter. You could have you could have mad botter tips and things like that that are pre

41:38.480 --> 41:44.400
recorded sessions that you've done, maybe 1520 MP3 files that sit on a droplet. And then when

41:44.400 --> 41:50.080
somebody says, hey, echo, give me a mad botter tip, it plays one of your tips. I'm just, you know,

41:50.080 --> 41:54.880
obviously that'd be a weird example. But there is I think there's more use cases than people realize

41:54.880 --> 41:59.680
because not a lot of people have these. And once you get them, you realize there's a lot of

41:59.680 --> 42:04.800
potential. All right. It's actually not the worst idea ever. You know, I mean, there's a lot of

42:04.800 --> 42:09.360
businesses that would like I could even see Linux Academy would want something like this like a

42:09.360 --> 42:14.240
like a you know, a Linux Academy educational tip. Like there's a lot of use cases here. Wait, I've

42:14.240 --> 42:20.400
got it. Hey, big mouth Billy bass. Yeah. Play Jupiter broadcast Linux Academy. Yeah. Say I did

42:20.400 --> 42:25.120
it again. No, no. It's podcasts are still labeled as Jupiter broadcast. So I don't know what we'll

42:25.120 --> 42:29.760
do there. Eventually I might change it. It seems like Linux Academy is a stronger brand with larger

42:29.760 --> 42:36.320
industry recognition. But the podcast could be like the premium podcasts from Linux Academy. Yeah,

42:36.320 --> 42:45.360
we're a premium brand. We're pretty. Yeah. I mean, I really want to believe in it. Right. This is a

42:45.360 --> 42:52.160
okay. Like, so I have to confess, I have written an Alexa skill. And because uncle Jeff makes it

42:52.160 --> 42:58.640
so easy to just automatically create a skill with AWS Lambda. It is really, really easy to get sucked

42:58.640 --> 43:05.120
back into the AWS ecosystem. Yes. Oh, for sure. Yeah. Like it's shocking. Like what they have done

43:05.120 --> 43:10.160
is I could make a skill. I can make a skill with my son. Like you can sit down and they have a lot

43:10.160 --> 43:14.720
of different systems now that make it like click and drag even. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

43:14.720 --> 43:19.920
And drag even. Yeah. I mean, I did it before that when you had to like coding like node,

43:19.920 --> 43:24.000
but you could, you didn't have to care, right? You could just do it in a Lambda and just basically

43:24.000 --> 43:28.240
write your functions that respond to certain things. Um, and you have to have like a default,

43:28.240 --> 43:35.120
you know, sorry, I don't understand you kind of function. I just don't know.

43:38.560 --> 43:42.480
See, I guess I don't know other than like making skills for other people.

43:42.480 --> 43:46.240
Yeah. Um, I, I think in, I think in your space, content creation,

43:46.240 --> 43:49.360
particularly audio content, it's awesome. Right. I think that makes a ton of sense,

43:50.080 --> 43:54.560
but how far could, how, how much would a different kind of business really be willing to invest in

43:54.560 --> 43:59.840
Alexa skill? Yeah. You know, it's, I think the that's funny. I think, uh, F R O L in the chat

43:59.840 --> 44:04.800
room nailed it is this is what I've been feeling is where my angst on this comes from is if

44:04.800 --> 44:09.440
developers don't start making these things better, I don't think they're taken off. I mean, more than

44:09.440 --> 44:14.400
they really have, but he writes in the chat room, he says, are those tubes like tablet several years

44:14.400 --> 44:19.920
ago? Promising, but not flying. Well, I'm still, yeah, I kind of feel like I'll give, I give the

44:19.920 --> 44:26.640
home pod, uh, a, a special mention here because it went from really basic course. You will, of course

44:26.640 --> 44:34.560
I did. It went from really basic. In fact, in its core, it is still very basic, but holy hell,

44:34.560 --> 44:40.320
the shortcuts work with the home pod. Holy hell, man. Like I, you know, I'm listening to a show

44:40.320 --> 44:46.560
all the way home. I get home, I walk in the RV, I say, Hey, home pod resume overcast. And

44:47.440 --> 44:50.960
the things were never on the same network. They were never talking until I obviously got home

44:52.000 --> 44:56.560
and it just on the home pod. Now it just immediately resumes playing my podcast exactly

44:56.560 --> 45:03.280
where I was now on the nice audio of the home pod. I also had to do was turn that macro or I'm sorry,

45:03.280 --> 45:08.640
shortcut on, on my iPhone some point a couple of days ago and that crap just works. So now I'm,

45:08.640 --> 45:13.680
I've got, okay, okay. You ready for this? This is, this is some real crap here. This is so,

45:13.680 --> 45:19.520
I take a drink before you tell me. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you're gonna, now this is not as applicable

45:19.520 --> 45:23.840
to you because your home does not go down the road, but you, this would work well if you had

45:23.840 --> 45:29.200
your phone in your car, but this is particularly applicable to me because we go down the road and

45:29.200 --> 45:34.000
we actually listen to our music on the home pod because it's louder than the RV is built in

45:34.000 --> 45:40.240
stereo system, which is not what do you do when we're driving the RV? We have the home pod plugged

45:40.240 --> 45:44.800
in still. We have, we have electricity in the RV when we're driving and we actually listen to our

45:44.800 --> 45:50.960
music and our podcasts on the home pod because it's louder than the RV stereo system. So I mentioned

45:50.960 --> 45:55.440
this just for context. So you'll understand why this skill is pretty important. So this is a

45:55.440 --> 46:01.440
shortcut that I have. I wasn't, it wasn't my idea, but I definitely built it. So if I say,

46:01.440 --> 46:07.760
Hey, home pod, I'm getting pulled over. It pauses the music or the podcast. It turns on,

46:07.760 --> 46:13.200
do not disturb on all of my iOS devices. It turns off their brightness on my phone.

46:13.200 --> 46:18.720
It gets the current location. It sends that to my fiance Hadia and it tells her I'm currently

46:18.720 --> 46:23.280
getting pulled over. This is my current location. While my screen is off on my iPhone,

46:23.280 --> 46:28.880
it turns on the front facing camera in high quality mode, saves that to a photo album.

46:29.680 --> 46:33.280
And also then sends it to me in a message when everything's done. And then when I tell it,

46:33.280 --> 46:37.920
everything's done and we're over, it takes me out of do not disturb mode, turns my brightness back

46:37.920 --> 46:43.280
on. And it saves, uh, that video that it recorded to iCloud and Dropbox.

46:43.280 --> 46:52.240
So the whole pod went from really basic to now I can do some super fancy stuff.

46:53.680 --> 46:57.040
And that same command works on my iPhone too. So I can use it while I'm driving in the car.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.920
So, you know, I'm amazed there's not a commercial with that feature because that actually, no,

47:03.920 --> 47:08.880
seriously that I was completely unaware. It could control your other devices like that. That's now,

47:08.880 --> 47:13.440
is that a third party developer or is that a integrated? That's a shortcut. It's a shortcut

47:13.440 --> 47:18.080
and you just have to have, so it has to be a setting that you can change via iCloud. Um,

47:18.080 --> 47:23.360
yeah. And it's pretty cool. And it's, it's a, you can, if you search for it in the shortcuts gallery,

47:23.360 --> 47:28.000
there's one that I use as a template. It's something it's called police. So I changed

47:28.000 --> 47:31.040
mine to I'm getting pulled over because that's the command. I just, that's stuck in my head

47:31.040 --> 47:35.040
because that's what I'm thinking when I'm getting pulled over, right? What else are you going to

47:35.040 --> 47:39.840
think? And just even having it silence and turn off screen brightness. Oh, that's really cool.

47:39.840 --> 47:44.560
And so the cop doesn't think you're like texting while driving. Right. Um, and so I think these

47:44.560 --> 47:48.000
personal assistants shouldn't be called personal assistants cause I don't know what the hell is

47:48.000 --> 47:52.480
personal about them. It really drives me crazy that you can't, I think there's a feature that

47:52.480 --> 47:58.080
would put an echo on every single business person's desk. Every desk in the United States

47:58.080 --> 48:02.640
would have an echo on it. If they could come up with a couple of real actual personal assistance

48:02.640 --> 48:08.240
features. If, when you and I need to reschedule the show, I could say, Hey, echo schedule a

48:08.240 --> 48:14.640
recording with Mike on Thursday or Friday. And then it would never talk to you. It would never

48:14.640 --> 48:20.160
bother you. It would never send you a message. It would contact your echo or some intermediary API,

48:20.160 --> 48:24.800
some service. It would check your calendar. You'd see what time you have available and

48:24.800 --> 48:29.280
match it up with the time that I have available. And it would set a mutual meeting, then notify us.

48:29.280 --> 48:34.080
And maybe that notification would come via the echo or something that shows up on your phone or

48:34.080 --> 48:38.640
just a regular old calendar invite and it would be done. And we wouldn't have to have this back

48:38.640 --> 48:44.000
and forth in Slack. It would all just happen because these personal assistants did that.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
And there's a lot of stuff like that. Like why can't I ask this thing to send a grocery list

48:48.000 --> 48:52.240
somewhere? You can create lists, but then you have to open up another app. Like they're not

48:52.240 --> 48:57.120
personal assistants. They're automation devices. And if you think of them as that,

48:57.120 --> 49:00.240
then I think they're a little more useful. So this is where I think the problem is,

49:00.240 --> 49:07.680
right? So if I wanted to develop some cool automation software for just, let's just say,

49:07.680 --> 49:13.280
the echo, right? I would definitely do it specifically for Big Mouth Billy Bass though.

49:14.880 --> 49:18.720
Because of all these stupid walled gardens, like these stupid barriers to like,

49:18.720 --> 49:23.120
I am completely sure that there's all kinds of ways that integrating with the HomePod sucks if

49:23.120 --> 49:28.560
you are not like a native iOS app. Yeah. And perhaps my Apple, like all that stuff

49:28.560 --> 49:34.960
doesn't work if my phone's not on the land. Right. So it would be great. Let's just,

49:34.960 --> 49:39.840
cause the ideal architecture would probably be you write some software that runs on a server.

49:40.960 --> 49:47.040
Could be a DO droplet. You then have these different endpoints. One could be for,

49:47.040 --> 49:54.560
you know, assistants such as Siri and echo. The other could be just like, almost like how the

49:54.560 --> 49:58.320
Android instant apps kind of work, which is like renders down a page. Hell, it could just be a

49:58.320 --> 50:04.080
webpage for mobile devices. And that, I mean, this is how Slack bots and bots in general work. And

50:04.080 --> 50:09.760
the other would be just a JSON endpoint for, you know, your slacks, your Microsoft teams,

50:09.760 --> 50:16.400
hip chats. But Apple won't allow it. Google has their own hangups about Google assistant. Although

50:16.400 --> 50:20.240
I think it's funny that no one who talks about this stuff really talks about Google assistant

50:20.240 --> 50:27.360
too much, which is interesting to me. Yeah. And Amazon, I think is actually the most flexible

50:27.360 --> 50:28.480
for developers here. Yes.

50:29.840 --> 50:34.240
But no one wants, with good reason, none of the other companies want to be in bed with Jeff Bezos.

50:34.880 --> 50:41.440
I hear he's a selfish lover. So I, like, I love it. The use case you gave is great. Like that is

50:41.440 --> 50:46.960
my ideal. I could just say, you know, Hey, Java Duke. And if you get the reference, you're old,

50:48.400 --> 50:53.200
go, I don't know, tell you what happens all the time, right? I'm coming back from Orlando or

50:53.200 --> 50:57.440
something and I'm stuck on I4. Just the same case, right? Tell Chris, I'm going to be 20 minutes late.

50:58.640 --> 51:02.160
That can be a shortcut now. You know, that, that is the thing is if you're on iOS.

51:02.160 --> 51:07.600
If I have a native iOS app, if I have a home pod, you're asking a lot of buy-in.

51:07.600 --> 51:13.680
I know. I know. And the thing is, is at different times, not necessarily the most competitive,

51:13.680 --> 51:18.800
you know, like tech def without question, the echo can do more, especially when you

51:18.800 --> 51:24.080
consider the skills in the ecosystem. And so in a lot of ways, Google assistant is better

51:24.080 --> 51:29.360
contextual conversations than any of the assistants are. And it in a way can do with it. Yeah. Yeah.

51:30.160 --> 51:36.160
Yeah. It's to me, it's just either, I think it's either, I don't know, it feels like they're almost

51:36.160 --> 51:40.320
going to be successful just because they play music and you can tell them to skip songs and

51:40.320 --> 51:45.600
turn things up and down. Like that is the minimum viable product of all of these speakers. And

51:45.600 --> 51:50.560
because the costs are coming down, they're all just getting smart anyways. And so this ecosystem

51:50.560 --> 51:55.280
is sort of building on the momentum of people wanting decent sounding speakers that they can

51:55.280 --> 52:00.000
control easily. And okay, if I can set a timer, that's kind of handy too while I'm cooking,

52:00.000 --> 52:04.720
like that's the momentum that these things are running on, not all of their fancy AI and assistant

52:04.720 --> 52:10.400
stuff, but we will reach a point where they're just ambient. They're everywhere. I mean,

52:10.400 --> 52:15.840
if you think about a household that has a couple of iOS devices and iPad and iPhone and a watch or

52:15.840 --> 52:20.000
a home pod, that's a lot of Siri mics everywhere in the house. If you think about a place that has

52:20.000 --> 52:25.040
a couple of echo dots, it's a lot of Alexa mic, uh, cancel, sorry. That's a lot of-

52:25.040 --> 52:26.480
The panacea dream come true.

52:26.480 --> 52:32.400
It really is. Ooh, yeah. And so then there is all of a sudden by the very nature, a market.

52:32.400 --> 52:35.760
And over time that market will start to get more sophisticated. I think,

52:36.800 --> 52:40.880
I think, I think, I don't know. We'll see. It's, they seem to be selling a crap ton of them.

52:40.880 --> 52:45.760
All three, Amazon, Google, and, and, uh, and, uh, Apple. But the only one that doesn't seem

52:45.760 --> 52:50.560
to be selling that super well that I've seen is the Cortana one. But even Microsoft's in the game,

52:50.560 --> 52:51.920
that's the one nobody ever talks about.

52:51.920 --> 52:56.480
Microsoft is actually, uh, integrating Cortana on the Xbox with Alexa.

52:56.480 --> 52:58.640
Yeah. That's actually, I don't know if you're joking,

52:58.640 --> 53:00.320
but that is actually something they're doing is you can-

53:00.320 --> 53:03.440
No, I'm not joking. Yeah, yeah, no. They, yeah.

53:03.440 --> 53:06.960
That's so weird. All right. Well, we, I know people hate it when we talk LadyTube,

53:06.960 --> 53:09.440
so we should probably wrap it up there. But I just still think it's,

53:09.440 --> 53:13.920
you look at the last couple of weeks, uh, and now with iOS 12 and the HomePod, you have,

53:13.920 --> 53:17.360
you have some incredible capabilities all of a sudden overnight that the HomePod could do.

53:17.920 --> 53:21.440
And, uh, Google Assistant is going to be calling people and scheduling. You know,

53:21.440 --> 53:24.880
if anybody's going to get there, it's going to be Google with that scheduling thing that I want.

53:24.880 --> 53:28.400
It's going to be over the phone though. It's going to call people and be a robot talking to

53:28.400 --> 53:32.800
them and just get stuff scheduled that way. Hello, Dave. I would like a dinner reservation.

53:32.800 --> 53:36.080
Yeah. Well, Mr. Dominic, is there anything you want to mention or plug or any links to

53:36.080 --> 53:40.400
send people to before we get out of here? Uh, go check out themadbotter.com. And as

53:40.400 --> 53:43.920
always, if you want to run some C-Sharp on Linux, I'm your man.

53:43.920 --> 53:45.840
There you go. That feels dirty every time.

53:45.840 --> 53:48.960
I don't know, man. It's going to get more and more popular, more and more in demand.

53:48.960 --> 53:52.800
All right. Well, we'll wrap it up there. I'm at chrislas. Grab the links we talked to

53:52.800 --> 53:57.600
about those kinds of things at coder.show. Also our contact page. We want your emails,

53:57.600 --> 54:03.840
your questions, even your corrections coder.show slash contact. That's the official place to get

54:03.840 --> 54:09.040
our attention. And then there's that subreddit coderradio.reddit.com. Thanks so much for tuning

54:09.040 --> 54:13.280
into this week's episode of the Coder Radio program. And we'll see you right back here next

54:13.280 --> 54:28.560
