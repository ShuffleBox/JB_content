This is Koder Radio, episode 437 for October 25th, 2021.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.960
Hello friend, welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.960 --> 00:23.960
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.760
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru, a cloud guru has a cloud playground.

00:27.760 --> 00:33.400
Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

00:37.720 --> 00:42.760
My name is Chris, and joining me like the champion he is, even after a late night support

00:42.760 --> 00:45.000
session, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello Mike.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Hey, why not?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.720
There must always be another Python script.

00:48.720 --> 00:53.520
You know, one day we'll figure out a way to automate you somehow, you know, I'll join

00:53.520 --> 00:57.280
you one day and I'll just be chatting with Alice and I won't even realize it for like

00:57.280 --> 00:58.280
the first 15 minutes.

00:58.280 --> 01:01.320
You know, I know it's coming honestly.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.320
Please do.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.320
Yeah.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.320
Would you take that?

01:04.320 --> 01:05.320
I know, right?

01:05.320 --> 01:08.880
I would like to be lounging in a soaking tub like a Russian czar.

01:08.880 --> 01:09.880
Sure.

01:09.880 --> 01:10.880
Oh yeah.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.200
So do you like the golden girls?

01:14.200 --> 01:17.280
Oh man, thank you for being a friend.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.920
I love the golden girls.

01:18.920 --> 01:23.560
Listen, if there's a gift, there'll be a card in it and it'll say exactly that.

01:23.560 --> 01:24.560
Yeah.

01:24.560 --> 01:30.360
I'm bingeing the golden girls because there is something about B. Arthur's D that gives

01:30.360 --> 01:32.680
me strength when I need to keep going.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.160
Yeah, she's so sassy.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.160
She's so sassy.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.160
Ooh.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.160
What was that?

01:38.160 --> 01:40.520
And now I'm coming back all of a sudden.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.400
You got, you got somebody else in there listening to me?

01:42.400 --> 01:43.400
No, something bad happened.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.400
Hang on.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.400
Thank you for being a friend.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.400
Traveled down the road and back again.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.400
All right, now I hear you.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.400
All right, there we go.

01:48.400 --> 02:00.400
One of the problems with my house being like all Apple is any, like my kid can hijack what

02:00.400 --> 02:03.200
I'm doing because I'm using the AirPods Max for the show.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.200
Right, right, right.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.080
It was my, uh, was it Stonheiner's who got me?

02:07.080 --> 02:08.240
They broke, so.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.680
It seems like it really sucks too.

02:09.680 --> 02:13.600
Like it messes that auto figure out where to play from all the time.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.600
It's a horrible feature.

02:14.600 --> 02:18.760
Like if someone turns on an iOS device, it just looks like, oh, let me steal the feed

02:18.760 --> 02:19.760
from the Mac.

02:19.760 --> 02:20.760
But anyway.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.680
Well, do I sound any different today to you?

02:22.680 --> 02:23.680
No, why?

02:23.680 --> 02:29.120
Oh, because I'm talking to you from space.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.480
I'm talking to you from space today.

02:30.480 --> 02:37.200
I'm a, this is the first live stream and the first VoIP call I've ever done over Starlink.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.200
Ooh.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.200
Yeah, yeah.

02:39.200 --> 02:45.520
I mean, in the order of things air, I've done love first, but in for, you know, what airs,

02:45.520 --> 02:48.560
but in terms of recording schedule, this is it, baby.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.880
This is my first production trial.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.160
I found, I found a spot in the woods.

02:53.160 --> 02:57.360
Like I had to drive around for a bit to find enough clearing because there's so there's

02:57.360 --> 03:01.640
like a tree canopy around here, but I'm out here way away from the coast because there's

03:01.640 --> 03:05.920
a cyclone bomb going off that has like 60 mile per hour winds on the coast.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.920
So we went inland.

03:06.920 --> 03:11.320
We're right at the foot of the Cascade mountains and I found a clearing in the woods where

03:11.320 --> 03:17.640
I could get the RV level and I put Starlink the little dish out there and it's awesome.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.600
We're doing the whole show live from the RV.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.040
Everything streamed from the RV, everything.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.680
It's pretty cool.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.080
It's a game changer for my work.

03:26.080 --> 03:30.280
I got emotional when I first started using it because I've never really had great internet

03:30.280 --> 03:31.280
in here.

03:31.280 --> 03:35.160
So in the art and business, is this like a big investment or?

03:35.160 --> 03:38.000
You know, it's, it's 400 bucks to get the dish.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Okay.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.800
So it's like an eighth of a MacBook pro.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.800
Right?

03:41.800 --> 03:42.800
Yeah.

03:42.800 --> 03:47.240
And then, uh, you, you got like a hundred dollar a month service, but as of right now,

03:47.240 --> 03:50.680
cause it's still kind of technically in the beta, uh, there is no caps.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.840
There's no limits like I have with LTE.

03:52.840 --> 03:58.080
There's no throttling and I've seen upwards of 240 megabits and I've seen probably an

03:58.080 --> 04:00.360
average of 130 megabits.

04:00.360 --> 04:04.120
My ping time right now is a recordings around 30 milliseconds to Google.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.680
Not bad at all for space, right?

04:06.680 --> 04:07.680
Jesus Christ.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.680
Major Tom.

04:08.680 --> 04:09.680
I know.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.720
And you know, these damn dishes are Linux boxes.

04:10.720 --> 04:15.040
There's a Linux computer in there that does everything you need to talk to the dishes.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.080
I mean, to the satellites, I don't have to go through their router.

04:18.080 --> 04:23.760
I can plug it directly into my router so I can manage it with all my LTE connections

04:23.760 --> 04:25.700
and everything else that I have.

04:25.700 --> 04:29.760
And it just integrates in with my land, my existing wifi access points are connected

04:29.760 --> 04:30.760
to it.

04:30.760 --> 04:33.800
It's Oh, it's glorious dude.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.760
It is glorious.

04:35.760 --> 04:36.760
It's game changer time.

04:36.760 --> 04:40.440
It really, it really means, you know, I can go out and about and I don't even need the

04:40.440 --> 04:41.440
studio.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.440
Like if it burns to the ground, I'll be okay.

04:42.440 --> 04:46.140
I preferred it, you know, cause the studio isn't moving and isn't constantly changing.

04:46.140 --> 04:51.460
Isn't affected by the rain like this place is loud sometimes, but yeah, it's pretty cool.

04:51.460 --> 04:52.500
It's pretty cool.

04:52.500 --> 04:56.720
So I know you were up pretty early this morning and since I've been out and about hunting

04:56.720 --> 05:00.240
in the woods, I didn't get a time to go through the email, so I thought maybe you and I would

05:00.240 --> 05:05.360
chat about like Alice launch, follow up and how support's been and you know, and I know

05:05.360 --> 05:10.240
you've at this point you've run some ads outside of Facebook and I don't know, like how's that

05:10.240 --> 05:11.240
going?

05:11.240 --> 05:12.240
How's the support stuff going?

05:12.240 --> 05:14.040
Uh, so yeah, there's a lot.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.960
I mean, I was up working on Alice late last night.

05:17.960 --> 05:22.280
Of course, when you have real customers, you have edge cases and you have to handle that.

05:22.280 --> 05:26.120
When I say I was up late last night, this is where the golden girls reference comes

05:26.120 --> 05:35.160
in, picture it, Florida, 2021, a man hunched over his MacBook air, wakes up cradling said

05:35.160 --> 05:39.520
MacBook air on the kitchen floor with a visual studio code open.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.520
Okay.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.120
Did you just wake up in a haze?

05:43.120 --> 05:48.880
According to get lab, I wrote like a lot of code last night and I kind of cut memory usage

05:48.880 --> 05:52.560
analysis by about 20% who sounds inspired.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.560
Yeah.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.640
I mean, if you've read it in the Lovecraft, you would be a little concerned, but yeah,

05:56.640 --> 06:00.360
that sounds, uh, inspired as something.

06:00.360 --> 06:05.320
I would say I opened the interdimensional portal where I just started writing things

06:05.320 --> 06:06.920
and see.

06:06.920 --> 06:07.920
Did you, did you really?

06:07.920 --> 06:08.920
Are you kidding me?

06:08.920 --> 06:11.120
Did you switch to see overnight?

06:11.120 --> 06:18.360
Like in some weird fugue state in like a, a like focus state in the middle of the night,

06:18.360 --> 06:24.080
you just said, you know what, Python's been great, but you know what's even better.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.080
Is that what happened?

06:25.080 --> 06:28.840
I mean, I can tell you what my exact thought process was cause one of the beauties of this

06:28.840 --> 06:32.240
just being a pure like exhaustion thing.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.480
So like Alice architecture, right?

06:34.480 --> 06:39.160
It uses Python as the primary language and then some rust.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.040
Now the problem with rust is, and this is a technical term.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.040
It's kind of a little bitch.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.040
Yeah.

06:44.040 --> 06:47.000
I'm familiar with that term at three in the morning.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.920
You sort of don't care.

06:48.920 --> 06:49.920
Yeah.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.760
You're kind of like, you know, you don't want to fool with this.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.160
I just want to get it done.

06:54.160 --> 07:00.040
So then you drop to see for reasons that are very insane.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.520
I'm just so I understand like the context.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.000
Were you under a time pressure as well?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.880
Like were you trying to get something done for this client?

07:04.880 --> 07:06.720
I had to get something done for this morning.

07:06.720 --> 07:07.720
Uh huh.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.720
Uh huh.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.720
Okay.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.720
So I woke up, did the demo.

07:10.720 --> 07:17.640
It was a special thing for a customer and the demo went well, but then I looked at the

07:17.640 --> 07:21.800
code and somebody who works with me looked at the code.

07:21.800 --> 07:25.080
The commit logs themselves are amazing.

07:25.080 --> 07:30.480
It's the rantings of a madman, but phrase in terms of algebra, you got to show this

07:30.480 --> 07:31.480
to me.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.480
This is good.

07:32.480 --> 07:35.760
Cause remember Alice doesn't really like, so this is like the dirty little secret of

07:35.760 --> 07:36.760
Alice.

07:36.760 --> 07:37.760
She doesn't need to understand the data.

07:37.760 --> 07:38.760
Right.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.880
She doesn't need to understand the structure of the data.

07:40.880 --> 07:41.880
Sure.

07:41.880 --> 07:42.880
Sure.

07:42.880 --> 07:43.880
Right.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.960
Like I said, like those old fashioned silhouette paintings, everything is basically see, right?

07:46.960 --> 07:52.000
Like if we go back into, I mean everything's binary, but you know, I hate you Fox pro.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.520
I hate you so much.

07:54.520 --> 07:59.040
That's a, that's one for the kids to Google Fox pro and then they'll understand.

07:59.040 --> 08:06.960
I can't say that my code will make anybody happy other than it works, but it's like if

08:06.960 --> 08:12.520
you could think of what functional C programming looks like, that's, that's what it is.

08:12.520 --> 08:15.960
Like I didn't even go objective with it.

08:15.960 --> 08:16.960
I was that pissed.

08:16.960 --> 08:21.400
I just went straight C. I like, I like to think of this as sort of a Dr Jekyll and Mr

08:21.400 --> 08:22.400
Hyde kind of thing.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.400
You know what?

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
When I flip out, I'm a C programmer.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.400
Exactly.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.400
Yeah.

08:26.400 --> 08:32.200
I send mean tweets and I write C. Although I didn't tweet, I'm very proud of myself.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.200
Good job.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.520
You know, I mean, uh, and I don't even think I got, did I get a slide?

08:36.520 --> 08:38.440
I don't even think I saw slack rant last night.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.440
No, no.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.440
Wow.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.440
Huh?

08:41.440 --> 08:42.440
Personal growth.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.440
Yeah.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.440
I'm going to miss that mic a little bit.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.440
Not going to lie.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.440
Made for good show content.

08:46.440 --> 08:47.440
Could have missed that guy.

08:47.440 --> 08:48.780
But you know, this works too.

08:48.780 --> 08:49.780
This works too.

08:49.780 --> 08:50.780
We're here.

08:50.780 --> 08:51.780
We are hashing it out on the show.

08:51.780 --> 08:52.780
So I'll take what I can get.

08:52.780 --> 08:58.640
The difference is pounding, uh, Jasmine tea tea, huh?

08:58.640 --> 09:00.080
You know, I'm with Ted lasso on the tea.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.080
It's not for me.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.080
Chase with vodka.

09:02.080 --> 09:06.480
But I've tried, I've tried, you know, I like the idea of a nice steady caffeine drip

09:06.480 --> 09:07.480
all day long.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.080
Cause I just like, I go to the, I go to the max.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.840
Oh, oh, do you know why I'm still standing?

09:12.840 --> 09:13.840
Hmm.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.080
Amazon makes their own energy drinks.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.080
Really?

09:16.080 --> 09:17.080
Like an Amazon basics energy drink.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.080
I swear to God.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.080
Yeah.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.960
I have them in my, in fact, I have one in front of me.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.960
Jesus.

09:21.960 --> 09:22.960
I can't believe they haven't done this before.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.160
It actually makes a lot of sense.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.160
How are they though?

09:25.160 --> 09:26.160
Well, I'm sorry.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.360
Why is there a pink elephant flying by?

09:28.360 --> 09:31.440
Is he got Jeff Bezos face?

09:31.440 --> 09:32.440
What's going on?

09:32.440 --> 09:36.460
I can say this is a more of a medicinal product or definitely not drinking this because you

09:36.460 --> 09:37.760
want to.

09:37.760 --> 09:38.760
But it works.

09:38.760 --> 09:39.760
Yeah.

09:39.760 --> 09:40.760
Okay.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.760
Hmm.

09:41.760 --> 09:42.760
I'll have to look for that.

09:42.760 --> 09:45.000
I mean, if I like take a heart attack tonight, that sucks.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.560
I've only had three of them, so I think I'm okay.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.680
You'd be careful over there.

09:48.680 --> 09:54.160
It's like pulling in, um, pulling in.net packages and then the.net foundation decides that they

09:54.160 --> 09:59.340
hate you and you can't do, Ooh, too much now, you know, I've been wondering how to talk

09:59.340 --> 10:05.280
about this because I don't follow it very closely and I didn't want to like, you know,

10:05.280 --> 10:10.120
we just got done getting everybody upset over workers rights because you and I did not understand

10:10.120 --> 10:13.640
like what a big controversy this is in the actual world of employed people right now

10:13.640 --> 10:15.640
because you and I are out here on the fringes.

10:15.640 --> 10:22.360
I just say literally woke up on the kitchen floor and we just walked right into that one,

10:22.360 --> 10:23.600
like a couple of jackasses.

10:23.600 --> 10:27.720
So I didn't want to do the same thing when it came to this.net stuff because we got emails

10:27.720 --> 10:30.160
into the show and people like, I want to know what you guys think about this and people

10:30.160 --> 10:31.280
seem fired up.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.480
And so I could tell there was a couple of things happening.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.620
First of all, it seemed like there was some questioning of really what the.net foundations

10:38.620 --> 10:42.840
role was and was it really there just to normalize Microsoft's control.

10:42.840 --> 10:43.840
That was a whole issue.

10:43.840 --> 10:48.800
At the same time, there was backlash going on because Microsoft decided to reverse a

10:48.800 --> 10:55.260
feature and then move that feature into the paid version of visual studio and everybody

10:55.260 --> 10:56.260
got really pissed.

10:56.260 --> 10:57.260
Yeah.

10:57.260 --> 10:59.360
So, so, so this is two separate things though, right?

10:59.360 --> 11:00.360
Yeah.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.360
Microsoft.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.840
So I think that one's the easier one to talk about.

11:02.840 --> 11:08.040
It's a live reload of basically Blazor, which is like, I don't know if you've done like

11:08.040 --> 11:12.220
Python ginger or Ruby or be right, sir.

11:12.220 --> 11:17.080
It's the.net equivalent to a templating engine that was going to be on all platforms and

11:17.080 --> 11:19.400
VS code.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.280
And then they decided to not do that.

11:22.280 --> 11:26.360
They said for reasons of time, but then it leaked that it was for strategic reasons.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.360
IE, huh?

11:27.360 --> 11:29.160
We're giving away a great editor.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.560
We also sell an editor that seems bad.

11:31.560 --> 11:37.800
You know, it's also awkward is like names of the business execs that said it'd be better

11:37.800 --> 11:38.800
to withhold this.

11:38.800 --> 11:42.640
Like they're, they, their identities were included in these documents that the community

11:42.640 --> 11:43.640
got.

11:43.640 --> 11:48.360
It's just, well, it's, it's worse that what it was that it was a, I forgot her name, but

11:48.360 --> 11:51.320
it was a woman that woman's boss, right?

11:51.320 --> 11:54.200
The VP above her actually ended up reversing it.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.200
Yeah.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.640
It's like you got publicly overruled.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.640
That's like, Oh geez.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.640
Yeah.

11:59.640 --> 12:00.640
Yeah.

12:00.640 --> 12:04.080
And then Microsoft said, uh, you know, we made a mistake at executing on our decision

12:04.080 --> 12:09.640
and it took longer than expected to respond back to the community translation.

12:09.640 --> 12:10.640
We got caught.

12:10.640 --> 12:11.640
Yeah.

12:11.640 --> 12:15.160
We got caught and then we had an internal debate and then we didn't know how to proceed.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.600
And then finally we got common sense and realized that this wasn't the Hill we wanted to die

12:18.600 --> 12:22.920
on and realized our reputation was being burnt over this and it wasn't going away.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.680
So now we're making a public statement.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.560
Oh boy, that's pretty bad.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.760
Well, the problem is the visual studio business, right?

12:31.760 --> 12:35.680
Visual studio proper doesn't really make sense with the rest of Microsoft right now.

12:35.680 --> 12:39.320
And I know I sound like a madman, but it's a legacy thing, right?

12:39.320 --> 12:42.720
But their whole thing is driving developers to Azure and making money on Azure.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.720
Yeah.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.840
There's no reason to be charging for visual studio.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.960
The simplest way to solve this problem is forget about community professional enterprise.

12:49.960 --> 12:52.120
Just make visual studio free done.

12:52.120 --> 12:58.640
You know, I, I agree and I think Microsoft has done such a good job of transitioning

12:58.640 --> 13:04.120
to the quote unquote cloud era that we don't really tend to pick at the bones of where

13:04.120 --> 13:06.600
they haven't really improved.

13:06.600 --> 13:13.560
And when you look at some of their more traditional, generally on premise focused businesses, they're,

13:13.560 --> 13:17.120
they're still milking those for as much as they can and they don't really want to move

13:17.120 --> 13:18.120
on.

13:18.120 --> 13:24.560
And I think visual studio is the key to that ecosystem that, you know, build it here on

13:24.560 --> 13:30.040
your premises and you run it right here on your intranet and their corporate applications

13:30.040 --> 13:35.360
that need to be maintained or need to be updated for compatibility purposes or need to be converted

13:35.360 --> 13:36.660
for whatever reason.

13:36.660 --> 13:40.700
And that's where they're still selling a bunch of visual studio code, I think.

13:40.700 --> 13:44.980
And so for, to them, to them, it'd be crazy to give it away for free because it's kind

13:44.980 --> 13:48.960
of become an, it's the enterprise product and they don't like giving that stuff away

13:48.960 --> 13:49.960
for free.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.960
There's still very much traditional Microsoft in some of those areas.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.840
No one wants to turn down a check, right?

13:54.840 --> 13:58.380
But the other issue was it was a little fuzzier, right?

13:58.380 --> 14:04.080
They were doing something strange with having to control get hub accounts that were.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.320
Yes, yes.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.720
This is one of the reasons why I didn't really bring it up before because I, I didn't follow

14:09.720 --> 14:16.200
it very well, but I, I guess it was something, it was something, something in that, uh, in

14:16.200 --> 14:17.200
that regard.

14:17.200 --> 14:23.520
But you know, I, I, it's hard to know from the outside if this is a genuine controversy

14:23.520 --> 14:26.560
or if this is a personality conflict.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.840
And this was kind of both.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.800
And it seemed like there was an apology attempt about it.

14:32.800 --> 14:36.560
And that apology was also really taken poorly.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.600
And when you're coming in from the outside and you see all that stuff, it's just sort

14:39.600 --> 14:41.000
of an off put.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.880
And I just didn't really think, I don't want to wade into this drama.

14:43.880 --> 14:48.080
But now in retrospect, I actually kind of regret it because I think there was something

14:48.080 --> 14:52.760
genuinely happening here between Microsoft and the development community.

14:52.760 --> 14:56.040
And the drama aspects of it were just enough that it put me off and I didn't pay attention

14:56.040 --> 14:57.040
to it.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.040
Yeah.

14:58.040 --> 15:02.120
I was also tired of getting yelled at, so I also ignored it, but I do feel we should

15:02.120 --> 15:03.120
have covered it.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.240
And having said that, I'm not sure what the right thing is, right?

15:07.240 --> 15:11.480
Like, you know, I'm getting more and more like granola hippie ish where I feel like

15:11.480 --> 15:16.360
open source things need to be run by nonprofit, you know, five oh one three or five or whatever

15:16.360 --> 15:22.040
it is foundations, not corporations because you're always going to end up in a commercial

15:22.040 --> 15:23.040
conflict.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.040
Yeah.

15:24.040 --> 15:27.480
I mean, look what happened ultimately to sent us, you know, I think that was a, that was

15:27.480 --> 15:31.040
a conflict of the sales department versus the engineering department there internally

15:31.040 --> 15:34.960
at Red Hat based on, you know, what we can kind of piece together.

15:34.960 --> 15:37.880
And then I know someone's going to say, well, there is a.net foundation, but look at who

15:37.880 --> 15:38.880
runs the.net foundation.

15:38.880 --> 15:44.640
Like, look at the board like, okay, can I fry some insane bacon that people are going

15:44.640 --> 15:45.640
to get mad at?

15:45.640 --> 15:49.920
Man, you know, I bring bacon every single week, just in case it's not really a conspiracy

15:49.920 --> 15:51.420
theory at the time.

15:51.420 --> 15:56.200
I would almost argue that anyone who's an MVP or otherwise, if you have been on the

15:56.200 --> 16:02.200
Scott Hanselman show, you should be disqualified from the.net foundation port.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.800
If you are an employee of Microsoft, you should be disqualified.

16:05.800 --> 16:10.900
If you actually think windows is a good operating system, you should be disqualified.

16:10.900 --> 16:13.120
The last one I'm joking, but the first time, serious, right?

16:13.120 --> 16:14.560
No, I think maybe it's good.

16:14.560 --> 16:18.240
I think I like all of them because it's kind of like, like, I love Hanselman.

16:18.240 --> 16:22.280
He's a nice guy, I guess, but they're so in their own world and they're trying to come

16:22.280 --> 16:23.520
into this open source thing.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.560
It's like, no, actually, we're not buttoned up professionals here.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.560
We're assholes.

16:27.560 --> 16:28.560
Yeah.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.720
I mean, we have BSD users and we let them hang around.

16:30.720 --> 16:31.720
They make me sick.

16:31.720 --> 16:34.640
Oh, well, and they're not competing in a Microsoft ecosystem.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.480
They're competing in the greater tech ecosystem.

16:37.480 --> 16:41.840
So that's where I actually think maybe they don't like windows point is actually rather

16:41.840 --> 16:44.520
relevant because you got to get outside the Microsoft echo chamber.

16:44.520 --> 16:45.520
Right.

16:45.520 --> 16:48.400
Like, get Marco Arment there and he's going to say, your code makes me want to cry because

16:48.400 --> 16:49.400
it's so ugly.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.560
I get people who like actively hate.

16:51.560 --> 16:54.920
Yeah, but but then they'll fix the font and he'll be happy.

16:54.920 --> 16:55.920
So it is true.

16:55.920 --> 16:56.920
That's just a problem.

16:56.920 --> 16:57.920
And he's it's Helvetica.

16:57.920 --> 16:58.920
No, I.

16:58.920 --> 17:04.400
Oh, now it's San Francisco on Mac, which is basically that they were tired of paying the

17:04.400 --> 17:05.400
license for her.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.680
But I think your point was taken.

17:07.680 --> 17:13.640
It does seem Miguel de Caza tweeted and he'd know he tweeted that, well, the inspiration

17:13.640 --> 17:19.520
for the foundation was the Gnome Foundation, which I'm not sure, but I think he was saying

17:19.520 --> 17:24.080
that, yeah, it's designed because, you know, Red Hat's a huge influence on Gnome.

17:24.080 --> 17:27.380
And you look at, you know, the contributions to Gnome and the and the foundation and who

17:27.380 --> 17:28.380
runs all that.

17:28.380 --> 17:32.100
And they're either Red Hat employees or, you know, affiliated it.

17:32.100 --> 17:36.180
It feels very much like Red Hat runs the Gnome project, although they would say that's very

17:36.180 --> 17:37.180
much not the case.

17:37.180 --> 17:39.640
And they would dispute and they would say I'm being toxic even saying that.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.360
But you just look at the numbers, right.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.360
And it seems sort of the same for the foundation.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.320
Wait a minute, Chris.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.320
That was inappropriate.

17:47.320 --> 17:52.560
Are you suggesting that people follow their financial incentives?

17:52.560 --> 17:54.080
Leno dot com slash Coder.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.720
Go there to get one hundred dollars in credit.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.920
And of course, you support this here show, but I mean, one hundred dollars in credit

17:58.920 --> 18:01.260
on a new account for 60 days.

18:01.260 --> 18:02.260
That's a bold statement.

18:02.260 --> 18:06.340
If you think about it, think about that from a business standpoint, like when you're coming

18:06.340 --> 18:10.640
up with that offering, what are you really saying as a business?

18:10.640 --> 18:12.640
It means you believe in your product, right?

18:12.640 --> 18:14.700
It means you believe your product will speak for itself.

18:14.700 --> 18:18.080
And if you give someone one hundred dollars, they can actually really try it for more than

18:18.080 --> 18:19.080
just a hot minute.

18:19.080 --> 18:22.000
I mean, that's really what it is.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.080
And I think that's a bold statement and one that I find appealing.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.040
You know, I've used Linode for a couple of years, but I have friends that have used Linode

18:29.040 --> 18:30.040
for over a decade.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.500
They've been around since two thousand and three.

18:32.500 --> 18:37.620
They use Linux for stuff way before anybody thinks you can use Linux for that stuff.

18:37.620 --> 18:41.880
This is something you come across if you do any kind of like research on the note like

18:41.880 --> 18:44.280
I have because I check out all of our sponsors.

18:44.280 --> 18:45.280
Right.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.400
And I did some I did some reading like Linode.

18:47.400 --> 18:51.280
First of all, they were the first to really figure out where user mode Linux was going.

18:51.280 --> 18:55.040
They were the first to really figure out that using a bunch of Apache virtual hosts was

18:55.040 --> 18:59.480
only going to scale so far and that there were new features in the kernel that could

18:59.480 --> 19:00.880
really change the game.

19:00.880 --> 19:05.600
And they saw how you could run multiple secure machines on one piece of powerful hardware

19:05.600 --> 19:07.880
way before AWS even existed.

19:07.880 --> 19:11.400
But what's great about Linode is they've really kept it interesting.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.800
They've really innovated all along because they're so passionate about this.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.340
You know, when you really get into something because you care about it, you put everything

19:17.340 --> 19:18.340
into it.

19:18.340 --> 19:21.120
That's why they have the best customer service out there.

19:21.120 --> 19:26.280
That's why they have such a comprehensive marketplace for easy deployment of great open

19:26.280 --> 19:27.940
source projects.

19:27.940 --> 19:32.120
And it's not just like the standard checklist of course, they have those like your next

19:32.120 --> 19:35.620
clouds and whatnot, but it's because they also really know this stuff.

19:35.620 --> 19:38.680
So they have some really good ones that when you see them and they're like, oh, that is

19:38.680 --> 19:39.680
a great idea.

19:39.680 --> 19:40.680
Maybe I should.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.680
Maybe I should do that.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.680
I mean, that's what's so great.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.160
Going back to that hundred dollars is you can try this stuff.

19:45.160 --> 19:50.620
I'm out on the road right now and I rely heavily on Linode as an intermediate infrastructure

19:50.620 --> 19:54.200
between the studio and my RV.

19:54.200 --> 19:59.120
I can move things up to Linode and then push them down at the RV at the pace the RV's connection

19:59.120 --> 20:00.940
is capable of handling.

20:00.940 --> 20:02.700
That is so, so handy.

20:02.700 --> 20:06.680
And it's just one of the many ways that it's sort of like, it's like it honestly is like

20:06.680 --> 20:10.300
Linode is the moons that orbit Jupiter.

20:10.300 --> 20:15.280
And they're, they're supplying our infrastructure from orbit.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.780
That's honestly how we look at it.

20:16.780 --> 20:21.040
And I, I've, I consider them an integral part of our business and I think you'd be really

20:21.040 --> 20:23.660
comfortable and I think you'd be really impressed if you did too.

20:23.660 --> 20:26.960
Or if you're just setting up a project for friends and family, or maybe you already have

20:26.960 --> 20:30.920
like a lot in one cloud provider and you're feeling like that's a big risk and you want

20:30.920 --> 20:34.120
to go something that's a little more spread out, you know, go with a multi-cloud approach

20:34.120 --> 20:36.640
and don't put all your eggs in one basket.

20:36.640 --> 20:40.880
Linode is also great for that because their pricing is 30 to 50% cheaper than the other

20:40.880 --> 20:43.120
major hypervisors out there.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.480
Just go try them out.

20:44.480 --> 20:48.880
They're just a great, great set of offerings that all come together to make it the best

20:48.880 --> 20:51.000
place to run anything that runs on Linux.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.680
Yeah, you can run it on Linode.

20:52.680 --> 20:58.000
So go to linode.com slash coder, get $100 on a new account for 60 days and you support

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
the show.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.160
Linode.com slash coder.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.040
I know this got your attention.

21:05.040 --> 21:11.960
Microsoft is officially, unofficially deprecating UWP or the Universal Windows platform.

21:11.960 --> 21:12.960
Mmm.

21:12.960 --> 21:13.960
Madre Forgers.

21:13.960 --> 21:18.560
It's like, you know, Microsoft has been so cagey about this the entire time.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.600
They didn't say it's retired.

21:19.600 --> 21:20.800
They didn't say it's deprecated.

21:20.800 --> 21:26.400
They said, quote, it will only receive bug reliability and security fixes.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.000
No new features.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.120
But it didn't actually say it was deprecated.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.640
So this is not about UWP.

21:31.640 --> 21:32.860
This is about Windows Phone.

21:32.860 --> 21:34.600
And I need a Deckard Kane.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.000
Stay a while and listen.

21:37.000 --> 21:44.400
Long ago, in a galaxy called New Jersey, I thought it was a good idea to make a significant

21:44.400 --> 21:49.820
for me at the time investment in Windows Phone development.

21:49.820 --> 21:51.880
If it sounds like I'm crying, it's because I am.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.840
Chris, how would you say that went?

21:53.840 --> 21:54.840
Pretty badly, Mike.

21:54.840 --> 21:55.840
Pretty badly.

21:55.840 --> 21:56.840
That's what I'd say.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.240
I'd say you made a big bet.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.680
You got some good hardware.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.800
You had some good concepts for apps.

22:01.800 --> 22:05.720
And then just as you got rolling, Microsoft pulled the rug out from underneath you and

22:05.720 --> 22:07.720
sent you tumbling.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.280
Actually, we can't sell these.

22:10.280 --> 22:11.280
Yeah.

22:11.280 --> 22:12.280
So, yeah.

22:12.280 --> 22:18.020
The worst part is my wife at the time, her job was selling them.

22:18.020 --> 22:20.040
She worked for Microsoft.

22:20.040 --> 22:25.080
I should have known when she came home every night was like, damn, I can't sell these phones.

22:25.080 --> 22:28.200
That may be not the best choice.

22:28.200 --> 22:31.280
Could have been an indicator, you know, a data point, perhaps.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.280
Could have been.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.240
But I was insane.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.240
So I'm sorry.

22:35.240 --> 22:38.200
Every time I think about Windows Phone, I like it destroys my mind.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.200
I know.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.000
Because it was such a good system.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.060
It's like WebOS.

22:43.060 --> 22:44.860
It's so good.

22:44.860 --> 22:46.920
But it was too good for the world.

22:46.920 --> 22:51.040
Well, a lot of the a lot of the visual cues that we now just take for granted, like things

22:51.040 --> 22:54.600
that indicate there's a little more content to the left or the right or to the bottom

22:54.600 --> 22:55.600
of the screen.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.600
That was them.

22:56.600 --> 22:57.600
They came up with that.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.300
The whole flat trend.

22:59.300 --> 23:00.800
They started the flat trend again.

23:00.800 --> 23:01.800
Exactly.

23:01.800 --> 23:05.400
All the in the advanced notifications and what is it, Android 47, whatever the new one

23:05.400 --> 23:06.400
is.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.400
You mean Android NSA edition?

23:07.400 --> 23:08.400
Yeah.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.400
Yeah.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.400
OK.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.400
Oh, hang on.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.400
Hang on, Chris.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.400
Oh, oh, Mr. Chaney.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.400
Yeah.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.400
No, I know.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.400
He said it.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.400
What?

23:17.400 --> 23:18.400
Right.

23:18.400 --> 23:19.400
Right.

23:19.400 --> 23:20.400
No, you got to watch out.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.400
He's a jackass.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.160
Reminds me of better days, Brock, when we were together and I was losing tents.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.160
Simpler times.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.160
Yes.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.160
Anyway.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.160
Times.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.160
UWP.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.160
I was trying to figure out the same framework about seven times, so I'm trying to figure

23:31.160 --> 23:33.720
out how to get to UWP.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.380
So it was Windows phone seven.

23:35.380 --> 23:36.720
It was Silverlight, right?

23:36.720 --> 23:39.960
And then it was Metro?

23:39.960 --> 23:40.960
Was Metro after Silverlight?

23:40.960 --> 23:41.960
Yep.

23:41.960 --> 23:42.960
Metro.

23:42.960 --> 23:45.760
And then they even called it Project Reunion for a short period of time.

23:45.760 --> 23:46.760
No, Reunion's new.

23:46.760 --> 23:47.760
Reunion's the.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.160
I thought it was a code name for it.

23:49.160 --> 23:52.160
But Reunion's the new Windows app SDK, isn't it?

23:52.160 --> 23:53.160
That's what it is.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.040
No, because there was a whole Stephen Sanosky thing that everybody's going to rewrite their

23:55.040 --> 23:56.040
stuff in C++.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.040
Yes.

23:57.040 --> 24:01.560
I think that was just like Windows SDK, which is weird because that's the current name now.

24:01.560 --> 24:02.560
Right.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.560
Right.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.560
They do that sometimes.

24:04.560 --> 24:05.560
I know.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.360
You all can Google this.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.360
They really do.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.920
We'll have a link in the show notes for it.

24:09.920 --> 24:14.440
But point being, this is not the first, and frankly nor will it be the last time that

24:14.440 --> 24:18.920
something that is UWP will be deprecated.

24:18.920 --> 24:22.080
And I personally hate them.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.560
I don't know what to say.

24:24.560 --> 24:29.400
It was such a good idea, Windows Phone, executed so poorly.

24:29.400 --> 24:37.600
UWP was a good idea, but they just couldn't make it work because no one is buying apps

24:37.600 --> 24:40.920
on Windows that aren't like enterprise, you know, call me sales guy apps.

24:40.920 --> 24:42.000
That's it.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.320
They lost their market opportunity to make that move.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.460
It was too little too late.

24:46.460 --> 24:47.460
Damn shame though.

24:47.460 --> 24:48.460
Really is a damn shame.

24:48.460 --> 24:50.600
Do they make it up for you with Visual Studio Code?

24:50.600 --> 24:56.120
I know that you were keen to see VSCode.dev light up in this last week, and it's as you

24:56.120 --> 24:57.120
would expect.

24:57.120 --> 25:02.000
It's a full, well, a fairly full web edition of VSCode in the browser.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.880
You can open up local files, though.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.460
So it's kind of just like VSCode since it's an electron app.

25:06.460 --> 25:07.460
But now it's in the browser.

25:07.460 --> 25:10.140
It does have a few limits because of that.

25:10.140 --> 25:11.560
But what do you think of this?

25:11.560 --> 25:15.600
Now as someone who, you know, often gives away Thalios to students learning STEM, I

25:15.600 --> 25:16.600
think this is great.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.560
That's a good point.

25:18.560 --> 25:22.040
My kids are so web app first now, I think because of the Chromebooks, like when they

25:22.040 --> 25:27.040
want to edit a video or edit a photo, they go to Google and they search for web apps

25:27.040 --> 25:28.040
to do it.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.040
Wait, your kid's school has Chromebooks too?

25:29.040 --> 25:30.040
Oh, yeah.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.040
It's funny.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.040
Yeah.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.160
My son, it's they're like, he thinks Chrome is the OS.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.160
Mm hmm.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.160
Yeah, they all have them.

25:36.160 --> 25:40.440
He also asked me for a guy Fox Max, so I was concerned.

25:40.440 --> 25:43.720
And even on their on their laptops at home, now they've asked for Chrome because that's

25:43.720 --> 25:45.960
what they're used to using at school.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.240
And you know, they get pretty impressive results from some of these web apps.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.320
The school teaches them like the video editing app and stuff like that.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.880
So VS code dev kind of does fit right in with that world.

25:54.880 --> 25:55.880
I haven't thought about that.

25:55.880 --> 25:56.880
Yeah, it makes a ton of sense to me.

25:56.880 --> 26:00.680
I mean, VS code is really just like a node JS electron app, right?

26:00.680 --> 26:01.960
So you could run a VS code server.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.160
In fact, that's been possible for a long time.

26:04.160 --> 26:07.640
But the difference here is this is hosted by Microsoft on their infrastructure, and

26:07.640 --> 26:08.640
it's quick.

26:08.640 --> 26:09.640
It's snappy.

26:09.640 --> 26:10.640
And they're updating it directly.

26:10.640 --> 26:11.640
Right.

26:11.640 --> 26:15.680
So what they're going to do is let me run a bunch of code on it and delete it.

26:15.680 --> 26:16.680
I'm still mad, guys.

26:16.680 --> 26:17.880
I'm still mad.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.480
Windows phone eight was great.

26:19.480 --> 26:22.400
You know what works great is their integration with GitHub now.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.560
So you can be a GitHub and you can be on a repo.

26:24.560 --> 26:28.360
And if you hit the period, I think it's just you hit period on your on your keyboard.

26:28.360 --> 26:33.520
It opens up that repo in GitHub and you're instantly editing the files inside VS code.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.520
And of course, it's because the extensions went out.

26:35.520 --> 26:36.520
It knows the language.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.800
Yeah, it's great.

26:38.800 --> 26:43.920
You know what I've done is on my home assistant box here in my RV, I've set up a VS code web

26:43.920 --> 26:44.920
instance.

26:44.920 --> 26:48.920
I have a local VS code editor running on my Raspberry Pi that I can just fire up from

26:48.920 --> 26:53.080
any computer with a bookmark, you know, from tablet to from a desktop machine.

26:53.080 --> 26:58.640
And I find that super useful because I can edit stuff directly on my file server using

26:58.640 --> 26:59.720
that.

26:59.720 --> 27:00.720
Very handy.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.480
But the one that Microsoft set up here lets you access things on the local machine just

27:04.480 --> 27:06.440
using the file system access API.

27:06.440 --> 27:09.600
So you have to have a browser that supports the file system access API.

27:09.600 --> 27:10.760
But most do.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.720
There are some things that won't work.

27:13.720 --> 27:16.800
The terminal and the debugger are not going to work, obviously.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.800
It's a lightweight version.

27:17.800 --> 27:18.800
Not quite.

27:18.800 --> 27:19.800
Everything's there.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.680
Microsoft breaks it out into good, better and best.

27:22.680 --> 27:28.640
They say that obviously things that just detect the language type and can do text completion,

27:28.640 --> 27:29.880
that's going to work good.

27:29.880 --> 27:33.560
Your better experience is going to be your TypeScript, your JavaScript and your Python.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.680
That's going to be your better experience.

27:35.680 --> 27:39.800
And your best experience in VS code for the web, surprise, surprise, is what they call

27:39.800 --> 27:45.960
quote, webby languages, such as JSON, HTML, CSS and all that kind of stuff makes a ton

27:45.960 --> 27:46.960
of sense, right?

27:46.960 --> 27:47.960
Yeah.

27:47.960 --> 27:51.800
In that case, it's going to be it's going to be exactly as identical to the desktop as

27:51.800 --> 27:55.000
it gets using VS code dot dev.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.400
What they take, they give us.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.400
You feel better now?

27:57.400 --> 28:03.400
I'm still pissed.

28:03.400 --> 28:07.920
This episode is brought to you by Datadog, the monitoring security platform for developers,

28:07.920 --> 28:11.840
security professionals, operation teams and anyone that's working in the cloud age.

28:11.840 --> 28:16.720
Unify your metrics, your traces and logs all in one place and troubleshoot issues faster

28:16.720 --> 28:21.320
and break down silos and communicate better between teams with Datadog.

28:21.320 --> 28:24.280
They have incredible, beautiful real time dashboards.

28:24.280 --> 28:28.720
Go to Datadog dot com slash Coda Radio, not only for the trial, but also so you can just

28:28.720 --> 28:31.480
see these beautiful real time dashboards.

28:31.480 --> 28:35.740
And you can plug in over 450 technologies you probably already have in your business.

28:35.740 --> 28:41.480
You can easily pivot from a high level overview of your entire environment.

28:41.480 --> 28:46.160
Right down to a granular level, individual metrics and events.

28:46.160 --> 28:51.080
They offer infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, security monitoring,

28:51.080 --> 28:54.920
real time user monitoring and so much more in one place.

28:54.920 --> 28:57.120
So go get started with a free Datadog trial.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.880
Go to Datadog dot com slash Coda Radio.

28:59.880 --> 29:04.760
Go see why thousands of companies and hundreds of Coda Radio listeners are using Datadog

29:04.760 --> 29:06.700
as their monitoring solution.

29:06.700 --> 29:10.160
If you start a free trial and you create one dashboard, well, Datadog will also send you

29:10.160 --> 29:13.160
a free t-shirt and I could use one of those right now.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.520
There's no washer and dryer out in the woods.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.860
Free stuff's always great and a trial's even better.

29:17.860 --> 29:20.120
Go see why Datadog is so darn great.

29:20.120 --> 29:23.320
Go to Datadog dot com slash Coda Radio.

29:23.320 --> 29:28.200
A little bit of Apple stuff before we get out of here.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.480
Just the tip.

29:29.480 --> 29:33.320
So WWDC must be dead because Apple has announced tech talks.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.800
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.800
I think this is this is Apple getting ahead of the sandwich.

29:38.800 --> 29:39.800
Seriously?

29:39.800 --> 29:40.800
Oh, I do.

29:40.800 --> 29:41.800
Yeah, yeah.

29:41.800 --> 29:42.800
Oh, I agree.

29:42.800 --> 29:47.040
Developers can now interface with Apple experts in virtual sessions that happen on October

29:47.040 --> 29:49.360
25th to December 17th.

29:49.360 --> 29:54.400
Developers can register for office hours and get 30 minutes with a developer and get app

29:54.400 --> 29:57.560
improvement ideas, design revisions and even help with bug fixes.

29:57.560 --> 30:02.680
This is Apple trying to make up for what people paid two thousand dollars to go to WWDC for

30:02.680 --> 30:05.600
was the chance to talk to an Apple developer after a session.

30:05.600 --> 30:09.520
Now they're doing tech talks with Apple experts and they're going to move this to a one on

30:09.520 --> 30:12.920
one guidance kind of thing that you can schedule virtually.

30:12.920 --> 30:15.240
And they're going to do these every now and then.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.720
And I think they're going to eliminate the developers coming to WWDC and now it's just

30:18.720 --> 30:21.360
going to be Apple in the press in the future.

30:21.360 --> 30:25.500
So are you saying that they're going to never have an in-person WWDC or are you saying there's

30:25.500 --> 30:27.540
not going to be any WWDC?

30:27.540 --> 30:29.360
I'm saying there's going to be a WWDC.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.360
It's just you ain't invited.

30:30.360 --> 30:33.240
It's just going to be the press and the mucky mucks.

30:33.240 --> 30:38.000
You know, it's going to be maybe the developers they're featuring up on stage because I think

30:38.000 --> 30:42.560
what they're going to do is a hybrid event going forward, mostly produced with a few

30:42.560 --> 30:47.000
hands on things and then a press area and they'll have an expanded press area so the

30:47.000 --> 30:49.600
YouTubers can do their vlogs.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.440
But developers, you're getting these virtual events.

30:51.440 --> 30:52.440
You're out.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.440
We say that with such disdain.

30:53.440 --> 30:57.000
They can't be having three thousand developers there all in all and just what are they going

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
to do?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
It just doesn't scale anyways.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.680
WWDC is not just about talking to an Apple engineer and getting help.

31:02.680 --> 31:05.560
It's a, I mean, it's a social event, right?

31:05.560 --> 31:07.560
It's like, yeah, it's like everybody.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.560
It's our annual cotillion.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.560
I don't know.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.560
I think you're absolutely right.

31:10.560 --> 31:11.560
It's huge.

31:11.560 --> 31:14.320
If you look at the Apple press.

31:14.320 --> 31:17.920
They all know each other because they see each other at WWDC and that's how they've

31:17.920 --> 31:18.920
all networked.

31:18.920 --> 31:24.600
It's been absolutely critical to Apple forming a community with these representatives and

31:24.600 --> 31:26.120
thought leaders in that community.

31:26.120 --> 31:32.160
I mean, it's been huge and it will be not good for the Apple community.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.840
Somebody will probably come along and offer an event, but it's not going to be the same.

31:34.840 --> 31:36.280
We've seen this happen before.

31:36.280 --> 31:39.160
You know, Macworld, Apple used to be involved and they pulled out.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.400
It's not unusual for Apple to do this.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.400
More I think about it, the more I think you might be right.

31:43.400 --> 31:44.680
But it'd be a loss.

31:44.680 --> 31:45.680
It's disappointing, right?

31:45.680 --> 31:49.320
To see all these community events, not just Apple ones, but all of them having suffered

31:49.320 --> 31:50.320
so much.

31:50.320 --> 31:58.000
My only thought on that is when you can't pro and con human interaction, like, you know,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.920
I have a different connection with Optimus Graves in the chat room right now because

32:00.920 --> 32:02.800
I've met him in person now.

32:02.800 --> 32:06.940
I will always think of that now when I see him show up in the chat room and it until

32:06.940 --> 32:12.040
you've had the experience that I've had where you take virtual only relationships and convert

32:12.040 --> 32:18.680
them into person relationships and you do that for years, then you start to go, oh,

32:18.680 --> 32:21.440
this is actually the most important and most valuable thing I do.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.280
I thought it was having a booth and giving a good talk.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.280
And you know, when I go to these events, it's not.

32:27.280 --> 32:31.240
And I had to come all the way around on the issue because I went into it like the people

32:31.240 --> 32:34.640
that say the hall track is the most important thing in the networking.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.400
That's a bunch of lazy people who don't want to go learn in sessions.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.400
That's who they are.

32:38.400 --> 32:41.320
And they're wasting their, they're wasting their money, you know, their company money

32:41.320 --> 32:42.320
or whatever.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.420
I seriously was that guy when I started going.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.360
And by the end of it, I was completely on the other end of it.

32:46.360 --> 32:49.280
I was like, wow, it's the most important thing I do is go out to lunch with the audience.

32:49.280 --> 32:54.180
And the most important thing I do is, you know, I've met a lot of the hosts at events

32:54.180 --> 32:55.180
and just stuff like that.

32:55.180 --> 32:57.420
Then it's just been absolutely critical.

32:57.420 --> 33:01.240
And I think until you've experienced that a few times, you don't realize it because

33:01.240 --> 33:02.860
it's, it's ephemeral.

33:02.860 --> 33:04.560
It's not something that could be on a pro and con list.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.980
And it varies a little bit for each person and each individual.

33:07.980 --> 33:11.080
And so it's so easy to say, well, coronavirus is dangerous.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.920
Therefore we should do this or it's cheaper to do this.

33:13.920 --> 33:17.000
But man, we are missing out.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.680
And I think we don't interact as well with people and we don't give people as much grace

33:21.680 --> 33:26.900
and leeway when they're having a bad day, when we only interact with them online.

33:26.900 --> 33:30.000
But when you've worked with them in person or you know them for a little while in person

33:30.000 --> 33:34.160
and you've seen them have a bad day in person, when they're having a bad day over Slack or

33:34.160 --> 33:39.160
telegram, you're able to be more generous because they're an actualized person in your

33:39.160 --> 33:40.160
mind.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.160
Yeah.

33:41.160 --> 33:42.920
So I've always been like the hall of track is the most important, right?

33:42.920 --> 33:43.920
Yeah.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.320
You've known all, you figured out way before I did.

33:45.320 --> 33:46.320
Wow.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.320
But it also makes sense, right?

33:47.320 --> 33:49.360
Cause I'm trying to sell, you know, software or whatever, right?

33:49.360 --> 33:50.360
Right.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.360
Yeah.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.360
You were going, exactly.

33:52.360 --> 33:54.760
You were going into sales and I'm, I was going at it from, I need to absorb as much information

33:54.760 --> 33:57.680
as possible to relay it in a podcast.

33:57.680 --> 34:03.360
Sorry to be so negative folks, but I'm worried that we will just have permanently lost a

34:03.360 --> 34:05.400
bunch of community events because of COVID.

34:05.400 --> 34:06.400
Yeah.

34:06.400 --> 34:11.160
It, it seemed like it's going to happen now that it's gone on for so long.

34:11.160 --> 34:14.120
Really and I know the big ones are great, right?

34:14.120 --> 34:20.040
WWC, Linux Northwest, but I actually tend to enjoy the smaller local ones where it's

34:20.040 --> 34:25.720
like folks that you might actually like, I mean, Tampa is not tiny, but all right.

34:25.720 --> 34:26.720
So make fun of me.

34:26.720 --> 34:27.720
All you want.

34:27.720 --> 34:28.720
I love the stress.

34:28.720 --> 34:29.720
It's our local theater.

34:29.720 --> 34:32.520
Like it's, there's a small chance you'd run into them, right?

34:32.520 --> 34:36.360
Going out with their spouse or whatever at the theater that you were just at a tech conference

34:36.360 --> 34:37.360
with.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.760
And if the conference is only, let's say a hundred, 200 people, it's not like a giant

34:40.760 --> 34:42.040
thing.

34:42.040 --> 34:46.320
Those are, I like those a lot, they're not as well produced and the food sucks and all

34:46.320 --> 34:49.960
this kind of stuff, but they don't have like all the art in the hallways and the banners

34:49.960 --> 34:50.960
and stuff.

34:50.960 --> 34:51.960
Yeah.

34:51.960 --> 34:52.960
They don't have a band.

34:52.960 --> 34:57.120
Like Shakira is not coming telling you that he's still alive, but totally that's a, that's

34:57.120 --> 35:01.580
a Silicon Valley reference for anybody who knows it, I don't know.

35:01.580 --> 35:05.520
It's just like, you know what, like there's a company called source code in Tampa.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.240
I used to see those dudes all the time.

35:08.240 --> 35:12.280
I haven't seen them in a year and a half, two years now cause there's no events, right?

35:12.280 --> 35:14.600
We're all like holed up in our little caves.

35:14.600 --> 35:18.120
You know, doing the Linux events, I've, I've attended events that are 30 people and I've

35:18.120 --> 35:21.080
done events that are, you know, 20,000 people.

35:21.080 --> 35:24.320
And I mean that like some of the, some of the larger corporate events that are down

35:24.320 --> 35:28.400
in Vegas or on the East coast, um, like I've never been to some of those, but those are

35:28.400 --> 35:30.160
even huge, like bigger, right?

35:30.160 --> 35:31.160
Larger events.

35:31.160 --> 35:36.920
And so it really scales, but I think we all kind of know this humans don't work very well

35:36.920 --> 35:41.240
at that scale, like when you're that big, everybody just becomes just another anonymous

35:41.240 --> 35:43.240
face, just one of the mini in the crowd.

35:43.240 --> 35:48.720
But when you're at an event that's between 230 people, you have 200 and maybe even 10

35:48.720 --> 35:54.200
people like in that range, that's enough where your brain can actually individualize each

35:54.200 --> 36:00.180
person and, and actually like make some connections and it's a better event because of that.

36:00.180 --> 36:02.720
And plus people are better in smaller groups.

36:02.720 --> 36:03.720
There's that too.

36:03.720 --> 36:04.720
People behave better.

36:04.720 --> 36:07.160
Yep, they're more accountable in a smaller group.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.800
So all of those things are part of the social dynamic as well.

36:09.800 --> 36:14.560
They're more willing to afford someone grace if they're like having a bad time and just

36:14.560 --> 36:15.560
dunking on them.

36:15.560 --> 36:16.560
Yeah.

36:16.560 --> 36:20.620
So, um, I think it's kind of unfortunate, but this is of course, Apple's made no announcement,

36:20.620 --> 36:25.500
but if I were Apple and I were going to wind down developers at WWDC, the way I would do

36:25.500 --> 36:32.080
it is by getting out ahead of it by launching these tech talks, I know, and it would be,

36:32.080 --> 36:36.580
you know, maybe for the better because you really want to pay $2,500 every year to maybe

36:36.580 --> 36:40.800
get a chance to talk to a presenter when you could just schedule something and have it

36:40.800 --> 36:41.800
on your calendar.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.680
See, I think that's a bad argument, right?

36:43.680 --> 36:46.680
That's yes, WWDC is ridiculous.

36:46.680 --> 36:53.160
The ticket price is nuts, but people mimic WWDC, even people who would say they don't,

36:53.160 --> 36:54.160
they do.

36:54.160 --> 36:55.160
Oh yeah.

36:55.160 --> 36:56.160
Look at Google IO.

36:56.160 --> 37:01.400
If WWDC and Google IO go this way, like for instance, you know what?

37:01.400 --> 37:03.920
I have never been to WWDC.

37:03.920 --> 37:04.920
Every year I got a ticket.

37:04.920 --> 37:05.920
I couldn't go.

37:05.920 --> 37:06.920
Every year I wanted to go.

37:06.920 --> 37:07.920
I couldn't get a ticket.

37:07.920 --> 37:12.600
So it was like, yeah, but like all conf is nice, which is like the folks who didn't get

37:12.600 --> 37:15.000
a ticket, but it runs in parallel.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Well, and yeah.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.160
And to your point, there's still networking benefits to going, even if you don't attend

37:19.160 --> 37:21.920
the actual WWDC event itself.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.080
I was talking about this last week.

37:23.080 --> 37:27.240
Wasn't I a Florida developer conference of Florida, Florida dev conf?

37:27.240 --> 37:28.800
I don't, I think it's done.

37:28.800 --> 37:31.520
I mean, I tried to reach out and say, Hey, what's going on?

37:31.520 --> 37:32.520
You know?

37:32.520 --> 37:33.520
Yeah.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.620
But you know, I was literally going to have TMB sponsor it.

37:36.620 --> 37:37.980
No one's responding.

37:37.980 --> 37:42.840
It seems like it's not happening because of COVID, but that was like the, I, the ideal

37:42.840 --> 37:44.560
relatively small conference.

37:44.560 --> 37:45.560
It was in Disney world.

37:45.560 --> 37:46.560
So that's great.

37:46.560 --> 37:47.560
Bring the kid, right?

37:47.560 --> 37:52.640
Bring everybody, you know, yeah, how it is because mom or dad, whoever was, it's, it's,

37:52.640 --> 37:54.280
it's a family event and a business event.

37:54.280 --> 37:55.280
Yeah.

37:55.280 --> 37:56.280
Those are nice actually.

37:56.280 --> 37:57.280
Right.

37:57.280 --> 38:00.360
So like, you know, with the moms and dads where the tech people will go to the conference

38:00.360 --> 38:04.560
and hang out in the contemporary hotel, that's where the conference was hosted.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.640
And the other parent would be like with the kid, right?

38:07.640 --> 38:10.840
Like in, in, I don't know, Narnia animal kingdom.

38:10.840 --> 38:14.480
I'm not super up on Disney, but it was always the same.

38:14.480 --> 38:18.840
Like I've, I've been down here so long, like I'd recognize, Oh, Hey, there's the big companies,

38:18.840 --> 38:21.080
but Oh, source toots here.

38:21.080 --> 38:25.120
Oh, you know, the guys from Orlando are here, right?

38:25.120 --> 38:26.120
They just changed their name.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.120
I don't remember.

38:27.120 --> 38:32.120
They're the guys who made rails for zombies, but they have a different name now, but it

38:32.120 --> 38:33.120
doesn't matter.

38:33.120 --> 38:37.800
I feel like we're going to lose something if we don't have these in person events.

38:37.800 --> 38:40.920
Maybe we'll be lucky and it's not a reduction.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.920
Maybe it's an expansion.

38:41.920 --> 38:45.140
Maybe it's this plus WWDC, but we'll find out.

38:45.140 --> 38:46.440
And then others, like you say, we'll follow.

38:46.440 --> 38:50.440
And that's also why it matters because it really will have a ramifications beyond just

38:50.440 --> 38:51.820
Apple.

38:51.820 --> 38:58.840
But before we get off of Apple, um, the reviews have landed today as we record of the Mac

38:58.840 --> 39:04.120
book pro M one pro and M one max, we're starting to see impressions of people that have them

39:04.120 --> 39:08.360
for about a week and more, and maybe we can change.

39:08.360 --> 39:11.840
And I think you've, uh, you've had a bit of an internal struggle on this one.

39:11.840 --> 39:16.000
I've seen several orders go by in slack and I don't know if any of them still stand.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
So last week you said, no, I don't think I'm going to do this, but then you started reading

39:20.000 --> 39:22.680
the reviews and hearing the impressions and I think you changed your mind.

39:22.680 --> 39:24.040
So where are you now?

39:24.040 --> 39:25.040
Are you going to get one?

39:25.040 --> 39:26.040
Did you get one?

39:26.040 --> 39:27.040
What's happening?

39:27.040 --> 39:29.760
I ordered a 16 inch M one pro.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.320
Oh, and then canceled it.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.320
Okay.

39:33.320 --> 39:36.480
I then ordered a 14 inch M one max, right?

39:36.480 --> 39:39.360
With 64 gigs of Ram who?

39:39.360 --> 39:40.360
And then canceled it.

39:40.360 --> 39:47.000
Oh, I am pleased to say I am not getting one of these.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Okay.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.080
You've come to a decision again.

39:49.080 --> 39:50.080
For now.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.080
Okay.

39:51.080 --> 39:52.080
Let's be honest.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.080
I can't be trusted.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.760
I tell you, it'd be a no brainer if they'd announced a desktop.

39:54.760 --> 40:00.480
So you know, when Apple announced the M ones, it feels like it was forever ago.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.720
You know, you asked me then if I was going to get one and I said, no, I'm going to wait.

40:03.720 --> 40:04.720
16 gigs is not enough.

40:04.720 --> 40:09.760
Bram, that was a hard limit for me on the Mac book pro back in the butterfly keyboard

40:09.760 --> 40:10.760
days.

40:10.760 --> 40:13.340
I just, I need more than 16 gigs of Ram.

40:13.340 --> 40:14.340
Can't do it.

40:14.340 --> 40:15.340
Hard pass.

40:15.340 --> 40:18.640
But I knew that Apple was going to address that.

40:18.640 --> 40:21.520
So I said, okay, let's start setting aside some money now.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.480
I want, you know, I want to be ready in case they announced something.

40:24.480 --> 40:28.920
I want to buy, especially if they announced a desktop and you know, I hate talking about

40:28.920 --> 40:31.920
this stuff because people, people get weird when I spend money.

40:31.920 --> 40:35.680
So I want, you know, I, I was very careful about this because I knew if I bought an Apple

40:35.680 --> 40:40.640
product, it was going to be a big deal for some people and I, you know, kind of upset

40:40.640 --> 40:41.640
a couple of people.

40:41.640 --> 40:46.760
So I wanted to be, I wanted to be measured, save my pennies for a while and watch to see

40:46.760 --> 40:49.240
what they had.

40:49.240 --> 41:00.000
And I've decided to pull the trigger on a 16 inch, 64 gigabytes of Ram max with two

41:00.000 --> 41:02.600
terabytes of storage.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.440
And um, I think that's it.

41:04.440 --> 41:08.520
I think that's the only changes I've made and that'll be on its way.

41:08.520 --> 41:12.440
And um, we're going to, I, you know, I've waited, I've waited this entire time to see

41:12.440 --> 41:17.160
what it's like, but I'm pretty impressed with what Apple announced, and so I've decided

41:17.160 --> 41:18.840
to go all in and pick one up.

41:18.840 --> 41:21.640
I don't know what the Linux compatibility story is going to be or anything.

41:21.640 --> 41:26.400
Um, and of course it's not my only machine, I still, I'm going to keep my ThinkPad and

41:26.400 --> 41:29.080
I still have my desktop, so we'll see.

41:29.080 --> 41:33.120
I'm going to just essentially add it to the arsenal and see if it becomes my primary daily

41:33.120 --> 41:34.120
driver.

41:34.120 --> 41:37.120
I'm going to be very interested to see what the virtualization story is.

41:37.120 --> 41:43.320
I will add to this that one of the deciding factors was that I got a chance to try out

41:43.320 --> 41:51.600
an M1 Mac mini and I installed a virtualization software on there and loaded up Fedora 35

41:51.600 --> 41:54.960
in that VM and full screened it.

41:54.960 --> 42:03.040
And it was so fast, I could not, would not be able to tell you I was in a VM and I'm

42:03.040 --> 42:06.960
using Wayland with 3d acceleration and you just would not know.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.160
It worked.

42:08.160 --> 42:12.940
It's the, it was the fastest virtualization experience I have ever had on a computer.

42:12.940 --> 42:19.080
And so if it was that good on an M1, I can only imagine how good it'll be on an M1 Max

42:19.080 --> 42:21.380
with a lot more RAM given to it.

42:21.380 --> 42:25.960
So I think it's going to be a pretty good situation that way, that ways, and that's,

42:25.960 --> 42:29.080
that's a big, that's a, that was why I wanted more RAM to begin with is for virtualization

42:29.080 --> 42:30.080
and containers.

42:30.080 --> 42:33.920
So I'm going to pull the trigger and I'm going to get one and it's been ordered, should be

42:33.920 --> 42:38.040
here like at the end of November, like right before Thanksgiving, I think it's a lot of

42:38.040 --> 42:42.500
money to spend on a computer, but I knew it would be when I started saving my pennies

42:42.500 --> 42:43.500
for it.

42:43.500 --> 42:48.880
I knew it was going to be expensive and uh, yeah, I wanted to make sure all my ducks were

42:48.880 --> 42:52.100
in a row and I decided to pull the trigger after last week's episode, after doing some

42:52.100 --> 42:55.160
more thinking and try and test it out of the mini.

42:55.160 --> 42:58.840
And I'm a little nervous at spending that much money cause it's makes me a little uncomfortable,

42:58.840 --> 43:02.160
but it's done, it's on its way and it's currently processing.

43:02.160 --> 43:06.960
I think because I, because I just delayed my order and, and hemmed and haught about

43:06.960 --> 43:14.240
it for a little while, I got initially a shipping notice of like December 24th was what it was

43:14.240 --> 43:17.680
going to arrive and I thought, well, okay, you know, whatever, that's fine.

43:17.680 --> 43:18.680
I'm not in a big rush.

43:18.680 --> 43:19.680
Uh, fine.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.960
I'll go for it.

43:20.960 --> 43:24.580
And so I just put the, submitted the order and then I got an email from them a few days

43:24.580 --> 43:29.100
later saying that now my estimated ship date is November 24th.

43:29.100 --> 43:32.360
So I think when you put your orders in and then canceled them, it must've made room in

43:32.360 --> 43:33.680
the queue for my order.

43:33.680 --> 43:34.680
Yeah.

43:34.680 --> 43:35.680
Well, I hope you like it.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.240
Well, I would look forward to the review.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.640
Yeah, we'll see.

43:38.640 --> 43:42.240
I'm uh, I'm so far impressed by the reviews that have trickled in.

43:42.240 --> 43:48.640
They, it looks, it looks like a lot of performance and you know, for me, like I'm, I'm not a,

43:48.640 --> 43:55.120
I'm not, um, super up to date on the best ways to use macOS, but I've used it enough

43:55.120 --> 43:59.600
over the years that I don't feel like macOS is going to be the big stumbling block that

43:59.600 --> 44:03.320
it is for like a lot of my friends who are going to try these machines out and I get

44:03.320 --> 44:06.800
in, they get in, they, it's like when people have been long time Android users and they

44:06.800 --> 44:10.120
switched to iOS that they just lose their minds.

44:10.120 --> 44:14.160
They don't know what to do, but I've had enough exposure over the years that I, I haven't

44:14.160 --> 44:21.840
used, um, big Sur and I haven't used, um, mozzarella or whatever the next one is.

44:21.840 --> 44:24.680
But, uh, I don't think it should be that big of a learning curve.

44:24.680 --> 44:25.680
Oh, really?

44:25.680 --> 44:26.680
Yeah.

44:26.680 --> 44:27.680
Isn't it?

44:27.680 --> 44:28.680
It comes out today too.

44:28.680 --> 44:29.680
Isn't it Monterey?

44:29.680 --> 44:30.680
Yeah, I think so.

44:30.680 --> 44:31.680
It's a little cheese.

44:31.680 --> 44:32.680
I think it comes out today.

44:32.680 --> 44:36.320
But you know, it's, it's kind of, it's kind of like you had been saying, like the M1,

44:36.320 --> 44:41.440
when I tried that Mac mini and I was using the VM machine and I put like, I gave the

44:41.440 --> 44:45.200
VM like eight gigs of Ram or something like that and I was using, I was like, Oh, Mike

44:45.200 --> 44:46.200
was right.

44:46.200 --> 44:50.680
This has been, I could have bought an M1 when they announced them and it would have been

44:50.680 --> 44:52.520
powerful enough to do the job I needed to do.

44:52.520 --> 44:54.080
I think it would have been fast enough.

44:54.080 --> 44:59.160
I kind of just wrote it off because of 16 gigs of Ram and only, what is it, a four core

44:59.160 --> 45:00.160
or an eight core processor?

45:00.160 --> 45:02.040
I don't know, but it was like, come on, that's not enough.

45:02.040 --> 45:06.200
I want to run three operating systems at once and six containers and I want to have all

45:06.200 --> 45:07.200
my desktop applications.

45:07.200 --> 45:08.960
That's just not enough.

45:08.960 --> 45:13.800
And then I tried that M1 and it wasn't even like a fresh install or anything like that.

45:13.800 --> 45:17.720
It was an M1 from when they were released and I loaded up that software and I'm full

45:17.720 --> 45:22.880
screen that VM and I thought I could work all day long in this VM and not feel like

45:22.880 --> 45:25.240
I was sacrificing anything really.

45:25.240 --> 45:29.800
And I could have, yeah, I could have done that six, nine months ago.

45:29.800 --> 45:33.840
I didn't need to wait, but I'm kind of glad I did because now I'm going to spend my money

45:33.840 --> 45:36.960
on a much nicer machine, which should be an even better experience.

45:36.960 --> 45:40.000
But it was one of those experiences like, yeah, Mike was right.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.200
I'll admit it.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.720
The M1 is fast enough.

45:42.720 --> 45:45.960
And the thing is too, and I know you said this, but it really makes a difference when

45:45.960 --> 45:47.760
you experience it.

45:47.760 --> 45:52.640
The machine doesn't even make a sound like I, when I touched it, it was cool to the touch

45:52.640 --> 45:56.760
and you know, I'm running, I was running it quite a bit because I didn't close any of

45:56.760 --> 45:57.760
the desktop apps.

45:57.760 --> 46:01.200
The browser was going, I had chat going and I went to town with the thing.

46:01.200 --> 46:02.200
I was really impressed.

46:02.200 --> 46:06.800
And that's what really pushed me over to get the MacBook because I thought, well, this

46:06.800 --> 46:10.240
laptop, if this mini is this powerful, then that laptop with an even faster chip is going

46:10.240 --> 46:11.640
to be plenty powerful.

46:11.640 --> 46:12.640
How are you liking the mini?

46:12.640 --> 46:13.920
Is it, is it holding up?

46:13.920 --> 46:15.800
Well, I only had it for a couple of days.

46:15.800 --> 46:17.260
It wasn't mine.

46:17.260 --> 46:20.200
So I gave it back, but it was really nice when I tried it, you know, I hooked it up

46:20.200 --> 46:24.680
to an external disk, my, my keyboard, I hooked it up to the launch keyboard.

46:24.680 --> 46:27.880
I hooked it up to a Asus, you know, just like screen.

46:27.880 --> 46:31.440
I bought an Amazon for years ago and a Logitech mouse and it felt nice.

46:31.440 --> 46:35.280
It's like, this is the nice thing about the mini is if you have, if you have your parts

46:35.280 --> 46:37.760
already, you just plug this thing in and you're good to go.

46:37.760 --> 46:38.840
And there's nice aspects to that.

46:38.840 --> 46:43.240
And I wish Apple had more offerings than just integrate all integrated systems except for

46:43.240 --> 46:45.240
this one, but we'll see.

46:45.240 --> 46:46.240
Maybe they will over time.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.920
But yeah, I thought it was a nice little box.

46:48.920 --> 46:52.080
Could make a good little home server for sure.

46:52.080 --> 46:55.360
It's food time for both of us, so we'll wrap it up by saying thank you to our friends at

46:55.360 --> 46:56.360
a cloud guru.

46:56.360 --> 46:57.560
Go find them on social media.

46:57.560 --> 47:02.120
It's just slash the cloud guru on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, you know, if it's a social

47:02.120 --> 47:04.480
media, well, they're over there.

47:04.480 --> 47:06.700
