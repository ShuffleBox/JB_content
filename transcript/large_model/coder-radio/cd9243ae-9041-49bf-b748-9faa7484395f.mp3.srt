00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
This is Kota Radio, episode 474, for July 11th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,880
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,200
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Here in my perfectly healthy state, I am joined by our host, Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,200
Hello Mike.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,200
Hello Chris.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,840
How are you feeling these days?

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,560
A little under the weather.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,000
My son's quest to bring home every pathogen possible continues.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,280
He is impressive.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,160
Only outdone because I have three of them, so I have three different vectors.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,720
But for, you know, a standalone agent, he is quite effective, I have to say.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
I'm very impressed.

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,620
Well, his summer camp has a splash pad, what is otherwise known as a petri dish.

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,760
And I think every time they do a splash pad day, they get the, it's like a high hangover,

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,000
but like you didn't even get to do the boozing.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You just get the hangover.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,800
Oh, I can imagine, you know, it's covered in wet moisture, right?

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,520
It's, and it's hot.

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,880
It's warm.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,560
Kids are all touching their faces, fingers in their mouths, running around.

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,380
Hey, um, can we just like super quickly remark on the fact that this whole Elon buying Twitter

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,840
thing was an absolute nothing burger that people had an absolute panic attack over that

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,200
has now turned into nothing.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,920
In fact, Twitter is actually suing Elon trying to make sure the deal goes through because

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,320
he's officially pulled out.

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,320
Yeah.

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,360
So I decided to, uh, apparently if you tweet Elon's name, you will get yelled at by both

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,960
crazy like right wing people and basically the PC principal from South Park at the same

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
time.

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
Yeah, it's something.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,160
But like nothing happened.

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,080
I guess they're assuming to compel him to close on a deal, but how do you force someone

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,400
to like run your company?

35
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,820
I know it's, well, we got a contract, but uh, yeah.

36
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,800
Is the court really going to say, no, Mr. Musk, you must buy this $44 billion company.

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
Yeah.

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
What are they going to be like?

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
We're sending a parole officer to drive you to the Twitter offices and install you in

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
the CEO chair.

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Like what?

42
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,080
Don't you think it's actually possible now that it's going to become a court case, there's

43
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,740
going to be some discovery involved and they may actually have to disclose the data they

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,640
do have about the bots on their platform.

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,940
Yeah, I feel like this discovery is going to be like super embarrassing for everybody

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,940
involved.

47
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,680
This just seems like a really bad idea.

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,680
So dumb.

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Like take the billionaire.

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
Well, I guess cause the shareholders can sue too, right?

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,640
So I guess the board has to sue him, but it's like, I don't know.

52
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,480
I mean like I kind of think he was just drunk or high, like started mouthing off and it

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,880
was like, I'm on a buy Twitter.

54
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,980
I think honestly people don't want to accept that somebody worth billions who's in charge

55
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,840
of giant tech companies that's launching satellites and building electric cars can just like want

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,280
to buy a company on a Lark and then a few days later not want to buy a company.

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,520
Like I don't think people can wrap their heads around it.

58
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,620
They want that person to be like diligent, very intentional, very well planned.

59
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,000
Did you see the conspiracy theory that he was like playing 40 chess to sell his Tesla

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
stock?

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm like, I don't know.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I saw the tweets.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,320
I think he was just stoned out of his mind.

64
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Like.

65
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
I think that's what it is.

66
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,720
I think he was having a good time.

67
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,560
And when you're a billionaire, 40, you know, 44 bill to blow, you know, you've got to think

68
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
you're a certain point.

69
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,640
Like I could fix this.

70
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
They just need some good leadership.

71
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
I'll get in there.

72
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
I'll fix it up.

73
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
You know, you could see him thinking that.

74
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
Of course.

75
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,640
And in the meantime, he's got having a couple of kids within a week from each other by two

76
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,560
different ladies, which is amazing.

77
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,620
Oh my God.

78
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,360
You know, when I heard that, I just thought the chaos that must exist in that man's life,

79
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
all the angry, I'm just going to say all the angry exes managing all of that and balancing

80
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,880
all of that's impossible.

81
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,920
So it's just going to be constant chaos.

82
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,560
He's in a world of chaos that he created for himself.

83
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,400
Like the only thing, and I'm sure you saw, I took interest in her, a guy who's like free

84
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
speech, free speech, free speech.

85
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,280
He got pissed off at Scott Galloway and just blocked him.

86
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,040
Well, wait, you're the one who says there should be no like censorship nowhere.

87
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
He had this whole little rant.

88
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,200
He wanted to bring Trump back on Twitter.

89
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,600
He wanted to.

90
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
What did he say?

91
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
He said, let all of it.

92
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,160
It was something like let all let everybody's freak flag fly, basically.

93
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,520
He also wanted to censor that kid understandably, but he wanted to censor that kid that was

94
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,920
tracking his flights.

95
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
That's right.

96
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,460
The kid with the I forgot about that.

97
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,440
Did you see the D.M. screenshots leaked where like Elon was considering offering him some

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,120
cash and then Elon decides he doesn't want to pay him.

99
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,680
And actually it was in that thread, too.

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,240
You can see there's two different Elans.

101
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,760
There's the Elon that comes out first and says, oh, you know, here's 60 K. Stop doing

102
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
this.

103
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,360
Kid comes back with how about 300 K and some Bitcoin.

104
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,320
And then Elon changes his mind, decides, actually, I don't want to pay for this.

105
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Yeah, I just can't even imagine like, you know, we've all done it right.

106
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,280
You wake up after a questionable night on the Twitter or, you know, in the I.R.C. or

107
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
whatever.

108
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
And you go, what did I do?

109
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,680
You know, for Elon, that's got to be every day.

110
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
I imagine.

111
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,320
And then all of a sudden we're having some kind of population like 70s style population

112
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
crunch.

113
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Yeah, I don't know.

114
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,400
I maybe I actually do think the birth rates are down in the Western world.

115
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
I think that is a thing.

116
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
I think it is down.

117
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,120
But I don't think the answer is that Elon needs to have another kid every month.

118
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,080
I don't think that's how you solve that problem.

119
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,680
I mean, you think you'd be smart enough to do the math on that one, but and and just

120
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,040
again for a guy who definitely enjoys his pot and booze, we have to just commend his

121
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
virility here.

122
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,000
I mean, with that level of crap running through your blood, the man has a high output.

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He has a high output.

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes.

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes.

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,920
A firm dedication, we should say.

127
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,640
And for people that don't think he knows what he's talking about, go check out the Everyday

128
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
Not.

129
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,320
There's a few videos now where Elon is walking around the factory and you can tell he just

130
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,840
he has absolutely every aspect of the production of those rockets absolutely figured out.

131
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
It's really impressive.

132
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,880
Isn't that the infuriating thing about him, though, like when like when he's doing what

133
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,000
he's supposed to be doing, he's brilliant.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He's on point.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,920
He's I very I believe him that like SpaceX is going to do incredible things.

136
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Yeah.

137
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,520
But then midnight strikes, we roll a fat blood with Joe Rogan and we're we're wacky like.

138
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
Yeah.

139
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,520
You're right.

140
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Yeah.

141
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,120
You know, it's too much of the cult of personality.

142
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,800
People pin too much on one person and then you get disappointed.

143
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Yeah.

144
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,720
And he has teams of, you know, brilliant people.

145
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,420
So speaking of fatal flaws, right.

146
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,780
We got some emails that came in this week and I wanted to cover one that came in from

147
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,020
Mark.

148
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,720
He wonders perhaps if Apple has a fatal fly says, Hello, Rob Bros.

149
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,800
According to the geopolitical strategist, Peter Zahan, Apple will be screwed when China

150
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,880
implodes and it will take multiple years to rebuild the supply chain in the Western Hemisphere.

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,240
He's got a clip.

152
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,320
It's about four minutes.

153
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,880
If we'll put a link in the show notes to that, he says, What do you think the tech world

154
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,480
will look like in which the next iPhone takes four to five years to release four to five

155
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
years?

156
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
So.

157
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,760
I guess maybe for the sake of argument, we go with his premise that China is going to

158
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,200
implode and that Apple will not be able to manufacture over there.

159
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,560
I mean, I guess I guess.

160
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,400
It seems like it'd be a slow decline more than just an overnight thing.

161
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Well, and and, you know, I just I forgot the name of the book, but the recent book that

162
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,600
came out about the Tim Cook, Johnny, I have little tenet when they were running Apple

163
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,640
after Steve died in that book.

164
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,020
The author shares that Tim Cook is not only aware of this problem or this possibility

165
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,840
of a problem takes a slightly different tack.

166
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,680
It's not that they think China is going to implode.

167
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,920
Perhaps they think they might get forced in a position of China, ask them to do some stuff

168
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,320
that's just unacceptable to them or would violate the US laws.

169
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,760
So they're they're already like doing things in Vietnam.

170
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Right.

171
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,820
They're they're opening facilities.

172
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,240
But it takes like years to set up these supply chains.

173
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,720
And one of the challenges and even I'm sure Alex will find it for us and why, you know,

174
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,840
you know, America days, you actually don't have the expertise in like member of that.

175
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,040
Was it Ohio or Wisconsin with the Foxconn plant?

176
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
Right.

177
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
I know what you're talking about.

178
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,240
It's like there's some fundamental skill sets that we just don't even teach anymore.

179
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,080
We don't invest, frankly, in those kind of, you know, technical tradesmen like education

180
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,280
programs as much as, say, China or even a Germany does.

181
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,400
So I don't think the premise is right, that China is going to implode.

182
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,200
But I do think and it's not just Apple, right?

183
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,880
Many of these multinational companies have to start thinking as Beijing, you know, Wolf

184
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,800
Warrior is their way to glory.

185
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,320
You maybe don't want that huge dependency on them because they will just knock on your

186
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,400
door and say, we want what we want.

187
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,460
When you look at a chart of what might be possible in our future and a different degrees

188
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,760
of the way things are going to go in terms of international relationships with China,

189
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,080
it seems to me it's probably ended up somewhere in the middle.

190
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,960
There'll be plenty of manufacturing that stays there potentially, or it'll move to other

191
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,880
countries where the labor is extremely cheap.

192
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
We see this even in Mexico.

193
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,040
A lot of car manufacturers now, you know, build their cars in Mexico.

194
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,400
If you look at the spectrum and you say things, let's say things go quite badly, you know,

195
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,520
so we have to start building here on American shores.

196
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,240
I hate to think of the future we would be in if we were down that path.

197
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
But in terms of the states, you know, we have a lot of resources.

198
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,160
In fact, there was just a real big lithium mine, I guess they found here in the states.

199
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,480
We have a lot of stuff that we need.

200
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,160
We just don't have the skills.

201
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,080
It's a solvable problem, but it's a very, very expensive problem to solve.

202
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,400
Well, it's also even infinite money can't make that happen fast.

203
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,440
It's a 10 year, 10 year move.

204
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,680
And it's a very inflationary move.

205
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
Very inflationary.

206
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Right.

207
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
It's going to be very expensive.

208
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,540
But Chris, when we're finally paying $20 a gallon for gas, which I think is a comrade

209
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,760
Biden's goal, we could all buy a Tesla.

210
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
But I think you're right.

211
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,840
You know, Cook's already all over this.

212
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,740
I mean, he's a supply chain guy.

213
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,220
He's if you look at the companies that have been impacted by the supply chain, the top

214
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,360
tier hardware OEMs like HP and Apple and Dell done really well.

215
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,120
They've they've managed this pretty well.

216
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,160
Let's see if we can help James.

217
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,560
He's in search of a tool is, hey, guys, a while back you were kind of complaining about

218
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,600
businesses that run on Xceler access.

219
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,560
I think we touched a nerve.

220
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,400
He goes on to say the implication being that they should have their own custom line of

221
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,040
business application.

222
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm a one man specialist repair business.

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,520
My requirements don't seem to be in line with any of the CRM or line of business application

224
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,540
or Web apps out there that I've come across.

225
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,360
They have all kind of something that I need, but don't really fit properly and would just

226
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
get in the way.

227
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,560
Mostly in a previous life, I was a PHP front end Web developer.

228
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,600
I could knock together a custom application to suit my business needs, but my cost and

229
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
time would be huge.

230
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,320
At the moment, I have built a fairly complex Google sheet system that does everything I

231
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,840
need and it's been a great way to prototype data structures and try out different ideas.

232
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,960
I definitely plan to move to a more stable platform, though.

233
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,280
Do you have any suggestions of frameworks or anything else that essentially let me build

234
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,840
a GUI for a MySQL database back end?

235
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,080
He wants like his access, but with his MySQL back end.

236
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:12,120
Jeez, I feel like I've gotten this question in real life a hundred different ways.

237
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,960
And I hate that I have to say to James, it's like a big old it depends.

238
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,400
I don't like the idea of him building a front end.

239
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,720
To be honest with you, I don't know why, but that just doesn't seem like where James should

240
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
be spending his time.

241
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,200
If I were just coming in cold and I was consulting with James on day one, I may change my mind

242
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,040
on day two, but on day one, I'd say don't build it.

243
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,720
Yeah, I'm not even sure what tool would even fit that bill, even if you decided to build

244
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
it.

245
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,640
I mean, there's all these weird little like enterprise data visualization tools, but I've

246
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,760
never found one that wasn't basically terrible.

247
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,120
Yeah, I almost wonder if that's what he needs is like something that generates reports.

248
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,400
Maybe somebody out there has a suggestion they could send us.

249
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,200
Wes just shared MetaBase, MetaBase.com to us as a possible tool for James.

250
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
I'm not familiar with it.

251
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Hey, thank you, Wes.

252
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
MetaBase.

253
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
MetaBase.

254
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,880
Check it out.

255
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,840
Maybe there's something great in there.

256
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,120
Scott wrote in, he said he'd had enough of us talking about VS code.

257
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,920
He wanted us to at least take a moment to mention VS Codium and remember that it is

258
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,320
a thing, which then Chris promptly wondered why it's a thing, but it is a thing just like

259
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,420
Chromium is a thing.

260
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,240
There is VS Codium.

261
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,560
It takes out some of the telemetry is I think the big difference.

262
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
I don't know, though.

263
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,680
I have to tell you, as somebody who doesn't use the Windows platform and is almost always

264
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,360
on the Linux platform, I feel like telemetry represents a niche user that needs representation

265
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,760
in these companies.

266
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,080
I actually turn telemetry on because I want them to see that a Linux user is out there.

267
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,880
Yeah, that's kind of the golden silver lining, whatever, of Microsoft's creepy stuff is they

268
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,760
get enough people installing VS code or using a Clippy for code whose name I can't remember

269
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,460
from GitHub on Linux, they might actually support it more.

270
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,840
But I totally understand that not everybody has that opinion, and they feel like Microsoft

271
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,920
can go F themselves.

272
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,760
I, however, have just decided I'm actually going to submit that metric.

273
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,920
You know, they probably have so much other data on me anyway.

274
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
They don't care, right?

275
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,400
Every time you log into Xbox, they're like, ha ha, they got me the moment I had to buy

276
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,440
Minecraft for my kids, right?

277
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,920
I was like, there's no going out on that.

278
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
They got me.

279
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,680
And for those of you who don't have kids, this is not a I wanted to or my kid wanted

280
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
to.

281
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
This is a must.

282
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,640
This is you will buy Minecraft or you will suffer.

283
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Yeah.

284
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,240
And it's, you know, as far as games go, it seems like a pretty good one.

285
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,440
Hey, guess what?

286
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,920
Guess what?

287
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,960
I got something really special coming up in September on the 29th.

288
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:54,360
We are getting a very special but limited tour of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab.

289
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:01,640
From individuals that are friends of Linux Unplugged, Tim Kanima is a friend of the show

290
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:07,160
and was involved with the I think he's like the operation lead for the helicopter that's

291
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,520
in the new Mars Rover.

292
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,860
And was a key player in getting JPL to adopt Linux as well.

293
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:21,520
And so he's extended a special tour to 20 JB listeners in the area in Southern California.

294
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,200
We don't have a meetup page yet because we're trying to also put together a broader meetup

295
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,880
because Linode is sending us on another road trip.

296
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,000
We're doing it around this event to JPL, so we're going to do meetups up and down the

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
West Coast.

298
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,440
But we need to get an idea of where people are at so we can plan our route and try to

299
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,240
be the most efficient with fuel that we can because it's just a ridiculous time to go

300
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,680
on a road trip.

301
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,080
And so I have created a West Coast crew matrix room.

302
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,600
And I'd like you to pop in there if you're in the West Coast and you think we could have

303
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,640
a meetup in your area, maybe have a suggestion of where we could hold the meetup or where

304
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,520
I could park Lady Joops.

305
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:02,640
It's bit.ly slash West Coast crew and I will put a link to that in the show notes too.

306
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,000
It's bit.ly slash West Coast crew.

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,960
You jump in that matrix room, you just give me some signal and then pretty soon I'll start

308
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,320
putting up a route that we're going to take and whatnot.

309
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,280
You can also boost into the shows and let me know if you're in the West Coast somewhere

310
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,680
between Washington, Idaho, Oregon, California area.

311
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,940
Let me know.

312
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,860
And guess what?

313
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,200
I created you a matrix account.

314
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,600
I'm in the matrix?

315
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
You are in the matrix now.

316
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I'll get you the credentials.

317
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,360
But yeah, I've created you a matrix account.

318
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,720
So wait, is it like green and black and has like those weird symbols flying by?

319
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
It depends.

320
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,000
Well, I'm going to have to sit you down.

321
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,040
There's going to be like a couple of pills you got to pick from and then like some mirror

322
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,280
stuff you got to play around with, but depending on which way you go.

323
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,040
Let me just get some Hendrix first and the mirror stuff will happen anyway.

324
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
All right.

325
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
So I don't think you're going to be at the West Coast meetup.

326
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
I don't think that's happening.

327
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,200
You know, we'll create a guerrilla East Coast meetup room just to have like a rap thing

328
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
going, you know.

329
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Totally.

330
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,000
You know, Brent's going to be in Raleigh for about a month coming up, and I think he's

331
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,440
going to do some micro meetups in the Raleigh area.

332
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,640
It's a little far for you to go for a small one, but who knows?

333
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,720
I might never know what happens.

334
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Food's good up there.

335
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
The food's good.

336
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Oh, barbecue.

337
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Carolina barbecue.

338
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,640
Don't even don't even tempt me.

339
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,320
Linode.com slash coder, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you

340
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,720
go there to show your support for this here show.

341
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,280
So it's Linode.com slash coder.

342
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,080
Linode is the developer's cloud with 11 data centers worldwide, and they've been hard at

343
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,840
work for nearly 19 years, creating the absolute best experience for you to run your applications

344
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
on.

345
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,560
If you've got massive back end infrastructure that you need to deploy or just a system for

346
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,840
you and your friends, Linode has something for you.

347
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,520
Clouds rolling out, screaming fast new MVME storage.

348
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,320
They've been really upgrading everything since I've been a customer for the last two and

349
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,020
a half years, just continually iterating on the experience.

350
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,680
And that's probably why I like them so much, because just as I'm kind of ready to kind

351
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,800
of take things to the next level, they've got a service for me.

352
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,040
Like I'm just thinking of right now, I had a managed database service and initially it

353
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,520
didn't support Postgres, but they just recently added Postgres support and it's like, OK,

354
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
let's go.

355
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
I got a few applications.

356
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
I'm ready to move over.

357
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,360
Also, we were just doing a massive late night rebuild of one of our aspects of our matrix

358
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,160
service, just one of those things that we should have taken care of a long time ago.

359
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,520
And it was so nice to be able to go into Linode and just say, you know what, a little more

360
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,720
disk storage, please.

361
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,520
Let's resize this disk a little bit bigger.

362
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,080
I've got to go through and clean some stuff up.

363
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,880
Let's just get ourselves a little bit of breathing room.

364
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,520
And just having that kind of flexibility in the Linode dashboard is so nice.

365
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,580
So go take advantage of that hundred dollar offer and see what I'm talking about.

366
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,320
Go play around with their cloud firewalls, their S3 compatible object storage.

367
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
There's a lot there.

368
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,880
And with pricing 30 to 50 percent cheaper than other major cloud providers, well, there's

369
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,200
nothing you're not going to love.

370
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,820
And the support, it's real.

371
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,920
It's actually humans are going to help you 24 seven.

372
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,200
They're not going to keep bumping you through some sort of weird tiered system.

373
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,400
You know, there's like a thousand people in that help desk area or something like that.

374
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
It's wild.

375
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,520
I can't even believe the hypervisors get away with it.

376
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,000
It's one of the ways Linode really tries to differentiate.

377
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,480
So go check them out.

378
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Support the show.

379
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Learn something.

380
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,640
Go learn something and get that hundred bucks.

381
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,720
Linode dot com slash coder.

382
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,800
That's Linode dot com slash coder.

383
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,540
Well, the Software Freedom Conservancy has picked up where Richard Stallman left off

384
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,720
and has launched tax against Microsoft, several of them, one for Copilot.

385
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,320
They have a big issue with Copilot and they put out a campaign for people to leave GitHub.

386
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,600
They've set up a website.

387
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,840
They want people to leave GitHub, maybe use GitLab, something else.

388
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,940
But they're also taking Microsoft to task this week for banning the sale of open source

389
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,880
applications from the Windows App Store.

390
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:54,240
A couple of weeks ago, Microsoft quietly updated their App Store policies, adding a new policy

391
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,520
that makes it impossible for open source or other software that is otherwise generally

392
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,240
available for free, meaning in price, not freedom, to be sold.

393
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,000
Apparently they made the change on July 16th.

394
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,960
Even the new rule, once it was discovered, drew criticism from developers because some

395
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,880
free software developers were using the sales in the Windows Store to help raise funds for

396
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,040
their open source project.

397
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,240
Can you guess what's going on here?

398
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,160
Can you kind of see where this is going?

399
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
I didn't get this.

400
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,280
I don't see why that's evil because I'm pretty sure there were probably some jerks like uploading

401
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,920
to other people's open source projects, maybe with slight malware modifications even and

402
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,800
trying to sell them.

403
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,440
That is exactly what was happening.

404
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,800
It's understandable and, of course, it's also kind of understandable how Microsoft just

405
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,200
took this ham-fisted approach, all right, we're just going to ban this, right, took

406
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,560
the Apple approach, this is out.

407
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,760
And then, of course, once they heard the protests, they did respond and they modified the policy

408
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
now.

409
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,600
And they're making adjustments to the policy to make it possible for the actual developers

410
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,800
to sell their own software.

411
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,080
Yeah, I feel like this is actually Microsoft behaving in a super reasonable way.

412
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:09,880
I mean, so this is why I think it is a little embarrassing that the Software Freedom Conservancy

413
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,160
is making such a big production out of this.

414
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,600
It reminds me of sort of the chick behavior from the Free Software Foundation that was

415
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,080
like pissing into the wind and just doing silly protests to like raise awareness.

416
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,780
And it, in my eyes, delegitimized the Free Software Foundation in the broader tech community.

417
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,240
And then, inevitably, it began to delegitimize it to some in the free software community,

418
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,440
not all.

419
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,040
And now it feels like we're seeing that exact thing happen now with the Software Freedom

420
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,540
Conservancy.

421
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,520
They're taking small things and exaggerating them to make them sound like much bigger issues.

422
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:51,820
While still raising valid questions, the manner in which it's being done is a little disingenuous,

423
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,400
in my opinion.

424
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,020
And I kind of hate to see it go this way because the Conservancy was kind of like the professionals

425
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,020
in the room here.

426
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,960
They were taking projects under their umbrella, giving them legal guidance, working with companies

427
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,840
that needed to be worked with to get in support of GPL, and something has shifted here.

428
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,560
It's kind of the last thing the free software community needed was for another one of these

429
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,520
advocacy institutions of theirs to start to lose legitimacy.

430
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,760
Even if, let's say, like the campaign to get people to move off of GitHub was a good one.

431
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,760
And one of their chief concerns is Copilot.

432
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,620
And one of their other chief concerns is, well, SourceForge eventually went to shit.

433
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,320
So inevitably GitHub's going to go to shit.

434
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,320
So we've got to get off of GitHub before it turns into SourceForge.

435
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,080
That's like their second or first reason.

436
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,240
But let's give it to them.

437
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
Let's say they're right.

438
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,640
And let's say Microsoft is going to make it worse and worse over time.

439
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,200
It's kind of like the idea that I, as an individual, could go up against the US military.

440
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:55,040
It's like my teeny tiny, maybe, handgun against their military jets and drones and forces.

441
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,880
The Software Freedom Conservancy going up against GitHub adoption is going up against

442
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,280
a natural tidal wave of user momentum.

443
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,440
It's literally pissing into a tidal wave of user adoption.

444
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,080
It is, unfortunately, a complete waste of resources.

445
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,600
And I don't mean to be nihilistic about it.

446
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,600
But the reality is we all only have so much time and energy and influence.

447
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,520
Why not measure twice, cut once, and exert your influence in areas where you can actually

448
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,560
make a difference?

449
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,800
And instead, they've kind of just doubled down on this.

450
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,640
And in this last week, they've kind of just gone absurd with both the abandoned GitHub

451
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,040
stuff and now with the Microsoft as attacking open source applications in the Windows Store.

452
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,760
As if the Windows Store makes these developers any actual money to begin with, right?

453
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,000
I mean, it's just the whole thing is ludicrous.

454
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,680
I do feel, though, that they have a little firmer footing when they talk about Copilot.

455
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,640
Because there's some fishy.

456
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,680
I'm still using it.

457
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,680
But there's definitely been some cases where it's suggested things that I'm sure it just

458
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:09,160
ripped off somebody's GitHub, because the variable names seem very idiosyncratic.

459
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
But I'm not even sure.

460
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,920
Because then are we just going to say that, well, any innovation on the development assistance

461
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,280
is bad because it might violate licenses?

462
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
I don't know.

463
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,400
I feel like that's kind of a ludic perspective.

464
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,200
The nuance there is the derived work, right?

465
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:30,400
Because these licenses, these free software licenses, have specific clauses about derived

466
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
work.

467
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,640
And Copilot is clearly producing derived work, right?

468
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,240
It seems like that connection is real close.

469
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,160
It's one line.

470
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,080
So I think that's where the perhaps that's where the issue is.

471
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,360
But I could totally see them focusing on the Copilot issues, focusing on abandoning GitHub

472
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,880
and attacking Microsoft over the Windows app store that no one uses.

473
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,240
It just feels, again, like the silly stuff that the Free Software Foundation was doing

474
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
years ago.

475
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,680
Now, we haven't heard anything from them for years.

476
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,640
And maybe people are just a little wired.

477
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,000
Maybe they're a little worked up.

478
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,120
Maybe they're a little fired up.

479
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,660
Because it came out that Lenart Patering, the creator of Pulse Audio and System D and

480
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,720
several other things, has been hired by Microsoft.

481
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,600
He quietly left Red Hat earlier this year on the DL and ended up at Microsoft.

482
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,680
And we don't really know what he's doing.

483
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,400
But it seems he's still working on System D. So there's that.

484
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,880
Microsoft's like, we will hire every open source maintainer that we can find.

485
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,120
I wanted to just put some perspective on this.

486
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,200
Because I don't know how I even might have been might have been Alex on Twitter that

487
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,280
sent this in or I came across it accidentally.

488
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
I found a clip of us.

489
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:50,080
It must have been from Alex, talking about Lenart in 2014 during all the System D debate

490
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,080
stuff.

491
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,640
And this is you and I in 2014.

492
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,000
So you're going to have to I apologize how ridiculous it sounds.

493
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,720
And I am reading a quote from Lenart Patering in the show.

494
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,120
And I just wanted to play this moment for you from 2014.

495
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,760
He says, I don't usually talk about this very much.

496
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,280
And hence, I figure that people really are not aware of this.

497
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,500
But yes, the open source community is full of assholes.

498
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,080
And I probably, and I probably more than others, am one of their most favorite targets.

499
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,420
I get mail for hacking on open source.

500
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,160
I get hate mail for it.

501
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,920
People have started and stated multiple times petitions on different websites asking me

502
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,600
to stop working on open source code.

503
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,240
You can go Google for it.

504
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,560
Recently, people started collecting bitcoins to hire for a hitman for me.

505
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,640
Yes, this really happened.

506
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,080
Just the other day, some idiot posted a song on YouTube, a creepy work filled with expletives

507
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,400
about me and suggestions of violence.

508
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,640
People post messages and references to artwork in 4chan style.

509
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,260
And there's more, a lot more.

510
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,080
So he talks about how essentially he gets a lot of hate for flipping bits on a hard

511
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
drive.

512
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
It seems a little out of perspective.

513
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,920
Yeah, to put it mildly, I forgot that he was getting death threats.

514
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,200
Oof, that is rough.

515
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,040
I think I had an interview with him in 2014 or 2015 as well.

516
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,800
And I really respected his intelligence.

517
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,840
I could tell by my interactions with him that he was an extremely bright individual.

518
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,080
And I guess, you know, back then people were a little more radical in the Linux space.

519
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,280
I can't really see that happening today, people raising funds to hire a hitman for somebody

520
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,140
developing something in Linux.

521
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,400
Certainly not in Bitcoin at least.

522
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,360
Yeah, especially these days, let's be honest, you should be using Monero.

523
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,600
But I guess I don't really have any thoughts on him at Microsoft other than I have this

524
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:45,960
creeping concern about centralization of free software talent in particular around Microsoft.

525
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,120
And I've been having this concern for a couple of years.

526
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,120
And the concern is just getting stronger and stronger.

527
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,440
And I don't think there's anything we can do about it.

528
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,120
But I worry that in a few years, we'll look back and realize that we kind of have been

529
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,400
led into a path where Microsoft has become dominant in the free software community and

530
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,900
the open source tool development, and maybe we're already there.

531
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,440
And I don't know if you've even reflected on it, we just sort of naturally slid into

532
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
it.

533
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,920
I mean, what would the alternative be then?

534
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,520
Well, if I were really to go deep, imagine a world where we haven't been living in an

535
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,920
environment of money printing since 2008, right?

536
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:32,220
So there hasn't been this massive growth in the tech industry and this ginormous consolidation.

537
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:38,280
And because that money has poured into assets first, and stocks in particular, big tech

538
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,860
companies like Apple and Microsoft and Google and Amazon have really benefited immensely.

539
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,120
And it has given them incredible economic power.

540
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,880
And so they have just gone around and gobbled up every small little company for like for

541
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,960
Apple, you know, like PI semiconductor that worked out really great, right?

542
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,920
There's a few acquisitions that have been solid for these companies.

543
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,840
You got to wonder though, man, like, if the money printer hadn't been going burr, and

544
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,560
these tech companies hadn't just been absorbing from the spigot, maybe we'd have thousands

545
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,920
of small little tech companies.

546
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,680
And maybe we'd have a lot more dispersed and decentralized talent.

547
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:23,320
Maybe we'd have a lot of small, you know, I like medium sized 500 less tech companies

548
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,780
that are building products that weren't just getting absorbed by Google, Apple and Microsoft

549
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:32,120
over the last decade, and Amazon, of course, and Facebook, of course, but then sun would

550
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,000
be alive, and we'd all be happy.

551
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,860
And we can't be happy, Chris, we do just that's not in the cards.

552
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:44,280
And also the money printing is, it's actually really prescient for you to make that the

553
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,800
point because think about like, did you I forgot who published it, but there was the

554
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,940
study on like how much money Uber loses.

555
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,040
And it's just insane, like, effectively, the federal the federal government was subsidizing

556
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,520
drunk people getting rides back from the bar, because those Uber rides just just cost a

557
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
lot more money.

558
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,520
Right?

559
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,280
They never got to a point where it's making money now.

560
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,240
They make I think they make money on the food part.

561
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Now.

562
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,400
I think that's actually easier business for them.

563
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,040
I bet man, the fees there are ridiculous.

564
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,320
Well, and they charge the restaurant to Yeah, they get they get they charge everybody.

565
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:24,320
But it's, it's just crazy, like all this capital was can't even say, basically, it was just

566
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,240
like somebody waved a wand, right and just created it out of whole cloth.

567
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,300
And it was allocated in some pretty crazy ways, like and and our bridges are still rusted

568
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,320
and falling down.

569
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,720
Hail scale.com slash coder go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices

570
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,220
and support the show.

571
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,000
scale scale is a zero config VPN, you'll get it installed on your device in minutes.

572
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,460
It'll take care of firewall rules.

573
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:57,240
It takes care of double carrier grade NAT, it just manages all of that elegantly devices

574
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,540
connect directly to each other using wire guards noise protocol.

575
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:08,740
It builds you a flat mesh network with the absolutely best VPN technology in the business.

576
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,800
Your devices are connected directly to each other.

577
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,260
They get static addresses.

578
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,320
I love this.

579
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,060
I have a bookmark folder, yes, bookmarks in my browser, where I just now have all the

580
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,680
tail scale IPS of all of the web dashboards and services that I use across my various

581
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
devices.

582
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,160
You can quickly and easily create a secure network between your servers, your computers,

583
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,960
your cloud instances, your virtual machines.

584
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,680
When you start thinking about the way you could bring different networks together.

585
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,960
It's a game changer.

586
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,480
It meant that I could have VMs here at the studio where I had a build environment or

587
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,220
a test environment and I could SSH into it from home and keep working on it and get things

588
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,720
going or keep things running.

589
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
It's so great.

590
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,120
Even when separated by firewalls or subnets, tail scale just works.

591
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,880
I've now started installing it on friends and families computers too.

592
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,060
One of the very first like aha moments I had was when I was setting up my son's laptop

593
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:05,360
and I realized I could put tail scale on here and then I can help him when he's at school

594
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,160
or when he's with his mom and I'm not there.

595
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,760
It was just a real aha moment to be able to kind of get access to that machine when I

596
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
need to.

597
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,760
It's all just on my network.

598
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,320
Like I've created my own flat network, just my own private layer.

599
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,220
It's really great and you can get started in just minutes.

600
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,960
If you've got five devices, it'll probably take you a minute a device and they all get

601
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,160
set up and it's just beautifully, beautifully connected and if you've got a business that

602
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,840
uses like a single sign on authority, maybe you've got two factor authentication as well.

603
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,200
Tail scale supports that so you can take your security up to the next level with that as

604
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
well.

605
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,560
They've got abilities to jump out onto a network too if you want to open that up or you can

606
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,120
share a machine with one other person.

607
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,820
My buddy Alex from Self Hosted and I, we have one machine that we have shared between us

608
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,480
for self hosted testing.

609
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,840
His machine shows up on my tail scale network as just like one of my devices and he controls

610
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,040
that access.

611
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
So great.

612
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,720
When you start working with this stuff, it'll start changing the way you work for the better

613
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,280
and you can layer it on just as you need.

614
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:12,320
I started kind of just simple with tail scale and now I've built new ways of working and

615
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,360
you can try it for free up to 20 devices.

616
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,280
Go to tailscale.com slash coder.

617
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:26,120
Support the show and get it for free for 20 devices at tailscale.com slash coder.

618
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,440
Well you're going to love this.

619
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,920
It's already taken off in Asia and now it's coming to the US and parts of Europe, a third

620
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:41,200
party lock screen platform, oh come on, a lock screen platform which is already pre

621
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,000
installed on many Android devices.

622
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,720
It just hasn't been activated in the EU but it's coming to US as well.

623
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:54,240
And what it is, is it is a way for the OEM or the carrier depending on who installs it

624
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:00,900
to monetize the lock screen and to show you ads with an app called Glance.

625
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,760
And the company is negotiating with US carriers to lock in a few partnerships to become the

626
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,160
quote out of the box experience of several smartphone models by next month.

627
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
That's their goal.

628
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:20,720
We have so much energy and ability to do horrible things to every surface that we ever see.

629
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,280
Yet we still can't scroll as good as iOS.

630
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,360
It's just, why?

631
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,440
And by the way, the carriers get to put them on?

632
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Or the OEM.

633
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,520
Depends on who gets the final image.

634
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,280
Yeah but the carriers, we can trust them.

635
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,240
They've never done anything stupid to their devices, right?

636
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,640
Yeah, should be fine.

637
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
Should be good.

638
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,880
I'm assuming these phones are going to be cheaper.

639
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,440
That's got to be the...

640
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,440
I don't think so.

641
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
No.

642
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,440
No?

643
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
I don't think so.

644
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,440
Really?

645
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
Nope.

646
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
Nope.

647
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
Nope.

648
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,440
Check out Tailscale.

649
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
Right.

650
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,720
And is it still Linode and Datadog?

651
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
I don't remember.

652
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,560
You know the good, use Linode.

653
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Definitely check out Tailscale.

654
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,440
But we're not putting it on your lock screen.

655
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,760
So I can't believe this.

656
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,680
And how funny is it that this is rolling out right as one of the headline features of iOS

657
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:17,920
16 is fully like dynamic information rich lock screens?

658
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,240
Apple is like, how about we make your lock screen useful and nice?

659
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,300
It's like we have an idea. Hang on.

660
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:28,600
Do you suppose the gals and lads over at Google are sitting there

661
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,500
in their Android division going, oh, man, this is going to make us look like idiots.

662
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,900
This is horrible.

663
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,440
We should buy this glance company and put them out of business.

664
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Or do you or do you think they think this is a great thing?

665
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,640
And I really struggle with this because.

666
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,780
This is only possible because Google made it possible.

667
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,780
This is. At the end of the day, Google's fault.

668
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,780
And you know, I've always felt about that, you know, I felt like they have screwed

669
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,780
the pooch from the very beginning and that they made this they made the Android platform

670
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:03,780
completely malleable for these hostile actors so that way they could dump on the market

671
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,780
and get rapid adoption. I've always felt that way, and I think they made critical decisions

672
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,780
early on, like the choice to go with Java, the choice to let carriers like Verizon completely

673
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,780
customize and call it droid and completely screw with the brand and everything.

674
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,780
They just completely bent over backwards to get adoption.

675
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:29,780
And I think here we are over a decade later, dude, in 2022, still dealing with the consequences

676
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,780
of their short term decision making.

677
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
That's how I see it.

678
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,780
I don't think they mind.

679
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,780
I mean, I because don't you feel like if they cared, they could just do something about it?

680
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,780
Yeah, that's why I start to wonder.

681
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,780
It's like, how could they even allow this?

682
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,780
Why haven't they closed this up ages ago?

683
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,780
I mean, I don't even want to put this idea in Google's head because I know how they feel

684
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,780
about advertising and the deep, passionate love they have for it.

685
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:01,780
But why don't they just like build this into Android and put these guys out of business

686
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,780
and just be like, yay, market consolidation.

687
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,780
We win.

688
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
That's got to be the way this goes, right?

689
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
They have to be thinking this.

690
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,780
Well, they already have the biggest ad digital ad business in the world.

691
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,780
I mean, what are these glance guys doing that special?

692
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,780
Well, they'll they'll do specializations depending on what the marketer wants to do.

693
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,780
Like maybe you want current events glances or sports glances with relative ads, right?

694
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
Fitness.

695
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,780
And so then you can like when the user uses a fitness app, you can prevent a fitness glance.

696
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,780
And then with a little discreet ad at the bottom just on the lock screen.

697
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,780
First of all, what relevant ads?

698
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,780
I think maybe once a year I get an ad that actually makes me like click it and buy something.

699
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
Yeah, yeah.

700
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,780
My ads have gotten real lowbrow recently.

701
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,780
And I know it's because like the rates of collapse or whatever, but it's dumb.

702
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,780
Like, you know, I have I've taken up cycling.

703
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:59,780
I bought a bike and I didn't get one of those the water bottle things, you know, that you hang off the.

704
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,780
Yeah.

705
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
Yeah.

706
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,780
So I like bought one.

707
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,780
Right.

708
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,780
I Googled the kind that would be compatible with my bike, ordered it, bought it.

709
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,780
No problem.

710
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:15,780
Now I am tortured every time I look into Instagram or Facebook because apparently I need another one.

711
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,780
I know they're so dumb.

712
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,780
Like they advertise to you after you bought the thing.

713
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,780
It's so dumb.

714
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,780
It's so dumb.

715
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,780
It's like I already bought the bike.

716
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,780
I already got the water thing.

717
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,780
I got the pump for the tires.

718
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,780
I'm good.

719
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,780
Like now I have to now I have to wake up early enough to actually, you know, do it.

720
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:36,780
But yeah, it's I want less ads in my life.

721
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:43,780
I again, all the other thing, too, is now this just makes iOS looks yet again so much

722
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,780
more premium than than these kind of schlocky Android phones.

723
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:54,780
So and I also wonder if iOS 16 announcing this sort of content rich lock screen, which

724
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,780
is a super obvious feature.

725
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,780
So it's not even like it's that innovative, right?

726
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,780
It's clearly an obvious feature, but perhaps it opened the door for something like glances

727
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:07,780
to their glance to come through and say, well, look, you know, Google hasn't built this feature

728
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,780
in, but you could ship it on your phones today and be competitive with iOS 16.

729
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,780
You know, it's not going to be as good.

730
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,780
And you know, they're going to be tempted to put the ads and like the dumbest places

731
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,780
where you'll accidentally click on them.

732
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,780
Right.

733
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,780
You could see this stupid sales person in the carrier store being like iOS 16 hasn't

734
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
even shipped yet.

735
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,780
And this device already has this feature.

736
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,780
Also, having known very well someone who used to sell these kind of phones, they bribe the

737
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,780
sales reps, the OEMs.

738
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,780
And Apple does not do that.

739
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,780
So if you ever wonder why, when you go to the Verizon store, like the kid who walks

740
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,780
up to you is all all about that Samsung Galaxy, whatever.

741
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,780
It's because he gets like 10 bucks per per unit.

742
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,780
They get a little skiff.

743
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:56,780
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

744
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:01,780
The Golden Dragon boosted him five days ago with a row of ducks.

745
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,780
Two, two, two, two.

746
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,780
I'm a duck.

747
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,780
D.U.K.

748
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,780
Duck.

749
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,780
Loaded with talent.

750
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,780
I love it.

751
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,780
I know.

752
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,780
The row of ducks is great.

753
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,780
Clippy for code is a great analogy, he writes.

754
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,780
That does make more sense.

755
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,780
Talking about our discussion around Copilot.

756
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:21,780
I was less end of open source and more maybe this is just going to be code paranoia.

757
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,780
I don't know.

758
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,780
But anyways, what is what has driven you to a web terminal versus something like Alacrity?

759
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,780
My guess would be maybe it's program compatibility.

760
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,780
Thanks for the show.

761
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,780
So he's asking you what drove you to such a fancy terminal?

762
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,780
I guess I should have asked that question.

763
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,780
So thanks, Golden Dragon.

764
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,780
Yes, there's two things here.

765
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,780
One, you gave me an opportunity to make fun of Copilot.

766
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,780
So I will do that in one second.

767
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,780
So, yeah, my fancy terminal love.

768
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,780
So on Mac, I like warp.

769
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,780
I think warp is probably the best terminal I've ever used.

770
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,780
I really wish they didn't make you log into GitHub to use it because that just feels kind of icky.

771
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,780
I also wish they would port it to Linux.

772
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,780
It's a native Rust application, native UI.

773
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,780
It's super fast, super good.

774
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,780
They have like their weird AI auto completion.

775
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:11,780
And because I can't spell, for instance, I think Postgres is spelled with a Q.

776
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,780
It really helps me out.

777
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:19,780
On Linux, I'm using Tabby, which is a webby-ish terminal.

778
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,780
Why the fancy terminal?

779
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,780
I really can't spell.

780
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,780
I can't stress this enough.

781
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:30,780
Like writing SQL queries is a pain in the ass because I routinely spell the names of the columns wrong or the tables wrong.

782
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,780
These nicer terminals generally help with that.

783
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,780
Now, you mentioned Alacrity.

784
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
I did look at Alacrity.

785
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,780
I almost picked it over Tabby.

786
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,780
I just happened to feel like Tabby is a text rendering.

787
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,780
It has some customization in there.

788
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:55,780
I try as much as I can to make my workflow on the dev one and the iMac basically the same for the simple reason of I just don't care.

789
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,780
I'm just trying to get my work done.

790
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,780
Muscle memory, as much as you can optimize that.

791
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,780
Yeah.

792
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,780
So it's pretty cool.

793
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:08,780
I mean, there is a weird thing going on in the terminal space where it's just getting attention now.

794
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:14,780
Like, it's funny, I was in GNOME Terminal and I guess I said, GNOME, please, you don't have to email me again.

795
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,780
It's not GNOME.

796
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,780
I know.

797
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,780
I've seen the error of my ways.

798
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,780
Bless me, GNOME.

799
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:26,780
Anyway, and it just feels old compared to some of these newer options.

800
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:36,780
Having said that, it's very, very sad that you have to install an entire instance of Google Chrome or Chromium to run a goddamn terminal.

801
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,780
But, you know, we've we've begun to make peace with that.

802
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,780
But, yeah.

803
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,780
So CodePilot.

804
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,780
Wow.

805
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,780
I mean, every once in a while it gets something right.

806
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,780
But it's got some interesting ideas.

807
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,780
It's got some really adorable ideas.

808
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:59,780
It's like it's what I imagine my six year olds would do if I just like clunk them down and be like, all right, you're writing some typescript now go.

809
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,780
Right.

810
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:07,780
Also, Objective-C, if you really want to screw with it, it has no idea that Objective-C ever existed.

811
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:16,780
It seems to think it's C++ and it just suggests the craziest non syntax compliant stuff.

812
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:22,780
It's like I just decided just to open up some old Objective-C code I had in VS Code.

813
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:28,780
And it has a little indicator on the bottom and you can see the poor bastard spinning like, what is this?

814
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,780
It doesn't know what to do.

815
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,780
Python, though, it's down with the snake.

816
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,780
All right. Nice check in.

817
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,780
I bucky boosts in four days ago with a double boost.

818
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,780
Ten thousand fifty cents.

819
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:53,780
My feeling is that as a developer, especially a junior developer, you should devote yourself to read documentation and understand what you're doing and writing more and not having it written by a bot and thus having to understand it less.

820
00:42:53,780 --> 00:43:01,780
If abused, this Copilot thing could have an impact on software quality and security, at least until it becomes so good, it completely replaces us.

821
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:07,780
He says, isn't it as bad as copy and pasting from some from S.O.?

822
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,780
What do you mean by S?

823
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,780
Stack Overflow.

824
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,780
Oh, Stack Overflow, of course.

825
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,780
I always think significant other, but it's like that doesn't seem maybe, although maybe significant other is a developer.

826
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,780
Well, if you're sticking it up for us like Linus, then I would copy and paste from them all day long.

827
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,780
I mean, but he's right.

828
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,780
And we've made that point.

829
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,780
It is in fact, I think he's quoting you perhaps isn't as bad as copy and pasting from Stack Overflow.

830
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:38,780
He says it's almost as bad as that, but at least there you have to understand that a what you want to solve and be read an explanation of the solution, usually well written and see you have to do the effort to adapt the solution to your specific code.

831
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,780
Laziness rarely brings excellence.

832
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,780
Just my two sats.

833
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,780
Thanks for the great show.

834
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,780
Well, but Copilot, it's just funnier because it suggests stupid things all the time.

835
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:56,780
So it is funnier for sure, although I haven't thought about the fact that to use Stack Overflow, you got to understand what you're asking for.

836
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,780
And you have to read the explanation usually to.

837
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,780
That's a great point.

838
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:06,780
And if you actually post on Stack Overflow, you have to have the testicular fortitude to know that you're going to get yelled at.

839
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,780
You better be no matter what you say, you're getting yelled at.

840
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,780
So we did not have a lot of boost this week.

841
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,780
So if you'd like to get your boost and we'd love a good batch for the next episode, you can go grab a new podcast app.

842
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,780
At newpodcastapps.com.

843
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:25,780
I also have my Fountain FM referral link because Fountain FM is the app I've been using.

844
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,780
If you want to try it out and then I think you'll be able to follow me.

845
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,780
You can see the clips I make and stuff in there.

846
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,780
We did get some thank you boost.

847
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,780
We got thirty six ninety sats from Kaspeland.

848
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:45,780
We got one thousand six hundred eleven sats from ITGuy05 and four hundred and seventy four sats from KVoc or KPVoc, as I often say, just trying to boost into the next episode.

849
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:51,780
He likes to do that, which I think is great.

850
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:57,780
Thank you for those and also thank you to our members, the Coder QA crew over at Coder QA dot co.

851
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,780
We're going to record a new Coderly this week and I got something kind of special already put together for our members.

852
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,780
Mm hmm. Looking forward to it.

853
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,780
We're just going to we're going to wait till you're not dying.

854
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,780
Want to you know, we don't want to over we don't want to overdo it.

855
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,780
So we got to let you hear. Oh, my God. I just had a brilliant idea.

856
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,780
Adds on the robes. What about him?

857
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,780
We should be saying we should be doing. Oh, we should put like patches.

858
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:26,780
Right. So let's call Linode. Let's sell them like a little Linode logo on the other side of the rope.

859
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:32,780
I mean, when you're talking about a robe, though, maybe that's an opportunity for a liquor sponsor brought to you by J&R Cigars.

860
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,780
And we might need to modernize, you know, because we're a new media.

861
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:44,780
We may need to do like cannabis and CBD CBD oils and maybe like essential, you know.

862
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:50,780
Are we a middle aged single mom taking our little bath? Is that what's happening?

863
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:56,780
Microdosing. Yeah. But like, you know, because like the lower part of the road, that's got to be like the cheaper ad space. Right.

864
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,780
Well, the most expensive has to be right on your waist where you tie the rope. Right.

865
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:05,780
We could call that the golden zone. Oh, man. What about like the ends of the robe tie?

866
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,780
We could do it like a karate belt. Right. Where you have like the stripes.

867
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:16,780
Well, clearly we should probably just wrap up and hang up our headphones and get into the road business because I think we got some serious runway there.

868
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,780
Unless we get some members, you know, the members do keep us going. Coder QA dot co.

869
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,780
You've also got the ad free feed over there as well. Mr.

870
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:29,780
Dominic, is there anywhere we should send folks to find you this week or look at stuff or I don't know.

871
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:36,780
Not really. I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'll mention Elon on Twitter to get yelled at again. That's possible.

872
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:43,780
That's like a great idea. Oh, actually, I do have someone to send people. It has nothing to do with me or you or JB or TMB.

873
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:53,780
The Web Telescope five o'clock today, we're seeing the first picture, the preview. And then tomorrow morning, Eastern Time, I think it's like 11 in the morning.

874
00:46:53,780 --> 00:47:02,780
NASA's releasing a bunch of the photos. But today I don't know if you saw this because today Biden's going to do like he's doing like a whole little press conference reveal the first photo.

875
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:06,780
Apparently it's going to be very interesting.

876
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,780
Ah, very cool. Now, pretty soon we'll start our aliens radio. The truth is out there.

877
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:17,780
I will mention that we have Jupiter tube and you can catch the show live on Jupiter dot tube on Mondays at noon.

878
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:25,780
Pacific three p.m. Eastern, I probably should mention that the top of the show because you can hit pause on your audio version and go watch the video version as such that it is.

879
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:32,780
Maybe I shouldn't actually. The Drew version is so much better. But check out Jupiter dot tube for all the live production archives over there.

880
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,780
Links to what we talked about today. Coder dot show slash four seven four.

881
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:42,780
That's also where you'll find our contact form. Your feedback is a big part of the show. That's why we open every episode with your feedback.

882
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:52,780
So send that in. Coder dot show slash contact. You'll also find our RSS page over there so you can subscribe in your favorite player or you could get a new podcast app and you search in the directory and we'll show up in there.

883
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:59,780
It's easy. It's super easy. All right. I think that's it. So thank you everybody for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder radio program.

884
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:06,780
You know what, man? Why don't we just do it? I'll just go grab the halls. You want to do it? Yeah. We're going to record a Coderly right now. Right now.

885
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:13,780
Let me just go grab a lozenge so I stop coughing. Yep. All right. Well here on the live stream over at Jupiter dot tube, the show rolls on.

886
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:20,780
But of course for you on the downloads, which is like, you know, everyone. All of you. Yes. Just be regular.

887
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:26,780
And also if you're listening live, it's a Coderly so drop trow. That's that's the standard practice.

888
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:31,780
Yeah. Do we do the Coderly live or do we not let them? We've been doing it live. Let's do it live.

889
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:37,780
You know what? You know how we like to show off. Bill O'Reilly is coming on, too. It'll be great.

890
00:48:37,780 --> 00:49:02,780
All right, everybody. Thanks so much. See you right back here next week.
