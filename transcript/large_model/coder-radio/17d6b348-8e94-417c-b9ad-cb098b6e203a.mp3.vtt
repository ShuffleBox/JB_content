00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Koda Radio, episode 357, for May 13th, 2019.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello, and welcome to Koda Radio,

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show that takes a pragmatic look

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
at the art and business of software development and related technologies.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Wes, and I'm joined once again by Mr. Michael Dominic.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Welcome to the show, Mike.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
It sounds like you're having a bit of a storm out there, but, well, that didn't stop you.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Yes, Wes, we are on location here in Atlantis, otherwise known as Florida,

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
and things are going great. We are not drowning.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
Well, here to help live with us in the studio is the man who puts I in iOS, Mr. Chris Fisher.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Or the home in HomePod.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Oh, that's right.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Hello, gentlemen. Good to be back.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I brought Levi, the studio dog, with me, too.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
That's really why you invited me.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
He keeps us safe, so we can focus on all the good content in this here, Koda Radio.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Okay, Chris and I are just back from Red Hat Summit in Boston.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Boston.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
And while we left, it seemed like everything else in the world exploded.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Holy smokes.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Between Google I.O. and Microsoft Build right here.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
We just flew, left Seattle, the Redmond area, abandoned it for Red Hat.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Also, a Python conference was going on, too.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
So much.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
All the things were happening last week. It was crazy.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
So, we have a lot to catch up on here on the show.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Before we get into any of that, though, we've had some excellent feedback this week.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Let's start with our friend, Louis, who writes to us.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
Love the show. It's probably my favorite piece of J.B. content since the untimely departure of Unfilter.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yes.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
And thank you for your perfect email.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Isn't that the end?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yes, that's perfect.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
End conclusion.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
No, he's got a little more substance than that, Mike.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
He writes, I was listening to episode 356 with glee as you were discussing testing and junior DevOps positions.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
I've just accepted a position as DevOps assistant at a small dev shop with the intent to work on my coding and development skills

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
and make my way into a more useful member of the team.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I was very excited about the position initially.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
It's taken some time to get the interview process behind me,

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
and I was beginning to become concerned I had accepted a position as the office doormat, bottom of the totem pole, as it were.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
After listening to the show and hearing Michael talk about the importance of QA to a dev shop,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm thinking it may be a great role for me.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
The following question you had regarding QA as a career path really hit my concerns on the nose

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
and made me feel a lot better about my career decision.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
I thought I was going to be in a big rush to get out of the basement and up to a full developer position.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
But after listening, I really feel like my contribution to this team is going to be important and necessary from the get go.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Thanks for the great show, Louis.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah, so that's some good stuff, Louis.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
QA is super important.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
I keep saying this and people keep not believing me, especially for a dev shop.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
If QA fails, oftentimes dev shops either lose margin on a project or get fired.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
And when the shop gets fired, usually people get fired.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
So that's super bad, right?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
QA, please test your stuff.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
The only thing that really determines if you're adding value and are a good contributing member to the team

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
or your role is viewed that way is the culture of the people you're working with, right?

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
If they view your contributions, if the system is set up so that your position isn't just mindless tasks that should be automated

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
but you're actually interacting with and concerned and an integral part of the process,

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
then even if people outside of that industry don't understand your value, it's still totally valid.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
It's a bit of an ego check at the door.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
You can also flip this around for other industries.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Like when I look at tech support and my previous roles as a sys admin,

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
the absolute best admins had spent time doing tech support.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
They'd spent time answering the phone and answering end users' questions.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
And even just to bring it to something a little more locally here, just recently, Wes is our lead podcaster on the network.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
He's like the top podcaster.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
But just over the last couple of weeks before we hired another editor,

04:23.000 --> 04:31.000
we had Wes editing this here show just to give him hands-on experience with what that end of the production crew has to work on.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
Wes wasn't hired to edit podcasts, but it was good to give him those insights so that way,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
A, he knows what kind of deliverables to give another team member,

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
but B, you gained a lot of insights into the actual production application as well.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
So now you've taken that information forward and enhanced other aspects of our production,

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
which was just an ancillary benefit of having you go do something that, to be frank, was below you, below your job title.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
But you check the ego at the door, and you're like, this is just good work.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
This is just something for me to learn.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, it makes me a better team member, and I can put out a better product as a result.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Exactly. I think that was really useful.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
And it's a matter of just getting over yourself a little bit.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
And, you know, we do need to – I'm glad we're talking about – and, Mike, I'm glad you shared your views,

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
because we do need to recognize that role in the industry and not be so obsessed with the totem pole

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
and just recognize that we're all a team trying to make a product or whatever you're doing together.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
How can you make the team stronger?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Exactly.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Okay, well, totally different sort of feedback.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
There's been a request over in our subreddit.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Yes, we do have a subreddit, coderadio.reddit.com.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Anyone know any Linux or programming subs that aren't full of mindless circle jerking?

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
Most seem to be afflicted with mindless circle jerking, free software extremism, and other indiscretions.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Now, Mike, you've already gave a little bit of feedback.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
This is a hard question to answer.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Is there anywhere you turn?

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
You know, I kind of have a weird view on this.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
I mean, I would argue, well, what are you looking to get out of a Linux community?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Are you talking about desktop Linux?

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Are you talking about, like, Linux the kernel, Linux on the server?

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
And also, it used to be much, much worse.

06:06.000 --> 06:15.000
So I would almost say, I don't know where you're going, but I would avoid R slash Linux as much as possible

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
and go to things like the Ubuntu forums aren't bad.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
I would also say the Jupyter broadcasting Telegram channel.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
I always log in there and people are like, oh, I'm running KDE because apparently I don't have a job

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
and I don't want to tweak settings.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
That took a turn.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Ouch.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
And, you know, I need help.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
And people help them who also allegedly don't have jobs.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
So, you know, go there.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Yeah.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
I mean, that's true free labor, right?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
That's always useful.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
You could tell Mike's a businessman.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Telegram is a good option.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
It's a little bit different than, you know, than Reddit, but it has a lot of the same feelings.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
I think it depends on, not to interrupt you, I'm sorry, but I just think it depends on the niche.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
So it depends on how niche-y down you go.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
If you go down to a group that's just enthusiastic about developing software, then they get less religious, right?

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
But if you go to a group that's all about GTK or free software, all about Qt, then they're going to be pretty passionate.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Understand your niche.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
And you're right.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
I think it's particularly hard, too, because Linux is just a big tent, right?

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
You have sys admin types, you have free software types, or you might have just people who want to write Python

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
and happen to run it all on Linux.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
So just avoid the word GNU if you can, and you will be okay.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
Now you're talking like the Red Hat Summit.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
Mike, we were down there, and I swear, they did not use the word free software once the entire week.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
It's all open source.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Kidding aside, they're definitely, at least from my kind of outside-in perspective, there's definitely a schism

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
between this is GNU, and all these proprietary companies are evil, and you can't just use Linux.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
You have to be Linux.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
And those of us who are trying to, again, don't want to hit this too hard, get a job done.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
So yeah, anybody, for instance, if you see someone raging on YouTube

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
about so-and-so company contributed X millions or billions of dollars to the Linux Foundation, that's evil.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
Well, that sentence itself is logically wrong, so ignore those people.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Some pragmatic advice from Mr. Dominic.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
All right, moving right along, we've got one more piece of feedback today.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
In our previous episode, a listener had asked about how to document a large system,

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
like databases, microservices, and more.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
And, well, we had some answers, but probably didn't do a good enough job.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
Someone else has written in, and one idea is a mind map tool, like Freeplane.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
This can provide a freeform way to show at a high level how all the parts link together

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
and attach as much details as needed, like credentials or screenshots or generated API documentation.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
And you know, I think that's a great idea, because anytime you can get something

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
that can capture some of the spirit of maybe like a whiteboard drawing that you have in a meeting

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
as you're diagramming a system architecture, if you can capture that in a way that is kept up to date,

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
that's the hard part, but that can be a huge boon, especially to, say, new developers on the team

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
who are really trying to understand the larger architecture.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
Do you use anything like that, Mike?

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah, I use a program on the Mac called OmniGraffle,

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
and in Chrome, I use draw.io when I'm on Linux.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
So I looked at the screenshots here.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
It's very similar.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
You can basically do charts, but I have not used this app in particular,

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
so I'm not sure where the differences would be.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
This is a nice visual way to do this, and I consider myself to be a visual learner

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
and a visual processor of information.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
Never really got into the mind maps, though.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
Draw.io, I think I'm going to give that a go.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
Really well done.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
You end up fighting with the tooling, and then you're like, is this even worth it?

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
I already know what I'm doing.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
You just need those barriers to be low

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
if you're going to get everyone involved to work on it.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
My way of tackling this particular problem would be a simple markdown document

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
where I outline all of the areas that need documentation,

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
and then I just continue to expand in on that

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
and then break it out into individual files,

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
which then could be later translated to a Wiki

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
or some other documentation database.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
Those tools can convert that to other formats,

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
and I've seen some neat little ASCII art to SVG graphic tools out there.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
No way.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
Yeah, so if you draw them in the right way,

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
that's great.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
you can then get richer graphics out of it in the end.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
I love that.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
I'll dig up one of those and throw it in the show notes, yeah.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
Lead podcaster indeed.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
That's the kind of stuff, Mike.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
That's the kind of stuff right there.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
It's fire.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
Okay, so while we're on this vein of documentation,

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
there's an interesting little new preference from our friends at Google.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
Obviously, Google I.O. went on last week,

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
and there was all kinds of interesting news,

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
but if you're an Android developer,

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
well, you may have noticed that, well, Android development,

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
it's basically Kotlin first now.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
Mike totally called this like almost two years on the nose.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
Called it because Java has Oracle,

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
and if you are from Google, who do you not like?

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
In the announcement, Google writes,

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
increasingly Kotlin first,

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
end quote, right there from Google.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
You know what, Chris and Wes, can you guys do me a favor?

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah, sure.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
Just a small favor now.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
Whip out that iron skillet for me.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
Get me some unfiltered bacon.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
This is the first of two times

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
I'm going to be frying some bacon today.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
Are you ready?

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah, fry it up.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
Well, we'll see.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
I don't know if we have it loaded in there.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
So this bacon is out of Eastern Europe.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Oh, yeah?

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah, is it tasty?

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
Oh, it's got a kind of a long history, long memory,

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
sort of not loving Russia feel to it.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
Because if you remember JetBrains,

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
which I have been corrected by JetBrains,

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
a number of time, it's not actually in Russia.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
Sorry.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
So JetBrains is a company that makes Kotlins.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
They also make the IntelliJ IDE,

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
which Android Studio is based on.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
When does Google just say,

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
thank you, welcome to Google?

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
It's going to happen, right?

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah, you think so?

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
You think so, huh?

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
Absolutely.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
Unless they're making so much money

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
that Google doesn't want to spend it,

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
but why wouldn't they just buy them?

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
Let's fry this up then.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
Let's fry it up.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
Go ahead, go ahead, Mike.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
We're frying it up right now.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
So within 180 days,

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
they're, oh, that's tasty.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
I like the aromas.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
I like it.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
I know.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
So I'm sorry, I didn't mean 180 days.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
I mean, a year and a half,

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
Google buys JetBrains.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
Oh.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
I mean, you nailed this part of the prediction

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
so far two years ago,

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
so this is part two now, really.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
Why wouldn't they?

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
Why wouldn't they buy

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
one of the better toolings?

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
I mean, they're a small,

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
little independent shop, right?

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
That's kind of ripe to be snatched up

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
by a giant behemoth.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
And they don't have the money

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
to support a language of this caliber,

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
especially if it becomes,

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
which it is becoming,

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
of course, yes, just do the math.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
Once Google's pushing this,

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
it's in their best interest

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
to own the entire tooling.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
And I mean, not only that,

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
but Google itself writes

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
a ton of Java, right?

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
I mean, that's kind of the backend

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
for most of their stuff,

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
and it's also the premier Java IDE.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah, and doesn't Oracle sue Google

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
like every two weeks?

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
So I mean,

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
they must also just like it themselves.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
They write here, too.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
If you're starting a new project,

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
you should write it in Kotlin.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
Code written in Kotlin

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
often means much less code for you,

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
less code to type, test, and maintain.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
So that's just a language win on its own.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
Yeah, kidding aside,

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
I've done some Kotlin in Java projects,

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
and given the choice,

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
I would do Kotlin every time.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
Like, no questions asked, yeah.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
There's Kotlin.js,

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
and there's even one targeted

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
at like native applications.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
So it's only going to be something

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
we see more of, I think.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
We also had a bit of a upplay

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
of Chrome OS and a downplay

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
of Fuchsia at Google I.O.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
Seems like at least

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
for the next several years,

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
the path forward for Google

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
is an Android and Chrome OS story,

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
and Fuchsia is going to continue

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
just to be an experiment.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
Some parties suspected all along

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
that Fuchsia was a research project,

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
maybe something to allow

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
some of their top engineers

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
something to work on

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
that was academically interested.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
And it surely will spin out results.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
It might provide models

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
that get upstreamed later

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
into the Linux kernel, for instance.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
It also works as a great leverage

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
to get lazy kernel developers

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
to create a new LTS kernel

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
that meets your needs,

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
and it continues to work

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
as great negotiating leverage

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
if we want to, and we're getting

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
it in that shape.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
I think that's really

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
what's happening here, is this is

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
a negotiating piece with the OEMs

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
and with the kernel development,

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
with upstream development,

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
because it benefits

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
the kernel development team a lot

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
to have Google spending a lot

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
of their development money

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
and resources on the Linux kernel.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
And if Google were to abandon

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
that development, it would be

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
a good portion of money

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
that would go elsewhere

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
into their own proprietary,

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
like, why are containers

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
so popular on Linux?

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
One big factor in that

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
was Google pioneering them

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
for their problems.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
Say it again, Wes.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
Say it again.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
We have containers

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
because of Google.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
Yeah, a lot of the memory

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
management stuff on ARM devices,

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
a lot of the power management

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
stuff.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
Power support.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
Yeah, boy.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
Right.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
I mean, you start to think

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
about all of the developers

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
that have come to the table

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
because of the Android ecosystem,

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
not even Google itself,

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
but then, like, your Qualicoms,

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
your Samsungs that have all come

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
to the table.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
I don't think Linus and GregKH

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
are ignorant to that fact.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
No.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
And so if you don't,

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
you never need to ship

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
a single Fuchsia product,

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
or you could ship a couple

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
of them even better.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
Yeah, tiny little embedded

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
things, throw a few out there.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah, ship a couple of them

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
so we can really ship this thing

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
if we want to.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
I don't know.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
And then, you know,

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
if they decide to play ball,

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
then they don't need to use it.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
And I think it's better

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
if everybody wins, right?

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
Because not only is Fuchsia OS

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
but their primary products

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
in the market right now

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
for operating systems,

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
Android and Chrome OS,

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
are all based on Linux.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
It's always good to have

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
some diversity anyway, right?

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
So it seems like Fuchsia

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
will bring some things.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
It did seem that Google

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
was furthering down

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
on some of their Linux kernel bets,

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
though, especially regarding

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
Chrome OS, which is every day

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
seemingly becoming more and more

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
like a regular Linux desktop

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
just with Google's branding on it.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
As a way to...

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
They're bringing Flutter over.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
You're going to have additional...

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
I say something like,

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
every Chrome OS machine

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
that's built in 2019

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
will support running Linux

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
applications or something like that.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
Right out of the box.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
During the keynote.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
Yeah, like a lot of things

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
are moving into place here.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
And right now,

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
on a current Chromebook,

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
you can go into like

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
the search app launcher thing,

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
type in terminal,

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
and in the background,

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
the dang thing sets up

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
a Debian 9 instance for you,

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
a container and launches it.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
This is cross-UI,

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
cross-platform toolkit,

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
I think powered by Dart

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
under the hood.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
And the idea is,

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
as we all want,

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
something that you can write

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
once and run everywhere.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
Flutter is targeting that,

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
and one of their targeted

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
or the supported platforms

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
is Chrome OS.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
So you can basically develop

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
native Chrome OS.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
I mean, it's still all using

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
Android, I think, under the hood.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
Another target, though,

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
it's just a shim

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
in their code for the moment,

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
I think that'll be the one

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
they target first,

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
or cute platforms,

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
but desktop Linux, right?

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
So you could be able to code

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
something in Flutter,

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
run it as a web UI,

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
or use Flutter to target

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
the Linux desktop.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
I don't know how it's going to

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
go, but that could be

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
very powerful because one thing

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
we've kind of missed

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
in the Linux world is we don't

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
just have one thing

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
to point people at

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
to develop apps.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
You can do it with Electron

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
or, okay, pick one

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
of the major toolkits

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
and hope that you make

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
the right choice

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
without really understanding

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
all the implications

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
of that.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
Mike, I'm curious

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
what your take.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
Have you played with Flutter?

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
I mean, you seem to already

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
be using some similar

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
or competing products.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah, I haven't really played

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
with Flutter more

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
than just doing a couple

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
sample Skunkworks things.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
I'm less optimistic

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
than you guys, I think.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
I think Flutter is going to be

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
for people who are so deep

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
into the Google Firebase

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
ecosystem where that's

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
kind of what they know,

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
which is fine.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
I really think

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
it's a serious

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
production tool at the moment.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
I think it's a fair hot take

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
and really can't argue with it.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
I think it is early days still.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
Can I just change tracks

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
for a second?

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
You know how there's

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
always that joke

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
that it's the year

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
of the Linux desktop,

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
which would be easy to make

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
right now when you've got

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
all of these different vendors

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
shipping these Linux shims.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
But something else

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
that you and I noticed

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
at Red Hat Summit

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
at the Flutter blog post,

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
all of these big summits

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
that just happened,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Google IO,

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
PyCon,

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
Red Hat Summit, and Build,

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
all very, very prominently

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
featured VS Code.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
All of them.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
Google showed VS Code

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
up on stage.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
This Flutter blog post

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
has VS Code in the blog post.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
Red Hat talked about

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
VS Code up on stage,

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
had slides talking about

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
VS Code up on stage.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
Build obviously talked

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
extensively about VS Code

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
and a lot of its new features.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
We talked about VS Code

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
remote last episode.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
That was one of the things

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
they talked about at Build.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
Just this is the year

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
of VS Code, holy shit.

19:59.000 --> 20:04.000
It's a flat pack that's like

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
super easy to install on Fedora.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
It's snapped up

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
officially by Microsoft,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
which is just insane.

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
And it was, again,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I just got to say this,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
on a Red Hat slide,

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
VS Code,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Microsoft Visual Studio Code

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
on a Red Hat slide.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
I think that might just further

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
prove Mike's prediction right.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
It's been very successful

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
for Microsoft

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
and has huge momentum.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
I bet that scares Google

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
a little bit,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
and that may be another reason

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
that JetBrains looks

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
appealing to them.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
That's right.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
That's right.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
So if you want to jump into

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
the Microsoft loves Linux thing,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
I'm going to need some bacon

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
out of the Pacific Northwest.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I love it.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
It's a double bacon episode.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Here we go.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
The burner's still hot.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Hints of maple.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
I should have been wearing

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
a shirt for this.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Oh, my.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Ah!

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Some sort of Redwood

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
kind of hint there.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
So I'm going to make an argument

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
that is going to inflame

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
the subreddit and YouTube,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
but too bad.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
If you are a Linux fan,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
but not a GNU Linux fan,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
come, let's say, October,

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
which I think it's really going

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
to be like August,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
but let's say October,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
the best distro of Linux,

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
bar none, is going to be

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Windows 10.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Because what is a Linux distro

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
if not a kernel with a bunch

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
of desktop and user experience

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
features built on top of it?

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
I mean, that's a big claim there.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Yeah, I mean, at first I was

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
going to call you crazy,

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
and then you added that second

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
part where you said,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
what is a Linux desktop

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
if not for something built

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
on top of a Linux kernel?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
And then I was kind of starting

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
to think maybe you have a point.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Well, think about it.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
So think about a guy like me

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
who has to support

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Windows software.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Oh, you're going to make me

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
throw up a little bit.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
But just hear me out.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Okay, okay.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
But deploys backends

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
almost exclusively to Linux,

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
actually right now

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
exclusively to Linux,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
and isn't particularly happy

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
with macOS hardware.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And anyway, Bootcamp,

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
let's just say Bootcamp

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
hasn't been getting the love

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
it should be on the Apple side.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
So if I need a good Linux

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
command line,

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
and if you haven't seen

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
the new terminal that Microsoft

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
is coming out with in the summer,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
you need to take a look at that.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
And I also need Windows desktop

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
application support.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I can think of no distro better

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
than Ciatia Nadella Edition

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
Windows 10.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
All right.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I mean, at the end of the day,

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
you still have to deal

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
with the hot mess

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
that is Windows.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And I think you can't discount

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
how frustrating that can be

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
for people that have been

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
dealing with Windows

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
for a long time.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Although I think there's a set

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
of quote-unquote power users

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
that you might argue

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
it's because they haven't

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
been exposed to the perhaps

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
better paradigms available

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
in the free software desktop,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
but they are good at Windows,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
and they might like Linux,

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
but don't feel like

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
they need to change.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
I was listening

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
to the excellent coverage

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
of just this very topic

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
in Linux Action News 105

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
earlier today,

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
and I kept going back and forth

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
about how I feel about this,

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
because on one hand,

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
it's kind of a huge win

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
for Linux, right?

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Because Microsoft basically

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
couldn't compete on the server

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
or with the large

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
enterprise developer mindset.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Or even the userland command line.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Yeah, not even the command line.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
And so they were basically

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
forced to ship

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
the full GPL Linux, right?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
I mean, you do have to

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
optionally add it or whatever,

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
but it's there

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
packaged by Microsoft.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
And they've always had

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
all these power,

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
and why it's threatening

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
is because they have more,

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
they just have more resources

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
to devote to the desktop, right?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
That's a lot of what they're doing.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
They have huge teams of people

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
to develop on this,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
so now they just have

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
a more pragmatic mindset.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
They can actually leverage

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
open source just as effectively

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
as the pure open source communities,

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
and they have

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
the commercial advantage.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Yeah.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
I'll tell you what.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
What the issue is

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
is fundamentally,

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
at the end of the day,

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
it's a great initiative,

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
but it's still Microsoft,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
and so they're doing it

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
exactly backwards.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
It starts with the name,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
the Windows subsystem for Linux.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Seriously, I'm not even joking.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
It starts at the name.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
They're doing a backwards approach.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
They are reverse engineering

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
their way into relevancy,

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
and it's a typical

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
top-down approach from Microsoft.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
It's the same issue they had

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
with mobile where they try to take

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
a full-fledged desktop operating system

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
and distill it down for mobile

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
instead of starting

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
from a clean slate

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
and building from the ground up

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
for mobile.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
They're doing the same thing here

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
trying to make...

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
They're still a legacy company

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
in many ways.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Right, they're trying to make

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
a relevant developer workstation

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
from a top-down approach

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
making something that has

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
everything turned on by default,

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
everything that's installed

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
by default,

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
a massive behemoth

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
that is 15 years worth

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
of desktop legacy,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
and they're bootstrapping into it

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
a Linux kernel that runs

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
in a really tight, tiny,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
well-designed VM.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
At the end of the day, though,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
it doesn't solve the problem

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
that is Windows.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Just like putting Windows

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
on a mobile device

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
doesn't make it

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
a mobile operating system,

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
they're not making this

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
a developer workstation.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
They're making it

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
more accommodating,

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
and they're making it

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
an easier stopgap

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
for people that haven't

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
taken the plunge

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
to a different platform.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
But I don't actually think

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
it solves the core issue,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
which is, fundamentally,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
they have a software-hardware

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
ecosystem issue.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
You know, you can crack jokes

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
about the quality

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
of Mac hardware,

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
but at least you know

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
what you're going to get,

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
and it's easy to spec it out,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
it's easy to request it,

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
it's conceivable,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
it's manageable.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
You go to Dell's website

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
or you go to Lenovo's website,

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
and it's a goddamn hot mess.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
You can't tell

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
what you're getting,

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
and you're getting upsells

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
in every different direction

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
for software packages

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
that are total shit shows

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
that make your machine run slow.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
None of those problems

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
have been solved yet.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
You can go get yourself

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
a service book

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
if you want to be

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
in the same exact situation

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
you are with Apple,

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
where only one vendor

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
is making the hardware.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
So they're really not solving

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
any of the overall

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
ecosystem problems

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
that make it extremely annoying

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
to use the Windows platform.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
It's better,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
and it makes it easier to use,

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
but it doesn't solve

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
the fundamentals.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
That's my opinion, though.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
I mean, if I was

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
a lifelong Windows user,

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I'd be thrilled

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
at this news.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
So you're looking at it

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
almost exactly backwards, actually.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
So you're doing exactly

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
what you think

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Microsoft is doing.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Windows is a feature

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
in a lot of industries

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
because Windows

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
is a certified platform

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
that someone on high

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
said this application

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
must ship on.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
So even if you're

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
a bash-loving developer,

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
it is a pain in the ass, frankly,

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
to have to carry

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
two laptops, right?

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
And honestly,

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
the problem with Windows

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
in my opinion,

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
I know this,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I'm much more forgiving

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
than I think most of our audience,

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
is that the C prompt

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
is basically an abortion

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
in terms of a command line.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
It's a joke.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Oh, it's so bad.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
So bad.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
I mean, the new terminal

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
does legitimately look good.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
It does fix it.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
Frankly, even without WSL2,

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
I mean, the hot take here

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
is now that it is a Linux kernel,

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
you could make

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
a sideways sort of weak,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
but definitely interesting argument

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
that Windows 10

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
really is a Linux distro.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
But even without that,

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
I would bet you

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
any amount of money

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
that there are a lot of developers

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
in our audience,

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
and not the ragey ones

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
who write into Reddit

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
every couple of weeks,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
but people doing their job

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
who are working on Linux

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
and popping up on Windows VM

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
because there's some

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
multi-million dollar application

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
that's WPF, C sharp,

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
and it's their job

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
to keep running,

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
whether it's duct tape

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
or wood glue or whatever

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
they need to do.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Fair enough.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
What came to my mind in this

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
is, is it partially a play

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
to just keep some

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Windows licensees happy?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Oh, for sure. Absolutely.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Because how many shops,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
you know, if you're lucky,

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
you have IT administrators

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
who are comfortable, you know,

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
adding Linux machines

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
to an active directory domain.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
But by and large, no, right?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
They have their infrastructure set up

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
probably for Windows laptops.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
So before, there might have been

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
enough developer pressure

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
to either get Macbooks

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
or, oh, you know,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
we really need a Linux laptop

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
that you have to custom support

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
for this.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
That argument kind of falls flat

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
with WS.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Yeah, absolutely.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
The whole thing is also,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I think, you're only having part

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
of the conversation, I should say,

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
unless we bring up Azure

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
because there's a big

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Azure development component

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
to this.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
And in the overall,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
like, year 2025,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
where you have the perfect,

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
ideal Microsoft world,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
and I imagine it to be this,

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
you have your on-premises

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Windows 10, Windows 7 workstations

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
that are connected

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
to an active directory

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
on-premises.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
And you have a lot of

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
current applications

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
that you've invested

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
a lot of years into development

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
running on those systems.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
But your future applications

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
are being developed.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Again, this is Microsoft's

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
ideal world.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Your future applications

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
are being developed

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
on Azure boxes,

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
running on Azure,

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
connected back to your

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
active directory,

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
which is likely running

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
on top of a Linux stack.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
And so for them,

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
if they can push down

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
a Linux development environment

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
to your Windows 10 machine

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
for all of these

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
on-premises Windows 10 boxes,

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
they've just enabled you

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
to do local development

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
for Azure systems.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
And I wouldn't discount the fact

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
that Canonical is coming out

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
and saying,

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
we are going to actually support

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
the Ubuntu U install on WSL2

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
because it's using

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
the same virtualizer

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
that we're supporting on Azure.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
That's massive scale.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
It's even sexier,

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
and I think it's going to be

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
very seductive,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
particularly to junior developers.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
You're forgetting the other,

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
I would say,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
the other piece of the Holy Trinity,

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
and that's GitHub.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
So let's say you pull down

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
your Azure environment.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Everything looks great locally.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
You push the GitHub.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Now there's a little prompt.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Why not just in Visual Studio

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
that says,

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
deploy to Azure instance

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
such and such GWT ID?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Done.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
No YAML files,

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
no bullshit with,

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
oh, you got to run my migrations

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
and my local versus

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
my production database

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
are in a different state,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
so I just took everything down.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Yes, I'm dunking on Rails.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
I don't know.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
I think like old guys,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
like us, frankly,

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
are going to,

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
because we know

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
how to do this deployments,

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
DevOps stuff already,

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
might not appreciate.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Think back to when you guys

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
were just starting.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Imagine an IDE, if you will.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Picture it,

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Sicily 1930.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
You have an IDE

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
that it says,

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
testing on local host.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Would you like to test

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
on virtualized Azure?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Huh, well it pulls down

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
your entire configuration

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
from Azure.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Great.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Would you like to push to GitHub?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Sure.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Push successful.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Your continuous integration

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
via App Center completed.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
I think now they call it

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Microsoft mobile app,

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
whatever they call it.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Would you like to deploy

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
your backend to Azure?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Click here.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Done.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
And they've already run the test.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
They've already run a help check.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
They've guaranteed

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
you're not going to be scrambling

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
for the rest of the day

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
with basically,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I broke my database via,

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
I'm going to use the word migrations,

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
but I know other ecosystems

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
have different words.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
I don't know.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Even me who knows how to do

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
all this stuff with scripts

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
might be like,

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
I really,

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
it's not valuable for me

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
to be fighting with

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
configuration files.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
No, I mean as much as you can

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
have taken care of for you,

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
especially if you have

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
more than enough work

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
just trying to finish

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
the feature you're working on,

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
that is a very appealing proposition.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
I mean I think Chris

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
will buy four more HomePods

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
and then a new Alienware

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Windows 10 PC

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
and he'll go on the

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Linux action news

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
and say,

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
this is the best distro,

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
but he'll wait a year

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
and he won't give me credit for it.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
That's going to be the other.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
That's my plan, yeah.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
It's a long-term plan.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
But it's great

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
that I can run these games.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Exactly.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
He's like,

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
I don't know.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
All I play is

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Magic the Gathering Arena

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
so I have no idea

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
what real games

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
are like anymore.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Don't you know

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
that the plan is

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
I'm just going to buy

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
really expensive Macs

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
with no GPUs

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
and then just buy external eGPUs

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
for the rest of my life?

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Oh, you have to go here, don't you?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
You've been keeping us

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
in the dark, Mike.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
We all want to know

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
more details

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
about what's going on over there.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
I mean you've inspired me.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
I've been experimenting

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
a little bit with an eGPU

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
with my ThinkPad laptop

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
and it's been kind of hit and miss.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
It's been an NVIDIA eGPU though

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
so I don't know

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
if that makes a difference

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
and I'm curious how

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
your adventures have gone

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
and if it's actually

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
worth the money.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
So yeah, my eGPU

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
is an OWC case

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
with a AMD Sapphire 560X.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
You can Google that if you want.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
That'd be a similar setup

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
I might go with.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah, and because I have to have it

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
work on Mac OS,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
NVIDIA was out of the question,

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
although maybe not pretty soon.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
This eGPU can plug into my Mac Mini,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
my Darter, and my HP Spectre

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
which runs Windows.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Wow.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
So that's three operating systems,

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
one eGPU.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Okay, so you've tried it

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
on all three then?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
I'd be curious

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
how they all variously fail.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I have used it on all three.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
So again, you say,

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
what was that?

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Three OSes, one GPU?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
I was hoping you wouldn't get that.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Yes, yes.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I won't even say the reference.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
So it works instantaneously

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
on Mac OS.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
No problem.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Because obviously Mac

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
is the one true operating system.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Aren't they even selling little kits now

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
that are pseudo-endorsed by Apple?

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Well, that's a $1,500 eGPU.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
But it's at least a notion

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
that they are aware of.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Yeah, so I think this is where

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Apple is going to answer

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
the I can't open up my Mac

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
and expand it question.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
And it works instantly.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
It's great.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Thunderbolt 3, everybody loves it.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Windows?

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Have you ever been to AMD's

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Windows driver website?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
You know, thankfully no.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
And I'm not intending to

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
any time soon.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
If you've seen the movie Hellraiser,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
you'll kind of get the theme,

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
very black and red,

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
very confusing.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
But it does work.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
It takes maybe like 45 minutes

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
to get it working.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Why did it take so long?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
What was the challenge?

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
Well, you have to run a Windows update

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
until you get a certain version

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
of Windows 10.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
And you have to kind of keep update.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
You know how Windows is.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
You have to pick if it's actually

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
going to give you the update.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
You have to kind of wait until it decides

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
that you have an update.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Update, then wait,

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
and then see if your update's there again,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
and then do the next round of that.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
And then restart a few times.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
And then install the AMD thing

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
and restart.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
And then while it loads,

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
it has to do something else

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
while it restarts.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
It's fun.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Now, you, Wes, put in a handy-dandy script here

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
for getting this set up on Ubuntu

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
that I did not see.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
That's right.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
I did it by hand.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
It's a pain in the ass.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
You have to fiddle around with the Misa utils,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Jar Jar Binks' favorite PPA.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
But once you have it running,

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
and you do have to restart,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
which, you know, I know Linux people,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
you say that never happens.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
But you do.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
It does work fine.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
I will say that this right now,

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
I would say the order is Mac, Windows, Linux

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
in terms of support.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
But the testing I did was on 18.10, not 19.4.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
So I'm wondering if the new update

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
with the new kernel might be a little better.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
And, yeah, I mean, this kind of has changed

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
how I think about workstations.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
So when you say it's changed

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
the way you think about workstations,

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
do you mean in the fact that

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
you're going to kind of, in the future,

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
buy a machine and not worry about it

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
having a baked-in GPU of any sort?

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Yeah, I think so.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Because I'm bound to basically buying machines,

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
it's very hard to replace the GPU.

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
I could see myself having a Mac and a Linux laptop

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
or a Windows and a Linux laptop

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
and just, when I need that kind of power,

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
hooking them up to the GPU.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
But most of the time, when I don't,

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
particularly because I travel a lot,

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I would just run them on the Intel integrated,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
whatever the hell, right?

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Yeah, I'm a little curious.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Have you done multiple workloads?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
I'm wondering if there's a difference

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
between having to configure it just to support

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
GPU offloading for training ML models or something

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
versus trying to get a fully accelerated desktop going.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
So on Windows in particular,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
there is a very obnoxious AMD app

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
that wants you to tweak it for what you're doing.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I did not do that because my Windows,

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
I really just tested it running some games on the HP Spectre.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
It was a little weird playing Tomb Raider on a Ultrabook

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
and having it look nice on an external monitor.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
Yeah, I have experienced that too with my ThinkPad.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
You're not joking.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
It really is something to have this tiny machine

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
that has no GPU and you're playing a full-fledged video game.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
And on Mac, it does it for you.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
In fact, I don't think there's an interface even.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
I looked it up to actually tweak it too much on Mac OS.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Having said that, Chris, can we spill the bacon here

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
or the beans that go with the bacon?

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
Ooh, you know, we do have so much bacon.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
We might as well have the beans too.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
One last little, here, we'll do the bacon ends here.

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
This is frying up the bacon ends, Mike.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
It's good, it's tasty.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Ooh, I can smell it.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
Yeah, all right, go ahead.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
So Chris shared with me today in Slack,

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
presumably to get me excited, that a Mac Pro was coming out.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
Oh, the leaked image of the cheese grater 2.0 style

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
is the rumor.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
With PCI slots, eight Thunderbolt ports.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Did you say eight?

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Yeah.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Wow, that's a beast.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
So are they actually recognizing that Macs could be good

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
if they put a tiny amount of effort?

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Damn, Wes, damn.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
It's a rumored leak, so don't get your hopes up.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
It's a rumored product image,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
and the image is from November 2018.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
So it's just a clever troll who realizes

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
that's what everyone wants.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
It was Chris taking his HomePod and Photoshopping it.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Just stretching it up.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.000
Yeah, no, but the real hot take here is NVIDIA support.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Yeah, which currently you can't even do on the Mac

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
with an eGPU.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Not unless it's the same architecture

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
as the old, old 2006, yeah.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
So that, if true, could be big

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
for a lot of these machine learning jobs

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
and the CUDA workloads and whatnot.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
It also means it's likely a fake leak.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
I'm just not buying it.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
Yeah, why do you do these things to me?

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
I don't know.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
For me, the issue with the eGPU

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
legitimately sounds like a compelling product,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
and having some experience, I bought myself,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I talked about this in Linux Unplugged,

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
they have a ThinkPad dock that has an NVIDIA 1060 built in.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Right, just built, integrated right in.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
So you get a Thunderbolt 3 dock

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
with all the traditional Thunderbolt 3 dock ports

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
with a GPU, and I thought, man, isn't that a great idea?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
So I tried it out to some success,

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
to also some issues, and I was very, very impressed.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
But I have to tell you,

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
every time I've wanted to use that eGPU dock

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
has not been when I'm at my desk.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
It's been when I'm traveling,

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
and I've got like three hours in a hotel room to kill.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
And I'm like, man, I wish I would have packed my eGPU dock.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Have you experienced that?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Because that's where I'd want to actually have it,

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
is when I got a couple hours to kill

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
and I want to play a video game.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
Yeah, so again, I know you're a much bigger gamer than I am.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
My game of choice is MTG Arena, which by the way,

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
if you're using desktop Linux, runs awesome on Nutris,

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
so you don't actually need a Windows install.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
Yeah, and Jason from Choose Linux plays,

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
and one day I will beat him.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
We've never played yet, because we're on different time zones.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
But actually, I have a few pain points

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
very different than that, though.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Like, the enclosure is bigger than my Mac Mini.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
That's not a storm behind him, that's the eGPU.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Yeah.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
It's just the eGPU.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
Right, so also, am I the only one in the world

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
who didn't know that Thunderbolt fails above a certain length?

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Well, it's a complicated protocol pushing a lot of data.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Yeah, it depends what you're doing.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
So what you're doing with that really, really high bandwidth

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
is like active Thunderbolt 3,

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
and it has to be a certain length cable, yeah.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
I guess that means the GPU has to be,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
the eGPU has to be fairly close to your face hole.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
Well, so the cable that comes with the OWC eGPU case that I have

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
is literally three and a half inches long.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Yeah.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
It's actually taught when I'm putting the Mac Mini

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
on top of the eGPU case and plugging it in.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
It's pathetic.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
And a six-foot cable costs, I don't know, an arm and a leg.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
Well, a six-foot cable of the right caliber to do this

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
costs a fortune, I found out, so I didn't do it.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
I don't know.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
And the other thing is, if Chris is just pulling my leg

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
and I can't run NVIDIA,

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
well, then really, for the only ML library that works well with AMD

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
is CoreML, because it's from Apple,

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
who up till now hates NVIDIA.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
Everything else is just better on NVIDIA.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
But you can swap cards in and out of that enclosure, right?

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
So you could have, in theory, an NVIDIA card that you swapped in

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
for certain workloads in an AMD card,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
and you're still kind of saving money,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
because you only have to buy one of each.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
I know that sounds crazy, but...

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Well, so the positive case that I would make

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
for someone like me who travels a lot,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
and maybe even someone like you,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
maybe even Wes, actually,

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
you could buy a new little Linux laptop every year or two,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
in my case, every three weeks,

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
and just plug it into your eGPU

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
and not spend money on an integrated graphics card.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
That's what I'm thinking.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
And it also means you'll likely get a smaller, lighter machine

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
that's better on airplanes.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Right. Oh, that's a good point.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Well, in the battery life,

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
those of us who do a lot of coding in airplane terminals,

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
nothing's worse than not being able to get an outlet

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
and having to patch something.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
And it's nice when you aren't using that,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
then you can just be, as you said, Mike,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
using the Intel graphics, which aren't great,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
but work beautiful when you're on an open-source desktop.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Yeah.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Especially when you just need like a terminal and a text editor.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
I mean, it's perfect.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Some electron apps, because you have to.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Excuse me, Flutter desktop apps?

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Yeah.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Oh, here we go.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Yeah, of course, of course.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Yeah, well, it all really depends on how energy efficient

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
the Windows subsystem for Linux is, apparently.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
That's what it's all about, baby.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
Listen, I'm showing up to Linux Unplugged one day,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
saying, hey, guys, check out my new desktop.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Look at the design.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
I have a background here of a square with four sub-squares.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
It's blue.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
And yeah, oh, look at this.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Look at this, I'm running games.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Have you guys heard of Steam?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
I hate you right now.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
All right, but I mean, all kidding aside,

41:52.000 --> 41:58.000
it kind of feels like you've transitioned to a new way.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Like there's no going back for you on the GPU thing.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Challenges aside, no.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Will you be building a big desktop

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
any time in the future, then?

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
So this is the irony.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Assuming Chris isn't screwing with me,

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
they finally come out with the Mac I want,

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
or they're allegedly coming out this summer or this fall,

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
and now I no longer give a crap about desktops.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
It's only been, what, five, six years?

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
Nice.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Go figure, right?

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Go figure.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Because think about it, 500 bucks a year,

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
I could get the new best spanking high-end GPU I want,

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
and not have to update to crazy Thaleo number four,

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
or crazy Mac Pro, or whatever Dell sells.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Right, and not to be like old man Chris here,

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
but kids, it's gotten to the point where I couldn't tell you

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
if I'm on a fourth-generation i7,

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
or a sixth-generation i7, or even a second-generation.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
It doesn't seem to matter.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
They're just so fast.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
At a certain point when you've got MB&E drives,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
you've got i7 processors,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
and you've got interchangeable GPUs,

42:59.000 --> 43:05.000
the base unit, the core machine, is pretty damn fast.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
And then it really just comes down to graphics and storage.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
And I've got network storage, too.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
Network storage adds a ton of additional storage to my machine.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Well, and don't forget Thunderbolt 3,

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
if you buy a high-end enough NVME Thunderbolt 3 NAS system,

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
that's nearly onboard performance.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Oh, yeah.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
I mean, we have a gigabit LAN here in the studio,

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
so it flies copy and files over to the free NAS, no problem.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
I mean, everything fails because of the old thermal throttling,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
but I'm ignoring that problem right now.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
Well, you externalize the GPU with decent cooling,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
and that makes your machine run cooler, too,

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
although it does heat up running that Thunderbolt bus as hard as it does.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
I just do all my development from the walk-in, so it's fine.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
I have to say, of all the three machines,

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
I will give the Galago one thing.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
It might always spin its fans up,

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
but it doesn't seem to suffer the way the HP does with the eGPU.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
The Spectre is very thin,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
so I can imagine they're really throttling that thing.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
It must be a tiny fan, and I got to say,

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
it sounds like one of those quadruped drones taking off.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
It's bad.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
So you're just embracing the tri-operating system lifestyle.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
You're not dual-booting anymore.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
You're tri-booting, and then with an eGPU in the mix now.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Like, this is getting complicated.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Wow.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
So I have a relatively crappy old Dell display.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
In fact, on Twitter, I'm asking people to recommend the new 27-inch matte.

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
I only want matte display that has DisplayPort.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
And then I have one of those Amazon laptop stands.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
So here's the deal.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Everything has Thunderbolt.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
You plug it in.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
If I need to work on Mac OS, I plug in the Air.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
If I need to work, or the Mac Mini, which is sitting here.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
But that's really supposed to be a server.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
If I need to work on Windows, I plug in the HP.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
If I need to work on Linux, I plug in the Darter, and we're good to go.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
Same keyboard, which is a DOS keyboard.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
Same mouse, which is my old Naga mouse that we had from before we started the show originally.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
Basically, I have built my own ghetto, or I think pretty fancy docking system.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Right, so you just have a little Thunderbolt cable dangling out there.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
You just plug in whatever you want.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
I like that.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
That's nice.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Yeah, and a Thunderbolt hub for all the USB crap, right?

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
So the keyboard.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Yeah.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
So the only kind of cognitive gymnastics you have to do is if you swap in a Mac,

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
you've got to swap the command and control keys stuff.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah, I sometimes get confused between POP and Mac all the time.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Oh, Gnome Shell, how Mac OS you've...

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
Or actually, more like Mac OS has become more like Gnome Shell, I think, really.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I'm just like, why doesn't my command work?

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I don't understand this, what's going on?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Yeah, but that's really the problem.

45:32.000 --> 45:39.000
I mean, the only thing I've noticed that's mildly annoying is the monitor I have does not have an in...

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
What do you call that? In built-in microphone.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Oh, sure.

45:43.000 --> 45:48.000
So taking conference calls doesn't work the way I would like it to.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
You just got to get yourself like a Logitech webcam or something.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
If you can recommend one, shoot it to me in Slack.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
C930E.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I could just Google that, okay.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Or C930 or C920.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
But C930 would be the...

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
We'll throw a link in the show notes.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
How about that?

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
We will.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
That's the one I use right there.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
It's got a nice wide-angle flat lens.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
And it's a mic as well or no?

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Yeah, it has a good dual-array stereo mic.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
So it does a decent job.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I mean, Mike, you're using a microphone right now.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
You do have a microphone, by the way.

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
I thought this was like a club I was supposed to hit invading barbarians with.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
It's for podcasting only.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
Actually, fair point.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
I did not.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
I literally never thought of that.

46:27.000 --> 46:33.000
You know what would be kind of fun is if people have kind of cool interesting setups that they'd like to share with us.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
They should do it.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Pictures too would be kind of cool.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Yeah.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Just go to coder.show slash contact.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
You can contact us that way.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Or, hey, it turns out we're all on Twitter.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
I'm at Westpane.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Mike, you're...

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
At Tumenuco.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
And I'm at Chris LAS.

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
You can find the whole network there too at Jupiter Signal.

46:53.000 --> 46:58.000
We do this show live every Monday right about noon Pacific.

46:58.000 --> 47:04.000
You can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to a time zone near you.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
That'll be it for today's show.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Thanks for joining us.

47:07.000 --> 47:34.000
We'll see you next time.

47:37.000 --> 47:48.000
Bye-bye.
