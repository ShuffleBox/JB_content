This is Koto Radio, episode 312 for June 4th, 2018.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.040
Hi everyone and welcome to Koto Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:35.040 --> 00:40.200
pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.680
This episode is brought to you by our two great sponsors, DigitalOcean and Linux Academy.

00:44.680 --> 00:48.120
I'll tell you more about those great sponsors as this here show goes on.

00:48.120 --> 00:54.000
My name is Chris and joining us every single week is our host, Mr. Michael Dominic.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.080
Hello, Mike.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.840
Hello, Mr. Chris.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.840
How are you doing?

00:58.840 --> 01:02.680
Are you up all hours of the morning watching keynotes and reading tech news today?

01:02.680 --> 01:05.280
I have been so deep in the tech news.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.300
This is like a gift from the tech gods.

01:07.300 --> 01:11.920
It has been a big day, as they say, because it was officially announced today.

01:11.920 --> 01:16.280
It's been rumored for a little bit, but officially announced today that Microsoft is acquiring

01:16.280 --> 01:17.280
GitHub.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.280
That process has now started.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.280
It is public.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.280
We're going to be talking about that.

01:20.280 --> 01:25.480
And of course, it's also Apple's WWDC 2018 kickoff keynote day.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.460
So a lot to talk about today.

01:27.460 --> 01:31.320
Everything we took notes and we came prepared, like you got a beer and I took notes.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.540
So I think we're pretty much set.

01:34.540 --> 01:37.720
So let's do that to go.

01:37.720 --> 01:42.040
Let's save feedback for next week, because we've got so much to get into that I think

01:42.040 --> 01:44.240
we should probably just start here.

01:44.240 --> 01:46.960
And let's save the GitHub stuff for a little bit.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.440
And let's kick off with the news of the day, which is WWDC.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.880
We both just got done watching and streaming.

01:52.880 --> 01:59.820
And it really came down to a few sections, iOS 12, watchOS 5, the Mac, and that really

01:59.820 --> 02:00.820
was kind of it.

02:00.820 --> 02:01.820
There wasn't really...

02:01.820 --> 02:02.820
There was no HomePod mentioned.

02:02.820 --> 02:03.820
So I'm sorry.

02:03.820 --> 02:04.820
I know that disappointed you.

02:04.820 --> 02:05.820
No HomePod.

02:05.820 --> 02:08.360
I cried.

02:08.360 --> 02:13.200
And Apple TV, I suppose, was in the mix too, but I didn't take many notes for Apple TV.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.680
So let's start with iOS 12.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.680
What do you say?

02:15.680 --> 02:16.680
Yeah.

02:16.680 --> 02:22.200
You know, I think just right up front, we need to remind the listenership that WWDC

02:22.200 --> 02:25.280
stands for Worldwide Developer Conference.

02:25.280 --> 02:30.520
That's something that may have been easy to forget during this presentation.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.680
I was not pleased.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.680
So iOS 12.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.520
I mean, maybe we should get your impressions first, because I'm going to come down pretty

02:37.520 --> 02:38.520
hard.

02:38.520 --> 02:39.740
Nothing major.

02:39.740 --> 02:45.400
The newest stuff, they really sort of started off with performance, particularly performance

02:45.400 --> 02:48.560
for oldest devices, which that's going to sell.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.920
They announced a new cross-device VR file format that Adobe's working with too to create

02:52.920 --> 02:56.480
content creation tools called.USDZ.

02:56.480 --> 03:01.120
And they announced a new AR app called Measure, as well as some updates to Photos to try to

03:01.120 --> 03:04.120
get more competitive with Google Photos.

03:04.120 --> 03:09.160
But I think the big stuff, which I can save if you want, was the Siri stuff.

03:09.160 --> 03:12.720
Yeah, the Siri shortcut is interesting.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.760
It looks pretty limited.

03:14.760 --> 03:20.080
I don't, you know, I would like less Siri in my life in general.

03:20.080 --> 03:24.040
I don't see a whole ton of people running out and writing apps specifically to take

03:24.040 --> 03:25.700
advantage of the Siri shortcuts.

03:25.700 --> 03:30.720
So the Siri shortcuts is also, well, it's really more of a user thing too, because you

03:30.720 --> 03:36.440
can assign your own phrases and then essentially like using workflow style macros, create little

03:36.440 --> 03:40.780
functions like I'm going home and then it gets you directions, set your home kit settings

03:40.780 --> 03:46.880
to 70 degrees, sends a text to a significant other, and then begins to play the NPR radio,

03:46.880 --> 03:48.880
whatever you may have set in your macro.

03:48.880 --> 03:54.080
So that way Apple doesn't have to try to invent every possible esoteric use case for Siri.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.320
They're just going to let users create it.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.760
They just basically punt it.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.680
Let the apps do the work.

03:59.680 --> 04:00.960
Let the apps do the work.

04:00.960 --> 04:01.960
Yeah.

04:01.960 --> 04:06.200
And a bunch of core apps got iPad versions, app limits, which give you now reminders to

04:06.200 --> 04:07.680
take a break.

04:07.680 --> 04:12.280
Collectivity reports, based on what you see too, you can give your kids allowances based

04:12.280 --> 04:16.400
on how they use their device, i.e. if they use their devices less, you can reward them.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.320
They announced Apple Books, which is replacing iBooks, and some changes to notifications

04:21.320 --> 04:25.980
like group notifications by topic, thread, and app, and group FaceTime.

04:25.980 --> 04:29.880
That's really the things that stood out to me for iOS 12.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.520
Now you seem like you got a different impression.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.520
Yeah.

04:33.520 --> 04:37.760
I, you know, I would almost rather take the conference as a whole.

04:37.760 --> 04:38.760
Okay.

04:38.760 --> 04:44.840
I only saw maybe, or the conference, the keynote as a whole, I only saw maybe three, maybe

04:44.840 --> 04:49.200
four things that really were interesting to developers, and I'm not going to count dark

04:49.200 --> 04:52.200
mode for Xcode or Mac OS.

04:52.200 --> 04:56.600
One because Xcode finally getting dark mode is not something they should be bragging about.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.000
Just throwing it out there.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.980
Some of the ML stuff around Core ML 2 and their machine kit stuff with Swift looks interesting,

05:06.980 --> 05:12.860
but that is a major departure from how that domain space typically works.

05:12.860 --> 05:18.680
And I'm not convinced that it's going to be attractive for a lot of people to basically

05:18.680 --> 05:26.320
train their models, their machine learning models, using a GUI app on a Mac in Swift,

05:26.320 --> 05:31.520
especially when a lot of machine learning algorithms work really well with Nvidia CUDA

05:31.520 --> 05:37.000
cards and Apple does not offer that.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.960
So that felt odd to me.

05:38.960 --> 05:43.640
I guess the desired use case is one might want to add some sort of machine learning

05:43.640 --> 05:49.060
element to an existing application or into a Mac or iOS app, and this is just an easy

05:49.060 --> 05:53.900
way to do that coming from the position of an iOS developer.

05:53.900 --> 05:59.480
It's certainly interesting, certainly accelerating with Metal may give Metal a reason to exist.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.560
That's not games.

06:02.560 --> 06:09.780
I felt a little bit like, honestly, the big plan for this keynote was going to be Marzipan,

06:09.780 --> 06:14.360
the cross-platform iOS and Mac thing they mentioned at the end, but it just wasn't ready.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.800
Yeah, so let's talk about that.

06:16.800 --> 06:21.260
Let's talk about Marzipan just for a second, because that is maybe the biggest news, ironically,

06:21.260 --> 06:22.980
which is not even going to be until next year.

06:22.980 --> 06:23.980
They said-

06:23.980 --> 06:24.980
Until next year.

06:24.980 --> 06:25.980
Yeah.

06:25.980 --> 06:30.560
It's going to be something that they'll ship their new apps like Home and News and Stocks

06:30.560 --> 06:32.480
apps that's going on Mac OS.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.660
That's built with Marzipan or whatever they're calling it.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.920
They didn't give it a name.

06:36.920 --> 06:41.780
They're going to try that for a year, and then however that goes, then they'll incorporate

06:41.780 --> 06:47.120
changes and improvements, and then they'll release it to developers in 2019.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.920
The more I hear about this, though, is this Electron that they're creating?

06:49.920 --> 06:52.840
Are they creating a new Electron?

06:52.840 --> 06:56.800
But with their own technologies, so it's Electron for the Apple ecosystem?

06:56.800 --> 07:03.420
No, it's adding from the very little that's leaked and the very little they showed on

07:03.420 --> 07:11.100
stage today, it's adding basically UI kit hooks into app kit.

07:11.100 --> 07:16.400
I was actually pretty hopeful for it, because I could see a world where you run an iOS app,

07:16.400 --> 07:20.960
and then just theoretically, I was doing a little architecture in my head during the

07:20.960 --> 07:22.160
keynote.

07:22.160 --> 07:26.720
Let's say you had an iOS app that gathered a bunch of data or did a bunch of AR tagging.

07:26.720 --> 07:32.740
Then you brought it back to your Mac, let's say your iMac Pro, and did a bunch of machine

07:32.740 --> 07:34.520
learning on that data.

07:34.520 --> 07:38.320
That would be a good place to take advantage of something like Marzipan to share the code

07:38.320 --> 07:42.280
between both sides of the application.

07:42.280 --> 07:48.080
Now the reality is someone can do that much easier in a number of other technologies,

07:48.080 --> 07:49.080
including C-Sharp.

07:49.080 --> 07:56.360
You can just do a Xamarin app and do a – you can just write a desktop app in C-Sharp or

07:56.360 --> 07:59.040
pal whatever you want.

07:59.040 --> 08:04.360
I don't know.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.760
I don't have a lot positive to say about this keynote.

08:06.760 --> 08:12.000
I was hoping – when it kept dragging on and they kept showing ridiculous stuff for

08:12.000 --> 08:16.760
the watch, I was thinking, okay, so they're dragging this out.

08:16.760 --> 08:17.760
There's going to be something.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.960
Is there going to be a Macbook Pro?

08:19.960 --> 08:22.600
Is there going to be – is Marzipan maybe actually coming out?

08:22.600 --> 08:26.160
I was thinking they really should update the Macbook Pro, even if it's just a quick update

08:26.160 --> 08:27.160
with a new keyboard.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.520
It's like a swap out the keyboard.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.520
Although I think it's underwhelming.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.520
I think the whole thing was underwhelming.

08:32.520 --> 08:36.640
It was very consumer focused, but there were – I don't know.

08:36.640 --> 08:40.700
It's unusual for Apple to talk about something that you're not even going to get your hands

08:40.700 --> 08:44.280
on for a year and kind of sneak that little information out there.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.600
I thought that was interesting.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.000
So Marzipan may not be shipping, but they're at least talking about it.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
They're just like, you know what?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Everybody's been rumored about it.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.480
Or what about the fact that they just addressed the whole, are you going to integrate MacOS

08:54.480 --> 08:55.480
and iOS head on?

08:55.480 --> 08:57.360
There's just a big nope slide up on screen.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.960
Well, that's what makes me think that the original plan was they were just going to

09:00.960 --> 09:07.340
announce and release Marzipan, and when it wasn't ready, they had to back off of it.

09:07.340 --> 09:12.880
Just one other point I want to throw in here, ARKit, adding additional functionality to

09:12.880 --> 09:16.440
ARKit is really interesting, but then Apple immediately – Sherlock's one of the more

09:16.440 --> 09:21.640
interesting things you could do with ARKit in terms of the measurements.

09:21.640 --> 09:26.120
In particular, it almost felt like Apple was really excited to be their own app developer

09:26.120 --> 09:29.560
instead of a platform vendor, which was weird to me.

09:29.560 --> 09:35.060
A lot of this presentation was – I mean, seriously, walk down this road with me.

09:35.060 --> 09:39.440
In an alternate universe, their presentation makes a lot more sense when at the end of

09:39.440 --> 09:45.280
the day, you're like, oh, and Marzipan is available now, developer.apple.com, the beta

09:45.280 --> 09:47.880
– we're releasing in a week, right?

09:47.880 --> 09:51.200
And by the way, you've already seen it in stocks, home, blah, blah, blah, here, all

09:51.200 --> 09:52.200
these apps.

09:52.200 --> 09:58.200
Instead, it was like, yeah, we're not done yet, and we don't have anything.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.840
Okay, I just – devil's advocate, right?

10:00.840 --> 10:02.800
I came into this, Chris.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.480
I have my MacBook set up.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.880
I set up a whole tool chain.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.480
I was ready to go.

10:07.480 --> 10:14.040
My plan was, whatever new API, if it was Marzipan or if it was something else, I was going to

10:14.040 --> 10:18.640
pound out an app within the next month and get it out the door as kind of a marketing

10:18.640 --> 10:19.640
thing.

10:19.640 --> 10:24.040
That gave me nothing, right?

10:24.040 --> 10:27.640
There was no app that I could write today that I couldn't have written yesterday.

10:27.640 --> 10:32.000
I guess it depends on the lens you're looking at because they did add new features to watch

10:32.000 --> 10:34.680
OS, which you say we're all kind of screwing around, but the stuff they added to watch

10:34.680 --> 10:36.840
OS seemed sort of relevant.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.520
You get third-party apps that can play background audio now.

10:39.520 --> 10:44.600
There's some vague improvements to what complications and access third-party apps get to that, and

10:44.600 --> 10:47.420
podcasts on the watch are huge for me.

10:47.420 --> 10:50.640
I think that's going to be great for our audience that have Apple Watch.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.320
So there's some stuff in there that I think is decent.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.560
It just depends on where you look.

10:54.560 --> 10:58.380
I grant you there is hardly nothing brought to the Mac that's of any interest to developers

10:58.380 --> 10:59.520
at all.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.720
I grant you that.

11:00.720 --> 11:05.520
But iOS 12, I think maybe you might be underselling some of that, and same with watch OS, but

11:05.520 --> 11:07.200
I think you've nailed it with the Mac.

11:07.200 --> 11:11.440
Well, the watch OS is they're just removing self-imposed restrictions, right?

11:11.440 --> 11:19.720
I mean, the only reason they didn't want background audio before was presumably battery life concerns,

11:19.720 --> 11:22.760
or they just didn't have the ability to hook it into the API.

11:22.760 --> 11:28.040
I mean, be the HomePod Apple defender.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.080
Tell me, what did I miss?

11:30.080 --> 11:33.560
No, I think it's a very...

11:33.560 --> 11:37.840
Okay, I'll tell you, you want to know my big theory about it, and it's...

11:37.840 --> 11:40.120
Yeah, fry me some bacon.

11:40.120 --> 11:47.080
I have already mentioned it once, but after watching the recent keynote and other actions

11:47.080 --> 11:51.400
recently, I think I'm right, and I have a theory as to how something could possibly

11:51.400 --> 11:56.080
be at a company as rich as Apple that the people running it don't know how to use computers.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.280
Now stick with me, because I know that sounds like a controversial thing to say, and, oh,

11:59.280 --> 12:06.800
Chris is just taking shots, but I think we have a serious problem here, and I think it

12:06.800 --> 12:12.200
starts at the top, and I'll explain my logic, because I think it explains why you're disappointed

12:12.200 --> 12:13.960
from a pro user standpoint.

12:13.960 --> 12:18.520
They're up on stage, and they're constantly saying, this was designed, in fact, I grabbed

12:18.520 --> 12:21.040
one of the quotes, and I don't know if I...

12:21.040 --> 12:25.840
Yeah, inspired by pro users, designed for everyone, and then they kept saying, this

12:25.840 --> 12:27.400
is something pro users really want.

12:27.400 --> 12:33.160
They said that several times on stage, and yet everything seems very, very consumer focused.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.520
Very little new stuff was opened up for developers.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.140
No major new kits were announced.

12:38.140 --> 12:43.160
It was more like a cleaning up, which is good, but I have a theory as to why this is happening.

12:43.160 --> 12:46.240
So first let's talk about Linux Academy, because that's why I'm on the road right now.

12:46.240 --> 12:51.600
I'm in Cortez, Colorado, and I'm on my way down to see Linux Academy to help them get

12:51.600 --> 12:53.880
their broadcast system on Linux.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.560
They brought in some new folks, the new folks knew how to use it on the Mac, and we're gonna

12:56.560 --> 13:00.640
go down and help them get it working on Linux, and go to Texas Linux Fest, and Linux Academy

13:00.640 --> 13:01.880
is committed to Linux.

13:01.880 --> 13:06.640
They're enthusiasts about Linux, developers, educators, they got together and they said,

13:06.640 --> 13:09.200
let's create a platform to teach people more about Linux.

13:09.200 --> 13:13.080
It's a full-featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills and

13:13.080 --> 13:14.200
advance your career.

13:14.200 --> 13:18.760
They have self-paced, in-depth video courses on every cloud, Linux, and DevOps topic.

13:18.760 --> 13:23.800
If it can run Linux or Linux runs on it, you can find a course about it at Linux Academy.

13:23.800 --> 13:28.060
They have hands-on scenario-based labs that give you experience on real servers, full-time

13:28.060 --> 13:32.880
humans that can help you whenever you get stuck, and if you're busy, no problemo.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.360
They have a course scheduler, you can set a time frame, set learning goals, stick to

13:36.360 --> 13:37.360
it.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.360
It's pretty great.

13:38.360 --> 13:42.080
Now if you go to linuxacademy.com slash coders, it's got an S on the end of it, linuxacademy.com

13:42.080 --> 13:46.720
slash coders, you can sign up for a free seven-day trial, and you can support the show.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.640
They also have training for particular types of certification, if you wanna go and get

13:50.640 --> 13:51.640
your certs.

13:51.640 --> 13:55.480
They've got learning paths if you wanna get down to a particular career track, maybe you

13:55.480 --> 13:56.480
wanna move tracks.

13:56.480 --> 14:00.160
They have a series of courses and content planned by their instructors to get on specific

14:00.160 --> 14:01.160
career tracks.

14:01.160 --> 14:06.000
And of course, they've got iOS and Android apps too, linuxacademy.com slash coders.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.760
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Coder Radio program, linuxacademy.com

14:10.760 --> 14:12.200
slash coders.

14:12.200 --> 14:17.360
So I think what's happening at Apple, and this is a wild speculation just based on years

14:17.360 --> 14:23.520
of observation now, and I think Steve Jobs built that company in a way to be run from

14:23.520 --> 14:24.740
the top.

14:24.740 --> 14:29.800
And it is architecturally designed in such a way that you've got your chiefs, you've

14:29.800 --> 14:35.160
got your Phil Schillers, and you've got your Craig Federighis, and others, and then you've

14:35.160 --> 14:38.800
got what used to be Steve at the top is now Tim at the top.

14:38.800 --> 14:43.600
But Tim is an old Compaq guy who ran operations before he came to Apple.

14:43.600 --> 14:48.720
He was never in the nuts and bolts of Compaq, and he's not a big computer user.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.520
I mean, he's even said it himself, he's more of an iPad user.

14:51.520 --> 14:55.000
And then you look at Craig Federighi, he seems to be perhaps the most technically competent

14:55.000 --> 15:02.380
of all of them, but he's a man, a middle-aged man who has a family, he has a very big career,

15:02.380 --> 15:04.960
he has a lot of things going on, lots of people to manage.

15:04.960 --> 15:10.320
He's probably not going home on the weekends and trying to build a Hackintosh or trying

15:10.320 --> 15:16.720
to try something brand new in machine learning on his Macbook with an eGPU.

15:16.720 --> 15:20.020
There's a chance he's tried it, but it's probably not something he's passionate about.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.120
And so the people...

15:21.120 --> 15:25.440
And Phil Schiller, again, he's a marketing guy, a marketing genius really, but he's not

15:25.440 --> 15:26.440
a technical expert.

15:26.440 --> 15:33.160
So you don't have an executive at the top now who is a PC user, a computer user, or

15:33.160 --> 15:38.840
even just enthusiastic about technology in a fundamental way, like willing to risk everything

15:38.840 --> 15:43.800
and build a company in his garage so they could sell some wood boxes with computer parts

15:43.800 --> 15:45.760
in them with his esoteric buddy.

15:45.760 --> 15:50.200
Like you gotta be really into it to do that, and there's nobody at the company at the top

15:50.200 --> 15:51.200
anymore.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.840
Of course, you've got tons of developers, thousands of developers and computer experts

15:54.840 --> 15:58.400
throughout the company that are incredibly passionate about this stuff, and they're the

15:58.400 --> 16:00.520
ones that are writing the good code, right?

16:00.520 --> 16:04.400
They're really just super passionate, but they don't run the company.

16:04.400 --> 16:09.720
And I think the DNA of Apple from the day Steve Jobs started it is such that it is a

16:09.720 --> 16:11.120
top-run company.

16:11.120 --> 16:16.040
It has an executive that sits at the top, and now it's a team of executives, and this

16:16.040 --> 16:21.880
team of executives decides based on customer stat data, what the customer stat data is,

16:21.880 --> 16:26.120
on what the cost for manufacturing is, what the marketing message is, and they sit there

16:26.120 --> 16:29.840
and have these conversations and they decide on what's gonna ship.

16:29.840 --> 16:33.480
And it is to abstract from the actual people.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.200
And so that's why they actually do the work.

16:35.200 --> 16:41.480
And so that's why they've had to go assemble a pro team that could do pro work and advise

16:41.480 --> 16:46.000
them on the new features that should be in Mac OS, because they don't know.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.480
They don't use them.

16:47.480 --> 16:48.800
They don't use Final Cut.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.240
They don't use Logic.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.780
They don't use Xcode.

16:52.780 --> 16:54.120
They don't know.

16:54.120 --> 16:59.160
And so they need to hire people, which are essentially yes-men, to tell them what to

16:59.160 --> 17:00.160
do.

17:00.160 --> 17:05.560
And what we've got is just a little bit more of the same now with dark mode.

17:05.560 --> 17:11.000
And it's disappointing because it's like the Mac App Store is all well and good, and it

17:11.000 --> 17:15.120
looks like a decent update, and there's some new apps like BBEdit that have never been

17:15.120 --> 17:19.600
in there that are long-standing pro Mac apps that are coming.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.920
But there was no mention about upgrade pricing.

17:21.920 --> 17:25.760
There was no mention about any of that kind of stuff that's gonna solve real issues for

17:25.760 --> 17:30.840
large-scale applications that cost tens of thousands of dollars to create.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.280
Why?

17:32.280 --> 17:35.120
Why after all this time has that not been addressed?

17:35.120 --> 17:36.120
Why?

17:36.120 --> 17:37.360
They just don't know.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.560
They're disconnected.

17:38.560 --> 17:42.740
So they're kind of just going around by what all of their crew tell them, and then they

17:42.740 --> 17:47.160
make decisions based on factors that probably are different than the factors you and I would

17:47.160 --> 17:52.280
make decisions on.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.600
I'm thinking if I agree with you or not.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.080
I don't think I agree with you, actually.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.080
Or maybe...

17:58.080 --> 17:59.440
How could it be any other way?

17:59.440 --> 18:00.440
How could it be any other way?

18:00.440 --> 18:02.520
I mean, just look what they're producing year after year.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.000
Look at the MacBook Pro.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Right.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.880
So there's two categories of complaint I have.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.620
One is the hardware is not for me, right?

18:10.620 --> 18:14.560
Which I think your theory works there.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.560
So I'm not...

18:15.560 --> 18:16.560
Let's just table that, right?

18:16.560 --> 18:19.200
I will concede that point.

18:19.200 --> 18:23.220
They're obviously trying to keep the Mac as a high-end development platform.

18:23.220 --> 18:24.760
And they...

18:24.760 --> 18:29.000
That little Swift tool they have to do machine learning in Swift is something I'm going to

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
check out.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.180
Because if that actually works, right, with that nice little easy GUI, that's pretty good.

18:37.180 --> 18:41.920
It's weird that it's not following the industry standards.

18:41.920 --> 18:48.160
You know, devil's advocate, your Apple, therefore you must use Swift, I guess.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.160
You see what I'm saying?

18:49.160 --> 18:50.160
The standard's Python, right?

18:50.160 --> 18:51.160
Not an Apple.

18:51.160 --> 18:54.160
I'm just...

18:54.160 --> 18:55.160
Right.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.160
I get it.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.160
But like Microsoft, you can do it in F sharp.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.840
You're fine.

18:59.840 --> 19:10.860
What I don't get is almost like an argument mismatch here in terms of I tune into a developer

19:10.860 --> 19:19.520
keynote from the richest company in the world, ready, willing, and able to develop some sort

19:19.520 --> 19:23.280
of new software on their platform.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.600
I don't get a whole lot new.

19:25.600 --> 19:32.080
Now, it may be also the case that because of what you said, because of your theory,

19:32.080 --> 19:35.780
the people presenting the information just failed to present it in a light that would

19:35.780 --> 19:37.220
have been attractive to me.

19:37.220 --> 19:40.200
So I'm certainly going to watch the session videos and look through the private...

19:40.200 --> 19:43.040
Yeah, and the State of the Union and all that.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.640
It may actually be true that there is something...

19:45.640 --> 19:50.220
My expectation was at minimum, there was going to be some amazing new ARKit APIs.

19:50.220 --> 19:57.920
And I have an idea of something I want to do if ARKit was just incrementally improved.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.000
But that's not what they told me, right?

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
I mean, you're asking me to make a...

20:03.000 --> 20:05.580
Well, I guess you're not.

20:05.580 --> 20:08.240
You're saying it just doesn't exist because they don't care to do it.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.480
Is that basically your point?

20:09.480 --> 20:11.960
Well, I think it's a little...

20:11.960 --> 20:14.660
So let's stick with ARKit for a second.

20:14.660 --> 20:19.280
It's very possible that they're at the developer level, there's new stuff they've put in there

20:19.280 --> 20:25.060
that just goes up in a word cloud for 25 seconds or if that, maybe five seconds in the background.

20:25.060 --> 20:29.520
But then if you were to go to the actual sessions at WWDC or go to the State of the Union, you

20:29.520 --> 20:33.180
may find out about a new set of APIs because there is a new version of ARKit.

20:33.180 --> 20:36.160
So there's likely new functionality for developers to take advantage of.

20:36.160 --> 20:41.600
But the people that are presenting the information, not only are they trying to target it for

20:41.600 --> 20:45.920
a general audience in the press, but they also genuinely don't understand and know how

20:45.920 --> 20:50.600
to distinguish between something that is really applicable to developers versus something

20:50.600 --> 20:52.620
that is just a nice new feature.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.240
I think they don't know...

20:54.240 --> 20:57.520
Probably Craig Federighi is in the unique position to understand that.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.900
And I think that's the issue, is you've got one really strong, technically competent player

21:01.900 --> 21:03.400
in that executive team.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.400
Okay.

21:04.400 --> 21:10.640
But I don't even know if I'm arguing against you now, I'm just frankly complaining.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.960
If you're serious about machine learning and you want Swift to be a good machine learning

21:13.960 --> 21:14.960
language, fine.

21:14.960 --> 21:15.960
You know what?

21:15.960 --> 21:16.960
I would be okay with that, right?

21:16.960 --> 21:17.960
I am not religious.

21:17.960 --> 21:24.720
I love my System76 stuff, I love POP, I would totally work on a Mac if it was easier.

21:24.720 --> 21:30.640
Then you need to ship CUDAs, you need to ship NVIDIA CUDA graphics cards, right?

21:30.640 --> 21:35.680
The fact that a company with 30 people or however big they are now just released a laptop

21:35.680 --> 21:41.240
that will do a better job than a MacBook Pro that cost a thousand dollars more at a task

21:41.240 --> 21:45.400
that Apple just highlighted in their keynote is ridiculous to me.

21:45.400 --> 21:50.200
The company I'm talking about is System76, but it is a fact, Chris, that if you are doing

21:50.200 --> 21:54.680
machine learning and you are, for whatever odd reason, trying to train your models on

21:54.680 --> 22:01.200
your own laptop, you definitely want at least a CUDA card, right?

22:01.200 --> 22:08.480
The guy said that unless what Apple thinks is that you are not going to do any high-end

22:08.480 --> 22:09.480
machine learning.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.440
What you are going to do is you are going to add a little bit of machine learning to

22:12.440 --> 22:16.800
an app and then I'm going to – then you are in this weird argument of what is like

22:16.800 --> 22:22.440
scripting and just like statistical analysis and what is machine learning because that

22:22.440 --> 22:23.440
seems weird.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.440
I agree with you.

22:24.440 --> 22:29.120
It sounds like Craig Federighi was deadly serious on stage about that, right?

22:29.120 --> 22:32.320
He very much seems to know what he is talking about.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.360
I just don't understand.

22:33.360 --> 22:39.840
Why would you not put your best foot forward and say, this is ARKit 2 and here is the ten

22:39.840 --> 22:45.720
new things you can do with it and this is CoreML 2 and what is it, MachineKit was the

22:45.720 --> 22:48.960
other one?

22:48.960 --> 22:50.280
I don't think I grabbed it.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.600
Oh, Metal for Machine Learning.

22:51.600 --> 22:52.600
Okay.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.600
Metal for Machine Learning.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.600
Okay.

22:54.600 --> 22:55.600
And this is why you want to do that.

22:55.600 --> 23:02.760
Instead, we had to have this very long explanation about exercise during a developer keynote.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.480
Have you met developers?

23:04.480 --> 23:05.480
I know.

23:05.480 --> 23:08.360
That was – the whole on the bike thing was – that was weird.

23:08.360 --> 23:12.680
And Animoji is just wrong and I don't mean wrong as in for developer conference which

23:12.680 --> 23:13.680
it is.

23:13.680 --> 23:14.680
I mean morally wrong.

23:14.680 --> 23:15.680
My kids love it.

23:15.680 --> 23:16.680
It creeps me out.

23:16.680 --> 23:17.680
My kids just love it.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.200
They love it.

23:19.200 --> 23:23.800
It reminds me of those old like late 80s horror movies when everybody was worried about Satanists

23:23.800 --> 23:27.960
and stuff where like the kid wears a go-tet or something.

23:27.960 --> 23:28.960
Terrifying to me.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.840
I am horrified by Animoji.

23:30.840 --> 23:34.760
This may be more of a Mike issue than an Apple issue but I don't know.

23:34.760 --> 23:38.640
I mean to me, I don't even know if I agree with you or I don't agree with you because

23:38.640 --> 23:43.080
I feel like we're across purposes but I feel like they're just not taking their

23:43.080 --> 23:46.320
developer community serious at all.

23:46.320 --> 23:49.760
They want – and that video with people's moms talking about – oh, no.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.760
I'm sorry.

23:50.760 --> 23:57.720
David Attenborough talking about developers like they are animals in a jungle somewhere.

23:57.720 --> 23:58.720
Did you see that intro?

23:58.720 --> 23:59.720
Yes.

23:59.720 --> 24:00.720
Yes, I did.

24:00.720 --> 24:06.240
Replace developer with any other group of people and you're on the front page of

24:06.240 --> 24:07.240
the New York Times.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.920
That's unbelievably terrible.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.880
That's insulting.

24:10.880 --> 24:16.660
Here's what – so I am more optimistic about the software improvements.

24:16.660 --> 24:22.000
The integration of workflow into iOS could be the biggest standout feature for iOS 12

24:22.000 --> 24:27.680
for power users and I'm glad that they finally revamped the Mac App Store.

24:27.680 --> 24:31.480
But the things that jumped out at me was no new MacBook Pro at all, even if it was just

24:31.480 --> 24:35.640
going to be now you can do 32 gigs of RAM and a new keyboard for God sakes.

24:35.640 --> 24:39.120
No iPad software OS level improvements.

24:39.120 --> 24:43.560
Just a few new apps that are coming to iPad from the iPhone so they're not even really

24:43.560 --> 24:45.440
new apps.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.280
So it's sort of hit and miss for me.

24:47.280 --> 24:52.680
I think the hardware area is the weakest story for Apple in terms of no Mac updates at all,

24:52.680 --> 24:53.680
no Mac Mini update either.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.120
Again, I think if you were looking for what developers need –

24:56.120 --> 24:57.120
Mac Mini.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.920
I mean if you're looking for a Mac Mini.

24:59.920 --> 25:04.000
Actually if you – so imagine if they had the Mac Mini and it was just basically a rebranded

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Intel NUC.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
A NUC?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Yeah.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.040
That would be a great little machine to just try something out, especially if you're an

25:09.040 --> 25:12.720
iOS developer and you want to experiment with the Mac.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.840
Right now your entry point is a laptop or an all-in-one iMac.

25:15.840 --> 25:16.840
It's just ridiculous.

25:16.840 --> 25:20.880
I know it's just – yeah, anyways, I just – that's what – those would have been

25:20.880 --> 25:24.600
signals to me that they kind of grokked with some of the more wider developer –

25:24.600 --> 25:31.560
Yeah, it's like certainly not fixing the damn keyboards and all their computers is

25:31.560 --> 25:33.200
super crazy to me.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.040
And I got to be honest, I know I'm coming in pretty hard and I can already see the YouTube

25:36.040 --> 25:40.840
comments coming, although it's not up on YouTube.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.240
I hope you're right, Chris, right?

25:42.240 --> 25:43.440
I hope Chris is right.

25:43.440 --> 25:47.080
I hope it's not – like I hope there is some cool stuff and it's just like Tim Cook

25:47.080 --> 25:51.460
is just not the right person to run this company and the message – because the messaging

25:51.460 --> 25:55.960
comes off as weirdly infantilizing and it's kind of like oh, you guys are so cute, little

25:55.960 --> 25:58.800
boy, here's a Matchbox car.

25:58.800 --> 26:08.200
And now the grown-ups are going to go work out and you know, I don't know, it – yeah,

26:08.200 --> 26:09.200
it felt bad.

26:09.200 --> 26:13.280
I mean, Chris, do you agree or do you think I'm just crazy?

26:13.280 --> 26:14.280
It felt off-tone.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.880
It felt – I don't know how to put – I've been trying to think of how to put this into

26:16.880 --> 26:21.480
words but all but one of the female presenters they brought up on stage felt like they were

26:21.480 --> 26:25.160
bringing females up on stage to check boxes.

26:25.160 --> 26:29.640
And that – and I think some people in the chatroom felt that way too and it's unfortunate

26:29.640 --> 26:32.880
when you see that because that almost feels like the reverse of what they're trying to

26:32.880 --> 26:33.880
accomplish.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.960
I'm not saying that for all of the presenters but there was definitely some.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.240
You know, they've all been very, very heavily coached.

26:39.240 --> 26:43.920
The Apple Keynote is almost a parody of itself now and it's such a –

26:43.920 --> 26:45.480
It could have been an episode of Silicon Valley, right?

26:45.480 --> 26:46.480
Yeah.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.480
It could have been the guy from Hooli up there.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.560
It's such a ripped off format now too.

26:49.560 --> 26:52.280
Like everybody uses that format.

26:52.280 --> 27:00.920
And so it feels really done and I think the pent-up need – what's going on here is the

27:00.920 --> 27:02.480
crossroads that we're approaching now.

27:02.480 --> 27:08.600
We're dancing around this GitHub story but look at the message from Microsoft, the continuous

27:08.600 --> 27:14.240
say last 25-year message about how they feel about developers versus the story we just

27:14.240 --> 27:15.240
got from Apple.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.900
And you and I both watched Build.

27:17.900 --> 27:27.280
You compare and contrast Build to WWDC and it's clear Microsoft deeply, deeply understands

27:27.280 --> 27:28.280
developers.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.340
It feels like when they're up on stage they are developers themselves that are making

27:31.340 --> 27:33.080
things for other developers.

27:33.080 --> 27:38.280
When Apple's on stage it feels like the candy company is making a new magical toy and there's

27:38.280 --> 27:40.960
a way for you developers to play along too.

27:40.960 --> 27:41.960
And that –

27:41.960 --> 27:45.320
That can make it so much worse.

27:45.320 --> 27:51.280
And so I just – I think it's just it wasn't enough and it didn't solve enough problems

27:51.280 --> 27:56.360
to address the crossroads that they're at right now.

27:56.360 --> 27:59.600
It's not – see, to me, I mean, I'll get off of it because I think we're just going

27:59.600 --> 28:04.600
to come close to a flame war here but it wasn't just that it wasn't enough.

28:04.600 --> 28:12.800
The actual tone to me was – I felt like I was in 10th grade and some girl's mom was

28:12.800 --> 28:16.920
trying to convince her to go out with me because the nerds, he'll make a lot of money, right?

28:16.920 --> 28:23.520
It felt weird like the – especially the first video with the developers in the wild

28:23.520 --> 28:28.400
treating them like some sort of weird creature you would find, an animal.

28:28.400 --> 28:36.640
And the thing with the moms and the relatives was just unbelievably bad.

28:36.640 --> 28:41.960
If you contrast it to Microsoft and to Google, Microsoft and Google treat this like a real

28:41.960 --> 28:44.040
profession, a real skill.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.360
Apple treats it like some sort of –

28:45.360 --> 28:46.360
Lifestyle choice.

28:46.360 --> 28:47.360
I don't even know.

28:47.360 --> 28:50.160
It's a lifestyle choice.

28:50.160 --> 28:54.760
But for like children, like honestly, it felt like they were talking to children.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.920
I don't know, we can move on.

28:57.920 --> 29:03.080
It just felt super – the only word I can think of is infantilizing.

29:03.080 --> 29:08.080
I mean it really felt like they were trying to say we're the adults, we understand you

29:08.080 --> 29:13.960
have these feelings and you want these things but you do have a curfew and you can't drink,

29:13.960 --> 29:14.960
right?

29:14.960 --> 29:16.760
Like it just – ah, terrible.

29:16.760 --> 29:17.760
Yeah.

29:17.760 --> 29:18.760
Yeah.

29:18.760 --> 29:23.560
I don't know if I get that strong of a read but I do feel like it was off the mark.

29:23.560 --> 29:29.840
And I myself am just pleased to see that they're adding a workout mode for hiking because jeez,

29:29.840 --> 29:31.600
I always feel like I was getting ripped off on that.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.600
Yeah.

29:32.600 --> 29:33.600
All right.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.440
Well, why don't we take a break and we'll change gears and we'll talk about GitHub,

29:36.440 --> 29:41.000
Microsoft and the big story and all of that that isn't really getting very much discussion,

29:41.000 --> 29:44.120
at least not today on Monday as it's all broke.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.200
But first, let's talk about DigitalOcean and how you can get $100 credit when you go

29:47.200 --> 29:49.600
to dio.co slash coder.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.600
No S on this one.

29:51.600 --> 29:53.680
Dio.co slash coder.

29:53.680 --> 29:58.120
$100 of DigitalOcean credit for 60 days when you sign up with a new account.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.120
And you can do a lot in 60 days.

30:00.120 --> 30:03.880
Try something new or maybe improve an existing app, test something you've been wanting to

30:03.880 --> 30:04.880
try for a while.

30:04.880 --> 30:08.720
They have optimized compute types where you can deploy droplets that have been optimized

30:08.720 --> 30:11.040
for specific types of compute workloads.

30:11.040 --> 30:14.200
They have customizable drops where you can mix and match the resources.

30:14.200 --> 30:18.140
My favorite system though is three cents an hour.

30:18.140 --> 30:24.000
Three cents an hour and I get four gigs of RAM, two CPUs, 80 gigabytes of SSD disk space

30:24.000 --> 30:27.160
and three terabytes of transfer for three cents an hour.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.280
Everything is SSDs.

30:28.280 --> 30:32.200
If you get the $5 a month system or you get one of those systems with hundreds of gigs

30:32.200 --> 30:36.040
of RAMs and lots of Xeon CPUs, everything is SSDs.

30:36.040 --> 30:37.040
Even the block storage.

30:37.040 --> 30:40.840
And then they have easy, simple, straightforward DNS management.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.960
Cloud firewalls which block traffic at their network level instead of letting the traffic

30:44.960 --> 30:50.440
hit your box, monitoring and alerting so that way you can deliver pro-level services and

30:50.440 --> 30:52.440
keep track of how things are trending.

30:52.440 --> 30:55.700
Global data centers, data centers all over the world and 40 gigabit connections coming

30:55.700 --> 30:56.700
into the hypervisors.

30:56.700 --> 31:01.080
And then they wrap it all up with a great dashboard and a super straightforward API.

31:01.080 --> 31:02.080
Try it out.

31:02.080 --> 31:07.640
60 days with a $100 credit, do.co slash coder.

31:07.640 --> 31:12.840
Now if you're thinking about trying GitLab, they have a one click deployment for GitLab.

31:12.840 --> 31:17.960
One click and it's all set up and ready to go and you can get to work, do.co slash coder

31:17.960 --> 31:22.200
and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Coder radio program.

31:22.200 --> 31:26.480
Yeah, so it started, you started probably seeing this over the weekend I think based

31:26.480 --> 31:30.560
on the telegram and Slack chats that I saw.

31:30.560 --> 31:34.120
But for $7.5 billion today-

31:34.120 --> 31:36.120
I'm sorry, put your pinkie up.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.120
Billion.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.120
Billion.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.120
Billion.

31:39.120 --> 31:44.280
So they officially announced it today that they are going to acquire GitHub and Nat Friedman,

31:44.280 --> 31:48.120
the founder of Xamarin is going to be, or Xamarin or however you say it.

31:48.120 --> 31:49.720
Still called Xamarin every time.

31:49.720 --> 31:54.040
Because it's going to be, I can't stop now, it's going to be the new CEO of GitHub once

31:54.040 --> 31:57.560
all this closes in about a year, or at the end of the year they think.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.540
So it's huge.

31:59.540 --> 32:04.220
This is huge because it's also, it's also Microsoft buying Electron basically.

32:04.220 --> 32:08.200
And that to me seems like the big story that's not getting a lot of discussion right now.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.200
Yeah.

32:09.200 --> 32:13.120
And Atom, which I think is going to be good night to Saigon for Atom pretty soon.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.680
Oh, right now we've got-

32:14.680 --> 32:15.680
VS Code.

32:15.680 --> 32:16.680
Yeah.

32:16.680 --> 32:17.680
We've got some redundancies.

32:17.680 --> 32:21.080
And under the hood they're effectively the same.

32:21.080 --> 32:22.080
So.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.080
Hmm.

32:23.080 --> 32:24.760
Yeah, I mean, so let's start with GitHub.

32:24.760 --> 32:28.640
A lot of people have been talking like this is the end of the world on Twitter.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.040
You know, lots of announcements about being at the end of the world.

32:31.040 --> 32:36.800
I think it's a little too early to tell, but I think it is a, it's a good, as they say,

32:36.800 --> 32:39.720
leeching moment about centralization.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.640
And especially when that comes to open source projects and it's a great opportunity for

32:42.640 --> 32:43.640
GitLab.

32:43.640 --> 32:47.200
So that, that, those are my thoughts on, on everybody freaking out about switching.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.260
But what have you, what, just before we move on, what do you think about the reaction so

32:50.260 --> 32:51.260
far?

32:51.260 --> 32:52.260
Surprised?

32:52.260 --> 32:53.260
Not surprised?

32:53.260 --> 32:54.260
Over the top?

32:54.260 --> 32:55.260
What do you think?

32:55.260 --> 32:58.280
Am I surprised that it happened or am I surprised at the reaction?

32:58.280 --> 33:01.720
Well, I was thinking the reaction, but I'm actually curious of the first one too.

33:01.720 --> 33:05.240
So start with the reaction and then let's talk about it.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.240
Yeah.

33:06.240 --> 33:12.320
So I made a mistake of when I first saw the leak, posting it to the Reddit programming

33:12.320 --> 33:16.880
subreddit and just watching the comments come in and my little notification panel there.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.680
Oh boy.

33:18.680 --> 33:19.680
People are not happy.

33:19.680 --> 33:20.680
Right?

33:20.680 --> 33:22.800
I wrote a quick blog post on dominicm.com.

33:22.800 --> 33:28.520
I wrote it when I noticed that the GitLab import tool actually crashed because so many

33:28.520 --> 33:32.080
people were trying to pull their repos off of GitHub.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.760
Oh man.

33:33.760 --> 33:41.000
I myself up until recently was a Bitbucket user, but for basically compliance reasons,

33:41.000 --> 33:44.160
I'm using a self-hosted GitLab now.

33:44.160 --> 33:50.880
I had evaluated GitHub, but I'm a little old man-ish and I kind of think it's important

33:50.880 --> 33:55.040
to control your own infrastructure provided you have good backups.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.040
Yeah.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.040
Yeah.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.040
I wasn't surprised by the reaction either.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.040
So what do you think?

33:59.040 --> 34:00.040
Were you surprised about this purchase?

34:00.040 --> 34:01.040
No.

34:01.040 --> 34:08.000
I think Microsoft is one, the logical purchaser for GitHub and honestly, someone had to buy

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
GitHub, right?

34:09.000 --> 34:10.600
Like they weren't going to IPO on good terms.

34:10.600 --> 34:11.600
I don't know.

34:11.600 --> 34:16.040
I mean, the one argument I've heard a lot is one of the features of GitHub, one of the

34:16.040 --> 34:18.880
biggest features of GitHub was the fact that it was an independent operator.

34:18.880 --> 34:22.040
It could sit between AWS or Azure or DigitalOcean.

34:22.040 --> 34:25.760
Like it was just this independent operator that didn't have any skin in that aspect of

34:25.760 --> 34:26.840
the game.

34:26.840 --> 34:33.720
So I would prefer to have seen it stay solo, right?

34:33.720 --> 34:36.880
But the answer to that was they probably needed to generate more revenue and therefore raise

34:36.880 --> 34:37.880
prices.

34:37.880 --> 34:38.880
Yeah.

34:38.880 --> 34:39.880
Okay.

34:39.880 --> 34:40.880
I can see that.

34:40.880 --> 34:45.000
The other thing is one thing that I'm not seeing enough of is people are like, oh my

34:45.000 --> 34:47.280
God, GitHub, how am I going to use Git?

34:47.280 --> 34:53.280
If you are using GitHub as a central repository, you're just like doing Git wrong, right?

34:53.280 --> 34:57.400
Your real problem is that GitHub created a bunch of proprietary tools to help you with

34:57.400 --> 35:03.440
deployments and continuous integration and you got totally locked into them.

35:03.440 --> 35:11.000
So I don't know, like I moved to GitLab from Bitbucket in a day because I pulled the repo,

35:11.000 --> 35:13.720
added an origin, pushed the new origin, right?

35:13.720 --> 35:18.760
It's really easy if you're doing everything by open standards and open tools and not using

35:18.760 --> 35:21.760
any proprietary integrations.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.540
It's really hard if you're using these one click deployment things.

35:25.540 --> 35:29.640
And that's where I think a little bit of the FUD makes sense around like the Microsoft

35:29.640 --> 35:33.640
acquisition because I could totally see an Azure button on like every repo, right?

35:33.640 --> 35:35.120
Like deploy to Azure now.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.120
Oh, 100%.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.120
Yeah, absolutely.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.120
Those things already exist.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.120
Right.

35:40.120 --> 35:45.380
And of course, Heroku has one, Microsoft has one, but the only way this really makes sense

35:45.380 --> 35:49.880
is as yet another play to funnel people into Azure in my mind.

35:49.880 --> 35:50.880
Yeah.

35:50.880 --> 35:51.880
Yeah.

35:51.880 --> 35:52.880
Yeah.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.720
I mean, yeah, I think so.

35:54.720 --> 35:58.640
Seems like this could also be just, hey, we're the developer company now.

35:58.640 --> 36:02.600
You want to write software on Linux and deploy it on AWS, as long as you're doing it with

36:02.600 --> 36:06.760
Visual Studio Code and pumping it through GitHub, we're good.

36:06.760 --> 36:07.760
You know?

36:07.760 --> 36:08.760
Like they don't care.

36:08.760 --> 36:12.400
I think that might be the, this is, we're the company for developers and you look at

36:12.400 --> 36:17.080
the contrast we just saw from Apple and then you look at Microsoft, Microsoft really has

36:17.080 --> 36:21.520
been making a lot of moves,.NET Core, Visual Studio Code, and many other things on their

36:21.520 --> 36:24.160
GitHub page, which we'll have a link to the show notes.

36:24.160 --> 36:27.760
A lot of stuff is open source, including throwing windows on GitHub.

36:27.760 --> 36:32.000
They may be the largest code contributor on GitHub.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.440
I think that is actually a...

36:33.440 --> 36:34.440
They are.

36:34.440 --> 36:35.440
Yeah.

36:35.440 --> 36:36.440
That's the truth.

36:36.440 --> 36:37.440
Yeah.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.440
Yeah.

36:38.440 --> 36:42.000
So I wonder if this is even bigger than Azure in a way, like I absolutely fundamentally

36:42.000 --> 36:46.720
has a very important, maybe the most important component is the Azure component and the future

36:46.720 --> 36:47.720
potential there.

36:47.720 --> 36:48.720
Yeah.

36:48.720 --> 36:49.720
But I wonder if it isn't bigger than Azure.

36:49.720 --> 36:50.720
Because look at Electron.

36:50.720 --> 36:53.040
I think GitHub is, yeah.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.040
Consider Electron too, right?

36:54.040 --> 36:55.040
Electron.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.040
Yeah.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.040
And so it's a bigger purchase.

36:57.040 --> 37:00.480
They have Electron now, they have GitHub and GitHub can, GitHub is like this middleware

37:00.480 --> 37:03.240
between so many different endpoints.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.320
It's so many things are tied into GitHub.

37:05.320 --> 37:10.680
So many things are tied, like my Linux box sitting next to me right here is, it pulls

37:10.680 --> 37:11.920
down updates from GitHub.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.840
It's like, there's so many things that are tied into GitHub.

37:14.840 --> 37:15.840
Oh, sure.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.320
GitHub now has all of that.

37:17.320 --> 37:20.320
Plus they have now easy tie-ins to Azure and they've got Electron.

37:20.320 --> 37:23.040
So I think it's bigger than just one thing.

37:23.040 --> 37:28.680
But okay, so the bigger message you think is that Microsoft is basically the anti-Apple

37:28.680 --> 37:29.680
now.

37:29.680 --> 37:33.120
They're saying, you know, we are the developer company, we're engineers, we understand you.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.480
We're not doing weird documentaries on you.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.480
Sorry.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.480
Can I help it?

37:37.480 --> 37:38.480
Yeah.

37:38.480 --> 37:41.600
And also, I think it also means that a lot of Microsoft's products are going to probably

37:41.600 --> 37:42.880
shift over to Electron.

37:42.880 --> 37:46.240
Skype was just the beginning.

37:46.240 --> 37:47.960
Yeah, I think that would have happened anyway, though.

37:47.960 --> 37:48.960
Yeah, exactly.

37:48.960 --> 37:51.320
Yeah, that's why they probably made the purchase.

37:51.320 --> 37:54.880
This actually ties into both WWDC and the GitHub Microsoft purchase.

37:54.880 --> 38:00.560
And I'm going to make a bold prediction here and I can't wait to see Telegram later tonight.

38:00.560 --> 38:05.000
I think Microsoft is actually ahead of the game in a lot of ways.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
They understand that the future is open standards.

38:08.000 --> 38:15.840
I would argue the present is open standards, too, and progressive web apps, Electron, just

38:15.840 --> 38:21.080
frankly not being crazy and proprietary about stuff where Apple's like, we're going to re-implement

38:21.080 --> 38:26.520
machine learning in Swift because that makes sense.

38:26.520 --> 38:27.520
It's weird.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.520
I don't know.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.440
I feel like there's something here, Chris, that both of these things happen on the same

38:30.440 --> 38:34.400
day and the dichotomy between them is huge.

38:34.400 --> 38:38.520
It's like night and day, help Mojave and Snow Leopard O.

38:38.520 --> 38:39.960
Oh, yeah, I agree.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.040
I think it is.

38:41.040 --> 38:45.080
It's a massive A-B contrast between the two.

38:45.080 --> 38:50.200
We couldn't be getting a bigger disparity because I really think Microsoft has shifted

38:50.200 --> 38:57.680
towards this development platform focus and Apple is shifting towards this enrich our

38:57.680 --> 38:58.680
ecosystem focus.

38:58.680 --> 38:59.680
They've shifted.

38:59.680 --> 39:00.680
They've been there for a while.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.960
This enrich our ecosystem focus, make things better for the iPhone.

39:03.960 --> 39:08.240
If you're on an iPhone, now you can scan using your iPhone camera and it goes directly into

39:08.240 --> 39:10.520
the doc you're working on on the Mac.

39:10.520 --> 39:15.200
That's where they're focusing, which is great for that ecosystem, but everyone's-

39:15.200 --> 39:17.200
Or that type of user.

39:17.200 --> 39:22.080
Right, but the thing is, if this continues, if these trend lines continue, everyone's

39:22.080 --> 39:26.640
going to be writing software for those iPhones and especially the backend software for all

39:26.640 --> 39:27.640
those Macs.

39:27.640 --> 39:30.960
They're going to be writing it on Microsoft's tools.

39:30.960 --> 39:35.800
They're going to be hosting the code on Microsoft's tools and the services are going to be running

39:35.800 --> 39:38.320
on Microsoft servers.

39:38.320 --> 39:44.200
Microsoft's going to own all of the stuff that's getting sold on those devices.

39:44.200 --> 39:50.200
If Apple had played their cards better, they could have owned the entire stack better.

39:50.200 --> 39:54.200
I agree with you 100%, but let's run it out five years.

39:54.200 --> 39:58.960
In five years, it's not going to be writing your native iOS app using Xamarin.

39:58.960 --> 40:03.760
It's going to be everything is a web standard, thank you, WebAssembly.

40:03.760 --> 40:07.880
Check off your bingo card for Coderadio.

40:07.880 --> 40:12.000
Microsoft is providing the best tooling, the easiest deployments from GitHub to Azure or

40:12.000 --> 40:13.840
frankly from GitHub to wherever the hell you want.

40:13.840 --> 40:17.240
I really hope they don't go too crazy with the Azure thing.

40:17.240 --> 40:22.160
Apple is still trying to convince you to redo your whole workflow in Swift.

40:22.160 --> 40:26.080
Apple had nothing future-leaning today other than the marzipan, which really, you know

40:26.080 --> 40:27.800
what marzipan is?

40:27.800 --> 40:33.760
It's rejiggering your iPad apps and your iOS apps to go work on the Mac, where Microsoft

40:33.760 --> 40:40.040
is saying we are going to make best practices for frankly large-scale engineering projects

40:40.040 --> 40:43.600
such as continuous integration, continuous deployment.

40:43.600 --> 40:48.720
We're going to make those practices more attainable for even junior developers.

40:48.720 --> 40:53.080
I'm talking kids right out of trade school or junior college rather.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.080
You know what?

40:54.080 --> 40:55.240
I take it back.

40:55.240 --> 41:00.960
I welcome the click to deploy to Azure button on everything, if only to explain to junior

41:00.960 --> 41:05.280
developers that you really have to automate your deployment, right?

41:05.280 --> 41:10.040
Or maybe like some sort of Docker generation tool, like Docker file generation tool, which

41:10.040 --> 41:15.440
by the way, Microsoft is a huge supporter of Docker and containerization in general.

41:15.440 --> 41:20.440
Where Apple's, I don't know, trying to get me to run.

41:20.440 --> 41:21.440
It's not even on the map.

41:21.440 --> 41:22.440
Yeah, it's not even on the map.

41:22.440 --> 41:23.440
Right.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.960
I don't know how to do some crunches, I don't know.

41:25.960 --> 41:26.960
But what about the FUD?

41:26.960 --> 41:29.720
I mean, you are the host of the Linux action show, Chris.

41:29.720 --> 41:30.720
Are you feeling-

41:30.720 --> 41:31.720
Wow.

41:31.720 --> 41:32.720
Retired.

41:32.720 --> 41:33.960
It's the retired host of the Linux action show.

41:33.960 --> 41:34.960
Wow.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.040
You know what?

41:36.040 --> 41:37.480
I just listened to the old episodes.

41:37.480 --> 41:41.160
You're always my host, baby.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.680
What particularly do you ask of me?

41:42.680 --> 41:43.680
What do you want to know of me?

41:43.680 --> 41:46.400
So, I mean, I'm sure you've seen some of the comments in Reddit, right?

41:46.400 --> 41:51.200
Some of the, you know, M dollar sign, blah, blah, blah, yeah, yeah.

41:51.200 --> 41:54.800
Does that have any weight to you, or is that kind of just, yeah?

41:54.800 --> 41:55.800
Oh, yeah.

41:55.800 --> 42:00.960
So, I asked some folks on Twitter that follow me, and it seems like everybody's pretty middle

42:00.960 --> 42:02.320
of the ground.

42:02.320 --> 42:05.840
It seems like, you know, people should have cared when Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation,

42:05.840 --> 42:07.440
has come up a few times.

42:07.440 --> 42:10.960
A lot of people feel like eventually it's going to not work out.

42:10.960 --> 42:15.640
It's almost just guaranteed to eventually kind of devolve into something people don't

42:15.640 --> 42:17.120
like from when it was independent.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.920
So, a lot of people are just sort of hedging their bets.

42:19.920 --> 42:25.120
But another, a fair amount of folks are pretty much sit back and wait and see.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.600
See what happens.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.560
Maybe things will work out okay.

42:28.560 --> 42:32.600
I think that's sort of my position as well, is there's so much FUD going around right

42:32.600 --> 42:33.600
now that you got to give time.

42:33.600 --> 42:34.600
You got to calm down.

42:34.600 --> 42:38.480
I mean, this deal isn't even going to be done for another six months or something.

42:38.480 --> 42:42.600
So, we've got a lot of time before anything really changes.

42:42.600 --> 42:48.620
And then once the deal does go through, I think it's at least worth sitting back and

42:48.620 --> 42:50.600
seeing where this all goes.

42:50.600 --> 42:54.840
And the fact that Nat Friedman is going to be running it is encouraging because he's

42:54.840 --> 43:00.960
been in open source and working with Linux for a very long time.

43:00.960 --> 43:04.720
I forget how I'm supposed to mispronounce his company, Zemarion.

43:04.720 --> 43:12.360
When Microsoft acquired Zemarion, he became a Microsoft employee along with Miguel Itacaza.

43:12.360 --> 43:17.720
And I got to say, like, if you're going to put somebody in charge of GitHub, it has needed

43:17.720 --> 43:21.280
a new leadership for a long time.

43:21.280 --> 43:23.440
That's kind of why they're in this position to begin with.

43:23.440 --> 43:26.140
And he's been toying around with Linux since the 90s.

43:26.140 --> 43:29.080
So it's like, who else are you going to put in charge that's not in a better position

43:29.080 --> 43:31.360
at Microsoft to run this thing?

43:31.360 --> 43:35.360
So I say it's at least we deserve, they deserve at least a wait and see approach.

43:35.360 --> 43:36.360
That's my take on it.

43:36.360 --> 43:40.240
It's not like you can't move to GitLab in 10 months.

43:40.240 --> 43:43.720
Or, you know, a day or less.

43:43.720 --> 43:48.480
He stresses in his blog post that we'll have linked in the show notes, coder.show slash

43:48.480 --> 43:49.480
312.

43:49.480 --> 43:53.400
He says GitHub will operate independently as a community platform and business.

43:53.400 --> 43:58.320
They're going to retain its developer first values, distinct spirit, and open extensibility.

43:58.320 --> 44:02.840
So it seems like maybe it's going to be more like a Zappos run business than it's going

44:02.840 --> 44:05.760
to be a Skype run business for Microsoft.

44:05.760 --> 44:07.520
It's going to be like LinkedIn, right?

44:07.520 --> 44:11.760
When they bought LinkedIn, LinkedIn's basically still LinkedIn.

44:11.760 --> 44:15.280
Which I mean, in that case, maybe not a good thing.

44:15.280 --> 44:18.800
So what's everybody freaking out about exactly?

44:18.800 --> 44:23.320
You know, I'm seeing a lot of stuff about like, well, all these, and it is true, right?

44:23.320 --> 44:27.920
A lot of projects are moving off of GitHub.

44:27.920 --> 44:36.560
It seems like there's just a lot of bad feelings in the community from like the 90s almost.

44:36.560 --> 44:41.000
Like one argument that does make sense to me, although I am the one who originally made

44:41.000 --> 44:48.560
it on Twitter was, you know, if I had proprietary software and I was in some way, even tangentially

44:48.560 --> 44:52.840
competing with Microsoft, it might give me pause now that they have access to all of

44:52.840 --> 44:53.840
my repos, right?

44:53.840 --> 44:59.600
Like that, that might be a reason to be afraid, but those aren't the people who seem to be

44:59.600 --> 45:00.600
screaming.

45:00.600 --> 45:07.120
It seems to be the FOSS community, which Microsoft is already very much in bed with you.

45:07.120 --> 45:12.240
Well, I don't think people acknowledge that as much as it's because it's more happening

45:12.240 --> 45:15.880
at the business level and people don't see like all the behind the scenes code contributions

45:15.880 --> 45:16.880
and stuff like that.

45:16.880 --> 45:21.280
It's not apparent, you know, a gnome release is something that's in the user's face.

45:21.280 --> 45:25.400
Microsoft contributing 200,000 lines of code to the kernel is not in the user face.

45:25.400 --> 45:26.400
So I think that's part of it.

45:26.400 --> 45:27.880
And I think, yeah, it's history.

45:27.880 --> 45:31.140
You know, somebody on Twitter, again, I go back to, cause I've just been watching reactions

45:31.140 --> 45:33.000
to this cause it's just been something.

45:33.000 --> 45:37.760
Somebody on Twitter said that people just sometimes want to hate and they need something

45:37.760 --> 45:39.440
to hate.

45:39.440 --> 45:44.280
And it's a personality trait and we tell ourselves, oh, it's because they're Microsoft, it's because

45:44.280 --> 45:47.360
of technical reasons, it's because of things that they've done.

45:47.360 --> 45:51.240
But sometimes we just, that's just how we're wired up.

45:51.240 --> 45:52.240
That could be a part of it.

45:52.240 --> 45:55.120
You know, people have picked their tribe and now they're fighting it and they're going

45:55.120 --> 45:56.120
to stay.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.560
That's part of their identity is that.

45:58.560 --> 46:02.820
I also have to leave a little space in here to acknowledge this could go wrong.

46:02.820 --> 46:05.500
So not all of them may be wrong.

46:05.500 --> 46:10.360
Microsoft could screw this up and it could really screw over a bunch of open source projects

46:10.360 --> 46:11.960
somehow.

46:11.960 --> 46:15.840
Right now it doesn't seem likely, but it could happen.

46:15.840 --> 46:20.640
So right now, how is somehow, so what exactly could they do?

46:20.640 --> 46:26.400
Well, you know, I couldn't tell you, but I will say this, um, and this has been a common

46:26.400 --> 46:30.980
argument is I am really disappointed in Skype since Microsoft has bought it.

46:30.980 --> 46:33.560
They destroyed its P2P inherent nature.

46:33.560 --> 46:38.600
They've essentially tried to chase every particular type of tech trend since they bought it, including

46:38.600 --> 46:40.760
right now, make it a Slack killer.

46:40.760 --> 46:44.480
They've awkwardly integrated it in with other products.

46:44.480 --> 46:48.440
It's gotten, it's gotten more love and I can see they've got a longterm vision with it,

46:48.440 --> 46:55.560
but I really am just, I miss old Skype, old P2P, simple app, clean little tiny app that

46:55.560 --> 46:57.720
just made calls Skype.

46:57.720 --> 47:03.400
I don't want a Slack killer big electron app that uses web RTC, which in my opinion doesn't

47:03.400 --> 47:06.760
sound as good as the old Skype and is now all server based.

47:06.760 --> 47:12.560
So it's, it's also not as great for all those edge cases where P2P is, is a better solution.

47:12.560 --> 47:15.960
I'm really unhappy with the way Skype's gone since Microsoft acquired them.

47:15.960 --> 47:19.840
LinkedIn, I feel like has gotten pushier and a little more aggressive since Microsoft's

47:19.840 --> 47:20.840
acquired them.

47:20.840 --> 47:23.860
It's like they've gotten more runway to be dicks and I don't like that either.

47:23.860 --> 47:30.280
So I'm not a hundred percent solid on Microsoft's longterm strategy here, but I'm willing to

47:30.280 --> 47:31.720
give them the benefit of the doubt.

47:31.720 --> 47:33.440
And it seems to be their particular strength.

47:33.440 --> 47:36.160
They have a huge reputation for putting developers first.

47:36.160 --> 47:38.960
I mean, Steve Ballmer has made that famous.

47:38.960 --> 47:44.680
They have been making obvious inroads into the open source community for years now.

47:44.680 --> 47:48.620
And I, it does seem like a natural fit and they have a good person to lead it.

47:48.620 --> 47:52.400
So I'm not saying it's going to be a failure, but I think, I think we do a disservice a

47:52.400 --> 48:01.200
little bit intellectually if we say it's not possible, what do you think of that?

48:01.200 --> 48:08.080
I guess, I mean, I would say the better argument is more, once again, one of the five big tech

48:08.080 --> 48:12.560
companies is eating what could have theoretically been a contender.

48:12.560 --> 48:18.920
Now GitHub had weird harassment issues that kind of screwed them up.

48:18.920 --> 48:23.640
But you can definitely think of an alternate universe where GitHub actually became a top

48:23.640 --> 48:24.880
tier company.

48:24.880 --> 48:25.880
Right?

48:25.880 --> 48:26.960
Like I could see a mud.

48:26.960 --> 48:34.860
Now it's weird though, cause what would GitHub have had to do to become equal to the Microsofts

48:34.860 --> 48:36.520
and Facebooks and Amazons of the world?

48:36.520 --> 48:37.520
I don't think it's possible.

48:37.520 --> 48:39.240
Would they still have been GitHub?

48:39.240 --> 48:40.460
No.

48:40.460 --> 48:43.480
Just because of the resources they're giving away to the open source community?

48:43.480 --> 48:44.480
No, no.

48:44.480 --> 48:50.600
Because these corporations have 20 years of customer base, plus they have huge, massive

48:50.600 --> 48:56.160
lucrative contracts with governments all over the world, and they've got major brand recognition

48:56.160 --> 49:00.160
amongst average consumers, so they're able to introduce products that get big traction

49:00.160 --> 49:01.160
much easier.

49:01.160 --> 49:03.640
GitHub doesn't have, doesn't have those things going for itself.

49:03.640 --> 49:10.080
I think it was probably destined to get purchased, if you think, if you think in those terms.

49:10.080 --> 49:13.080
Doesn't you know, but it doesn't have to be a top five, it could have been a top hundred.

49:13.080 --> 49:17.360
I mean, if it has to be purchased, I can't think of a better purchaser.

49:17.360 --> 49:18.360
Yeah.

49:18.360 --> 49:20.080
Yeah, I think so.

49:20.080 --> 49:21.080
Right?

49:21.080 --> 49:26.400
Like the, the thing about the alternate universe where Google purchased GitHub, that would

49:26.400 --> 49:28.640
be some serious cause for alarm.

49:28.640 --> 49:32.400
I bet you wouldn't be getting the same reaction though.

49:32.400 --> 49:33.880
It might spook you and I more.

49:33.880 --> 49:36.040
Oh, it would be, really?

49:36.040 --> 49:38.860
You think, you think people would be more okay with it?

49:38.860 --> 49:39.860
I do, yeah.

49:39.860 --> 49:41.560
I see that would scare the shit out of me.

49:41.560 --> 49:42.560
Like that.

49:42.560 --> 49:43.560
Me too.

49:43.560 --> 49:46.600
But I think, I think the people that are reacting strongly about Microsoft purchasing GitHub

49:46.600 --> 49:49.440
are the people that would probably, not all of them, but a lot of them would probably

49:49.440 --> 49:52.160
react better about Google.

49:52.160 --> 49:53.160
I wouldn't.

49:53.160 --> 49:54.160
Why?

49:54.160 --> 49:58.640
Uh, because Google is an open source company and uses Linux.

49:58.640 --> 49:59.640
That's the brand, right?

49:59.640 --> 50:02.360
That's the, that's the, that's the community.

50:02.360 --> 50:06.260
Every time I get, I get, I, every time I criticize Google on the show, people get upset at me

50:06.260 --> 50:09.520
because I'm criticizing a company that uses open source.

50:09.520 --> 50:10.520
Okay.

50:10.520 --> 50:13.840
So every time I've ever been to a Google campus, it's a fricking sea of Mac books.

50:13.840 --> 50:16.280
I just want to throw that out there.

50:16.280 --> 50:21.240
I understand they use Linux on the server and this is not me trying to be a jerk, but

50:21.240 --> 50:25.800
you know, uh, uh, laughing, the chat room points out, it says now that Microsoft owns

50:25.800 --> 50:30.720
LinkedIn and GitHub, do they even need to bother interviewing new hires anymore?

50:30.720 --> 50:32.920
Well, that's actually, you know what?

50:32.920 --> 50:33.920
That's a fair point.

50:33.920 --> 50:35.760
Can you imagine you get something in your GitHub email?

50:35.760 --> 50:38.440
It's like, Hey, uh, want to come to Redmond?

50:38.440 --> 50:39.440
Yeah.

50:39.440 --> 50:40.440
Right.

50:40.440 --> 50:42.440
They're going to have really interesting, they're going to have so many interesting

50:42.440 --> 50:43.600
insights now.

50:43.600 --> 50:46.480
That's the creepy part that we may learn more about as time goes on.

50:46.480 --> 50:47.480
We may not.

50:47.480 --> 50:48.720
I mean, this just broke today.

50:48.720 --> 50:50.280
So we're still processing it.

50:50.280 --> 50:52.200
It seems like there's still a lot to figure out and learn.

50:52.200 --> 50:53.200
I'm sure they'll share.

50:53.200 --> 50:54.200
Yeah.

50:54.200 --> 50:58.120
And the reality is, I think for the first year, they're going to be very hands off,

50:58.120 --> 50:59.120
right?

50:59.120 --> 51:04.360
Nate, Nate, we'll go over and go ahead and take over, but then it's, I would be surprised

51:04.360 --> 51:09.800
if we see aggressive moves because they, you know, it is true that people are, a lot of

51:09.800 --> 51:12.080
folks have left to get lab.

51:12.080 --> 51:18.520
Like I'm sure it is a very, very vocal minority, but I wouldn't be surprised if they just do

51:18.520 --> 51:23.720
nothing for a year just to calm the community down and say, nothing's changed.

51:23.720 --> 51:25.600
Your paychecks just say Microsoft now, right?

51:25.600 --> 51:26.600
Yeah.

51:26.600 --> 51:29.280
And they can afford to be a patient, slow moving company when it comes to this kind

51:29.280 --> 51:30.280
of stuff.

51:30.280 --> 51:31.280
Well, and get help makes money, right?

51:31.280 --> 51:32.280
Get help does have revenue.

51:32.280 --> 51:36.880
So it's not like they bought some little app startup that the app like never even launched.

51:36.880 --> 51:37.960
Right.

51:37.960 --> 51:40.320
And now their services costs probably just got removed.

51:40.320 --> 51:44.040
So now it's going to be much more of a moneymaker.

51:44.040 --> 51:45.520
Migrate that baby to Azure.

51:45.520 --> 51:46.520
Yep.

51:46.520 --> 51:50.240
All right, Mr. Dominic, is there anything else we want to touch on this week?

51:50.240 --> 51:54.100
I know I'm going to go ahead and throw this Mac out the window and we'll be back on Pop

51:54.100 --> 51:55.100
by the morning.

51:55.100 --> 51:56.100
Wow.

51:56.100 --> 51:57.100
All right.

51:57.100 --> 51:58.100
Well, hey, there's a sale on Pixelbooks.

51:58.100 --> 52:02.960
Tell the good folks where they can find you in the meantime, like somewhere else online.

52:02.960 --> 52:04.120
Follow at Dumanuco on Twitter.

52:04.120 --> 52:06.560
I'm sure it's going to be entertaining.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.520
And follow me at Chris LAS.

52:08.520 --> 52:10.080
And the show may float.

52:10.080 --> 52:13.360
Recording days and stuff are changing as I'm on the road and Mike's going to be traveling.
