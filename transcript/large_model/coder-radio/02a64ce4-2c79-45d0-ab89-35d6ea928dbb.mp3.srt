This is Coder Radio, episode 440 for November 15th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,420
Hello old friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:25,120
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,200
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru with the Cloud Playground, Azure AWS

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,600
and Google Cloud Sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloudguru.com.

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,860
My name is Chris and joining us hunkered down from his base of development and shenanigans,

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,960
it is our host, Mr. Dominic.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,520
Hello, Mike.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
What's up, Chris?

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
Uh-oh.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,560
You sound a little under the weather.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,600
I have to tell you, I am not feeling well.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,840
So I've had the Rona before and I am fully vaccinated.

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,140
So I'm hoping that means it's not the Rona, but I did a home test and it said no.

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,960
You do have a kid and family.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,480
They're all vectors of all kinds of disease.

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,480
Let me tell you.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,680
Well, especially the five-year-old.

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,160
My immune system, honestly, if I could like just inject a purple heart into my bloodstream,

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,400
I would because this kid comes home.

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,480
Did you wash your hands, Reese?

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Yeah.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Did you really?

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,480
Oh, no.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,160
Well, go wash your hands.

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,980
It's like you're asking them to pull nails to wash their damn hands.

28
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,440
It's like you're asking them to code in Windows.

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
I mean-

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,040
My kid the other day, I won't say which one, so there's three of them, but I won't say

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
which one.

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
My kid the other day goes-

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
I say I name names.

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,680
I mean, you're just like, you're a better dad.

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,080
The kid comes out of the bathroom and I say, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you didn't wash your

36
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
hands.

37
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,040
Dad, I washed my hands like an hour ago.

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm good.

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,000
That's not how it works.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Damn kids.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,600
You know, maybe you could explain to me why my Twitter feed is blowing up today.

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,880
Usually when this happens, somebody has bought a new laptop.

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,880
So I have made many questionable decisions in my life.

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,740
Most of them either involve gin, women, or frankly, I don't know why I can't get this

45
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,740
kid to wash his hands.

46
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,740
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,740
This is my hobby horse.

48
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,840
This is no longer code radio.

49
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,040
This is goddammit wash your hands.

50
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Yeah.

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,520
So my MacBook Air, my beloved, my sweetheart, my darling, your M1 MacBook Air, yes, is going

52
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:39,500
to a staff member, the wicked Dave, my CTO, because his MacBook, not Air, but do you remember

53
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,000
the dark days of the regular MacBook?

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
Oh, the butterfly you're talking about?

55
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
Yeah.

56
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
She's having some problems.

57
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
I bet.

58
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
You bet.

59
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,640
Can you guess what those problems are?

60
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,800
The Z key or something.

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
That's what I'm having.

62
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
I just gave out on the.

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Yeah.

64
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,240
So it's a Z key and it's a command key that are not working and that's causing just like

65
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,040
all kinds of issues.

66
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,160
So like I like Linux.

67
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
I don't like the fighting.

68
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
I'll be honest with you.

69
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,160
I haven't been happy with the.

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,520
You're more in the community to speak to this, but I don't like the nastiness, right?

71
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,640
I think everybody should get along.

72
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
It's off putting.

73
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Right.

74
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
It's mean.

75
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,960
It seems and it's weird because when you when people DM you and this has been my experience,

76
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,440
I can't speak to yours.

77
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,240
But when people DM you, they're like not like that right there.

78
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Oh, yeah.

79
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,120
Well, if you know Mac OS works for you, it's cool dog or, you know, oh, yeah, if you like,

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,200
you know, I mean, frankly, people who are true Linux users know I'm talking about the

81
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Pop OS stuff.

82
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Right.

83
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
So.

84
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Yeah.

85
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
There's been a spat between GNOME and Pop OS.

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,560
And I feel like, you know what?

87
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
It shouldn't happen.

88
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,240
And I don't care who's wrong or right.

89
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
I'm sure I know.

90
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,520
I know it got covered elsewhere, but I I think that weakens everybody, honestly, unnecessary

91
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
conflicts.

92
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,920
And, you know, I am familiar with all of I'm familiar with the tweets that that supposedly

93
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,360
upset the GNOME side and the decisions supposedly upset the Pop side.

94
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:11,680
And my genuine takeaway from reading everything is that if this conversation had been in person,

95
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,960
it would have been a total non-issue and be probably would it would have been wrapped

96
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,700
up in an afternoon.

97
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,680
And it's so funny because it's like you have to read into everything, though.

98
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
That's exactly what I thought.

99
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,680
If this had happened at a conference, this had happened at Linux Fest Northwest, right

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:33,160
at the at the pub after the sessions, it would have been a minute and a half of maybe awkwardness

101
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,720
and then it would just been resolved.

102
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Yeah.

103
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,120
And there would have been no issue.

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,280
And legitimately, I think a lot of the offense on the GNOME side came from reading into a

105
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,440
tweet, perhaps imbuing it with some intention that the author maybe did not intend it to

106
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,080
have.

107
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,240
And it's the exact kind of thing that gets lost in low bandwidth text communication.

108
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,580
I mean, I learned my lesson the hard way long, long time listeners will know.

109
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,840
You don't touch anything that's going to start a fight on Twitter because you're always going

110
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,360
to be constrained and they're always going to misunderstand you and think that you're

111
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
being mean.

112
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,800
I could see the individual who tweeted saying I didn't expect them to take it that way.

113
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,000
It is one of those things that looking back at it, you kind of go, oh, I guess I see how

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
they took it that way.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,920
Either way, I thought the response was funny.

116
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,040
I don't know if you've noticed, but System76 did respond to all of it by just simply making

117
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,040
a blog post that just is a super long ass list of all of their upstream open source

118
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,960
contributions and they really had no other comment than that.

119
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,200
Obviously people who listen to the show a long time.

120
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,320
I'm friendly with the System76 people, but this is all a waste of energy.

121
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,120
It just is a waste of energy.

122
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,240
And frankly, you know, people who can develop Linux desktops, not even applications, but

123
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,840
actual like operating systems are some of the brightest people in the world and wasting

124
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,160
their time on Twitter fights is you know what I saw?

125
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,120
I saw a lot of just I just saw a lot of comments saying, you know, I'm just sick of this.

126
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,040
I like I'm just I'm leaving Linux or I'm just going to ignore this stuff and just put my

127
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
head down.

128
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,400
And I think really it's just focus on the work.

129
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,780
I think that was the message from System76 with that blog post is focus on the work.

130
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,560
So it sounds like you're getting yourself a new work system.

131
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,760
This is the part where Mike forgot what configuration he ordered.

132
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, I got it up right here.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, you do.

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,120
Because Mike's been running a fever for a couple hours.

135
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,800
And you blew my Twitter up with this.

136
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,320
Of course, I've seen it go by.

137
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
I love it actually.

138
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,520
So yeah, you got to it's called it's pronounced Pangolin, right?

139
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
Oh, is it?

140
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
I thought it was Pangolin.

141
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,960
I thought it was like a like British or whatever.

142
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Who cares?

143
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,320
I have a hard time with with words.

144
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,480
So I'm not the person to ask.

145
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,400
You went with full disk encryption on the hard drive.

146
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
You're doing Pop!

147
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
OS 2104 pre-install.

148
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,580
I thought that was interesting.

149
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,040
But this is where it gets juicy.

150
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Wait, why was it?

151
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Why?

152
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Why was that interesting?

153
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,840
I know you have different requirements, especially if you're traveling, but I still am very nervous

154
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,640
about encrypting my home disk.

155
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,120
I'm an old man who had clients who I couldn't recover their data because they lost their.

156
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
I know.

157
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,760
But so even my Mac does have to be encrypted.

158
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Right.

159
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
I know for you.

160
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
It's a different deal.

161
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
So didn't you know what the deal was?

162
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
I was looking.

163
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,120
Is it OK to talk about other brands or are we going to get in trouble from potential

164
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
sponsors?

165
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
I don't know.

166
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
You tell me.

167
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
No, it's fine, of course.

168
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,320
I know you've been to the Dell headquarters, but I was looking at the XPS.

169
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
I call it Sputnik.

170
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
They don't call it that anymore.

171
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
They call it developer edition.

172
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,960
So, OK, so there's a crazy story behind this.

173
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
OK.

174
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Do you want to hear the crazy story?

175
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Of course.

176
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
All right.

177
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:32,400
Poor old Mike can't buy servers because reasons, right?

178
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
OK.

179
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,960
And those reasons of the chip shortage, but Mike is not going to talk politics here.

180
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,200
I would direct you to unfilter show.

181
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,520
Yeah, I will gripe.

182
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,600
I will gripe about the supply shortage all you like on that show.

183
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:50,240
And also, my whole team is remote now, but I still have my space in Plant City, which

184
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,360
is effectively a server farm.

185
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,500
Those servers, I regret to inform you, are mostly Thalios and iMac Pro right now at this

186
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:06,680
point and very other expensive Apple computers running Linux or running Mac server because

187
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,960
the prices on server equipment that I can get from my I mean, I have a Dell rep and

188
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,800
I also called other companies and I'm not trying to pick on Dell.

189
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,700
I like Dell, but are like drug dealer insane, right?

190
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,340
They're crazy.

191
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,480
So I commandeered all the desktops.

192
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,400
Everybody who works remote got issued a laptop and I just said and I just literally in Slack

193
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,680
I was like, you guys don't have desktops anymore to the company's property.

194
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
They're now servers.

195
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,440
They're servers now.

196
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:47,800
And then I had a problem because my man, Dave, my CTO, his MacBook, why I bought him two

197
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,440
butterfly keyboards in two and a half years is beyond me.

198
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,440
They both failed for the same reason.

199
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,600
And sure enough, son of a bear, it failed.

200
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,380
He can't type.

201
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,840
So he remapped the keys to get along.

202
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:10,160
But you know, he prefers to work on Mac and our policy is you may work on a new system

203
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,560
you want as long as you don't commit Windows line innings to get because that is a hanging

204
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,280
offense.

205
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,500
So I have to give up my M1 Mac Air and I bought a Pangolin from System76.

206
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,560
With a Ryzen in it, which is interesting.

207
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
It's pretty cool.

208
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
They're all Ryzen.

209
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
They're all Ryzen.

210
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,120
So the Pangolin is a pure AMD system.

211
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,720
And there is a method to my madness here.

212
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,840
Granted my fever was 101 when I bought it.

213
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
And talk to the sales guy.

214
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,280
So Sam, you did an excellent job here.

215
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,840
Why didn't you just get yourself another M1 MacBook Air?

216
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,040
Why did you go with a Pangolin Linux box?

217
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,600
Yes, this is the big thing, right?

218
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,400
The Air config versus what I got in the Pangolin does not match up at all.

219
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,440
Right, 64 gigs of RAM.

220
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
That's pretty nice.

221
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah, 64 gigs of RAM.

222
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's a pretty beastly machine.

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,360
We have a link in the show notes, I think, definitely in the chat room.

224
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,840
And I want to give it a shot.

225
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,080
So you don't know this yet.

226
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Confession, I did order also a monitor for it, a 1080p because I don't want to fight

227
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,120
with Linux upscaling monitor.

228
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,000
And I have a launch keyboard to go with it.

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,840
I'm going to be pretty, I'm going to give it another go.

230
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
The Linux stuff.

231
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,560
I think the all AMD with an AMD GPU in there, if this doesn't work for you, I think it's

232
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,720
fair to say you gave it a really good shot because it's a preloaded Linux box from a

233
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,080
Linux first vendor and it's an entire AMD stack with lots of power.

234
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Hopefully it works for you.

235
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
We'll see.

236
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Are you going to keep Pop OS on there?

237
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Yeah.

238
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Yeah, I am.

239
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
All right.

240
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
Will you let us know how it is?

241
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,240
Also, just a shout out to some friends of ours.

242
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,000
They don't sponsor, never have anything like that, no kickback.

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,240
But if you're looking for a used server, unixsurplus.com, just going to put that out there.

244
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,040
That's where I've bought some of my stuff in the past and I like it.

245
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
Linode.com slash coder.

246
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,080
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

247
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
show.

248
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
It really makes a difference.

249
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,600
Linode.com slash coder.

250
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,240
Linode is where we host everything that we've built for the last couple of years, but it's

251
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,140
also where I host my personal stuff.

252
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,600
It was a Linode weekend.

253
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,880
It really was.

254
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,240
On Friday, I got on my sync thing Linode, which is one of the $5 a month boxes, which

255
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,380
does sync thing and some SSH jump post stuff for me and occasionally other random tasks.

256
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,200
Sometimes I want to pull down the stuff I still have in Dropbox and I want to put it

257
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
on a cloud box.

258
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,480
I do like the Dropbox command line version on that box.

259
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,540
I could tell it still had some horsepower to spare because you get a surprising amount

260
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,360
of performance out of a $5 a month system.

261
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,760
I pulled down a Starbound Docker compose file and it looked pretty good and fired up Starbound

262
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,800
on my Linode.

263
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,680
My kids and I have a persistent Starbound world, which is a fun, very, very adorable

264
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,960
little game, although it lacks controller support on the PC, which is just atrocious.

265
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,000
It runs great on Linode because it doesn't take a ton of resources for us to play on

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
there.

267
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
The system already had... I don't need anything more.

268
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,480
I think this Linode is going to become like my junk drawer server, you know what I mean,

269
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,320
where I just have a bunch of different stuff on there that it just runs great.

270
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Then on Sunday, I set up a CentOS Stream 8 box because I decided to try out a Docker

271
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,480
container of Windows 2000 that you can RDP into.

272
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,040
How awesome would that be to have a Windows 2000 machine running in a Docker container

273
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,520
up on Linode that I can RDP into?

274
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,560
Just seems like the ultimate cloud workstation.

275
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,960
What else could you possibly ever want?

276
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,000
I thought, well, what a great opportunity to try out CentOS Stream 8 a little bit more.

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
I did just that.

278
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,560
I set it up and I got Docker installed on there and it's so quick and it's such a thrill

279
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,880
when you've just done a fresh install on Linode and then you do a system update because the

280
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:15,000
updates download from their local LAN because they've mirrored the repositories there.

281
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You just get essentially download speeds that are so fast that the only limitation is how

282
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,400
fast your SSH terminal can update the results.

283
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,200
I mean, it's happening faster than the terminal can even update the results.

284
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,920
They're just such screamers and Linode has recently been rolling out MVME upgraded storage,

285
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,440
which is awesome and they have 11 data centers to choose from.

286
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,840
So you're going to find something that's close to you that's just a few hops away either

287
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,680
from you or your clients, depending on what you're doing.

288
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,980
You know, I can sit here and tell you all day long about the various ways we use Linode

289
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
also for JB.

290
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,120
It's critical to our infrastructure now, but I think that a hundred dollars will speak

291
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
for itself.

292
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
So go there and try it out.

293
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,320
So go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 and you support the show.

294
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,100
It's linode.com slash coder, get 60 day credit on a new account and support the show, linode.com

295
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,840
slash coder.

296
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,400
So old grumpy developer, he's got some questions for us.

297
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,080
He worries he's becoming the resident old man in his groups.

298
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,680
He says, Hey guys, longtime listener here and I've always appreciated your non BS response

299
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,400
to things happening in the tech world.

300
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,360
So I'd love your opinion on something that's showing up all over my tech channels these

301
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,800
days.

302
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Web three.

303
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,120
Now I'm all for better payments on the web and depending on the application, decentralization

304
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,520
can be great.

305
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,440
However, it seems that their answer is just throw everything, including code data, everything

306
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,280
into the blockchain.

307
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
Really?

308
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,040
This sounds like a proof of concept, but it's been months.

309
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Actually it's been years.

310
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,740
It's been months of talking about how it's going to kill the web as we know it.

311
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,960
And yet when you ask people for some solid examples, the answer is just do some, do your

312
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
research.

313
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,640
God, crypto.

314
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,520
Have I just become the resident old man in these circles shaking my fist at these crazy

315
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
kids?

316
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
What's your take?

317
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,080
Is web three an actual movement and a thing we should be paying attention to or just a

318
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,100
niche thing for the crypto bros and shady businesses?

319
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:10,960
And I should mention today as we are recording Coinbase, one of the largest online exchanges

320
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:19,040
for crypto, its co-founder and an ex Sequoia partner announced paradigm one, which is a

321
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:28,000
$2.5 billion fund that's going to, I guess, essentially VC web three companies.

322
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,440
And it's $2.5 billion that they're a fund that they're launching today.

323
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:41,320
Also the web three foundation has a series of grants they've given out to nearly 300

324
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
projects.

325
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,640
I have information about that in the show notes, including how you could apply for one

326
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,260
of these grants.

327
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,200
Web three, have you been sucked into any of this hype cycle about web three at all?

328
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,760
I have been very Clint Eastwood skeptical.

329
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,080
So there's a problem in the industry right now where mobile has been dominated by a duopoly

330
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,440
of Apple and Google agreed.

331
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,800
And if your Facebook, Microsoft or frankly anybody else who wants to make money and not

332
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,600
give 30% to Apple and Google, you need to manufacture another paradigm.

333
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,840
When I hear web three, I hear Metta.

334
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,640
It's the same bull only Metta is corporate owned by a few giants.

335
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,040
And I think a lot of the people behind web three envision a blockchain powered, decentralized

336
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,600
future utopia.

337
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,680
And this gets a little nasty because I know you personally know one of those people or

338
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,780
at least someone I'm connected to on LinkedIn who is really, really enthusiastic about it.

339
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,200
But it's weird because he made all his money on a very simple, you know, when you come

340
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,640
down to it, SaaS service for a niche.

341
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,560
I don't think that web three is a thing.

342
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,400
I think it's a marketing term.

343
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
That's nice.

344
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,020
I can't say it all ends in tears because it doesn't.

345
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,760
But it's just like a harder way to do simple things in my opinion.

346
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,320
I think it's got a few things going for it.

347
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,240
But like all of these things that are this huge thing, I think one or two things will

348
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,440
shake out as technologies that people adopt and the other two hundred and ninety seven

349
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,400
will all disappear and go nowhere.

350
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,740
One I will say, like the gentleman I'm thinking of, I believe this gentleman has a lot of

351
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,680
power to raise VC money and he will be successful because he has money.

352
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Right.

353
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
True.

354
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,560
A lot of the stuff I've seen with three is just like tacking on a crypto and the blockchain

355
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,000
that already exists and saying it's web three.

356
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,960
I don't even believe in Web 2.0.

357
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,840
I'm just like, dude, the Dom existed for a long time.

358
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,480
The only reason the Dom isn't 100 percent dominant and I could make a good argument

359
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,280
that it is, is because Apple's a little bitch about JavaScript engines on iOS.

360
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:54,440
The problem is that there's one very big platform, very big vendor that has a stake in having

361
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,120
the subscription model app development economy continue to work.

362
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:07,160
Today, Roblox announced they're they're spending a huge amount of money on online education

363
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,240
in what they are also calling the metaverse.

364
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,200
Don't you think it's interesting you have Web 3.0 and the metaverse happening around

365
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,000
the same time and they're not the same thing.

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,720
They're the same bloody thing.

367
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,740
They're not one in one key way, in one key way.

368
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,800
One is like this utopian crypto backed like we made a bunch of money and now we want to

369
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
become utopian.

370
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Yeah.

371
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
These people think that.

372
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
No, they don't.

373
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
That's the.

374
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Yeah, I know.

375
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
But this is what they're.

376
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Let me tell you what they're selling.

377
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,000
What they're selling is Web 3.0 is private by default because all your information is

378
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,200
central in a blockchain.

379
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,600
So not each company storing it.

380
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,440
Therefore they're giving up all of the data they collect on you and you are allowing certain

381
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,120
information via controls and then that information stored in the blockchain.

382
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,200
That kind of stuff.

383
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,120
I seem to remember somebody telling me that someone else was doing this for open source

384
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,040
and Linux and then all of a sudden that person sold out.

385
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,520
Oh, I'm not saying I don't buy it.

386
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,240
I don't buy it.

387
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
They're all shysters.

388
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,400
It's all anybody who can get V.C. money is in for themselves.

389
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,240
I mean, come on, dudes.

390
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,000
Web 3.0 define what is our new technology?

391
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
No, blockchains went around.

392
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,880
It's I think you have two camps.

393
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,860
You have people who are delusional and think that companies like Microsoft and Apple and

394
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,320
Amazon would give up power and decentralize it to a bunch of, you know, to the blockchain.

395
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
That's never going to happen.

396
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,280
And then you have people that actually, you know, know it's never going to happen or just

397
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
grifting.

398
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,040
I think those are two camps in this group.

399
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,920
OK, I think I have a special experience in this.

400
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:45,660
Because I'm I'm old enough to have been right there at the beginning of the app store, right?

401
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,640
It was a utopia.

402
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,720
Or so we thought.

403
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,960
But it turned out, thank you, Epic, for suing Apple, that it was all from the beginning.

404
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,320
They were using the app to make bigger deals with other companies and control the ecosystem.

405
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
Web 3.0 is not.

406
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
You know what 3.0 is?

407
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,480
It's somebody who made their money, sold out, everybody over that wants to now cleanse their

408
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,520
reputation.

409
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
That's what Web 3.0 is.

410
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Yeah.

411
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,280
And be responsible for building the next generation of some technology platform so they can make

412
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,240
their make it into history books.

413
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,000
It's not the next generation.

414
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,480
You could do the same thing with regular rest.

415
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,120
It's putting something on the block chain does not inherently make it more secure.

416
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
It doesn't make it better.

417
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,640
It, in fact, makes it slower and dumber.

418
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,920
That's dumb.

419
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,600
Here's the thing, though.

420
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,200
Having a decentralized, trusted way for companies to share data and do payments, that idea is

421
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,440
appealing to a lot of people.

422
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,740
And that's why I think this Web 3.0 stuff has been picking up momentum since 2018.

423
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,800
And it's just been getting the ball has just been bigger, the snowball has gotten bigger

424
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
and bigger.

425
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,480
And I think they're touching on key issues that people are concerned about, like control

426
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
of privacy.

427
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,640
Oh, I know.

428
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,880
But people care about that.

429
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
And so they're playing to that.

430
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Fry me some bacon.

431
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Give me my bacon.

432
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,440
Here you go.

433
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,240
I have some possum bacon from Tampa, maple possum bacon.

434
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,080
It's they're trying to make their rehash ideas sound like new ideas.

435
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,480
It's all.

436
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,440
Don't listen to it.

437
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,640
I was there for the whole mobile boom.

438
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,360
I was there when the shysters would sell.

439
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,560
They would try to sell Adobe Air to people.

440
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Oh, yeah.

441
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
And saying it was like flat.

442
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,920
I mean, it's these are people who've already made their money.

443
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Yeah.

444
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,360
That have no business in this industry.

445
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,080
And if we didn't have conflicts, I would go after a very specific person.

446
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,160
So it's.

447
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,800
If these people weren't rich from either, you know, selling Bitcoin or cashing out their

448
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,640
V.C. businesses, this Web 3.0 thing wouldn't be going anywhere because the industry doesn't

449
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,440
necessarily want this, but these people want it.

450
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,960
And because they're rich, these people, you know, who else is a fraud?

451
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,320
Gainer, Vaynerchuk, whatever his name is, Gary, these people, Gary, thank you.

452
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,440
These people hustle.

453
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,400
And this dude I'm thinking of in particular wants to be the next one.

454
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Yeah.

455
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Yes.

456
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
We could talk about this offline because, you know, exactly what I'm talking about.

457
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Yeah.

458
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
I do know who you're talking about.

459
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Yes, I do.

460
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
It's it's the same.

461
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Yeah.

462
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
You know what?

463
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,580
We're just going to go through emails because it's nonsense.

464
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,880
It's the same technology hasn't changed since the 80s.

465
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, and humans, let's be honest, that's at the core of the problem.

466
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's humans.

467
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,320
And once you understand human nature and human motivations, and especially once you've had

468
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,680
a peek behind the curtain at these industries, you really kind of.

469
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Wow.

470
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,320
You managed to get another Swift episode out of me.

471
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Thank you, Fever.

472
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,880
Let's do just a couple more emails because we had a couple of spicy ones that are calling

473
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,420
Apple out hardcore.

474
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,960
And it's a different bend on the story than I think we've taken.

475
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,840
So Trev writes in, I just wanted to add my two cents on what I think is Apple's hypocrisy.

476
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,960
We're supposed to trust whoever they say we should trust.

477
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,560
But then, heaven forbid, I'm allowed to use my own device the way I want.

478
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,700
I'm referring, of course, to the new back door they've opened up for three letter agencies

479
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,440
via iCloud bastions of privacy and security.

480
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
My arse.

481
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,620
So Trev says, at the end of the day, you can't trust Apple because the way they've engineered

482
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,320
the iCloud backups when you use iCloud messages, it makes it possible for them to get access

483
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,000
to things like your messages and, if you use iCloud backup, your backup of your phone from

484
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,320
the cloud, essentially giving three letter agencies a back door into every iPhone.

485
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,200
I just got an iMessage from Fort Meade.

486
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,400
They want us to shut the f*** up right now.

487
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,120
Daniel is a web dev from Hungary, and he feels like forcing Apple to enable sideloading would

488
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
actually be a really bad thing.

489
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,520
He says, I just cannot agree with the idea that giving the government the power to change

490
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,200
some company's software to benefit a few people is ever going to be a good thing.

491
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,600
Daniel, you are a beautiful man.

492
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,520
I've never met you, nor have I seen you, but your spirit.

493
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:52,960
He's from Hungary, but he sounds like maybe like a legacy American patriot who's like

494
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
small government.

495
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,320
Honestly, he sounds like he's from Utopia.

496
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,880
He says, okay, but here's his argument.

497
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,040
If it was okay to force Apple to allow sideloading, then isn't it just the same?

498
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,800
Isn't the same logic that Apple should be forced to allow NSA backdoors directly into

499
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,040
the phone?

500
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,120
Isn't the NSA also working to benefit people?

501
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,960
So have you ever heard of phone companies?

502
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,440
Yeah, I have.

503
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Yeah.

504
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,280
Just, Daniel, you are a beautiful soul.

505
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,920
You're deeply confused, but you're a beautiful soul.

506
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,000
They already do.

507
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,160
Everything you've described is already happening.

508
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,840
Welcome to the Thunderdome, and it's not just the US, by the way.

509
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,720
They don't need to build a backdoor into the phone.

510
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
What do you mean?

511
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
It's already there.

512
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
It's already there.

513
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Once it hits the server, you're done.

514
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,160
I think that's just it.

515
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,680
We forget that, but it matters.

516
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
All right.

517
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,880
So I want to say we're holding on to some productivity tips that have come in this week,

518
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,840
and we're going to round up of them next week.

519
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,600
We've gotten some good ones so far that are like good tips for speeding up people's development

520
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
workflows.

521
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,120
We've had a few ideas for tools that you could add, like the hook up to your machine, actually.

522
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,240
But we'd like more so we can feature them next week.

523
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,000
So whatever platform you use, whatever apps you like or tools that have changed your game,

524
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
let us know.

525
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,260
Maybe it's something that just improved your workspace.

526
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,840
Help a fellow coder out, coder.show slash contact, and then in 4.11, we'll round some

527
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,400
of those up and cover them.

528
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,600
We've gotten some good ones in, but I think maybe we're probably so far going to read

529
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,360
three or four on there, so we could use a few more, so that way we could do a nice complete

530
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,920
roundup.

531
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,000
Shortcut.com slash coder.

532
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,720
Have you really ever been happy with your project management tool?

533
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,000
I mean, let's be honest, most are either too simple or they're so complex that you have

534
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,920
to essentially have somebody in charge of just prodding everyone to use it all the time.

535
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,320
Shortcut, formerly known as Clubhouse, is different because it's worse.

536
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,280
No, of course it's not.

537
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,760
No, it's way better.

538
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,220
Shortcut is a project management tool that's built specifically for software teams.

539
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,980
It's fast, it's intuitive, it's flexible, it's powerful, and it has a lot of other nice

540
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,980
things going for it.

541
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,520
Here's a few of the highlights that I think are great, especially if you have a team that

542
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,900
has a team-based workflow.

543
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:05,020
Individual teams can use Shortcut's default workflows or customize them.

544
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,840
That's totally optional too.

545
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,480
And they have organizational-wide goals and roadmaps.

546
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,600
The work in these workflows is automatically tied into larger company goals.

547
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,760
It takes just one click to go from a team roadmap to an individual update and vice versa.

548
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,620
And the other thing you have to love is the type VCS integrations, whether you use GitHub

549
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,120
or GitLab or Bitbucket, Shortcut ties directly to those so you can update your progress from

550
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
the command line.

551
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,200
Actually, speaking of using the keyboard, it has a very keyboard-friendly interface,

552
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
and I love this.

553
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,120
I think this is a great power user tool.

554
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,380
They have what they call the PowerBar, probably appropriately named, allowing you to do virtually

555
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,920
anything without having to touch your mouse.

556
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Just throw it away.

557
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
Just use the keyboard.

558
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,840
I think also iteration planning is fantastic.

559
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
You can set weekly priorities.

560
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,960
Oh, man, I could use that.

561
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,600
And then let Shortcut run the schedule for you with, you know, a company burn down charts

562
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,200
and other kind of reporting that just makes it great.

563
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,200
So go give it a try today at shortcut.com slash coder, again, at shortcut.com slash

564
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
coder.

565
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,680
That's where you go to sign up and support the show, shortcut.com slash coder, again,

566
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,480
formerly known as Clubhouse.

567
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
Let's be honest.

568
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:19,000
You shouldn't have to project manage your project management, shortcut.com slash coder.

569
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,720
The developers are really upset this week because it seems like Apple is buying Google

570
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,560
ads out from underneath them to redirect users to subscribing via the App Store platform

571
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,260
instead of the developer's website, where it would likely be cheaper and they would

572
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,240
generate more revenue.

573
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,640
Apple has just sneaky bought a few ads here and there.

574
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
A few.

575
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,040
To sort of capture search results and send them to the App Store.

576
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,080
I don't care who you are.

577
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
This just doesn't look good.

578
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,440
Well, no, it's not great.

579
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
And it shows you.

580
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,600
I'm going to try to be calm here.

581
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm going to say that the reality of iOS is that the real business that Apple is in is

582
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,280
the business of collecting in-app purchases or just I would say just monetize the iPhone

583
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
in general.

584
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Right.

585
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,840
But well, I would go a little further.

586
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,280
Like your description was fair, but I think it was a little diplomatic.

587
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,240
They are not saying this is Apple doing it.

588
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,440
They're making it look like it's the actual app developer themselves putting up these

589
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
ads.

590
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Wow.

591
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Really?

592
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Yeah.

593
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,960
Which they're using the app developers trademarks or logos, et cetera.

594
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,800
And the app developers aren't happy.

595
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,760
But because it's Apple and no one wants to get kicked off the store, I mean, you can

596
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,320
read the article in Forbes.

597
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,720
It's a chilling effect.

598
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,000
Honestly, Apple is no longer a computer company.

599
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,920
They're a middleman company.

600
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,220
That's what they are.

601
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,940
They're here to collect their tax.

602
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,640
They're the IRS of businesses, of software businesses.

603
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,840
They're here to collect their tax.

604
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,960
And that's what they do.

605
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,160
And it's a bigger business than the Macintosh business, by the way.

606
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:02,360
So you're right, reading the details, they ran the ads for the app as if the developer

607
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
had ran them.

608
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,320
So it'd be like an ad for Overcast on Google ads.

609
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
Yeah.

610
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Overcast is a small app.

611
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,440
Let's take Tinder, which is a huge app, because everybody on an app was looking to get some

612
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,400
app during the COVID, right?

613
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,080
Ah, it's so scummy, right?

614
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,520
They pretended to be Tinder.

615
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,840
No, I am not a Tinder user anymore.

616
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,520
I mean, that's how Chris and I met.

617
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,520
But you know, it's fine.

618
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,760
That's a joke.

619
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,960
The other part of this is that by buying these ads, they are driving up the cost of legitimate

620
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,960
ads from the actual app developer for the name of their own goddamn app.

621
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,440
That seems really shady.

622
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,680
Honestly, this is the reason, not the reason, but this is a reason I bought a Pangolin instead

623
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:53,240
of a Mac today, because I don't believe that Apple is a software company or frankly a computer

624
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,480
company anymore.

625
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,040
They are a revenue maximization company and frankly, a middleman company.

626
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,040
It really is a shady thing to do because I hadn't thought about.

627
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
It's super shady.

628
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
There's no excuse for this.

629
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,280
I hadn't thought about raising the price for developers to advertise their own app.

630
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,560
That really is just the worst.

631
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,760
Wow.

632
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,720
And you know, they made those first party app tracking changes and guess what?

633
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,480
Now Apple's ad sales are way up.

634
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:27,720
In fact, AppsFlyer, which is an app marketing survey business, says that really now developers

635
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,760
are kind of forced to use Apple's ads if they want to take advantage of any first party

636
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
information.

637
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,800
So it's no surprise that now the number one player in this area is becoming Apple.

638
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,160
They've also taken a good chunk out of some of the social networks.

639
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,520
Facebook claimed that they were taking a bit of a hit.

640
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,640
It seems like it was clearly a motivated move that, geez, it just had the side benefit.

641
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,440
I mean, you could argue it's for users, but yeah, we said it at the time.

642
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,080
This is going to increase their ad sales.

643
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,240
What are you talking about?

644
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,560
This is going to increase their in-app purchase revenue.

645
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,280
There is no excuse for this.

646
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,440
They decided to do a solid to the biggest grossing apps in their store that we're also

647
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,420
offering outside of app purchases.

648
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,420
Give me a break.

649
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,420
I know.

650
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,660
This challenges credulity.

651
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,880
This is why the Mac is honestly so neglected.

652
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,600
Yes, the hardware is great, blah, blah, blah, but the software is kind of, it doesn't meet

653
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
the hardware for sure.

654
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,720
Yeah, I was thinking like things are good now, right?

655
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,400
With things are getting better.

656
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,700
Monorays, a pretty good release, as long as you don't change your mouse cursor size.

657
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,760
And the M1 hardware and the M1 Max and Pro updates seem really solid.

658
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
So do the new MacBooks.

659
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,720
They've come back on a few decisions they've made that were awful, and now the MacBooks

660
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,560
seem really competitive.

661
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,920
But how long will it last?

662
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:50,040
Because this is ultimately, let's say the Mac were to enjoy just a renaissance like

663
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,040
nobody ever saw.

664
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,080
And this is hypothetical, but let's just say it shoots up to 30% of the PC market, right?

665
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,680
Well what's Apple going to do?

666
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,680
They're going to do exactly what they're doing to iPhone users right now.

667
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,520
They're going to try to start monetizing the Mac user in every single way.

668
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,200
Because once they reach market saturation of potential customers for their devices,

669
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,320
because they are very expensive, and because they have a very unique ecosystem, not everyone's

670
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
going to buy it.

671
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,080
So they reach market saturation, and the only direction they have to go then is to monetize

672
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,920
all those billions of users.

673
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,800
And this is why I'm going back to Linux.

674
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
It's the long-term bet.

675
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,240
You're going to have a good time for a short term, is my bet, with the Apple platform.

676
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,760
It's got probably years of interesting growth ahead of it, but it won't last forever.

677
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,800
And if you look at the long time scale, you know Apple's a 30-year plus company, it took

678
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,840
them about 20 years, and then they took their eye off the Mac for a bit.

679
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,520
And now they're just after 10 years getting back to it.

680
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,660
Yeah, but see, I think they really are a services company now.

681
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,040
They're looking for that sweet, sweet recurring revenue.

682
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,300
And you know this because the background of our conversation has been the chip shortage.

683
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,400
Apple is the richest company in the world, or maybe they dropped, I don't know, but they're

684
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,360
one of the top three.

685
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,780
They could just like, with magic, open factories, right?

686
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,640
Because I don't care what you say, if you're willing to throw obscene amounts of money

687
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,160
at a problem, those problems get solved.

688
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,360
If you think about what this means long term, it's bad for Apple users long term.

689
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,320
This is not a good thing to see Apple doing.

690
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,760
And if you doubt the seriousness in which Apple sees this, just look at how serious

691
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,720
they are investing in Apple TV, and how all in they are with Apple TV.

692
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,240
There's only one reason, services.

693
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,040
It's services, and that shows you like how far are they willing to go?

694
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,960
They're willing to become a new HBO.

695
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,240
They're willing to basically build HBO inside their company and produce content to drive

696
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
up services.

697
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,640
You don't have to deal with any of those nasty labor unions, or workers, or people who might

698
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,320
get hurt on the job building your desktops, right?

699
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,700
Seriously, like, yeah, I mean, I know I'm gonna put my foot in the fire here, but this

700
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,800
is why I have a very sympathetic eye to System76.

701
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,120
You know what, they're doing a lot of their work.

702
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,820
I know they buy, you know, the laptops from overseas, and they just do whatever they do

703
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,000
with them.

704
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,620
But they build their Thaleos and some of their other equipment in the US, right, the launch

705
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,800
keyboard in Denver.

706
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,960
They do a fair amount of QA and firmware work, and there's quite a bit of back and forth

707
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,840
with the vendor to just fix small compatibility, niggling issues.

708
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,440
But you're right, they don't build the motherboards or the chassis or anything.

709
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,320
But they're getting there, right?

710
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,120
They've even said on their roadmap is to get there.

711
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,660
Carl and I had a conversation about it when I was there in Denver, and he's pretty frank

712
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,660
about it, really.

713
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:46,120
Like, the launch is a step to figuring out how to build an electronic device like this,

714
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,720
and it was the baby steps to launching a laptop.

715
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,320
It's all in the end goal to sort of building a laptop.

716
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,940
I think he'd be pretty pleased if they had something that was getting close to shipping

717
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,940
in two years.

718
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,640
So that's kind of the timeline we might be looking at.

719
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
I actually think too.

720
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,080
I mean, you might know more than I do.

721
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,480
I feel two years is...

722
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,960
Oh, I think it's optimistic.

723
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Yeah.

724
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,360
Yeah, I, you know, but like they're making the effort.

725
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,320
People can listen to old shows and me rant about Tim Cook when I don't have a fever,

726
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,480
or when I do, frankly, but I don't like what Apple has become.

727
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,200
You know, they were a company started with two buddies out of a garage in California,

728
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:33,380
and they've become this thing that knows neither, you know, state, country, friend.

729
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,440
It's all about extracting revenue from other people's labor, and that seems...

730
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,200
Apple is a nation onto its own now, really.

731
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
Right.

732
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
They're their own country.

733
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
In fact, they tax as they see fit, which...

734
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Right.

735
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,680
That's exactly where I was going.

736
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
Right.

737
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,920
Here's my problem.

738
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,400
They are such a relevant player that, A, they come up all the time because of how significant

739
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,040
they are in the market, and B, they touch everything.

740
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,320
It's like Google, the federal government, Amazon.

741
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,800
It's almost impossible to not interface with them in some way.

742
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,080
Apple maybe is the one you could get away from the most out of the tech giants, I'd

743
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,080
argue.

744
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,400
I'm not saying I wouldn't interface with them.

745
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:17,120
I mean, I'm just saying, do we need to develop for their platforms?

746
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,880
I guess I'm feeling a little like we've already reached a dystopia we just don't realize.

747
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,880
It's dystopia.

748
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,840
It's just a boring dystopia because we have this situation where governments and companies

749
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:33,120
and all of this are just unavoidable, and if you have moral objections to how they operate,

750
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,800
you have no choice.

751
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,920
They are such a significant player now that they will still have some influence in your

752
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
life.

753
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
It's a little sad.

754
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,160
Sure, but the world has always been hell until somebody said no.

755
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,800
The last time somebody said no was Winston Churchill and the people of England, and they

756
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,560
said no, and they saved the world.

757
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,760
Why can't us as engineers and software developers just say no?

758
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,200
I think that's where we should end it.

759
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Go ahead.

760
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Let me tell you about Web3.

761
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
No.

762
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Okay.

763
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
I'm just kidding.

764
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
You're right.

765
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
We should wrap it up there.

766
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
We have more for next week, but we'll let you go.

767
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,960
You got to get rested up and get healthy.

768
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,120
Our friends over at Web3 will solve all of the problems for us in the meantime, so I

769
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,080
think when we come back, it'll all be solved.

770
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,880
I have many, many doubts.

771
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
Yeah.

772
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,880
Yeah.

773
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,280
And of course, you can find Mike on Twitter.

774
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
He's at Dumanuco.

775
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,800
His company's at the Mad Botter Inc.

776
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,760
And go check out Alice, his latest project, Alice.dev.

777
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,780
I'm at Chris LAS, the whole network, because there's a whole network of shows like Linux

778
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:32,160
Action News and Linux Unplugged, at Jupiter Signal, and of course, at Coder Radio Show

779
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,840
for like announcements, releases, and stuff like this, but you know, you can find links

780
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,640

783
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,520
It's all a really important part of the show, and I'd like to make it even more part of

784
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
the show.

785
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
