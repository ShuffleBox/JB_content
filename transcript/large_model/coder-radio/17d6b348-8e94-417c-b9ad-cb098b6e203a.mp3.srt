00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Koda Radio, episode 357, for May 13th, 2019.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello, and welcome to Koda Radio,

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show that takes a pragmatic look

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
at the art and business of software development and related technologies.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Wes, and I'm joined once again by Mr. Michael Dominic.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Welcome to the show, Mike.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It sounds like you're having a bit of a storm out there, but, well, that didn't stop you.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, Wes, we are on location here in Atlantis, otherwise known as Florida,

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and things are going great. We are not drowning.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, here to help live with us in the studio is the man who puts I in iOS, Mr. Chris Fisher.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Or the home in HomePod.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, that's right.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hello, gentlemen. Good to be back.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I brought Levi, the studio dog, with me, too.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's really why you invited me.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He keeps us safe, so we can focus on all the good content in this here, Koda Radio.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay, Chris and I are just back from Red Hat Summit in Boston.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Boston.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And while we left, it seemed like everything else in the world exploded.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Holy smokes.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Between Google I.O. and Microsoft Build right here.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We just flew, left Seattle, the Redmond area, abandoned it for Red Hat.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Also, a Python conference was going on, too.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So much.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All the things were happening last week. It was crazy.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So, we have a lot to catch up on here on the show.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Before we get into any of that, though, we've had some excellent feedback this week.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's start with our friend, Louis, who writes to us.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Love the show. It's probably my favorite piece of J.B. content since the untimely departure of Unfilter.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And thank you for your perfect email.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Isn't that the end?

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, that's perfect.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
End conclusion.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No, he's got a little more substance than that, Mike.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He writes, I was listening to episode 356 with glee as you were discussing testing and junior DevOps positions.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've just accepted a position as DevOps assistant at a small dev shop with the intent to work on my coding and development skills

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and make my way into a more useful member of the team.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I was very excited about the position initially.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's taken some time to get the interview process behind me,

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and I was beginning to become concerned I had accepted a position as the office doormat, bottom of the totem pole, as it were.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
After listening to the show and hearing Michael talk about the importance of QA to a dev shop,

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm thinking it may be a great role for me.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The following question you had regarding QA as a career path really hit my concerns on the nose

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and made me feel a lot better about my career decision.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I thought I was going to be in a big rush to get out of the basement and up to a full developer position.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But after listening, I really feel like my contribution to this team is going to be important and necessary from the get go.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Thanks for the great show, Louis.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, so that's some good stuff, Louis.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
QA is super important.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I keep saying this and people keep not believing me, especially for a dev shop.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If QA fails, oftentimes dev shops either lose margin on a project or get fired.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And when the shop gets fired, usually people get fired.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So that's super bad, right?

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
QA, please test your stuff.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The only thing that really determines if you're adding value and are a good contributing member to the team

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
or your role is viewed that way is the culture of the people you're working with, right?

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If they view your contributions, if the system is set up so that your position isn't just mindless tasks that should be automated

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
but you're actually interacting with and concerned and an integral part of the process,

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
then even if people outside of that industry don't understand your value, it's still totally valid.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's a bit of an ego check at the door.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You can also flip this around for other industries.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Like when I look at tech support and my previous roles as a sys admin,

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
the absolute best admins had spent time doing tech support.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They'd spent time answering the phone and answering end users' questions.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And even just to bring it to something a little more locally here, just recently, Wes is our lead podcaster on the network.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He's like the top podcaster.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But just over the last couple of weeks before we hired another editor,

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
we had Wes editing this here show just to give him hands-on experience with what that end of the production crew has to work on.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Wes wasn't hired to edit podcasts, but it was good to give him those insights so that way,

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
A, he knows what kind of deliverables to give another team member,

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
but B, you gained a lot of insights into the actual production application as well.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So now you've taken that information forward and enhanced other aspects of our production,

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
which was just an ancillary benefit of having you go do something that, to be frank, was below you, below your job title.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But you check the ego at the door, and you're like, this is just good work.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is just something for me to learn.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, it makes me a better team member, and I can put out a better product as a result.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Exactly. I think that was really useful.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And it's a matter of just getting over yourself a little bit.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And, you know, we do need to – I'm glad we're talking about – and, Mike, I'm glad you shared your views,

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
because we do need to recognize that role in the industry and not be so obsessed with the totem pole

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and just recognize that we're all a team trying to make a product or whatever you're doing together.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
How can you make the team stronger?

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Exactly.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay, well, totally different sort of feedback.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There's been a request over in our subreddit.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes, we do have a subreddit, coderadio.reddit.com.

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Anyone know any Linux or programming subs that aren't full of mindless circle jerking?

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Most seem to be afflicted with mindless circle jerking, free software extremism, and other indiscretions.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Now, Mike, you've already gave a little bit of feedback.

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This is a hard question to answer.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Is there anywhere you turn?

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You know, I kind of have a weird view on this.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I mean, I would argue, well, what are you looking to get out of a Linux community?

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Are you talking about desktop Linux?

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Are you talking about, like, Linux the kernel, Linux on the server?

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And also, it used to be much, much worse.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So I would almost say, I don't know where you're going, but I would avoid R slash Linux as much as possible

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and go to things like the Ubuntu forums aren't bad.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I would also say the Jupyter broadcasting Telegram channel.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I always log in there and people are like, oh, I'm running KDE because apparently I don't have a job

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and I don't want to tweak settings.

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That took a turn.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Ouch.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And, you know, I need help.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And people help them who also allegedly don't have jobs.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So, you know, go there.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I mean, that's true free labor, right?

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's always useful.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You could tell Mike's a businessman.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Telegram is a good option.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a little bit different than, you know, than Reddit, but it has a lot of the same feelings.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I think it depends on, not to interrupt you, I'm sorry, but I just think it depends on the niche.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So it depends on how niche-y down you go.

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you go down to a group that's just enthusiastic about developing software, then they get less religious, right?

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But if you go to a group that's all about GTK or free software, all about Qt, then they're going to be pretty passionate.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Understand your niche.

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And you're right.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I think it's particularly hard, too, because Linux is just a big tent, right?

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You have sys admin types, you have free software types, or you might have just people who want to write Python

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and happen to run it all on Linux.

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So just avoid the word GNU if you can, and you will be okay.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now you're talking like the Red Hat Summit.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Mike, we were down there, and I swear, they did not use the word free software once the entire week.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's all open source.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Kidding aside, they're definitely, at least from my kind of outside-in perspective, there's definitely a schism

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
between this is GNU, and all these proprietary companies are evil, and you can't just use Linux.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You have to be Linux.

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And those of us who are trying to, again, don't want to hit this too hard, get a job done.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So yeah, anybody, for instance, if you see someone raging on YouTube

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
about so-and-so company contributed X millions or billions of dollars to the Linux Foundation, that's evil.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, that sentence itself is logically wrong, so ignore those people.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Some pragmatic advice from Mr. Dominic.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
All right, moving right along, we've got one more piece of feedback today.

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
In our previous episode, a listener had asked about how to document a large system,

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
like databases, microservices, and more.

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And, well, we had some answers, but probably didn't do a good enough job.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Someone else has written in, and one idea is a mind map tool, like Freeplane.

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This can provide a freeform way to show at a high level how all the parts link together

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and attach as much details as needed, like credentials or screenshots or generated API documentation.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And you know, I think that's a great idea, because anytime you can get something

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
that can capture some of the spirit of maybe like a whiteboard drawing that you have in a meeting

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
as you're diagramming a system architecture, if you can capture that in a way that is kept up to date,

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
that's the hard part, but that can be a huge boon, especially to, say, new developers on the team

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
who are really trying to understand the larger architecture.

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Do you use anything like that, Mike?

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, I use a program on the Mac called OmniGraffle,

150
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and in Chrome, I use draw.io when I'm on Linux.

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So I looked at the screenshots here.

152
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's very similar.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can basically do charts, but I have not used this app in particular,

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
so I'm not sure where the differences would be.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is a nice visual way to do this, and I consider myself to be a visual learner

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and a visual processor of information.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Never really got into the mind maps, though.

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Draw.io, I think I'm going to give that a go.

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Really well done.

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You end up fighting with the tooling, and then you're like, is this even worth it?

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I already know what I'm doing.

162
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You just need those barriers to be low

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
if you're going to get everyone involved to work on it.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
My way of tackling this particular problem would be a simple markdown document

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
where I outline all of the areas that need documentation,

166
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and then I just continue to expand in on that

167
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and then break it out into individual files,

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
which then could be later translated to a Wiki

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
or some other documentation database.

170
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Those tools can convert that to other formats,

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and I've seen some neat little ASCII art to SVG graphic tools out there.

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No way.

173
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah, so if you draw them in the right way,

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that's great.

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
you can then get richer graphics out of it in the end.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I love that.

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'll dig up one of those and throw it in the show notes, yeah.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Lead podcaster indeed.

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's the kind of stuff, Mike.

180
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's the kind of stuff right there.

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's fire.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Okay, so while we're on this vein of documentation,

183
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
there's an interesting little new preference from our friends at Google.

184
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Obviously, Google I.O. went on last week,

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and there was all kinds of interesting news,

186
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
but if you're an Android developer,

187
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
well, you may have noticed that, well, Android development,

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
it's basically Kotlin first now.

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Mike totally called this like almost two years on the nose.

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Called it because Java has Oracle,

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and if you are from Google, who do you not like?

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
In the announcement, Google writes,

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
increasingly Kotlin first,

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
end quote, right there from Google.

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You know what, Chris and Wes, can you guys do me a favor?

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, sure.

197
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Just a small favor now.

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Whip out that iron skillet for me.

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Get me some unfiltered bacon.

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This is the first of two times

201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm going to be frying some bacon today.

202
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Are you ready?

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah, fry it up.

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Well, we'll see.

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't know if we have it loaded in there.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So this bacon is out of Eastern Europe.

207
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, yeah?

208
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, is it tasty?

209
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, it's got a kind of a long history, long memory,

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
sort of not loving Russia feel to it.

211
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Because if you remember JetBrains,

212
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
which I have been corrected by JetBrains,

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
a number of time, it's not actually in Russia.

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Sorry.

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So JetBrains is a company that makes Kotlins.

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
They also make the IntelliJ IDE,

217
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
which Android Studio is based on.

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
When does Google just say,

219
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
thank you, welcome to Google?

220
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's going to happen, right?

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, you think so?

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You think so, huh?

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Absolutely.

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Unless they're making so much money

225
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
that Google doesn't want to spend it,

226
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
but why wouldn't they just buy them?

227
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Let's fry this up then.

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's fry it up.

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Go ahead, go ahead, Mike.

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We're frying it up right now.

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So within 180 days,

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
they're, oh, that's tasty.

233
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I like the aromas.

234
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I like it.

235
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I know.

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So I'm sorry, I didn't mean 180 days.

237
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I mean, a year and a half,

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Google buys JetBrains.

239
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh.

240
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I mean, you nailed this part of the prediction

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
so far two years ago,

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
so this is part two now, really.

243
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Why wouldn't they?

244
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why wouldn't they buy

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
one of the better toolings?

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I mean, they're a small,

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
little independent shop, right?

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's kind of ripe to be snatched up

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
by a giant behemoth.

250
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And they don't have the money

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
to support a language of this caliber,

252
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
especially if it becomes,

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
which it is becoming,

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
of course, yes, just do the math.

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Once Google's pushing this,

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
it's in their best interest

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
to own the entire tooling.

258
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I mean, not only that,

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
but Google itself writes

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
a ton of Java, right?

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I mean, that's kind of the backend

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
for most of their stuff,

263
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and it's also the premier Java IDE.

264
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah, and doesn't Oracle sue Google

265
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
like every two weeks?

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So I mean,

267
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
they must also just like it themselves.

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They write here, too.

269
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
If you're starting a new project,

270
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
you should write it in Kotlin.

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Code written in Kotlin

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
often means much less code for you,

273
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
less code to type, test, and maintain.

274
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So that's just a language win on its own.

275
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah, kidding aside,

276
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I've done some Kotlin in Java projects,

277
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and given the choice,

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I would do Kotlin every time.

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Like, no questions asked, yeah.

280
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
There's Kotlin.js,

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and there's even one targeted

282
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
at like native applications.

283
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So it's only going to be something

284
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
we see more of, I think.

285
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We also had a bit of a upplay

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
of Chrome OS and a downplay

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
of Fuchsia at Google I.O.

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Seems like at least

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
for the next several years,

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
the path forward for Google

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
is an Android and Chrome OS story,

292
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and Fuchsia is going to continue

293
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
just to be an experiment.

294
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Some parties suspected all along

295
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
that Fuchsia was a research project,

296
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
maybe something to allow

297
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
some of their top engineers

298
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
something to work on

299
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
that was academically interested.

300
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And it surely will spin out results.

301
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It might provide models

302
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
that get upstreamed later

303
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
into the Linux kernel, for instance.

304
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It also works as a great leverage

305
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
to get lazy kernel developers

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
to create a new LTS kernel

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
that meets your needs,

308
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and it continues to work

309
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
as great negotiating leverage

310
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
if we want to, and we're getting

311
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
it in that shape.

312
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I think that's really

313
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
what's happening here, is this is

314
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
a negotiating piece with the OEMs

315
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and with the kernel development,

316
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
with upstream development,

317
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
because it benefits

318
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
the kernel development team a lot

319
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
to have Google spending a lot

320
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
of their development money

321
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and resources on the Linux kernel.

322
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And if Google were to abandon

323
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that development, it would be

324
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
a good portion of money

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
that would go elsewhere

326
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
into their own proprietary,

327
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
like, why are containers

328
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
so popular on Linux?

329
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
One big factor in that

330
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
was Google pioneering them

331
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
for their problems.

332
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Say it again, Wes.

333
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Say it again.

334
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We have containers

335
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
because of Google.

336
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, a lot of the memory

337
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
management stuff on ARM devices,

338
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
a lot of the power management

339
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
stuff.

340
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Power support.

341
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah, boy.

342
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Right.

343
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I mean, you start to think

344
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
about all of the developers

345
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
that have come to the table

346
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
because of the Android ecosystem,

347
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
not even Google itself,

348
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
but then, like, your Qualicoms,

349
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
your Samsungs that have all come

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to the table.

351
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't think Linus and GregKH

352
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
are ignorant to that fact.

353
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No.

354
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And so if you don't,

355
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
you never need to ship

356
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
a single Fuchsia product,

357
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
or you could ship a couple

358
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
of them even better.

359
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah, tiny little embedded

360
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
things, throw a few out there.

361
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah, ship a couple of them

362
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
so we can really ship this thing

363
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
if we want to.

364
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I don't know.

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And then, you know,

366
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
if they decide to play ball,

367
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
then they don't need to use it.

368
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And I think it's better

369
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
if everybody wins, right?

370
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Because not only is Fuchsia OS

371
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
but their primary products

372
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
in the market right now

373
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
for operating systems,

374
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Android and Chrome OS,

375
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
are all based on Linux.

376
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's always good to have

377
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
some diversity anyway, right?

378
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So it seems like Fuchsia

379
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
will bring some things.

380
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It did seem that Google

381
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
was furthering down

382
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
on some of their Linux kernel bets,

383
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
though, especially regarding

384
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Chrome OS, which is every day

385
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
seemingly becoming more and more

386
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
like a regular Linux desktop

387
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
just with Google's branding on it.

388
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
As a way to...

389
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
They're bringing Flutter over.

390
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You're going to have additional...

391
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I say something like,

392
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
every Chrome OS machine

393
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
that's built in 2019

394
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
will support running Linux

395
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
applications or something like that.

396
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Right out of the box.

397
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
During the keynote.

398
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, like a lot of things

399
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
are moving into place here.

400
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And right now,

401
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
on a current Chromebook,

402
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
you can go into like

403
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
the search app launcher thing,

404
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
type in terminal,

405
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and in the background,

406
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
the dang thing sets up

407
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
a Debian 9 instance for you,

408
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
a container and launches it.

409
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This is cross-UI,

410
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
cross-platform toolkit,

411
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I think powered by Dart

412
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
under the hood.

413
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And the idea is,

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
as we all want,

415
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
something that you can write

416
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
once and run everywhere.

417
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Flutter is targeting that,

418
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and one of their targeted

419
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
or the supported platforms

420
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
is Chrome OS.

421
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So you can basically develop

422
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
native Chrome OS.

423
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I mean, it's still all using

424
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Android, I think, under the hood.

425
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Another target, though,

426
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
it's just a shim

427
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
in their code for the moment,

428
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I think that'll be the one

429
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
they target first,

430
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
or cute platforms,

431
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
but desktop Linux, right?

432
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So you could be able to code

433
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
something in Flutter,

434
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
run it as a web UI,

435
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
or use Flutter to target

436
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
the Linux desktop.

437
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't know how it's going to

438
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
go, but that could be

439
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
very powerful because one thing

440
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
we've kind of missed

441
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
in the Linux world is we don't

442
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
just have one thing

443
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
to point people at

444
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
to develop apps.

445
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You can do it with Electron

446
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
or, okay, pick one

447
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
of the major toolkits

448
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and hope that you make

449
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the right choice

450
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
without really understanding

451
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
all the implications

452
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
of that.

453
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Mike, I'm curious

454
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
what your take.

455
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Have you played with Flutter?

456
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I mean, you seem to already

457
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
be using some similar

458
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
or competing products.

459
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah, I haven't really played

460
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
with Flutter more

461
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
than just doing a couple

462
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
sample Skunkworks things.

463
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm less optimistic

464
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
than you guys, I think.

465
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I think Flutter is going to be

466
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
for people who are so deep

467
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
into the Google Firebase

468
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
ecosystem where that's

469
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
kind of what they know,

470
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
which is fine.

471
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I really think

472
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
it's a serious

473
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
production tool at the moment.

474
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I think it's a fair hot take

475
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and really can't argue with it.

476
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I think it is early days still.

477
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Can I just change tracks

478
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
for a second?

479
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You know how there's

480
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
always that joke

481
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
that it's the year

482
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
of the Linux desktop,

483
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
which would be easy to make

484
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
right now when you've got

485
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
all of these different vendors

486
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
shipping these Linux shims.

487
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But something else

488
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
that you and I noticed

489
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
at Red Hat Summit

490
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
at the Flutter blog post,

491
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
all of these big summits

492
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
that just happened,

493
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Google IO,

494
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
PyCon,

495
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Red Hat Summit, and Build,

496
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
all very, very prominently

497
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
featured VS Code.

498
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
All of them.

499
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Google showed VS Code

500
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
up on stage.

501
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This Flutter blog post

502
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
has VS Code in the blog post.

503
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Red Hat talked about

504
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
VS Code up on stage,

505
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
had slides talking about

506
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
VS Code up on stage.

507
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Build obviously talked

508
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
extensively about VS Code

509
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and a lot of its new features.

510
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
We talked about VS Code

511
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
remote last episode.

512
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That was one of the things

513
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
they talked about at Build.

514
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Just this is the year

515
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
of VS Code, holy shit.

516
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a flat pack that's like

517
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
super easy to install on Fedora.

518
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's snapped up

519
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
officially by Microsoft,

520
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
which is just insane.

521
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And it was, again,

522
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I just got to say this,

523
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
on a Red Hat slide,

524
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
VS Code,

525
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Microsoft Visual Studio Code

526
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
on a Red Hat slide.

527
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I think that might just further

528
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
prove Mike's prediction right.

529
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's been very successful

530
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
for Microsoft

531
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and has huge momentum.

532
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I bet that scares Google

533
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
a little bit,

534
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and that may be another reason

535
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
that JetBrains looks

536
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
appealing to them.

537
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's right.

538
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's right.

539
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So if you want to jump into

540
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
the Microsoft loves Linux thing,

541
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm going to need some bacon

542
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
out of the Pacific Northwest.

543
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I love it.

544
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's a double bacon episode.

545
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Here we go.

546
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The burner's still hot.

547
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Hints of maple.

548
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I should have been wearing

549
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
a shirt for this.

550
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh, my.

551
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Ah!

552
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Some sort of Redwood

553
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
kind of hint there.

554
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So I'm going to make an argument

555
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
that is going to inflame

556
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
the subreddit and YouTube,

557
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
but too bad.

558
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If you are a Linux fan,

559
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
but not a GNU Linux fan,

560
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
come, let's say, October,

561
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
which I think it's really going

562
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
to be like August,

563
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
but let's say October,

564
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
the best distro of Linux,

565
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
bar none, is going to be

566
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Windows 10.

567
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Because what is a Linux distro

568
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
if not a kernel with a bunch

569
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
of desktop and user experience

570
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
features built on top of it?

571
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I mean, that's a big claim there.

572
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, I mean, at first I was

573
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
going to call you crazy,

574
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and then you added that second

575
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
part where you said,

576
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
what is a Linux desktop

577
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
if not for something built

578
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
on top of a Linux kernel?

579
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And then I was kind of starting

580
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
to think maybe you have a point.

581
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Well, think about it.

582
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So think about a guy like me

583
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
who has to support

584
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Windows software.

585
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, you're going to make me

586
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
throw up a little bit.

587
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But just hear me out.

588
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Okay, okay.

589
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But deploys backends

590
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
almost exclusively to Linux,

591
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
actually right now

592
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
exclusively to Linux,

593
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
and isn't particularly happy

594
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
with macOS hardware.

595
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And anyway, Bootcamp,

596
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
let's just say Bootcamp

597
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
hasn't been getting the love

598
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
it should be on the Apple side.

599
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So if I need a good Linux

600
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
command line,

601
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and if you haven't seen

602
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
the new terminal that Microsoft

603
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
is coming out with in the summer,

604
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
you need to take a look at that.

605
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And I also need Windows desktop

606
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
application support.

607
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I can think of no distro better

608
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
than Ciatia Nadella Edition

609
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Windows 10.

610
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
All right.

611
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I mean, at the end of the day,

612
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
you still have to deal

613
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
with the hot mess

614
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
that is Windows.

615
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And I think you can't discount

616
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
how frustrating that can be

617
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
for people that have been

618
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
dealing with Windows

619
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
for a long time.

620
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Although I think there's a set

621
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
of quote-unquote power users

622
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
that you might argue

623
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
it's because they haven't

624
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
been exposed to the perhaps

625
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
better paradigms available

626
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
in the free software desktop,

627
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
but they are good at Windows,

628
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and they might like Linux,

629
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
but don't feel like

630
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
they need to change.

631
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I was listening

632
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
to the excellent coverage

633
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
of just this very topic

634
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
in Linux Action News 105

635
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
earlier today,

636
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and I kept going back and forth

637
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
about how I feel about this,

638
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
because on one hand,

639
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
it's kind of a huge win

640
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
for Linux, right?

641
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Because Microsoft basically

642
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
couldn't compete on the server

643
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
or with the large

644
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
enterprise developer mindset.

645
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Or even the userland command line.

646
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah, not even the command line.

647
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And so they were basically

648
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
forced to ship

649
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
the full GPL Linux, right?

650
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I mean, you do have to

651
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
optionally add it or whatever,

652
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
but it's there

653
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
packaged by Microsoft.

654
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And they've always had

655
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
all these power,

656
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and why it's threatening

657
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
is because they have more,

658
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
they just have more resources

659
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
to devote to the desktop, right?

660
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's a lot of what they're doing.

661
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
They have huge teams of people

662
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
to develop on this,

663
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
so now they just have

664
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
a more pragmatic mindset.

665
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
They can actually leverage

666
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
open source just as effectively

667
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
as the pure open source communities,

668
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and they have

669
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
the commercial advantage.

670
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah.

671
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'll tell you what.

672
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What the issue is

673
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
is fundamentally,

674
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
at the end of the day,

675
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
it's a great initiative,

676
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
but it's still Microsoft,

677
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
and so they're doing it

678
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
exactly backwards.

679
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It starts with the name,

680
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
the Windows subsystem for Linux.

681
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Seriously, I'm not even joking.

682
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It starts at the name.

683
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
They're doing a backwards approach.

684
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
They are reverse engineering

685
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
their way into relevancy,

686
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and it's a typical

687
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
top-down approach from Microsoft.

688
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's the same issue they had

689
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
with mobile where they try to take

690
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
a full-fledged desktop operating system

691
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and distill it down for mobile

692
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
instead of starting

693
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
from a clean slate

694
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and building from the ground up

695
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
for mobile.

696
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
They're doing the same thing here

697
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
trying to make...

698
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
They're still a legacy company

699
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
in many ways.

700
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Right, they're trying to make

701
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
a relevant developer workstation

702
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
from a top-down approach

703
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
making something that has

704
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
everything turned on by default,

705
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
everything that's installed

706
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
by default,

707
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
a massive behemoth

708
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
that is 15 years worth

709
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
of desktop legacy,

710
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and they're bootstrapping into it

711
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
a Linux kernel that runs

712
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
in a really tight, tiny,

713
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
well-designed VM.

714
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
At the end of the day, though,

715
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
it doesn't solve the problem

716
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
that is Windows.

717
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Just like putting Windows

718
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
on a mobile device

719
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
doesn't make it

720
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
a mobile operating system,

721
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
they're not making this

722
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
a developer workstation.

723
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
They're making it

724
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
more accommodating,

725
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and they're making it

726
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
an easier stopgap

727
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
for people that haven't

728
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
taken the plunge

729
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
to a different platform.

730
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But I don't actually think

731
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
it solves the core issue,

732
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
which is, fundamentally,

733
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
they have a software-hardware

734
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
ecosystem issue.

735
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You know, you can crack jokes

736
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
about the quality

737
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
of Mac hardware,

738
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
but at least you know

739
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
what you're going to get,

740
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and it's easy to spec it out,

741
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
it's easy to request it,

742
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
it's conceivable,

743
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
it's manageable.

744
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You go to Dell's website

745
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
or you go to Lenovo's website,

746
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and it's a goddamn hot mess.

747
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You can't tell

748
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
what you're getting,

749
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and you're getting upsells

750
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
in every different direction

751
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
for software packages

752
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
that are total shit shows

753
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
that make your machine run slow.

754
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
None of those problems

755
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
have been solved yet.

756
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You can go get yourself

757
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
a service book

758
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
if you want to be

759
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
in the same exact situation

760
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
you are with Apple,

761
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
where only one vendor

762
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
is making the hardware.

763
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So they're really not solving

764
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
any of the overall

765
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
ecosystem problems

766
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
that make it extremely annoying

767
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
to use the Windows platform.

768
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's better,

769
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and it makes it easier to use,

770
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
but it doesn't solve

771
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
the fundamentals.

772
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That's my opinion, though.

773
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I mean, if I was

774
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
a lifelong Windows user,

775
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'd be thrilled

776
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
at this news.

777
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So you're looking at it

778
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
almost exactly backwards, actually.

779
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So you're doing exactly

780
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
what you think

781
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Microsoft is doing.

782
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Windows is a feature

783
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
in a lot of industries

784
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
because Windows

785
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
is a certified platform

786
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
that someone on high

787
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
said this application

788
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
must ship on.

789
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So even if you're

790
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
a bash-loving developer,

791
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
it is a pain in the ass, frankly,

792
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
to have to carry

793
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
two laptops, right?

794
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And honestly,

795
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
the problem with Windows

796
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
in my opinion,

797
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I know this,

798
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm much more forgiving

799
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
than I think most of our audience,

800
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
is that the C prompt

801
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
is basically an abortion

802
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
in terms of a command line.

803
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's a joke.

804
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Oh, it's so bad.

805
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So bad.

806
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I mean, the new terminal

807
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
does legitimately look good.

808
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It does fix it.

809
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Frankly, even without WSL2,

810
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I mean, the hot take here

811
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
is now that it is a Linux kernel,

812
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
you could make

813
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
a sideways sort of weak,

814
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
but definitely interesting argument

815
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
that Windows 10

816
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
really is a Linux distro.

817
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But even without that,

818
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I would bet you

819
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
any amount of money

820
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
that there are a lot of developers

821
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
in our audience,

822
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and not the ragey ones

823
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
who write into Reddit

824
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
every couple of weeks,

825
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
but people doing their job

826
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
who are working on Linux

827
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and popping up on Windows VM

828
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
because there's some

829
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
multi-million dollar application

830
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
that's WPF, C sharp,

831
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
and it's their job

832
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
to keep running,

833
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
whether it's duct tape

834
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
or wood glue or whatever

835
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
they need to do.

836
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Fair enough.

837
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
What came to my mind in this

838
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
is, is it partially a play

839
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
to just keep some

840
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Windows licensees happy?

841
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Oh, for sure. Absolutely.

842
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Because how many shops,

843
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
you know, if you're lucky,

844
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
you have IT administrators

845
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
who are comfortable, you know,

846
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
adding Linux machines

847
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
to an active directory domain.

848
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But by and large, no, right?

849
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
They have their infrastructure set up

850
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
probably for Windows laptops.

851
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So before, there might have been

852
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
enough developer pressure

853
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
to either get Macbooks

854
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
or, oh, you know,

855
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
we really need a Linux laptop

856
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
that you have to custom support

857
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
for this.

858
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
That argument kind of falls flat

859
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
with WS.

860
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah, absolutely.

861
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
The whole thing is also,

862
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I think, you're only having part

863
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
of the conversation, I should say,

864
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
unless we bring up Azure

865
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
because there's a big

866
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Azure development component

867
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
to this.

868
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And in the overall,

869
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
like, year 2025,

870
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
where you have the perfect,

871
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
ideal Microsoft world,

872
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and I imagine it to be this,

873
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
you have your on-premises

874
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Windows 10, Windows 7 workstations

875
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
that are connected

876
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
to an active directory

877
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
on-premises.

878
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And you have a lot of

879
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
current applications

880
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
that you've invested

881
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
a lot of years into development

882
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
running on those systems.

883
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But your future applications

884
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
are being developed.

885
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Again, this is Microsoft's

886
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
ideal world.

887
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Your future applications

888
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
are being developed

889
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
on Azure boxes,

890
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
running on Azure,

891
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
connected back to your

892
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
active directory,

893
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
which is likely running

894
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
on top of a Linux stack.

895
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And so for them,

896
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
if they can push down

897
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
a Linux development environment

898
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
to your Windows 10 machine

899
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
for all of these

900
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
on-premises Windows 10 boxes,

901
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
they've just enabled you

902
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
to do local development

903
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
for Azure systems.

904
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And I wouldn't discount the fact

905
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
that Canonical is coming out

906
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
and saying,

907
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
we are going to actually support

908
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
the Ubuntu U install on WSL2

909
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
because it's using

910
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
the same virtualizer

911
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
that we're supporting on Azure.

912
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That's massive scale.

913
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's even sexier,

914
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and I think it's going to be

915
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
very seductive,

916
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
particularly to junior developers.

917
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You're forgetting the other,

918
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I would say,

919
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
the other piece of the Holy Trinity,

920
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and that's GitHub.

921
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So let's say you pull down

922
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
your Azure environment.

923
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Everything looks great locally.

924
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You push the GitHub.

925
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Now there's a little prompt.

926
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Why not just in Visual Studio

927
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
that says,

928
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
deploy to Azure instance

929
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
such and such GWT ID?

930
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Done.

931
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
No YAML files,

932
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
no bullshit with,

933
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
oh, you got to run my migrations

934
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and my local versus

935
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
my production database

936
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
are in a different state,

937
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
so I just took everything down.

938
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yes, I'm dunking on Rails.

939
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I don't know.

940
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I think like old guys,

941
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
like us, frankly,

942
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
are going to,

943
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
because we know

944
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
how to do this deployments,

945
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
DevOps stuff already,

946
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
might not appreciate.

947
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Think back to when you guys

948
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
were just starting.

949
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Imagine an IDE, if you will.

950
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Picture it,

951
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Sicily 1930.

952
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You have an IDE

953
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
that it says,

954
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
testing on local host.

955
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Would you like to test

956
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
on virtualized Azure?

957
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Huh, well it pulls down

958
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
your entire configuration

959
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
from Azure.

960
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Great.

961
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Would you like to push to GitHub?

962
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Sure.

963
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Push successful.

964
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Your continuous integration

965
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
via App Center completed.

966
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I think now they call it

967
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Microsoft mobile app,

968
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
whatever they call it.

969
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Would you like to deploy

970
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
your backend to Azure?

971
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Click here.

972
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Done.

973
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And they've already run the test.

974
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
They've already run a help check.

975
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
They've guaranteed

976
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
you're not going to be scrambling

977
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
for the rest of the day

978
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
with basically,

979
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I broke my database via,

980
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I'm going to use the word migrations,

981
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
but I know other ecosystems

982
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
have different words.

983
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't know.

984
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Even me who knows how to do

985
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
all this stuff with scripts

986
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
might be like,

987
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I really,

988
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
it's not valuable for me

989
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
to be fighting with

990
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
configuration files.

991
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
No, I mean as much as you can

992
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
have taken care of for you,

993
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
especially if you have

994
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
more than enough work

995
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
just trying to finish

996
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
the feature you're working on,

997
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
that is a very appealing proposition.

998
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I mean I think Chris

999
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
will buy four more HomePods

1000
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and then a new Alienware

1001
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Windows 10 PC

1002
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and he'll go on the

1003
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Linux action news

1004
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and say,

1005
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
this is the best distro,

1006
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
but he'll wait a year

1007
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and he won't give me credit for it.

1008
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
That's going to be the other.

1009
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
That's my plan, yeah.

1010
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's a long-term plan.

1011
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But it's great

1012
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
that I can run these games.

1013
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Exactly.

1014
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
He's like,

1015
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I don't know.

1016
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
All I play is

1017
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Magic the Gathering Arena

1018
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
so I have no idea

1019
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
what real games

1020
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
are like anymore.

1021
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Don't you know

1022
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
that the plan is

1023
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm just going to buy

1024
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
really expensive Macs

1025
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
with no GPUs

1026
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and then just buy external eGPUs

1027
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
for the rest of my life?

1028
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Oh, you have to go here, don't you?

1029
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You've been keeping us

1030
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
in the dark, Mike.

1031
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We all want to know

1032
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
more details

1033
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
about what's going on over there.

1034
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I mean you've inspired me.

1035
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I've been experimenting

1036
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
a little bit with an eGPU

1037
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
with my ThinkPad laptop

1038
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and it's been kind of hit and miss.

1039
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's been an NVIDIA eGPU though

1040
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
so I don't know

1041
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
if that makes a difference

1042
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and I'm curious how

1043
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
your adventures have gone

1044
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
and if it's actually

1045
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
worth the money.

1046
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So yeah, my eGPU

1047
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
is an OWC case

1048
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
with a AMD Sapphire 560X.

1049
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You can Google that if you want.

1050
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That'd be a similar setup

1051
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I might go with.

1052
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah, and because I have to have it

1053
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
work on Mac OS,

1054
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
NVIDIA was out of the question,

1055
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
although maybe not pretty soon.

1056
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
This eGPU can plug into my Mac Mini,

1057
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
my Darter, and my HP Spectre

1058
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
which runs Windows.

1059
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Wow.

1060
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So that's three operating systems,

1061
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
one eGPU.

1062
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Okay, so you've tried it

1063
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
on all three then?

1064
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'd be curious

1065
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
how they all variously fail.

1066
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I have used it on all three.

1067
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So again, you say,

1068
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
what was that?

1069
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Three OSes, one GPU?

1070
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I was hoping you wouldn't get that.

1071
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yes, yes.

1072
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I won't even say the reference.

1073
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So it works instantaneously

1074
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
on Mac OS.

1075
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
No problem.

1076
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Because obviously Mac

1077
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
is the one true operating system.

1078
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Aren't they even selling little kits now

1079
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
that are pseudo-endorsed by Apple?

1080
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Well, that's a $1,500 eGPU.

1081
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But it's at least a notion

1082
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
that they are aware of.

1083
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah, so I think this is where

1084
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Apple is going to answer

1085
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
the I can't open up my Mac

1086
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and expand it question.

1087
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And it works instantly.

1088
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's great.

1089
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Thunderbolt 3, everybody loves it.

1090
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Windows?

1091
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Have you ever been to AMD's

1092
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Windows driver website?

1093
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You know, thankfully no.

1094
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And I'm not intending to

1095
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
any time soon.

1096
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
If you've seen the movie Hellraiser,

1097
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
you'll kind of get the theme,

1098
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
very black and red,

1099
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
very confusing.

1100
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But it does work.

1101
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It takes maybe like 45 minutes

1102
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
to get it working.

1103
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Why did it take so long?

1104
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
What was the challenge?

1105
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Well, you have to run a Windows update

1106
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
until you get a certain version

1107
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
of Windows 10.

1108
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And you have to kind of keep update.

1109
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You know how Windows is.

1110
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You have to pick if it's actually

1111
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
going to give you the update.

1112
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You have to kind of wait until it decides

1113
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
that you have an update.

1114
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Update, then wait,

1115
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
and then see if your update's there again,

1116
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
and then do the next round of that.

1117
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And then restart a few times.

1118
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And then install the AMD thing

1119
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and restart.

1120
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And then while it loads,

1121
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
it has to do something else

1122
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
while it restarts.

1123
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's fun.

1124
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Now, you, Wes, put in a handy-dandy script here

1125
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
for getting this set up on Ubuntu

1126
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
that I did not see.

1127
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That's right.

1128
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I did it by hand.

1129
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's a pain in the ass.

1130
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You have to fiddle around with the Misa utils,

1131
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Jar Jar Binks' favorite PPA.

1132
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But once you have it running,

1133
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and you do have to restart,

1134
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
which, you know, I know Linux people,

1135
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
you say that never happens.

1136
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But you do.

1137
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It does work fine.

1138
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I will say that this right now,

1139
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I would say the order is Mac, Windows, Linux

1140
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
in terms of support.

1141
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But the testing I did was on 18.10, not 19.4.

1142
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So I'm wondering if the new update

1143
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
with the new kernel might be a little better.

1144
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And, yeah, I mean, this kind of has changed

1145
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
how I think about workstations.

1146
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So when you say it's changed

1147
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
the way you think about workstations,

1148
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
do you mean in the fact that

1149
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
you're going to kind of, in the future,

1150
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
buy a machine and not worry about it

1151
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
having a baked-in GPU of any sort?

1152
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Yeah, I think so.

1153
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Because I'm bound to basically buying machines,

1154
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
it's very hard to replace the GPU.

1155
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I could see myself having a Mac and a Linux laptop

1156
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
or a Windows and a Linux laptop

1157
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and just, when I need that kind of power,

1158
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
hooking them up to the GPU.

1159
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But most of the time, when I don't,

1160
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
particularly because I travel a lot,

1161
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I would just run them on the Intel integrated,

1162
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
whatever the hell, right?

1163
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah, I'm a little curious.

1164
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Have you done multiple workloads?

1165
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm wondering if there's a difference

1166
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
between having to configure it just to support

1167
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
GPU offloading for training ML models or something

1168
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
versus trying to get a fully accelerated desktop going.

1169
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
So on Windows in particular,

1170
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
there is a very obnoxious AMD app

1171
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
that wants you to tweak it for what you're doing.

1172
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I did not do that because my Windows,

1173
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I really just tested it running some games on the HP Spectre.

1174
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It was a little weird playing Tomb Raider on a Ultrabook

1175
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
and having it look nice on an external monitor.

1176
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Yeah, I have experienced that too with my ThinkPad.

1177
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You're not joking.

1178
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It really is something to have this tiny machine

1179
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
that has no GPU and you're playing a full-fledged video game.

1180
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And on Mac, it does it for you.

1181
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
In fact, I don't think there's an interface even.

1182
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I looked it up to actually tweak it too much on Mac OS.

1183
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Having said that, Chris, can we spill the bacon here

1184
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
or the beans that go with the bacon?

1185
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Ooh, you know, we do have so much bacon.

1186
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
We might as well have the beans too.

1187
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
One last little, here, we'll do the bacon ends here.

1188
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
This is frying up the bacon ends, Mike.

1189
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's good, it's tasty.

1190
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Ooh, I can smell it.

1191
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah, all right, go ahead.

1192
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So Chris shared with me today in Slack,

1193
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
presumably to get me excited, that a Mac Pro was coming out.

1194
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Oh, the leaked image of the cheese grater 2.0 style

1195
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
is the rumor.

1196
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
With PCI slots, eight Thunderbolt ports.

1197
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Did you say eight?

1198
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Yeah.

1199
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Wow, that's a beast.

1200
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So are they actually recognizing that Macs could be good

1201
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
if they put a tiny amount of effort?

1202
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Damn, Wes, damn.

1203
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It's a rumored leak, so don't get your hopes up.

1204
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It's a rumored product image,

1205
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
and the image is from November 2018.

1206
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So it's just a clever troll who realizes

1207
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
that's what everyone wants.

1208
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It was Chris taking his HomePod and Photoshopping it.

1209
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Just stretching it up.

1210
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah, no, but the real hot take here is NVIDIA support.

1211
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yeah, which currently you can't even do on the Mac

1212
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
with an eGPU.

1213
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Not unless it's the same architecture

1214
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
as the old, old 2006, yeah.

1215
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So that, if true, could be big

1216
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
for a lot of these machine learning jobs

1217
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
and the CUDA workloads and whatnot.

1218
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It also means it's likely a fake leak.

1219
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm just not buying it.

1220
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah, why do you do these things to me?

1221
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I don't know.

1222
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
For me, the issue with the eGPU

1223
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
legitimately sounds like a compelling product,

1224
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and having some experience, I bought myself,

1225
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I talked about this in Linux Unplugged,

1226
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
they have a ThinkPad dock that has an NVIDIA 1060 built in.

1227
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Right, just built, integrated right in.

1228
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So you get a Thunderbolt 3 dock

1229
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
with all the traditional Thunderbolt 3 dock ports

1230
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
with a GPU, and I thought, man, isn't that a great idea?

1231
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So I tried it out to some success,

1232
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
to also some issues, and I was very, very impressed.

1233
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
But I have to tell you,

1234
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
every time I've wanted to use that eGPU dock

1235
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
has not been when I'm at my desk.

1236
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
It's been when I'm traveling,

1237
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and I've got like three hours in a hotel room to kill.

1238
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And I'm like, man, I wish I would have packed my eGPU dock.

1239
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Have you experienced that?

1240
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Because that's where I'd want to actually have it,

1241
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
is when I got a couple hours to kill

1242
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and I want to play a video game.

1243
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah, so again, I know you're a much bigger gamer than I am.

1244
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
My game of choice is MTG Arena, which by the way,

1245
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
if you're using desktop Linux, runs awesome on Nutris,

1246
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
so you don't actually need a Windows install.

1247
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yeah, and Jason from Choose Linux plays,

1248
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and one day I will beat him.

1249
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We've never played yet, because we're on different time zones.

1250
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
But actually, I have a few pain points

1251
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
very different than that, though.

1252
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Like, the enclosure is bigger than my Mac Mini.

1253
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
That's not a storm behind him, that's the eGPU.

1254
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yeah.

1255
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's just the eGPU.

1256
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Right, so also, am I the only one in the world

1257
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
who didn't know that Thunderbolt fails above a certain length?

1258
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Well, it's a complicated protocol pushing a lot of data.

1259
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yeah, it depends what you're doing.

1260
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So what you're doing with that really, really high bandwidth

1261
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
is like active Thunderbolt 3,

1262
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and it has to be a certain length cable, yeah.

1263
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I guess that means the GPU has to be,

1264
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
the eGPU has to be fairly close to your face hole.

1265
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Well, so the cable that comes with the OWC eGPU case that I have

1266
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
is literally three and a half inches long.

1267
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Yeah.

1268
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It's actually taught when I'm putting the Mac Mini

1269
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
on top of the eGPU case and plugging it in.

1270
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's pathetic.

1271
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And a six-foot cable costs, I don't know, an arm and a leg.

1272
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Well, a six-foot cable of the right caliber to do this

1273
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
costs a fortune, I found out, so I didn't do it.

1274
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I don't know.

1275
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And the other thing is, if Chris is just pulling my leg

1276
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and I can't run NVIDIA,

1277
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
well, then really, for the only ML library that works well with AMD

1278
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
is CoreML, because it's from Apple,

1279
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
who up till now hates NVIDIA.

1280
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Everything else is just better on NVIDIA.

1281
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But you can swap cards in and out of that enclosure, right?

1282
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So you could have, in theory, an NVIDIA card that you swapped in

1283
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
for certain workloads in an AMD card,

1284
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and you're still kind of saving money,

1285
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
because you only have to buy one of each.

1286
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I know that sounds crazy, but...

1287
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Well, so the positive case that I would make

1288
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
for someone like me who travels a lot,

1289
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and maybe even someone like you,

1290
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
maybe even Wes, actually,

1291
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
you could buy a new little Linux laptop every year or two,

1292
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
in my case, every three weeks,

1293
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and just plug it into your eGPU

1294
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and not spend money on an integrated graphics card.

1295
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That's what I'm thinking.

1296
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And it also means you'll likely get a smaller, lighter machine

1297
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
that's better on airplanes.

1298
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Right. Oh, that's a good point.

1299
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Well, in the battery life,

1300
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
those of us who do a lot of coding in airplane terminals,

1301
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
nothing's worse than not being able to get an outlet

1302
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and having to patch something.

1303
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And it's nice when you aren't using that,

1304
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
then you can just be, as you said, Mike,

1305
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
using the Intel graphics, which aren't great,

1306
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
but work beautiful when you're on an open-source desktop.

1307
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Yeah.

1308
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Especially when you just need like a terminal and a text editor.

1309
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I mean, it's perfect.

1310
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Some electron apps, because you have to.

1311
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Excuse me, Flutter desktop apps?

1312
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Yeah.

1313
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Oh, here we go.

1314
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Yeah, of course, of course.

1315
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yeah, well, it all really depends on how energy efficient

1316
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
the Windows subsystem for Linux is, apparently.

1317
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That's what it's all about, baby.

1318
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Listen, I'm showing up to Linux Unplugged one day,

1319
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
saying, hey, guys, check out my new desktop.

1320
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Look at the design.

1321
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I have a background here of a square with four sub-squares.

1322
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It's blue.

1323
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And yeah, oh, look at this.

1324
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Look at this, I'm running games.

1325
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Have you guys heard of Steam?

1326
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I hate you right now.

1327
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
All right, but I mean, all kidding aside,

1328
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
it kind of feels like you've transitioned to a new way.

1329
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Like there's no going back for you on the GPU thing.

1330
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Challenges aside, no.

1331
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Will you be building a big desktop

1332
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
any time in the future, then?

1333
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So this is the irony.

1334
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Assuming Chris isn't screwing with me,

1335
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
they finally come out with the Mac I want,

1336
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
or they're allegedly coming out this summer or this fall,

1337
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and now I no longer give a crap about desktops.

1338
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It's only been, what, five, six years?

1339
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Nice.

1340
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Go figure, right?

1341
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Go figure.

1342
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Because think about it, 500 bucks a year,

1343
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I could get the new best spanking high-end GPU I want,

1344
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
and not have to update to crazy Thaleo number four,

1345
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
or crazy Mac Pro, or whatever Dell sells.

1346
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Right, and not to be like old man Chris here,

1347
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
but kids, it's gotten to the point where I couldn't tell you

1348
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
if I'm on a fourth-generation i7,

1349
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
or a sixth-generation i7, or even a second-generation.

1350
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It doesn't seem to matter.

1351
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
They're just so fast.

1352
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
At a certain point when you've got MB&E drives,

1353
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
you've got i7 processors,

1354
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
and you've got interchangeable GPUs,

1355
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,000
the base unit, the core machine, is pretty damn fast.

1356
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And then it really just comes down to graphics and storage.

1357
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And I've got network storage, too.

1358
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Network storage adds a ton of additional storage to my machine.

1359
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Well, and don't forget Thunderbolt 3,

1360
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
if you buy a high-end enough NVME Thunderbolt 3 NAS system,

1361
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
that's nearly onboard performance.

1362
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Oh, yeah.

1363
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I mean, we have a gigabit LAN here in the studio,

1364
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
so it flies copy and files over to the free NAS, no problem.

1365
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I mean, everything fails because of the old thermal throttling,

1366
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
but I'm ignoring that problem right now.

1367
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Well, you externalize the GPU with decent cooling,

1368
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
and that makes your machine run cooler, too,

1369
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
although it does heat up running that Thunderbolt bus as hard as it does.

1370
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I just do all my development from the walk-in, so it's fine.

1371
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I have to say, of all the three machines,

1372
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I will give the Galago one thing.

1373
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
It might always spin its fans up,

1374
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
but it doesn't seem to suffer the way the HP does with the eGPU.

1375
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
The Spectre is very thin,

1376
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
so I can imagine they're really throttling that thing.

1377
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It must be a tiny fan, and I got to say,

1378
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
it sounds like one of those quadruped drones taking off.

1379
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It's bad.

1380
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So you're just embracing the tri-operating system lifestyle.

1381
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
You're not dual-booting anymore.

1382
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You're tri-booting, and then with an eGPU in the mix now.

1383
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Like, this is getting complicated.

1384
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Wow.

1385
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
So I have a relatively crappy old Dell display.

1386
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
In fact, on Twitter, I'm asking people to recommend the new 27-inch matte.

1387
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I only want matte display that has DisplayPort.

1388
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And then I have one of those Amazon laptop stands.

1389
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So here's the deal.

1390
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Everything has Thunderbolt.

1391
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You plug it in.

1392
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
If I need to work on Mac OS, I plug in the Air.

1393
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
If I need to work, or the Mac Mini, which is sitting here.

1394
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
But that's really supposed to be a server.

1395
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
If I need to work on Windows, I plug in the HP.

1396
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
If I need to work on Linux, I plug in the Darter, and we're good to go.

1397
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Same keyboard, which is a DOS keyboard.

1398
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Same mouse, which is my old Naga mouse that we had from before we started the show originally.

1399
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Basically, I have built my own ghetto, or I think pretty fancy docking system.

1400
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Right, so you just have a little Thunderbolt cable dangling out there.

1401
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You just plug in whatever you want.

1402
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I like that.

1403
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
That's nice.

1404
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Yeah, and a Thunderbolt hub for all the USB crap, right?

1405
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So the keyboard.

1406
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeah.

1407
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So the only kind of cognitive gymnastics you have to do is if you swap in a Mac,

1408
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
you've got to swap the command and control keys stuff.

1409
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah, I sometimes get confused between POP and Mac all the time.

1410
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Oh, Gnome Shell, how Mac OS you've...

1411
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Or actually, more like Mac OS has become more like Gnome Shell, I think, really.

1412
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I'm just like, why doesn't my command work?

1413
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't understand this, what's going on?

1414
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Yeah, but that's really the problem.

1415
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I mean, the only thing I've noticed that's mildly annoying is the monitor I have does not have an in...

1416
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
What do you call that? In built-in microphone.

1417
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Oh, sure.

1418
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So taking conference calls doesn't work the way I would like it to.

1419
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
You just got to get yourself like a Logitech webcam or something.

1420
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
If you can recommend one, shoot it to me in Slack.

1421
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
C930E.

1422
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I could just Google that, okay.

1423
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Or C930 or C920.

1424
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
But C930 would be the...

1425
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
We'll throw a link in the show notes.

1426
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
How about that?

1427
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
We will.

1428
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
That's the one I use right there.

1429
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's got a nice wide-angle flat lens.

1430
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And it's a mic as well or no?

1431
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Yeah, it has a good dual-array stereo mic.

1432
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So it does a decent job.

1433
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I mean, Mike, you're using a microphone right now.

1434
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You do have a microphone, by the way.

1435
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I thought this was like a club I was supposed to hit invading barbarians with.

1436
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It's for podcasting only.

1437
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Actually, fair point.

1438
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I did not.

1439
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I literally never thought of that.

1440
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
You know what would be kind of fun is if people have kind of cool interesting setups that they'd like to share with us.

1441
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
They should do it.

1442
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1443
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Pictures too would be kind of cool.

1444
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Yeah.

1445
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Just go to coder.show slash contact.

1446
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
You can contact us that way.

1447
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Or, hey, it turns out we're all on Twitter.

1448
