00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 465 for May 9th, 2022.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.460
Well hey, good looking, welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:19.460 --> 00:25.160
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.160 --> 00:29.080
Sitting right here in Seattle, my name is Chris and our host joining us from the East Coast

00:29.080 --> 00:30.080
is Mr. Dominic.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.080
Hello, Mike.

00:31.080 --> 00:37.680
Hey, welcome to Florida and also brought to you by CNN plus, wait, what, what happened?

00:37.680 --> 00:39.160
You canceled us already?

00:39.160 --> 00:40.160
Yeah.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.320
Well, you were, you enjoying Jake Tapper's book club?

00:43.320 --> 00:44.560
You know, that was their big hit, right?

00:44.560 --> 00:46.760
I actually thought that was a joke.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.160
I didn't think it was real.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.160
That was real?

00:49.160 --> 00:50.160
Yeah.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.160
Yeah.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.640
I liked Scott Galloway's show, but I liked it, but I kind of didn't like it.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.440
It's just like rich, fancy people being rich and fancy.

00:56.440 --> 00:59.400
Mmm, living vicariously through CNN plus.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.960
Carousel, oh, keep going.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.800
Are you doing all right?

01:02.800 --> 01:04.820
Today is a weird day to be recording.

01:04.820 --> 01:10.400
We are like in the sixth day of just like crash after crash after crash in the market.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.960
I mean, it's gleeful for you and I, so I don't know what you're talking about.

01:13.960 --> 01:14.960
It is.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.440
We are such twisted bastards.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.440
It's so funny.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.320
Like the whole market's down.

01:19.320 --> 01:24.560
People's 401ks are trashed and I'm not making light of that, but you and I are both like

01:24.560 --> 01:25.560
called it.

01:25.560 --> 01:30.560
I'm enjoying an Elijah Craig on the rocks as I watch all these motherfuckers burn.

01:30.560 --> 01:31.560
It's just, we got feedback.

01:31.560 --> 01:35.200
They're like, you guys are old and grumpy and a bunch of doomers and you always think

01:35.200 --> 01:36.360
things are about to go bad.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.640
And see about two weeks, three weeks ago, we did a, at the end of the episode, we were

01:39.640 --> 01:42.960
just like, hey guys, just so you know, like it's probably going to be kind of economically

01:42.960 --> 01:43.960
tough for a bit.

01:43.960 --> 01:44.960
And you know, we're out there.

01:44.960 --> 01:47.440
Well, because we lived through the crash, I'm sorry, but we lived through the.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.440
The last one.

01:48.440 --> 01:53.480
We have a roughly a half a decade between us or a decade almost.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.480
It's just a number baby.

01:54.480 --> 01:59.760
I know I, I, sweetheart, I love you no matter what, baby, don't worry, but the.com crash,

01:59.760 --> 02:00.760
I was too young.

02:00.760 --> 02:01.760
Oh, I wasn't.

02:01.760 --> 02:02.760
Yeah.

02:02.760 --> 02:03.760
Yeah.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.760
You, that's what I'm saying.

02:04.760 --> 02:08.200
Between us, we've lived through, baby, this is the same song.

02:08.200 --> 02:12.120
I don't know why we're being like super in love with each other right now.

02:12.120 --> 02:16.040
You know, when, when time gets tough and we, uh, when we get to do a real good solid, told

02:16.040 --> 02:18.600
you so you and I just would get close, we get real.

02:18.600 --> 02:24.240
You know what this song is about us, honestly, Carly, Simon, the song was also about that

02:24.240 --> 02:25.240
dude.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.240
It's one of those things.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.240
I think it's a small business.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.560
You're more tuned into as well because I think that, and I don't mean to characterize it

02:29.560 --> 02:33.580
like this in a negative way, but I think a lot of people that pushed back, gave us feedback

02:33.580 --> 02:34.800
that like you guys are crazy.

02:34.800 --> 02:35.800
There's no crash.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.200
I think they're nine to five version.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.200
They just don't watch the market like us, like a business person does because it's just

02:41.200 --> 02:42.380
different consequences.

02:42.380 --> 02:43.380
And I'm not saying that negatively.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.940
I just think it's a different set of priorities.

02:45.940 --> 02:49.120
It's a stupid old folktale, but the canary, it was not really a folktale.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.120
It's true, right?

02:50.120 --> 02:55.880
I mean, small business guys, like real small, like our size, we feel everything six months

02:55.880 --> 02:56.880
before everybody else.

02:56.880 --> 02:57.880
Yeah.

02:57.880 --> 03:03.480
I mean, we, our private conversations, you know, you know, I've been taking just hiring

03:03.480 --> 03:08.200
these people, the reason, and we're going to get to the feedback, but I'm just a pre

03:08.200 --> 03:09.260
defense.

03:09.260 --> 03:16.200
The reason I don't think these wages that kids are asking for sustainable is because

03:16.200 --> 03:17.680
we're going into a crash.

03:17.680 --> 03:24.440
Why would anybody want to pay someone 70 plus when they don't have to, when the market will

03:24.440 --> 03:27.480
not sustain that wage next year?

03:27.480 --> 03:31.960
And that's not really a moral or judgment call on the, on what the wage is or isn't.

03:31.960 --> 03:37.560
I would rather hire someone at 65 and, and as a young kid at a college and keep them

03:37.560 --> 03:42.840
for five years, then hire them at 70, have them be non-profitable, non-sustainable and

03:42.840 --> 03:44.600
have to frankly let them go.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.840
I think the thing that you and I are not quite saying out loud, but what we both see coming

03:48.840 --> 03:53.680
is a flip in the market where it's been really those who are looking to get a job.

03:53.680 --> 03:57.480
It has been their market and it has been a really great time to look for a job.

03:57.480 --> 04:01.240
And when a recession hits, that tends to reverse that trend.

04:01.240 --> 04:05.920
And there is actual psychological studies that show that people transition from a, you

04:05.920 --> 04:10.920
should be lucky to have me mindset to a, a job that just pays the bills so we can get

04:10.920 --> 04:11.920
by mindset.

04:11.920 --> 04:15.120
It's not a, it's not a great, it's not a great place to be emotionally for the country.

04:15.120 --> 04:19.560
Well, first of all, our country is schizophrenic, but you told me I can't do any more than filter

04:19.560 --> 04:20.560
content.

04:20.560 --> 04:28.480
So, um, also folks, if you're running out of recession, if you're feeling cold, perhaps

04:28.480 --> 04:34.240
General Electric or JCP and L or New Jersey central power and light, all companies who've

04:34.240 --> 04:40.760
tried to turn my lights off at one point, if you're cold, wrap yourself in the comfort,

04:40.760 --> 04:48.640
the love, the judgment free affection of a Coderradio rope.

04:48.640 --> 04:49.640
That's so great.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.640
Hey, you know what?

04:50.640 --> 04:55.840
Looking back, man, and reflecting on that, the Coderradio robe was at the, what now feels

04:55.840 --> 04:58.440
like kind of the beginning of the supply chain issues.

04:58.440 --> 04:59.440
Right?

04:59.440 --> 05:00.440
No, you're right.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.440
We were there, right?

05:01.440 --> 05:05.520
We couldn't get, listen, if folks who don't have a Coderradio robe, I couldn't get threads

05:05.520 --> 05:06.520
and stuff.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.820
It was like it kept coming down to thread and folks that don't have, we should describe

05:09.820 --> 05:10.820
the robe, right?

05:10.820 --> 05:11.820
It's a black robe.

05:11.820 --> 05:12.820
It's a bathrobe, right?

05:12.820 --> 05:13.820
A black robe.

05:13.820 --> 05:14.820
Uh, I don't, what do you call the rope?

05:14.820 --> 05:19.360
Oh, it's a, it's a type of type of real, it's a really plush towel material that is, it's

05:19.360 --> 05:23.160
both towel and robe and I forget the name of it, but we got like a really high quality

05:23.160 --> 05:24.160
one.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.800
So you can even put it on wet, you know, that kind of thing.

05:25.800 --> 05:32.520
But the fact that we can't print, like get robes is, man, I couldn't get Ram chips at

05:32.520 --> 05:34.480
reasonable prices.

05:34.480 --> 05:40.280
And we've been frankly, kvetching about this for what, eight months, 10 months?

05:40.280 --> 05:41.280
I suppose.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.280
Yeah.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.280
But we've been getting a little more poignant about it recently.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.000
Well, you know, we're in our feelings.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.160
It's a, it's a, it's a season of feelings right now.

05:47.160 --> 05:48.160
I, okay.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.160
So I'm not making light of it.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.320
I know it, it sucks.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.320
The whole tech world is hunkered down right now.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.840
No, it blows.

05:53.840 --> 05:58.720
Also there is a silver lining for someone like my dad who was hoping to retire this

05:58.720 --> 05:59.720
year.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.720
This sucks.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.760
And if you are in your twenties, your thirties, or maybe even your early forties, this could

06:04.760 --> 06:06.880
actually be a really great investment opportunity.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.840
No, this is your moment.

06:08.840 --> 06:12.240
Also, if you're kind of wondering like what the hell is going on?

06:12.240 --> 06:14.040
Why is everything crashing?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.040
Why is oil down?

06:15.040 --> 06:16.040
Why is gold down?

06:16.040 --> 06:17.040
Why is silver down?

06:17.040 --> 06:18.560
Why are all the tech stocks down?

06:18.560 --> 06:22.160
I have been doing a Bitcoin podcast with the Bitcoin dad.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.960
It's called the Bitcoin dad pod.

06:23.960 --> 06:24.960
Yeah.

06:24.960 --> 06:25.960
Okay.

06:25.960 --> 06:26.960
It is.

06:26.960 --> 06:27.960
Yep.

06:27.960 --> 06:31.840
In episode five, we talk about the overall monetary system and the issues there.

06:31.840 --> 06:36.520
And then in episode 14, we talk about issues that are going on with some of the major assets.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.560
So the Bitcoin dad, he's traditionally trained in economics.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.600
He went to school for that to become like a big economic egghead.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.040
So he has a really sound understanding of the economy.

06:46.040 --> 06:49.400
And then I chime in on the technicals and stuff like that and just help move the show

06:49.400 --> 06:50.400
along.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.240
But episode five, the whole show has been really good, but five and 14, even if you're

06:54.240 --> 06:59.120
not interested in Bitcoin and you just want to understand what the hell is going on at

06:59.120 --> 07:01.300
the bigger picture.

07:01.300 --> 07:04.780
Why I'm recommending this is it's a really level-headed take.

07:04.780 --> 07:09.000
It's weirdly non alarmist, even though we're talking about stuff at a pretty massive scale.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.540
Well, we're almost certainly going to be in a 1970s level recession.

07:14.540 --> 07:16.760
There is some real fundamentals that would suggest that.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.440
And so also I'm saying is if you're curious, go check out that, we'll have it linked in

07:19.440 --> 07:20.440
the show notes.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.440
Bitcoin dad, you said?

07:21.440 --> 07:22.440
Yeah.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.440
It's the Bitcoin dad pod.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.680
So listen to that.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.320
And I just want to say I made a thousand bucks on Dogecoin.

07:27.320 --> 07:32.120
And for any IRS agents, this show, much like Tucker Carlson's is not necessarily factual.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.120
Yeah.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.080
Could just be a, what did he say?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.080
A character I play.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.080
Yeah.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.080
A character.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.080
Yeah.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.080
It's a character.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.080
Yeah.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.080
It's a character who's making money on it.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.080
It's really important that the IRS never listen to the show.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.080
Okay.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.080
All right.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.080
There we go.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.080
Moving on.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.080
We do have some feedback.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.440
Eddie has a moral dilemma, which we seem pretty qualified to answer.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.840
Welcome to dad radio.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.240
We're very upset too.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.240
Okay.

07:56.240 --> 08:00.880
So he said, I did some contract work for a company that rhymes with smell and probably

08:00.880 --> 08:03.400
due to my hard headedness, I ran into some issues.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.400
I wanted to run past you.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.400
You see, I'd get an order to do a job through a small it company I worked for.

08:08.400 --> 08:12.760
So like smell was contracting with his small company.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.760
Super use of this.

08:13.760 --> 08:14.760
Yep.

08:14.760 --> 08:19.040
His job was to drive to the job site, usually in Missouri or Illinois, and then complete

08:19.040 --> 08:20.840
the work order that they had sent me.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.200
He said he get paid for gas and time on the job.

08:23.200 --> 08:27.800
He's fine with all of those details, but the devil was in them details.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.160
So here's an example that he want to run past us.

08:30.160 --> 08:34.640
So he'd get the order and the order would tell him that they just got a computer that

08:34.640 --> 08:38.560
was bought by smell and it needed to get transferred all the settings from their old computer

08:38.560 --> 08:40.800
needed to get transferred to the new computer.

08:40.800 --> 08:47.660
And on the work order, they specifically told him to use the USB bus and a USB disk to transfer

08:47.660 --> 08:53.760
the files, which he said added a considerable amount of time to the billing, just hours.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.480
That's going to be slow, slow as yeah.

08:56.480 --> 09:00.560
And so he didn't want to be bored out of his mind with the data slowly transferring, watching,

09:00.560 --> 09:05.020
you know, you know, 11 megabits a second or whatever it was then probably USB two.

09:05.020 --> 09:10.080
So he'd hook it up to the SATA bus or the might even been before SATA, he says, and

09:10.080 --> 09:13.160
he just transferred right there over the local disk bus.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.000
Of course, now smell didn't like it when he did things that way, but they never really

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
fired him.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.640
He just wasn't following orders like a good robot, he says, and he just didn't agree with

09:21.640 --> 09:24.440
some of the questionable methods.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.600
Thankfully it was, you know, competent, got the job done.

09:26.600 --> 09:31.600
So it was never really an issue, but he wonders what we would do in a similar ethical dilemma.

09:31.600 --> 09:36.040
Would you have just gone the USB route and, you know, add another four hours to the bill?

09:36.040 --> 09:37.040
What would you do?

09:37.040 --> 09:40.100
Uh, no, the answer is no.

09:40.100 --> 09:45.940
I think if smell is who I think smell is, this is not the first time I've heard of something

09:45.940 --> 09:46.940
like this.

09:46.940 --> 09:53.400
Uh, I'll let Chris speak for himself cause I know there's possibly a relationship there.

09:53.400 --> 09:57.280
I've never, I've never dealt with technical support outside of like calling them for my

09:57.280 --> 09:58.280
own stuff.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.120
I like how you just like didn't even give the cover.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.120
All right.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.120
So smell, right?

10:02.120 --> 10:03.120
Right.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.120
We're talking.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.120
Yeah.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.120
Okay.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.120
But maybe Drew could beep that out.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.120
I don't know.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.120
We'll find out.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.240
I got to tell you, there is a reason that I closed my business account with those people.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.240
Smell.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.240
Yeah.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.240
I'm going to have to leave this one alone.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.240
I wasn't super.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.240
Yeah.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.240
Here's what I see.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.240
Cause I've been.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.240
All right.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.240
You've been that guy.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.240
Cause here's the thing, dude.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.240
I'm so damn good.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.880
I've been in this position dozens of times, hundreds of times.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.240
This is my default position.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.240
Stop.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.240
I told my fiance that this morning.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.240
I'm so damn good.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.240
I can do this position.

10:29.240 --> 10:30.240
And you know what?

10:30.240 --> 10:35.080
I just want to say I'm, there's a reason I'm drinking Elijah Craig at three o'clock of

10:35.080 --> 10:36.080
the afternoon.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.080
Well done, sir.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.080
Well done.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.080
Well done.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.200
Oh, you got me there.

10:40.200 --> 10:45.720
I would actually very frequently be the guy that was the fastest at getting the task done

10:45.720 --> 10:46.720
in the company.

10:46.720 --> 10:47.720
And so.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.920
Again, not a feature for the fiance, but keep going.

10:49.920 --> 10:53.000
Not a great feature for the, for the guys running the company either.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.760
They like to see, you know, if they can send out one guy and he builds six hours to do

10:56.760 --> 11:02.440
a job and I build three hours and the customer is even happier, they're not happy, right?

11:02.440 --> 11:03.900
The incentives don't align.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.080
So it becomes a question of fraud, right?

11:06.080 --> 11:07.080
Seriously.

11:07.080 --> 11:13.040
If, for instance, I do contract development, I think it is my job.

11:13.040 --> 11:18.020
And I always, if I can find like a BSD or Apache license package to do something quicker

11:18.020 --> 11:21.120
for a customer, I do it in the contracts.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.520
It says I'm going to use those kinds of open source stuff anyway.

11:24.520 --> 11:28.560
And my goal is to deliver as many deliverables as quickly as possible.

11:28.560 --> 11:29.960
And I hope they hire me again, right?

11:29.960 --> 11:32.040
You know, I'm with the writer here.

11:32.040 --> 11:36.040
I think it's up and you should not do it the bad way to make more money.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.440
I would face this issue frequently.

11:38.440 --> 11:42.840
And I'll tell you, this is where it makes all the difference to be your own boss versus

11:42.840 --> 11:45.560
work for people that are telling you how to do the job.

11:45.560 --> 11:52.560
Because the actual solution here is to charge for the overall solution you're providing,

11:52.560 --> 11:54.160
not for the hours it took you to solve it.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.160
Bing, bing, bing.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.160
It's called Alice.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.160
Yep.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.160
Yeah.

11:58.160 --> 12:04.280
So you basically create a standard price for PC transfer, you know, PC transfer is $300.

12:04.280 --> 12:07.560
You're incentivized then to get that done as fast as possible.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.900
Get it done in 45 minutes.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.020
Get it done in an hour, right?

12:10.020 --> 12:13.880
Because then you're just making money that so you have to sell it instead of on the hours

12:13.880 --> 12:16.960
you have to sell it based on the task of the solution.

12:16.960 --> 12:20.280
hourly billing sets up a confrontational relationship.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.600
It only makes sense for custom work.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.600
Right?

12:23.600 --> 12:29.080
Like we have a fantastic customer in Canada, we're doing they're in the agricultural business.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.020
But they want things exactly the way they want.

12:32.020 --> 12:33.840
They want what they want.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.960
So we do it the way they tell us we have a meeting almost every week.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.300
It's fantastic.

12:39.300 --> 12:45.420
But for things like maintenance and support of existing hardware, the corruption in hourly

12:45.420 --> 12:46.420
billing is terrible.

12:46.420 --> 12:50.660
The incentives don't align with the customer or the person doing the billing.

12:50.660 --> 12:54.180
The only person that really was had their incentive aligned their incentives aligned

12:54.180 --> 12:55.360
there was smell.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.680
Can I give you a real example to just just for the listener?

12:58.680 --> 12:59.680
Yeah.

12:59.680 --> 13:03.080
So Alice, right, we sell Alice as an annual license.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.440
My incentive is one for them to be happy.

13:06.440 --> 13:09.560
But also, I'm going to make the same.

13:09.560 --> 13:10.560
There's three tours of Alice.

13:10.560 --> 13:16.160
But let's say I'm going to make the same, you know, n dollars, let's call it $7,000.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.320
No matter what.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.320
What do you think, Chris?

13:18.320 --> 13:21.320
Am I sitting there looking for ways to slow down the job?

13:21.320 --> 13:26.160
Or am I as aggressively as possible setting up their Alice instance?

13:26.160 --> 13:27.160
Yeah.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.160
And they like that, right?

13:28.160 --> 13:29.160
They want that.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.160
Yes.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.720
I understand where Eddie's coming from when he's not the boss, and so it's like for him,

13:33.720 --> 13:37.040
the moral dilemma is do I keep my job and do it the slow way?

13:37.040 --> 13:40.000
And then you know, the other thing is you got to like try to look busy during all that

13:40.000 --> 13:42.720
time because the customers are always kind of keeping an eye on you.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.840
You know, you're in a bad position, man.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.240
Like it doesn't sound like Eddie's there anymore.

13:47.240 --> 13:53.520
But Eddie, can I recommend a different company who bills so much and cancels people's credit

13:53.520 --> 13:54.720
accounts?

13:54.720 --> 14:03.360
I won't call them plum, but they might be a pear or an orange, perhaps.

14:03.360 --> 14:07.520
Certainly not a Macintosh, which is a specific type of fruit.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.920
You want to do an apples to apple kind of comparison, you're saying?

14:09.920 --> 14:12.040
Oh, I definitely don't want to do that.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.040
No.

14:13.040 --> 14:15.160
Well, I got really good news.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.080
Special announcement.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.560
Longtimer Remy has written back in.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.560
Oh, God.

14:19.560 --> 14:20.560
Did he summon Egon?

14:20.560 --> 14:21.560
Sorry.

14:21.560 --> 14:26.400
He says, I am a longtime listener, but I'm not as long nor as famous as Egon.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.000
That's how he starts his email.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.400
Every email, honestly, should be getting with a shout out to Egon.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.260
The long timers, no.

14:33.260 --> 14:37.840
And I also appreciate that Remy still spells his name in a way where I can read it appropriately

14:37.840 --> 14:40.740
because when he first started emailing in, he spelled his name the correct way, which

14:40.740 --> 14:41.780
I would always butcher.

14:41.780 --> 14:46.520
So now he writes in a way where my childlike brain can read it correctly.

14:46.520 --> 14:51.380
So after just recently writing in about macro keyboard shortcuts, he says, I'm in the process

14:51.380 --> 14:53.800
of trying to sell my own GPL software.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.240
It's a small monitoring app written in Qt and C++.

14:56.240 --> 15:00.720
If you want to check it out, it's at leafnode.nl.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.840
But I am not really necessarily looking for free advertisements.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.620
You don't have to mention it, but I already did, Remy.

15:06.620 --> 15:07.760
You are going to get it no matter what.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.760
Keep going.

15:08.760 --> 15:09.760
He says, the price is low.

15:09.760 --> 15:13.940
I'm not looking to make a profit because actually, I don't really want to get into a gray area

15:13.940 --> 15:16.600
and I don't want to have to run a company.

15:16.600 --> 15:21.040
And plus, I just kind of hate exposing my private data to any public company to register

15:21.040 --> 15:25.260
and would that gray area be the Qt license, perhaps?

15:25.260 --> 15:26.320
Perhaps un peu?

15:26.320 --> 15:28.840
I think it's like a business legal thing in his country.

15:28.840 --> 15:29.840
I don't know.

15:29.840 --> 15:30.840
OK.

15:30.840 --> 15:34.380
He says, I haven't gotten on a mobile app store yet, but the download includes an APK

15:34.380 --> 15:35.380
for Android.

15:35.380 --> 15:38.040
The app itself can export its source code.

15:38.040 --> 15:42.140
I've built that in so that even when the binary is distributed, users can still get the source

15:42.140 --> 15:43.140
code.

15:43.140 --> 15:47.680
A hypothetical scenario here is when it's up on the Play Store and then I can't export

15:47.680 --> 15:48.960
the source code to the user.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.880
So he's concerned about this and GPL violations.

15:51.880 --> 15:55.520
And I'm wondering, why not just link to it like an about page under a hamburger menu

15:55.520 --> 15:56.520
or something?

15:56.520 --> 15:57.520
That's like legit what I was going to say.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.520
OK.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.520
But here's this real question.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.360
So he's looking at the Linux deployment.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.540
He's got a script right now that will build an app image.

16:04.540 --> 16:07.400
It will compile Qt statically.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.880
It's based around Ubuntu 18.04.

16:08.880 --> 16:14.680
He says, it works on most modern Linux boxes that have app image support, which is like

16:14.680 --> 16:15.680
everything.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.360
But he's kind of curious.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.080
What do we recommend for packaging this thing up?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.800
He says, I see that snaps have a-

16:21.800 --> 16:22.800
Oh, no, no, no.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.800
I'm not touching Linux packaging.

16:23.800 --> 16:24.800
Go.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.800
Is that how you feel now?

16:25.800 --> 16:26.800
Is that how you feel?

16:26.800 --> 16:30.760
I have gotten into some nasty, nasty fights.

16:30.760 --> 16:31.760
That's what Remi's concerned about.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.720
He's worried about snap blowback, he says.

16:33.720 --> 16:40.440
Do what you want, but the stakes are so low.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.680
So you're saying the risk isn't worth the return.

16:42.680 --> 16:43.680
It's not worth it.

16:43.680 --> 16:44.680
Do it.

16:44.680 --> 16:45.680
Do what you want.

16:45.680 --> 16:53.080
My personal opinion is that I would take a.deb over a snap or a flat, especially a flat

16:53.080 --> 16:54.080
pack.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.960
Which, you know, everybody likes flat pack, and I've heard the recent Linux unplugged

16:57.960 --> 16:58.960
and whatever.

16:58.960 --> 16:59.960
Here's the thing.

16:59.960 --> 17:00.960
Here's the thing.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.840
I think flat packs have gotten a lot more accepted.

17:03.840 --> 17:07.320
It's really only in Ubuntu land where they're still tricky, but every other distro.

17:07.320 --> 17:08.920
Well, so I run Ubuntu, right?

17:08.920 --> 17:09.920
I run Pop.

17:09.920 --> 17:10.920
Yeah, and it's huge.

17:10.920 --> 17:11.920
It is huge.

17:11.920 --> 17:12.920
Right, right.

17:12.920 --> 17:13.920
So it-

17:13.920 --> 17:14.920
Well, okay, Pop's got flat pack support.

17:14.920 --> 17:15.920
Pop's got flat pack.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.600
I mean, regular, straight up Ubuntu does not.

17:18.600 --> 17:21.760
It does, but it's not very great.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.080
I mean, you know-

17:23.080 --> 17:24.080
Well, here's the thing.

17:24.080 --> 17:25.080
Here's the thing.

17:25.080 --> 17:32.240
Flathub is actively working on a way for developers to monetize, and it is a large repo of software,

17:32.240 --> 17:34.240
and it's desktop focused, and-

17:34.240 --> 17:35.240
I heard this before.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.000
Canonical is working on the Ubuntu app store.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.120
I bought, you remember, years ago, I bought an Ubuntu app to rebrand it, remonetize it,

17:43.120 --> 17:48.360
and I made, the guy I bought it from made enough money to buy a cheeseburger, literally.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.360
He made a video about it.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.360
His name is Zane Swafford.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.480
He's a great kid.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.480
He worked for me.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.120
It's different this time, man.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.120
Oh, of course it is.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.120
How come?

17:56.120 --> 17:57.120
Oh, I didn't know.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.120
Okay.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.120
Yeah.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.120
This time will be different.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.280
It is not tied to any particular distro.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.480
There was no universal packaging format back then.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.280
It was all tied to dab and app.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.400
So why is flat better?

18:08.400 --> 18:09.600
I don't use flat packs.

18:09.600 --> 18:15.120
I use, so, and I know we're going to get, I use snap, but my preference is straight

18:15.120 --> 18:16.120
dabs.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.120
Right.

18:17.120 --> 18:21.020
I will install a.deb deal and just do the deep package thing on the terminal.

18:21.020 --> 18:23.400
That's the way I like to do it, but tell me why I'm wrong.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.760
I think a dab is a pretty reasonable, and you're going to, you're going to get probably

18:26.760 --> 18:29.320
80% of your, maybe 70% of your user base.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.900
So I'm not trying to say don't go with the dab.

18:30.900 --> 18:35.200
And I don't even think I'd argue that a flat pack is necessarily better than an app image

18:35.200 --> 18:36.200
or a snap.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.320
I think what I would argue is that just the network effect has gotten to the point now

18:39.320 --> 18:41.480
where flat packs are starting to become a superior choice.

18:41.480 --> 18:46.720
It's sort of like it's becoming the, it's becoming the DMG of the Linux desktop, even

18:46.720 --> 18:49.280
though app image is pretty close to that.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.280
It's simple.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.720
It works with all software centers, you know, it's straightforward to get a flat pack installed

18:53.720 --> 18:54.720
on Linux.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.160
Now app image is also a great way to go.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.160
I just probably wouldn't do snaps like everybody else.

18:59.160 --> 19:05.880
I have a pony in this race and it's app image because they're the same thing.

19:05.880 --> 19:09.440
Mac OS has been doing this for years and it's been fine.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.440
Right?

19:10.440 --> 19:11.440
Yes, it takes more storage, blah, blah, blah.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.440
A lot of technical reasons.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.340
Maybe you don't want to do it that way, but who cares?

19:15.340 --> 19:17.260
People buy terabyte hard drives now.

19:17.260 --> 19:21.680
And there is the app image hub, which kind of acts like a flat hub.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.840
That to me is part of it.

19:22.840 --> 19:23.840
I guess.

19:23.840 --> 19:28.880
I think you got to have a front end to find new apps, recently updated apps.

19:28.880 --> 19:29.880
You got to have a place.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.480
I think that's what makes the app stores work.

19:31.480 --> 19:35.720
I'm at the point where I'm starting to, again, they don't pay me.

19:35.720 --> 19:39.360
I just like the stuff they put out.

19:39.360 --> 19:43.600
Where I think system 76, thinking about pop OS is right.

19:43.600 --> 19:49.640
That these Linux deck tops are for technical people, for developers, for engineers.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.680
And at some point you're just going to have to pop open the terminal, right?

19:52.680 --> 19:56.320
You're just going to have to do it out of the old way.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.640
I mean, is Dash old?

19:58.640 --> 20:05.180
I know this is heresy, but if I became the ruler of Linux, I think I would target the

20:05.180 --> 20:06.880
user you just described.

20:06.880 --> 20:11.740
And then what I would say is, from henceforth, all tutorials and how-tos will take place

20:11.740 --> 20:13.440
on the command line.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.160
Because it's a consistent UI across all Linux.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.240
It's not just Linux.

20:17.240 --> 20:23.480
You know, the Mac podcasts, love you all, please don't be mad.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.520
But the real technical ones, guess where they live?

20:26.520 --> 20:29.360
They live in ZShell, which is Mac Bash, right?

20:29.360 --> 20:33.580
Well, ZShell exists everywhere, but Mac, the default is ZShell.

20:33.580 --> 20:34.760
For some reason, yeah.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.080
The reason's the GPL3.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.080
Yeah.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.700
But like, you know what?

20:38.700 --> 20:39.800
It's Unix.

20:39.800 --> 20:44.320
Like Mac and Linux, it's weird that there's that animosity between the communities, because

20:44.320 --> 20:46.840
they really are, they're not just kissing cousins.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.240
They're Cleopatra and her husband slash brother.

20:49.240 --> 20:53.000
Yeah, especially when you have things like Brew or Nix, and you can get package management

20:53.000 --> 20:54.600
going on the Mac.

20:54.600 --> 20:59.680
And yeah, I think System76 is targeting the right user with Pop, and that it is that technical

20:59.680 --> 21:01.160
user who just wants to get to work.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.440
I think I'm going to buy a Thaleo tonight.

21:03.440 --> 21:08.280
I think Remi just wants to give, he wants like maybe your best talk him out of trying

21:08.280 --> 21:10.680
to ship and sell GPL software pitch.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.680
Do you have one?

21:11.680 --> 21:12.840
Because he's asking for your opinion on it.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.720
I think we both know what that is.

21:14.720 --> 21:18.160
Yeah, I am going to do the same thing very soon.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.160
Okay.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.960
I hope it's open core.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.160
Remi, michael at the madvador.com.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.160
Drop me a line.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.360
We need to talk.

21:27.360 --> 21:33.080
So Chris, you know, and the listeners know that I have been trying to revive the open

21:33.080 --> 21:34.400
core business model.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.520
I've noticed a few comments.

21:36.520 --> 21:40.640
Can I just put my balls on the table like Eric Bachman or Erlich Bachman?

21:40.640 --> 21:43.200
I'm going to open core Alice if I can.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.200
Really?

21:44.200 --> 21:46.280
I'm wondering how this is going to work.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.960
So let's start there.

21:47.960 --> 21:51.300
You're thinking you open source and you even said GPL there.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.300
And then what?

21:52.300 --> 21:53.940
Sell plugins, extra functionality?

21:53.940 --> 21:57.680
So I said open core and GPL, which I guess is open source too.

21:57.680 --> 21:58.680
So yeah.

21:58.680 --> 21:59.680
Free software though.

21:59.680 --> 22:00.680
It's what it is.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.680
It's free software.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.560
I'm going to get back just for a second, right?

22:03.560 --> 22:07.480
What Alice actually is because we talk about it like, you know, oh, great, great idea.

22:07.480 --> 22:08.480
Yeah.

22:08.480 --> 22:12.280
So Alice is automation and data translation software.

22:12.280 --> 22:17.600
I have a term that I use for my customers called universal data fluency.

22:17.600 --> 22:23.520
Basically the software looks at the shape of the data to translate it into other data

22:23.520 --> 22:24.800
sources.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.900
So we had a partnership at close, which is a CRM.

22:28.900 --> 22:34.180
We could look at data from HubSpot, which is another CRM and translate it into close.

22:34.180 --> 22:37.480
Right now we actually focus on contractors for Alice.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.860
We do service Titan.

22:38.860 --> 22:42.120
We're going to do house call pro next year.

22:42.120 --> 22:45.240
The idea though is we do Google suite, right?

22:45.240 --> 22:46.240
Google.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.240
What the hell do they call it now?

22:47.240 --> 22:50.840
Google for business used to be just G suite is not still called G suite.

22:50.840 --> 22:51.840
No, it's not.

22:51.840 --> 22:55.500
It's I mean, I usually, I usually call it like Google apps for business that they yelled

22:55.500 --> 22:58.640
at me because I had the old name up and the old names or something.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.640
Is it Google teams?

22:59.640 --> 23:01.640
It's like Google for, I don't know, whatever.

23:01.640 --> 23:05.400
I think it's now called Google wishes it invented Slack for business.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.400
Let me put it this way.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.720
We also integrate with Slack.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.000
Thank you, Chris.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.560
And teams and office three 65 and whatever the Google version of that is, which is weird

23:13.560 --> 23:17.440
because I've been a Google customer for over a decade and a half.

23:17.440 --> 23:24.600
But hey, Google, my love, stop rebranding your, just stop renaming things and maybe

23:24.600 --> 23:29.800
bring back a, the X and PP based chat and maybe while you're at it wave and we're never

23:29.800 --> 23:32.840
going to get all your, your, your reader.

23:32.840 --> 23:33.840
You want to talk about that?

23:33.840 --> 23:34.840
Do we have to go here?

23:34.840 --> 23:37.040
Yeah, actually I've moved on.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.040
I've moved on reader.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.840
I've made peace with actually it's all the other stuff.

23:40.840 --> 23:44.840
I'm already pre upset about stadia so much for my Alice plug, but let's, let's, let's

23:44.840 --> 23:45.840
have our feelings.

23:45.840 --> 23:46.840
No, no, no, no.

23:46.840 --> 23:47.980
We have to say the names.

23:47.980 --> 23:49.780
We have to say the names.

23:49.780 --> 23:52.520
Google has killed every product that was ever good that they made.

23:52.520 --> 23:53.520
Sorry.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.520
Google is better.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.520
It was better than Twitter.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.160
Google plus is still better than Twitter and Facebook combined.

23:58.160 --> 24:04.680
I love the Google plus, but anyway, all right, so integrates with Slack, integrates with

24:04.680 --> 24:07.600
all the different business areas and it helps you move data between those things.

24:07.600 --> 24:12.800
It sounds like that's core functionality as far as you're concerned or is Slack like outside

24:12.800 --> 24:13.800
core.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.680
That's an interesting question.

24:15.680 --> 24:18.720
So we are having a problem.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.640
Should I just air my dirty laundry here?

24:20.640 --> 24:21.640
Oh, probably.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.760
I mean, it's good for the ads, right?

24:24.760 --> 24:31.520
Our best customers are, how should we say, a little traditional in their it stack.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.600
They don't have Slack.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.640
They don't have teams, honestly.

24:34.640 --> 24:40.160
They have Google, but they don't understand why Gmail keeps changing on them and they're

24:40.160 --> 24:42.840
to say they're upset is a dramatic understatement.

24:42.840 --> 24:46.560
They're basically their most modern communications tools.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.560
Probably email.

24:47.560 --> 24:52.160
You know, I'll just give you the numbers, our most popular integration, Microsoft access.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.160
Of course.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.720
Oh man, I bet I could have predicted that.

24:55.720 --> 25:03.400
We have fire stations, fire truck repair companies, military contractors, and a whole lot of like

25:03.400 --> 25:06.560
actual contractors, like folks who are literally building buildings.

25:06.560 --> 25:11.120
I mean, I don't know about the military, but all these other ones like manufacturing parts

25:11.120 --> 25:17.520
or like where it's a shop, it's like a machine shop or construction, all these places, offices,

25:17.520 --> 25:19.920
they're all places that get somebody who knows just enough.

25:19.920 --> 25:24.480
They're dangerous just enough to build something like an access or an Excel.

25:24.480 --> 25:25.480
That's classic.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.160
Oh, oh, my mom.

25:27.160 --> 25:31.280
So I'm not going to say where she works because she would literally cut my left that off.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.160
But my mom is an Excel ninja.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.640
She has done things.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.880
I didn't tell you this, but I'll tell you on the air.

25:37.880 --> 25:42.160
I bought a book called Python Workout, 50 lessons every week.

25:42.160 --> 25:43.160
We're going to do one.

25:43.160 --> 25:47.080
I'm going to put it on GitHub, public, you're going to love it.

25:47.080 --> 25:51.120
She could do them in Excel and half the time I couldn't Python.

25:51.120 --> 25:54.400
A pivot table to her is life.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.480
Like she is so powerful.

25:57.480 --> 26:02.000
I actually asked her just like I just start throwing programming problems at her as a

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
go on.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Just go on Excel.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Yeah.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Do it in Excel.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
There's a whole programming language.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.600
The problem is Excel changed.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.600
Yeah.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.000
These things used to run businesses.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.360
Oh, you would be horrified.

26:14.360 --> 26:15.360
They still do.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.360
Oh, OK.

26:16.360 --> 26:19.240
Yeah, I mean, I've seen it in my time, so I can only imagine.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.000
I've always wondered, like, how long could this possibly last?

26:22.000 --> 26:23.280
And it sounds like forever.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.280
Yeah.

26:24.280 --> 26:25.560
Much longer than I thought it would.

26:25.560 --> 26:30.600
So listeners, if any of you know what I'm talking about when I say Microsoft Access,

26:30.600 --> 26:32.760
because I'm pretty sure that that's a relic, right?

26:32.760 --> 26:35.560
I know they know they know they don't know.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.560
They know access.

26:36.560 --> 26:41.400
My God, I hope that would actually if people don't know millions in and tell me as you're

26:41.400 --> 26:43.040
listening to this right now, send us a boost.

26:43.040 --> 26:49.480
Did you know or did you not know about access and have you ever used it or seen it?

26:49.480 --> 26:50.920
Tailscale.com slash coder.

26:50.920 --> 26:54.400
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.520
And of course, you support the show.

26:55.520 --> 26:59.080
So it's tailscale.com slash coder.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.640
Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

27:01.640 --> 27:03.820
It installs on any device in minutes.

27:03.820 --> 27:05.360
It manages your firewall rules.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.680
It helps you with double dreaded NAT.

27:07.680 --> 27:14.480
I recently learned that one of the co-founders of Tailscale has parents that retired into

27:14.480 --> 27:15.700
an RV.

27:15.700 --> 27:20.560
And so he went out to their RV and made sure that Tailscale worked through carrier grade

27:20.560 --> 27:21.560
NAT.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.360
Man, am I grateful for that.

27:23.360 --> 27:26.120
That is the scenario I use it all the time.

27:26.120 --> 27:31.520
Tailscale creates a decentralized flat network for your systems protected by WireGuard's

27:31.520 --> 27:32.520
mesh protocol.

27:32.520 --> 27:37.760
And then Tailscale runs this backplane that you can authenticate to using a single sign-on

27:37.760 --> 27:38.760
system.

27:38.760 --> 27:43.480
So if you work with a like a business single sign-on system and it uses two factor authentication,

27:43.480 --> 27:44.480
Tailscale supports that.

27:44.480 --> 27:48.400
Of course, it has support for DNS, so you can set up a DNS server in there and actually

27:48.400 --> 27:50.300
address everything by name.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.540
And Tailscale VPNs are always on.

27:52.540 --> 27:53.540
They're smart.

27:53.540 --> 27:57.120
So they send the traffic that's supposed to talk to those machines through the VPN, and

27:57.120 --> 28:00.300
not all your traffic, which means you can leave it on all the time.

28:00.300 --> 28:02.000
So every device remains connected.

28:02.000 --> 28:09.240
I'm talking, I have Raspberry Pis, I have an iPad, I have lots of desktops, I have containers,

28:09.240 --> 28:13.920
and I have VPSs, and I have VMs all on this Tailscale network.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.960
It's allowed me to build my own internet, and you can set it up and try it for yourself

28:17.960 --> 28:22.520
for free for up to 20 machines by going to tailscale.com slash coder.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.000
And keep an eye out for a future Linux Unplugged.

28:25.000 --> 28:30.080
I have an interview with one of the founders of Tailscale, and it's really insightful.

28:30.080 --> 28:33.600
And he talks about how they've built it to be sustainable, even for the free accounts.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.800
But it's just a great service.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.360
It's changed the way I work, and it's going to change the way you work, maybe you support

28:39.360 --> 28:41.720
your friends, your family, or connect your devices.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.080
Go build your own internet and support the show.

28:44.080 --> 28:48.080
Get started at tailscale.com slash coder.

28:48.080 --> 28:57.880
Yeah, so I'm, okay, so my idea for the open-coring of Alice, and I'm going to say core, and please,

28:57.880 --> 29:01.000
please stop sending me fascist emails.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.860
Not emails from fascists, literally saying that I'm a fascist because I like open-coring.

29:04.860 --> 29:07.880
It's really mean, like it's unnecessary.

29:07.880 --> 29:14.760
So the way I architected Alice is a little psychotic, for lack of a better word.

29:14.760 --> 29:17.360
There's a core automation engine, right?

29:17.360 --> 29:24.800
It runs the services, it does timers, it does webhooks, it does several versions of dedupe,

29:24.800 --> 29:25.800
deduplication.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.640
Oh, sure, yeah, I bet.

29:27.640 --> 29:34.440
The obvious ones you'd think of, I have my own little method that seems faster, but I'll

29:34.440 --> 29:38.320
be honest with you, performance has become an issue, and I'm playing with the underlying

29:38.320 --> 29:39.880
Python runtime.

29:39.880 --> 29:45.160
I actually am considering porting her to the.NET.

29:45.160 --> 29:52.600
I don't know if you know this, but so.NET has a Python runtime that seems pretty performant.

29:52.600 --> 29:57.440
There's challenges there because they're, I mean, this is a whole conversation, but

29:57.440 --> 30:00.040
I'll give you the one I told my six-year-old.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.660
It's a McDonald's parfait, right?

30:02.660 --> 30:06.920
There's a layer of yogurt, there's fruit, there's granola.

30:06.920 --> 30:09.060
Yeah, you gotta have that.

30:09.060 --> 30:11.440
Maybe like a little breading or something, I mean, I don't know.

30:11.440 --> 30:16.300
The idea is that the layers may, I think, now right now they're a little tightly coupled

30:16.300 --> 30:21.320
and I need to do some work on that, but I think maybe by this time next year, I can

30:21.320 --> 30:28.320
uncouple the core, the yogurt part, and make that an open core automation engine.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.660
Hmm, yeah.

30:29.660 --> 30:30.720
And why wouldn't I do that?

30:30.720 --> 30:36.880
I really think the pushback you've gotten on open core is probably just a vocal minority

30:36.880 --> 30:41.400
because I think, I mean, I think you could even, you don't even really have to use the

30:41.400 --> 30:42.400
language.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.760
You know, you could really just talk about how this is the project, it's open source,

30:45.760 --> 30:50.260
it's free software, these additional commercial modules are available, and you almost could

30:50.260 --> 30:54.100
even not even say the words open core, but people would get it.

30:54.100 --> 30:59.940
So the way I bill for Alice is there's that 5,000, like that's the minimum, right?

30:59.940 --> 31:04.560
And then the more integrations, and if you want us to host it, obviously that costs something,

31:04.560 --> 31:05.560
right?

31:05.560 --> 31:07.100
For hosting in PlanCity.

31:07.100 --> 31:09.500
But I bill for the additional integrations.

31:09.500 --> 31:15.840
So I'm not suggesting I'm going to make the integration layer or the, you know, data translation

31:15.840 --> 31:18.360
layer open source.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.560
That could be something that's also custom per customer.

31:20.560 --> 31:21.560
I could see that.

31:21.560 --> 31:22.560
Yeah.

31:22.560 --> 31:23.560
Well, we do a lot of custom work, right?

31:23.560 --> 31:30.400
So see, I have memories, and frankly, I know you do, right, of the old days where you had

31:30.400 --> 31:36.600
companies that were living the open source lifestyle, a free software package, right?

31:36.600 --> 31:37.600
Open source.

31:37.600 --> 31:44.800
But to be super clear, when I say the yogurt part is going to be open source, I mean, GPL,

31:44.800 --> 31:47.080
like straight up GPL.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.720
I want to charge for the integrations.

31:48.720 --> 31:52.280
I want to charge for some of the data translation stuff.

31:52.280 --> 31:55.160
So I have talked to three attorneys.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.160
How's that going?

31:57.160 --> 32:03.680
Mike, take a shower, have a glass of water and a cup of coffee and go to bed.

32:03.680 --> 32:07.360
What are you out of your mind?

32:07.360 --> 32:13.160
And the last one was, so killing yourself, like, why don't you just kill yourself?

32:13.160 --> 32:14.160
Sorry, kids.

32:14.160 --> 32:18.680
I have a divorce lawyer, I have a business lawyer, I actually have two business lawyers

32:18.680 --> 32:24.560
because one of my business lawyers literally quit being a lawyer to go raise cattle, which

32:24.560 --> 32:26.440
tells you how fun being a lawyer is.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.040
Man, that's probably the way to go, let's be honest.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.400
But even her, she was like, you're insane.

32:31.400 --> 32:36.440
You know, what is the difference between open core and free software in terms of a corporation,

32:36.440 --> 32:38.960
in terms of a business?

32:38.960 --> 32:42.040
It seems like you actually have a business behind an open core model.

32:42.040 --> 32:45.120
There's an actual business where the free software project, sometimes there's no business,

32:45.120 --> 32:47.120
there's just a guy.

32:47.120 --> 32:51.400
KP says in the chat, open core is great, just tell an AWS, find out your product, or they'll

32:51.400 --> 32:53.760
just write their own plugins from placers.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.040
There's that, there's that, yeah.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.520
So it's possible, right?

32:56.520 --> 33:01.000
Like, Chris knows, and I think you all know that I've been thinking about this for a year

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
and a half now.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.040
I'll be honest with you, the reason I haven't done it is I'm frankly scared.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.960
Yeah, I think that's probably your biggest risk there is somebody creates commercial

33:08.960 --> 33:11.840
plugins that replace what you do.

33:11.840 --> 33:15.280
And that almost would be a great problem to have too at the same time, because the scale

33:15.280 --> 33:19.320
you would have to reach to show up on their radar and then to have customers that want

33:19.320 --> 33:23.400
it for them to implement that would mean that you're, you know, you're probably at hundreds

33:23.400 --> 33:24.600
of employees at that point.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.520
Could I make a evil announcement?

33:26.520 --> 33:27.680
Oh yeah, let's do it.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.600
Not to turn this into an ad for Alice.

33:29.600 --> 33:35.720
We're also, oh, giving dates is painful because I've been wrong every time.

33:35.720 --> 33:42.600
By next year, we're going to have a self-service GUI reporting tool where folks who pay for

33:42.600 --> 33:49.160
the GUI reporting tool can use the internal, the yogurt, right?

33:49.160 --> 33:52.320
Part of Alice to create their own reports.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.320
Working on that now?

33:53.320 --> 33:54.320
Oh yeah.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.280
It's a, it's a web interface.

33:56.280 --> 34:05.340
I want an iPad interface, but I, do you remember that episode where, what's his name?

34:05.340 --> 34:06.340
Number one.

34:06.340 --> 34:07.340
Oh, Riker.

34:07.340 --> 34:10.320
Riker mutinied against the card.

34:10.320 --> 34:11.320
No.

34:11.320 --> 34:13.760
My employees will not allow me to open Xcode again.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.200
Are you telling me there's a Riker mutiny episode?

34:16.200 --> 34:18.540
Am I blanking on this?

34:18.540 --> 34:19.540
You are.

34:19.540 --> 34:20.540
I can think of it.

34:20.540 --> 34:22.760
I can think of a Jakota mutiny episode on the holodeck.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.480
It's the one where he and Q merge.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.960
Q offers him to be kind of a mutiny.

34:27.960 --> 34:28.960
You're right.

34:28.960 --> 34:33.320
And he turns Wesley into like this huge stud and Wes is like, Oh, what's up mom?

34:33.320 --> 34:37.120
Which is weird too, troubling in so many ways.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.120
Yeah.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.840
Oh, by the way, can we respond to the Star Trek feedback or no?

34:40.840 --> 34:41.840
Oh yeah, sure.

34:41.840 --> 34:42.840
Sure.

34:42.840 --> 34:43.840
Boost a gram.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.840
Boost.

34:44.840 --> 34:45.840
All right.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.400
So we did get some Star Trek feedback.

34:47.400 --> 34:52.280
In fact, we got a rage boost from a middle-aged dev sent in 500 sats.

34:52.280 --> 34:56.360
I love discovery season four, however, I missed out on most of enterprise and I will check

34:56.360 --> 34:57.360
it out.

34:57.360 --> 35:01.560
I do remember those and Dorian antennas wiggling though, which was great.

35:01.560 --> 35:05.200
We had a few people in telegram respond to that.

35:05.200 --> 35:09.920
We were just not appreciating the emotional journey that discovery takes you on when we

35:09.920 --> 35:11.680
were talking about discovery.

35:11.680 --> 35:15.640
I think spoiler free, but did you catch strange new worlds, which has launched?

35:15.640 --> 35:20.080
Don't, don't spoil it because it's just new, but parents of Coder radio, this is the time

35:20.080 --> 35:22.640
to maybe make your kids go away.

35:22.640 --> 35:24.640
You have two seconds.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.080
Get out of here.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.080
One two.

35:29.080 --> 35:34.420
I'm a big fan of the uniforms in discovery in a strange new worlds.

35:34.420 --> 35:35.560
Big fan.

35:35.560 --> 35:36.560
Big fan.

35:36.560 --> 35:37.560
All right.

35:37.560 --> 35:38.560
I mean, that's positive.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.560
I thought you were going to drop a bomb.

35:39.560 --> 35:40.560
Nope.

35:40.560 --> 35:45.080
It's a, it's, it's a specific uniform that I like, but yeah.

35:45.080 --> 35:47.480
Oh, is it in the sick pay?

35:47.480 --> 35:51.920
I refuse to answer any questions that might cancel me.

35:51.920 --> 35:52.920
All right.

35:52.920 --> 35:53.920
I got you.

35:53.920 --> 35:54.920
But yeah, I, all right.

35:54.920 --> 36:00.800
I think my, my take on the strange new worlds is that it is probably the best first episode

36:00.800 --> 36:02.040
of any of the new Trek.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.400
No, it's kidding aside.

36:03.400 --> 36:04.400
It's really good.

36:04.400 --> 36:05.400
Right?

36:05.400 --> 36:11.620
Like I, I, I wasn't going to watch it until we got our nasty emails and I did because

36:11.620 --> 36:15.920
I'm a coward and I loved it a little too much though.

36:15.920 --> 36:16.920
Yeah.

36:16.920 --> 36:17.920
So, okay.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.320
Just between you and I, Chris, no one else can hear this, right?

36:20.320 --> 36:21.760
No, it's just private now.

36:21.760 --> 36:25.200
So, so Mariah bought a dress for the wedding, right?

36:25.200 --> 36:26.200
Oh yeah.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.200
Right.

36:27.200 --> 36:32.920
I lit it on fire and I bought her a yellow star trip.

36:32.920 --> 36:33.920
She's going to love that.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.240
She's just going to love that.

36:35.240 --> 36:39.400
I just want to say she, she is not super thrilled.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.800
I can't imagine.

36:41.800 --> 36:42.800
All right.

36:42.800 --> 36:47.600
Next boost comes in boost from DPG says, I want to recommend the new Lego star Wars games

36:47.600 --> 36:48.600
in the Skywalker Sega.

36:48.600 --> 36:53.360
It's been a blast playing with my younger cousin, plenty of nostalgia, may the force

36:53.360 --> 36:54.760
be with you.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.440
He's also says there's a bunch of Jar Jar stuff in there.

36:57.440 --> 36:58.960
In fact, I'll jump right to it.

36:58.960 --> 37:04.440
Crashmaster 18 wrote in with a thousand sats, Mesa happy to hear Jar Jar.

37:04.440 --> 37:09.440
And for what it's worth, I like all the star Wars movies and I like Picard too, but I can't

37:09.440 --> 37:10.560
get into discovery.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.560
Tried repeatedly.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.560
I can't believe people are encouraging this Jar Jar thing.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.880
They're actually using their sats to encourage more Jar Jar Binks.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.320
I don't think these people appreciate what they're doing to the show.

37:20.320 --> 37:27.400
You know, they're not thinking this through Mesa stand with captain Vorka, bringing the

37:27.400 --> 37:28.400
world together.

37:28.400 --> 37:32.200
I just want to say this one more time and I really hope we stopped being a social commentary

37:32.200 --> 37:37.840
podcast, but a captain Lorker was the most interesting captain of Star Trek ever period.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.860
Second only maybe to Cisco.

37:39.860 --> 37:44.000
And I have this weird thing where me Cisco and Lorca are, nevermind better than Sean

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Luke.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Yeah.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Sean Luke, you know, he's too perfect.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.280
Well, they take him down a few pegs in Picard.

37:49.280 --> 37:52.040
So if that's your thing, you'll enjoy Picard.

37:52.040 --> 37:56.600
I have watched Picard and watching an old man suffer from dementia is not great.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.600
Oh geez.

37:57.600 --> 37:58.600
Oh geez.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.600
I'm actually impressed.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.240
He reacted the hell out of that final episode.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.080
You know who the hero of Picard is?

38:03.080 --> 38:04.080
Seven of nine.

38:04.080 --> 38:05.080
Who?

38:05.080 --> 38:06.080
Lorca?

38:06.080 --> 38:07.480
I'm filled with rage right now.

38:07.480 --> 38:08.480
Are you insane?

38:08.480 --> 38:09.480
Who?

38:09.480 --> 38:10.480
Dodge.

38:10.480 --> 38:15.680
But the OG Dodge first episode, they jump her, they put a hood on her and that girl

38:15.680 --> 38:17.480
steps right up to the plate.

38:17.480 --> 38:18.720
You're right.

38:18.720 --> 38:24.040
And when they try to kill captain Picard or Admiral Picard, if you were, listen, fighting

38:24.040 --> 38:28.760
someone on a college campus or whatever the hell Starfleet thinks it is.

38:28.760 --> 38:31.560
I have gotten to physical altercations on the college campus.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.560
Let me tell you something.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.560
I can't believe it.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.560
Of course you have.

38:34.560 --> 38:35.560
Yes.

38:35.560 --> 38:38.280
We both hurt each other by missing each other and hitting walls.

38:38.280 --> 38:39.280
Oh my God.

38:39.280 --> 38:43.120
I, you two, you two hot heads fighting each other and then punch on the wall is God.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.320
I wish I could have seen that.

38:44.320 --> 38:45.320
I'm bleeding.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.320
Are you okay?

38:46.320 --> 38:47.320
Like it's,

38:47.320 --> 38:48.320
fights over.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.800
Oh my God.

38:50.800 --> 38:51.800
And attacked us.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.560
The, the, the, the, the building jumped.

38:53.560 --> 38:54.560
Yes.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.040
So I wish I could have seen that.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.480
Nev kicked off a challenge last week.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.400
He's now coming through with 5,000 sats.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.640
Jim, I hereby challenge you to install gen two for a week.

39:03.640 --> 39:07.120
If you manage this challenge successfully, I will give you 5,000 sets.

39:07.120 --> 39:09.380
At the end of the week, you can submit a Neo fetch.

39:09.380 --> 39:14.200
That's a program you can install on the command line and give me a screenshot of it and submit

39:14.200 --> 39:16.320
a pull request to his get lab.

39:16.320 --> 39:19.080
He's got it linked in the show notes, so we'll put a link to that.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.620
And then you get the 5,000 sats.

39:20.620 --> 39:24.920
If you complete the gen two challenge, I think they might've already connected in the matrix

39:24.920 --> 39:26.320
too, which is awesome.

39:26.320 --> 39:29.200
I'm not positive, but I think it might've been happening.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.200
Oh my God.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.200
It's not me.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.200
Okay.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.560
I don't have to insult you into new, no, some guy named Jim does.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.800
Sorry Jim, but maybe you'll enjoy your set.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.640
Jim, you did this to yourself.

39:38.640 --> 39:44.060
Also puppy Linux for life saved my ass more times than y'all could ever.

39:44.060 --> 39:45.060
Puppy Linux.

39:45.060 --> 39:49.040
Also system rescue CD also really good for saving your bacon.

39:49.040 --> 39:50.040
System rescue CD.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.040
Shout out.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.520
I like how I have the crappy old version.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.520
Yes.

39:53.520 --> 39:58.320
The good version.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.600
Linode.com slash coder.

39:59.600 --> 40:04.600
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

40:04.600 --> 40:05.600
show.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.720
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

40:07.720 --> 40:11.240
You got to go try it for yourself or your next project to go learn something.

40:11.240 --> 40:14.360
Maybe they have a one click deployment of something you've been wanting to try for a

40:14.360 --> 40:15.360
while.

40:15.360 --> 40:18.960
That's the first place I check when I learn about a new open source project.

40:18.960 --> 40:22.360
Sometimes I just browse their marketplace just to learn about new projects.

40:22.360 --> 40:27.680
And because I actually do that, I noticed that they update it pretty frequently as well.

40:27.680 --> 40:28.960
There's a lot of nice things in there.

40:28.960 --> 40:35.800
And I always mentioned things like Jitsi GitLab or Nextcloud or lots of popular gaming servers.

40:35.800 --> 40:40.360
I run a couple for my kids up there, but of course you can also use it to deploy your

40:40.360 --> 40:43.600
entire infrastructure for your business in the cloud.

40:43.600 --> 40:51.680
And it's not like this super intense, hyperscaler, esoteric platform where all of the jargon

40:51.680 --> 40:56.400
and the skills only apply to that platform, which essentially is creating a new form of

40:56.400 --> 40:58.120
cloud lock-in.

40:58.120 --> 40:59.920
That's not the game Linode plays.

40:59.920 --> 41:03.760
What they play is the value, the performance and the service.

41:03.760 --> 41:07.520
There's not a lot of people competing in this space and nobody does it like Linode because

41:07.520 --> 41:10.040
they've been around for 19 years doing this kind of stuff.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.880
They've recently been rolling out MVME PCIe storage.

41:12.880 --> 41:16.240
So if you have applications that need super high performance, like I'm talking serious

41:16.240 --> 41:18.840
IOPS, they've got disks for that now.

41:18.840 --> 41:24.760
They've got AMD EPYC CPUs that consistently benchmark higher and faster than the competitors.

41:24.760 --> 41:31.160
11 data centers around the world where they are their own ISP, so they control their connectivity.

41:31.160 --> 41:32.160
It's great.

41:32.160 --> 41:37.720
40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors, they got SSDs, MVMEs, they got the RAMs, they

41:37.720 --> 41:38.720
got the CPUs.

41:38.720 --> 41:42.520
I mean, it goes on and on, but what really matters and what I hear a lot is the support.

41:42.520 --> 41:45.640
I mean, I could just, I could rattle on about all the features.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.840
I use the crap out of the object storage.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.520
That's why I say just go take advantage of that $100.

41:51.520 --> 41:57.080
That's like real working money, especially when you see these prices, they're 30 to 50%

41:57.080 --> 41:58.080
lower than the hyperscalers.

41:58.080 --> 42:03.360
So like that $100, you can really try this thing and actually see what I'm talking about.

42:03.360 --> 42:07.680
And it's also just great for anybody who might want to deploy a portfolio or a website.

42:07.680 --> 42:08.880
It scales.

42:08.880 --> 42:09.880
It's great for individuals.

42:09.880 --> 42:10.880
It's great for businesses.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.120
It really hits that sweet spot.

42:13.120 --> 42:16.840
You can take it even further with things like their API, their documentation.

42:16.840 --> 42:23.720
Go try it out and support the show, linode.com slash coder.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.720
Can we have a pop topic?

42:25.720 --> 42:26.720
Sure.

42:26.720 --> 42:35.000
So I'd like to, with respect, ask you, what terminal are you using right now?

42:35.000 --> 42:38.960
The machine I'm sitting at is plasma and I love console on the Mac.

42:38.960 --> 42:44.880
I'll use iterm for most my like day long work and then like quick stuff, I'll just use the

42:44.880 --> 42:45.880
terminal.

42:45.880 --> 42:46.880
It's so kind of depends.

42:46.880 --> 42:49.480
And then I actually just use the GNOME terminal on GNOME.

42:49.480 --> 42:53.080
So I have been taking a journey into the land of terminals, eh?

42:53.080 --> 42:58.640
There are so many new terminals now and I have to say, I'm not going to say negative

42:58.640 --> 43:04.800
about the ones I don't like, but warp, we've talked about them before, made the right choice

43:04.800 --> 43:06.560
by not going electron.

43:06.560 --> 43:07.560
Yeah.

43:07.560 --> 43:09.960
That's just not where you want an electron app, is it?

43:09.960 --> 43:12.720
So folks that don't know, I use an app called magnet app.

43:12.720 --> 43:16.480
It adds like snap tiling and also keyboard commands, stuff that should be built into

43:16.480 --> 43:19.000
the window manager of Mac OS, that kind of stuff.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.980
Stuff that literally exists on pop OS for free, but I paid $20 because I hate my life.

43:23.980 --> 43:31.480
I will say, and I say this with love, the font rendering for some reason, we've talked

43:31.480 --> 43:41.600
about this before, on Mac terminal, terminal.app, the fonts look crisper and bigger than on

43:41.600 --> 43:42.600
warp.

43:42.600 --> 43:45.200
And this is the one that kills me.

43:45.200 --> 43:51.280
So I opened the same file, same Python script, in vim, on pop OS.

43:51.280 --> 43:54.240
Now, this is not the newest release, so I apologize.

43:54.240 --> 43:57.840
I'm not insane, so I didn't update it.

43:57.840 --> 44:02.760
And in VS code, the font is like a quarter of the size in VS code.

44:02.760 --> 44:04.200
It's like half size.

44:04.200 --> 44:08.440
I have just decided in the last year, I'm just popping up the font size on all that

44:08.440 --> 44:09.820
stuff now.

44:09.820 --> 44:12.120
Have you messed with VS code setting sync at all?

44:12.120 --> 44:20.000
No, I'm afraid to do the sync because my settings on Mac and pop are different, but how does

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
it work?

44:21.000 --> 44:26.200
I'm not a heavy config tweaker of VS code because I'm installing it and removing it

44:26.200 --> 44:28.720
so frequently that I don't want to get tuned to the weeds.

44:28.720 --> 44:34.160
But I decided to authenticate it with my GitHub account, and then I sync across my font and

44:34.160 --> 44:35.720
font size.

44:35.720 --> 44:37.760
And I pop it up to like 18.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.200
Now I have pretty big monitors too.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.440
No, I'm right there with you, 18, I'm at 16.

44:41.440 --> 44:50.120
I mean, but on the Linux terminal, right on the GNOME terminal, because I'm running pop,

44:50.120 --> 44:52.980
it's size 13 and they look the same.

44:52.980 --> 44:55.400
That seems like a problem in Electron.

44:55.400 --> 44:56.400
Is this on a 4K screen?

44:56.400 --> 44:59.200
I'm wondering if it's like a difference in scaling.

44:59.200 --> 45:05.360
I can tell you exactly what screen it's an old Dell UltraSharp, I don't remember the

45:05.360 --> 45:11.040
model, but UltraSharp 27 inch, 250, 60 by 1440.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.040
That's what it is.

45:12.040 --> 45:16.800
Man, that is, it's such a tricky resolution for Linux to get right in some use cases.

45:16.800 --> 45:19.120
250, that's a normal resolution.

45:19.120 --> 45:26.920
I know, it's because it's right on the edge of requiring high DPI, but not quite.

45:26.920 --> 45:31.160
I think you'll find it's a little bit better in the new pop because it has GTK4.

45:31.160 --> 45:36.400
Wow, but there's other dependent, I mean, I'm not keen to upgrade right now.

45:36.400 --> 45:42.920
So why that specific, and I hope this is valuable to people, but hell, you're helping me now.

45:42.920 --> 45:43.920
Why?

45:43.920 --> 45:44.920
Why?

45:44.920 --> 45:45.920
It's not 4K.

45:45.920 --> 45:51.920
Right, I think it gets down to how things get rendered on that particular toolkit.

45:51.920 --> 45:54.400
So if you're, say you're on GTK with X11.

45:54.400 --> 45:57.320
Oh, no, no, no, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm GDome, right?

45:57.320 --> 46:04.080
I'll get the exact versions, 2004, the last LTS, not the new one, right?

46:04.080 --> 46:09.840
On the laptop itself, it's a system 76, I think it's a lemur, right?

46:09.840 --> 46:13.340
It's a black one, it's a little black one.

46:13.340 --> 46:15.600
It's beautiful on its own screen.

46:15.600 --> 46:19.840
The minute I plug in that HDMI cable, everything is fine.

46:19.840 --> 46:20.840
Everything's lovely.

46:20.840 --> 46:24.020
Until I open it, like it's Slack, it looks like **** too.

46:24.020 --> 46:25.680
That's what it is.

46:25.680 --> 46:31.440
Newer versions of Electron on Linux do support resolution scaling, but I don't know if that's

46:31.440 --> 46:34.280
actually shipped in things like Slack yet.

46:34.280 --> 46:36.720
Electron uses an older toolkit.

46:36.720 --> 46:41.440
I think it's GTK, but I think it's like an older GTK.

46:41.440 --> 46:46.800
What's strange is when I go to Plant City and I plug it into the 19, whatever, the 1920

46:46.800 --> 46:49.680
by 1080, it looks fine.

46:49.680 --> 46:50.680
So you're right.

46:50.680 --> 46:51.680
You must be right.

46:51.680 --> 46:52.680
It's got to be the scaling.

46:52.680 --> 46:53.680
Yeah.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.820
A couple of more boosts before we get out of here.

46:55.820 --> 46:59.640
Eric Jr. sent in 5000 SATs for absolutely no reason.

46:59.640 --> 47:04.220
From Funny Money, AKA Tom, he sent in 10,000 SATs just to say keep up the great work and

47:04.220 --> 47:06.140
files copying sent in 10,000 SATs.

47:06.140 --> 47:09.420
We really got some really great support last week.

47:09.420 --> 47:13.360
And we also got people asking if they know of any open source projects that are on the

47:13.360 --> 47:15.360
Lightning Network.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.000
I'm trying to collect a list.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.600
Here's my thinking.

47:18.600 --> 47:25.200
In the podcasting 2.0 spec, which includes things like transcripts, chapters, embedded

47:25.200 --> 47:30.500
images, it includes things like alternative download types, and it includes these boosts.

47:30.500 --> 47:34.240
So in that spec, it's an RSS namespace spec.

47:34.240 --> 47:36.680
It's an open source namespace spec.

47:36.680 --> 47:41.400
And you can put things in there like a value tag with a Lightning address.

47:41.400 --> 47:47.060
And that tells podcasting 2.0 compatible clients, like I have the support for this feature.

47:47.060 --> 47:53.620
So like transcripts, you can have a transcript namespace in the RSS XML that points to where

47:53.620 --> 47:55.300
the transcript lives at.

47:55.300 --> 47:59.660
And then the app, when it loads the podcast, it can load the transcript because it sees

47:59.660 --> 48:04.020
that namespace in the XML for the transcript URL.

48:04.020 --> 48:07.440
And it goes and grabs that text, same with chapters, images.

48:07.440 --> 48:10.360
So one of the things we could actually start doing if there was enough people with podcasting

48:10.360 --> 48:14.960
2.0 apps is we could actually have an image of what we're talking about show up on the

48:14.960 --> 48:17.040
screen now if we wanted to.

48:17.040 --> 48:20.760
I'm really excited about the possibility of transcripts because then it makes the shows

48:20.760 --> 48:25.340
infinitely more searchable, which is super useful from like just looking back in the

48:25.340 --> 48:29.640
archive, finding when we talked about stuff and getting some Google juice because they've

48:29.640 --> 48:33.980
never really gotten around to making audio super searchable.

48:33.980 --> 48:37.880
So it's a whole set of features and I'm just kind of scratching the surface.

48:37.880 --> 48:42.520
Like here's another example, like if you've ever seen, like in the old days we'd have

48:42.520 --> 48:47.000
on a download app for an episode, we'd have the MP3 link, we'd have an MP4 link, we'd

48:47.000 --> 48:51.080
have like a mobile link, we'd have all these different versions of the file.

48:51.080 --> 48:55.400
Well in podcasting 2.0, they're cleaning that up and they're making it so that way you could

48:55.400 --> 49:00.000
just have one entry that has multiple file type options.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.600
Another example, and this is the last one I'll use, is they're making it possible for

49:04.600 --> 49:10.200
music publishers to basically say in their RSS feed, this is actually an album.

49:10.200 --> 49:15.440
And so it can tell the podcast UI, again if it's podcasting 2.0 compatible, it can tell

49:15.440 --> 49:21.680
the podcasting UI, render this as a music album, not a weekly podcast series.

49:21.680 --> 49:24.880
And so then it'll say things like, you know, artist and album.

49:24.880 --> 49:25.880
Oh cool.

49:25.880 --> 49:31.120
Yeah, it's really stuff that we've needed for a long time to compete with Spotify and

49:31.120 --> 49:35.080
YouTube and Facebook and everybody who wants Apple that wants to get on this.

49:35.080 --> 49:38.800
And the best part is, is that it's an open source community spec, there's lots of people

49:38.800 --> 49:43.120
contributing to it, there's multiple apps being created at newpodcastapps.com.

49:43.120 --> 49:46.160
It's really got a lot of good momentum and one of the namespace things in there is this

49:46.160 --> 49:47.780
value block.

49:47.780 --> 49:50.780
Right now it's Lightning which uses Bitcoin.

49:50.780 --> 49:54.080
That's just an implementation detail and I think Lightning is a good one because with

49:54.080 --> 49:59.640
Lightning you can send stupid cheap amounts of money, like seven cents, right?

49:59.640 --> 50:02.300
You can't do that with the existing payment rails.

50:02.300 --> 50:08.340
We have people that listen to this show that stream us some sats every minute as they listen.

50:08.340 --> 50:09.680
Just a handful of sats.

50:09.680 --> 50:13.720
And you know, it's probably, in some cases it could be less than a penny.

50:13.720 --> 50:14.720
But it adds up.

50:14.720 --> 50:17.400
And you can't do that with PayPal or Stripe.

50:17.400 --> 50:20.000
The fees are like a couple of bucks, right?

50:20.000 --> 50:21.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:21.160 --> 50:25.000
And so Lightning is the part of the backend that makes this possible.

50:25.000 --> 50:30.400
In this value namespace tag, in the RSS feed, you can do splits.

50:30.400 --> 50:33.960
So one of the things I'm thinking about is I want to do splits with certain open source

50:33.960 --> 50:35.920
projects that we use to produce these shows.

50:35.920 --> 50:39.840
So when people boost these shows, a split of it goes to an open source project.

50:39.840 --> 50:43.620
But these open source projects need to get on the Lightning network first and so if people

50:43.620 --> 50:48.120
know of open source projects that are accepting Lightning payments, let me know because that's

50:48.120 --> 50:49.120
something I could see doing.

50:49.120 --> 50:53.160
I could also see down the road splits with a host or somebody who helps us produce the

50:53.160 --> 50:55.120
show or all kinds of things.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.760
Shout out to Drew.

50:56.760 --> 50:58.720
Let's split some Lightning money with Drew, right?

50:58.720 --> 50:59.720
Let's do it.

50:59.720 --> 51:00.720
Come on.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.920
Listen, Drew has saved Chris's life a hundred times.

51:02.920 --> 51:03.920
Chris is crazy.

51:03.920 --> 51:04.920
Oh man.

51:04.920 --> 51:05.920
You've heard him live.

51:05.920 --> 51:06.920
He's nuts.

51:06.920 --> 51:07.920
Just nuts.

51:07.920 --> 51:08.920
It's definitely Chris and not me.

51:08.920 --> 51:09.920
Absolutely.

51:09.920 --> 51:14.640
I think the biggest resistance right now is crypto looks really scary, especially with

51:14.640 --> 51:20.560
the market tanking and people don't know the difference between Bitcoin and all of the

51:20.560 --> 51:22.160
other crypto currencies.

51:22.160 --> 51:24.680
It's sort of like there's a lot of operating systems and people don't know.

51:24.680 --> 51:25.680
You mean Miccoin?

51:25.680 --> 51:26.680
Yeah, right.

51:26.680 --> 51:27.680
Miccoin and scam coins, right?

51:27.680 --> 51:28.680
There's a lot of...

51:28.680 --> 51:31.400
There's Windows, there's Mac OS, there's Linux, there's the right tools for the right job.

51:31.400 --> 51:33.160
Different ones have different fundamentals.

51:33.160 --> 51:35.880
It's the same thing with crypto technology and blockchains.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.340
A lot of them are scams.

51:37.340 --> 51:40.760
Some of them are a good idea but just don't have the solid fundamentals.

51:40.760 --> 51:42.200
And then there's Bitcoin.

51:42.200 --> 51:45.900
And so that's why I like the Lightning Network because it's based on some solid fundamentals.

51:45.900 --> 51:47.960
But it could be anything.

51:47.960 --> 51:52.420
If you could get the payments right, it could be a stripe backend for that value namespace.

51:52.420 --> 51:56.680
And so the podcasting 2.0 stuff is really about all of these new things that need to

51:56.680 --> 52:02.340
come to podcasting and then about working with podcast app developers to actually incorporate

52:02.340 --> 52:03.340
those things.

52:03.340 --> 52:05.640
And it's not a lot right now.

52:05.640 --> 52:08.800
Frountain and Castamatic are the ones I use.

52:08.800 --> 52:14.360
Some apps like Overcast and AntennaPod have implemented bits and parts of the podcasting

52:14.360 --> 52:15.360
2.0 spec.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.360
And some of the...

52:16.360 --> 52:21.320
There's some really nice web podcasting players which have almost all of the features.

52:21.320 --> 52:26.140
And it's gonna require us on the backend to develop new tooling to produce the RSS feeds

52:26.140 --> 52:27.840
with all of these features.

52:27.840 --> 52:29.320
But I'm all about it.

52:29.320 --> 52:32.440
I think transcripts are one of the things I'm the most excited about along with the

52:32.440 --> 52:33.540
value tag.

52:33.540 --> 52:36.380
I could quickly see some shows doing...

52:36.380 --> 52:41.420
Like LAN could be a great example of we have six stories in an episode of LAN and we could

52:41.420 --> 52:45.340
have the headline image up as we're talking about that story each chapter because each

52:45.340 --> 52:46.920
story has a chapter.

52:46.920 --> 52:51.200
A standardized way to do chapters is another nice thing that's also searchable on the web.

52:51.200 --> 52:53.520
That's part of the podcasting 2.0 spec.

52:53.520 --> 52:57.640
And then on top of all of that, it also has a good crediting system to make it really

52:57.640 --> 53:02.280
clear who's a host, who's a guest speaker, who's a community contributor and all of this

53:02.280 --> 53:04.920
information that the listener might want to know.

53:04.920 --> 53:08.980
So it's all out there at newpodcastapps.com if you want to get it on the client side.

53:08.980 --> 53:13.440
I'm also kind of covering the development of all of this in office hours as we begin

53:13.440 --> 53:16.160
to build the tooling on the backend this summer.

53:16.160 --> 53:20.040
We have a really good conversation going on on the GitHub for Jupyter Broadcasting about

53:20.040 --> 53:21.040
some of that stuff.

53:21.040 --> 53:23.960
And then the development of that's gonna be covered in office hours.

53:23.960 --> 53:25.400
Office hours, not here.

53:25.400 --> 53:28.920
For all of that, because it's gonna be a summer of projects.

53:28.920 --> 53:31.620
Wes Payne is a mastermind of this thing.

53:31.620 --> 53:34.340
He's gonna be like the CTO of this project.

53:34.340 --> 53:37.600
He's gonna get veto power for anything too crazy.

53:37.600 --> 53:39.760
But he's kind of got a really good outline of it already.

53:39.760 --> 53:43.800
Honestly, my life would be so much better if Wes could just veto my decisions.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.600
Oh, everything, right?

53:45.600 --> 53:49.780
Like we should just submit stuff to Wes over Slack and he just needs like a voting thing

53:49.780 --> 53:51.280
that he just hits yes, no on, right?

53:51.280 --> 53:56.680
Like I should pull up to a gas station, be like, Wes, it's for, by the way, 420 gallons.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.680
Oh, oh, please, please.

53:58.680 --> 54:01.120
Oh, come on, are you busy?

54:01.120 --> 54:03.280
I paid 589 yesterday.

54:03.280 --> 54:04.280
Get out.

54:04.280 --> 54:05.560
I did.

54:05.560 --> 54:06.560
That's wild, dude.

54:06.560 --> 54:07.560
Really?

54:07.560 --> 54:12.520
I now pay more just over what I used to pay to fill up my truck, which had more, a larger

54:12.520 --> 54:13.520
tank.

54:13.520 --> 54:17.920
I now, for my little golf with like a 10.8 gallon tank, I now pay more than I did in

54:17.920 --> 54:19.080
my big Dodge truck.

54:19.080 --> 54:24.420
I have spent more money on food and gas and I did the math and it was depressing relative

54:24.420 --> 54:25.420
to my income.

54:25.420 --> 54:31.160
I have actually gotten poorer or less well off, I guess I should say, because I'm, you

54:31.160 --> 54:33.580
know, you and me are not poor.

54:33.580 --> 54:36.660
This is like, I feel it because you and I are not the only ones, listeners out there

54:36.660 --> 54:37.660
feeling it too.

54:37.660 --> 54:41.520
That's why like, I kind of laugh about the market because I have to, but I also really

54:41.520 --> 54:43.880
know it's rough for people too.

54:43.880 --> 54:45.080
I connect with that.

54:45.080 --> 54:50.800
Well, this has been a interesting experience the last couple of years with the COVID and

54:50.800 --> 54:55.100
with the market going, I think, frankly insane.

54:55.100 --> 54:57.480
Probably the wildest rides ever.

54:57.480 --> 55:00.840
And you know, I was so scared about going independent in the middle of COVID.

55:00.840 --> 55:01.840
I know you were.

55:01.840 --> 55:02.840
I know.

55:02.840 --> 55:03.840
I remember.

55:03.840 --> 55:05.400
But this seems actually in some ways scarier.

55:05.400 --> 55:11.360
I think you and I, and not just personally, like, you know, an important part of the show

55:11.360 --> 55:17.360
for me, maybe I'm in the feelings, is for people opening small businesses, right?

55:17.360 --> 55:18.360
Yeah.

55:18.360 --> 55:23.860
It's Coderadio, sure, whatever, but I don't know that you should right now, honestly.

55:23.860 --> 55:28.040
It feels like a hunker down, collect your, you collect your nuts, squirrel them away.

55:28.040 --> 55:29.640
Well, I mean, that's your choice, Chris.

55:29.640 --> 55:32.080
I respect your lifestyle if you want to collect nuts.

55:32.080 --> 55:33.080
Meanwhile, what?

55:33.080 --> 55:34.960
You're going to be collecting gold and Bitcoin?

55:34.960 --> 55:38.800
I mean, that's, that's what I, that's where I keep going back.

55:38.800 --> 55:39.800
That's the silver lining.

55:39.800 --> 55:45.120
And I just think this is one of the things now that I'm managing, right, for the business,

55:45.120 --> 55:50.080
trying to not trying to make this too, too gloomer, but like this could have a downturn.

55:50.080 --> 55:51.080
Did you just say gloomer?

55:51.080 --> 55:52.080
Isn't that a thing?

55:52.080 --> 55:53.720
A doom and gloomer?

55:53.720 --> 55:55.040
It's new to me, but I like it.

55:55.040 --> 56:00.560
You could see, you could see how this could ultimately result as a decline in the advertising

56:00.560 --> 56:04.760
space, especially in the tech advertising space as this gets rougher and rougher.

56:04.760 --> 56:10.200
And so that's why when we went independent again, I focused on memberships and I'm so

56:10.200 --> 56:11.880
super grateful for our members.

56:11.880 --> 56:16.360
I feel like the boosts are additive because they allow people more one time, one time

56:16.360 --> 56:19.920
contributions or additional on top of contributions.

56:19.920 --> 56:24.520
And I think if I had my S together and the, and the chain, the supply chain was working,

56:24.520 --> 56:28.240
I could probably try to add a little bit of a swag sale arm to, to try to make up for

56:28.240 --> 56:29.240
it.

56:29.240 --> 56:32.240
But it's like, this is my thing to manage now this year that I didn't really plan for,

56:32.240 --> 56:33.400
but I mean, it's what I got to do.

56:33.400 --> 56:34.720
Well, but you need money.

56:34.720 --> 56:37.960
That's that's, that's the way my man, can I pitch an idea?

56:37.960 --> 56:38.960
What you got?

56:38.960 --> 56:43.080
Torture Mike or, oh wait, not Mike, Jar Jar.

56:43.080 --> 56:46.840
So I will in character talk like Jar Jar Binks.

56:46.840 --> 56:47.840
Oh God.

56:47.840 --> 56:51.320
And Wes gets to pick a coding challenge for me.

56:51.320 --> 57:02.760
This is a paid only video or VR at my, at my discretion, at my discretion event, a pay

57:02.760 --> 57:07.360
per view watching me want to choke West to death because Wes is like, I'm like, Wes,

57:07.360 --> 57:08.840
you're going to pick like some normal language.

57:08.840 --> 57:09.840
No closure.

57:09.840 --> 57:16.680
We need like some really dramatic music, you know, got to have some dramatic lighting changes.

57:16.680 --> 57:21.920
And then as I get an, and also obviously people can tip me and boost because why would I do

57:21.920 --> 57:23.200
this sober?

57:23.200 --> 57:24.840
So how about this?

57:24.840 --> 57:30.200
I will become more like Jar Jar as I'm irritated and I don't get to know.

57:30.200 --> 57:37.640
So you, you give me a brand new Ubuntu or I prefer pop or Mac machine and I have to

57:37.640 --> 57:39.840
install the tool chain too.

57:39.840 --> 57:41.320
We got to back off this note here.

57:41.320 --> 57:45.560
Wes says he's concerned this is turning into some sort of weird coding only fans with Mike

57:45.560 --> 57:48.880
and he's not sure he wants to be involved with that.

57:48.880 --> 57:50.200
I feel like Wes will do it.

57:50.200 --> 57:51.200
I don't know.

57:51.200 --> 57:52.200
Come on.

57:52.200 --> 57:53.200
Do it.

57:53.200 --> 57:54.200
Oh, you'll probably do it.

57:54.200 --> 58:00.120
I just want to say how many languages and how many weeks I got killed, Elm closure is

58:00.120 --> 58:01.120
I'm like a magneto.

58:01.120 --> 58:03.120
I'm saying the names in rage.

58:03.120 --> 58:04.120
Come on, Wes.

58:04.120 --> 58:05.120
Wes was right.

58:05.120 --> 58:06.120
Or you know what?

58:06.120 --> 58:07.120
Worse.

58:07.120 --> 58:08.760
Put it to the matrix chat room.

58:08.760 --> 58:10.860
Let them have their, have their way with me.

58:10.860 --> 58:11.860
That came out wrong.

58:11.860 --> 58:12.860
Hey, look at you.

58:12.860 --> 58:14.760
You're giving, you're giving them a, no, you give them a shout out, let them have their

58:14.760 --> 58:15.760
way with you.

58:15.760 --> 58:16.760
They'll love it.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.680
They're just, they're probably just glad you're giving them some attention.

58:18.680 --> 58:19.680
Let's do it.

58:19.680 --> 58:20.680
Matrix chat room.

58:20.680 --> 58:26.160
In fact, if someone can figure out how to get my IRC stuff to matrix, that's not me.

58:26.160 --> 58:27.160
I would be very happy.

58:27.160 --> 58:28.160
There you go.

58:28.160 --> 58:30.120
That's probably not going to happen because we don't have the bridge.

58:30.120 --> 58:35.520
So what about like, I'm just saying pay-per-view torture, Jar Jar, who doesn't want to torture

58:35.520 --> 58:36.520
Jar Jar?

58:36.520 --> 58:37.520
I would love to watch.

58:37.520 --> 58:40.240
I don't know if I want to be involved with the production because you know, it's a lot

58:40.240 --> 58:46.240
of Jar Jar, but if I could watch, maybe have a few beers, some nachos, put it up on the

58:46.240 --> 58:49.840
big screen, you know, now I'm starting to enjoy myself, I'm thinking.

58:49.840 --> 58:54.480
I'm just saying, I mean, you need, let's raise some revenue.

58:54.480 --> 58:55.480
Let's do it.

58:55.480 --> 58:56.480
Let's do it.

58:56.480 --> 58:57.480
In the meantime, where should we send folks?

58:57.480 --> 58:58.480
Alice.dev.

58:58.480 --> 58:59.480
Go check it out.

58:59.480 --> 59:00.480
Go see it.

59:00.480 --> 59:05.240
If you want to follow this here podcast on the Twitter, it's at Coder Radio Show and

59:05.240 --> 59:07.440
the network is at Jupiter Signal.

59:07.440 --> 59:12.680
Of course, there's a big network of shows, some big stuff going on in Linux this week.

59:12.680 --> 59:15.840
You might want to go subscribe to Linux Action News and check out the latest episode for

59:15.840 --> 59:17.160
details on that.

59:17.160 --> 59:19.240
You can always join us live on a Monday.

59:19.240 --> 59:21.440
We do it here at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

59:21.440 --> 59:22.440
Love having you here.

59:22.440 --> 59:27.720
And of course, links to what we talked about today, coder.show slash four, six, fiver.

59:27.720 --> 59:29.360
That's where you'll find our contact form too.

59:29.360 --> 59:30.360
That's a big part of the show.
