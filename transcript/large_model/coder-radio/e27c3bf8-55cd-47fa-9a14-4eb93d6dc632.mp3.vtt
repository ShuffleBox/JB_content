00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 475 for July 18th, 2022.

00:10.000 --> 00:19.840
Oh, hey there, good buddy. Welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:19.840 --> 00:25.200
pragmatic look at the art and the business, the software development, and the world of

00:25.200 --> 00:26.280
technology.

00:26.280 --> 00:30.640
My name is Chris, and joining us right there from his tactical podcasting station, it's

00:30.640 --> 00:33.520
our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

00:33.520 --> 00:39.280
Mama Mia. There's a put in a lean on the castle because I keep losing the princess.

00:39.280 --> 00:43.000
You know, eventually, you gotta take some responsibility there. Like, you just put some

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
security in.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.680
Who do I got to help me? An imaginary mushroom in my brother who says he sees ghosts everywhere.

00:48.680 --> 00:54.920
I'm all alone, and Bowser breathes the fire. Like a pepper.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.860
Just to mention, not to mention, you're constantly out there breaking bricks with your bare hands,

00:58.860 --> 00:59.860
so I can imagine.

00:59.860 --> 01:03.820
Yes, like Apollo, like my Madam Vin Diesel.

01:03.820 --> 01:08.120
I've had a really good week, you know, and I think it's all thanks to your Twitter feed.

01:08.120 --> 01:12.160
I have no recollection. Madam Senator, I don't know.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.600
No, it's really, it's positive. You know, so here I am the other day. In fact, I just

01:15.600 --> 01:18.280
sort of, I captured this and I thought, let's share it on the show because it's just so

01:18.280 --> 01:28.520
great. So a tweet comes out from Mr. Dominic on July 15th at 10 a.m. and it just says simply,

01:28.520 --> 01:32.480
living more or less purely in desktop Linux these days. I'm finding a lot to love, but

01:32.480 --> 01:35.880
do wish the community didn't have to rely so heavily on electron.

01:35.880 --> 01:38.760
And you know, you mentioned elementary OS a little bit there. I thought, oh, this is

01:38.760 --> 01:41.840
great. He's having a great time with Linux.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.960
So I thought, I'll just check in now this morning just to see how things are going.

01:44.960 --> 01:50.600
So I'm sure you've tweeted later. Oh yeah. In fact, the very next tweet on July 15th

01:50.600 --> 01:56.680
at 6 p.m. in the evening, it looks like you're buying a MacBook Pro the very same day. The

01:56.680 --> 02:02.760
day you tweet about how great desktop Linux is, a mere half a day later, you buy a MacBook

02:02.760 --> 02:03.760
Pro.

02:03.760 --> 02:08.280
On the advice of my attorney, I respectfully decline to answer this question as it may

02:08.280 --> 02:10.400
very obviously incriminate me.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.240
So you're supposed to get it tomorrow too.

02:12.240 --> 02:16.680
I already got it. In fact, they screwed up my weekend plans because FedEx was like, yo

02:16.680 --> 02:22.800
dawg, you need to be here to sign for this and we'll be there in three hours. Ding, ding.

02:22.800 --> 02:28.600
There was less than eight hours between the two tweets. What happened in that eight hours?

02:28.600 --> 02:31.280
Well, we can blame Nilay Patel for this one.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.360
Oh, I always do. Was it the beard or what was it?

02:34.360 --> 02:41.080
It was the Verge's posting about a sale on that specific MacBook Pro. And me, I don't

02:41.080 --> 02:47.200
want to dunk too hard on the good folks at Ionic, but their deployment tools, their cloud

02:47.200 --> 02:53.160
deployment solution is not very good. And I had to hand me down my MacBook Air. So I

02:53.160 --> 02:57.720
was like, hmm, now I won't use the iMac out of Pure. Just you're disgusting.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.440
Oh, you're so shameful.

03:00.440 --> 03:05.880
Intel. Oh, oh, yeah, but this is an M1. You didn't go for the M2.

03:05.880 --> 03:11.320
Well, if you look at it, so that's a great point. But if you look at the M2, the M1,

03:11.320 --> 03:18.440
it's really not worth it for what I'm doing. I did, however, this is actually the largest

03:18.440 --> 03:20.880
laptop I've ever purchased for myself.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.160
Yeah, it's 16 inches, it's a big lunch tray.

03:23.160 --> 03:28.240
It's a big boy. It's big and dark and speaking for a pre-show topic.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.320
Beautiful. It's just beautiful.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.880
You know what? Space gray is beautiful.

03:32.880 --> 03:41.240
I have the 16 inch as well with the max CPU in there. And I still don't feel like I've

03:41.240 --> 03:46.200
ever put that thing to its maximum. So I'm sure as far as workload goes, the M1 is fine.

03:46.200 --> 03:51.640
I'm just surprised you weren't drawn, tempted by the maybe the new M2 Air or something like

03:51.640 --> 03:52.640
that.

03:52.640 --> 03:59.440
I was tempted, but I was dissuaded by the price and the 250 bucks off of this was tempting.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.360
Also the screen, I wanted to hear what the hype was about this whatever blah, blah, blah

04:03.360 --> 04:04.360
fancy fancy screen.

04:04.360 --> 04:07.160
Yeah, right. It's got that XDR or whatever laptop display.

04:07.160 --> 04:15.480
It's pretty. It's very nice. So I have not completely betrayed Linux, but doing a little

04:15.480 --> 04:17.120
havesy havesies here.

04:17.120 --> 04:21.800
Yeah. You spend some time with your Linux family, then you sneak off on the weekends

04:21.800 --> 04:23.760
and go spend time with your Mac family.

04:23.760 --> 04:27.720
Well, like every good Republican congressman, I get to the airport, I tap my foot a couple

04:27.720 --> 04:31.720
of times. If you get that joke, you've been listening to a lot of unfiltered several years

04:31.720 --> 04:38.080
ago, like a lot. Or you happen to be a Republican congressman who goes to the airport quite

04:38.080 --> 04:39.080
a bit.

04:39.080 --> 04:43.440
Deep ref. So Richard writes in because he's struggling to with a similar problem only

04:43.440 --> 04:48.240
on the other side of the fence. He says, I recently bought a gaming laptop with a GeForce

04:48.240 --> 04:55.920
RTX 3080 TI to do machine and deep learnings. It came with Windows 11, which means I also

04:55.920 --> 05:01.800
have WSLG. That's WSL with graphical apps. And it was really simple, I got to say, to

05:01.800 --> 05:06.800
get Ubuntu 2204 set up a couple of commands. And I have Firefox and Chrome with audio.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.880
NVIDIA has special instructions for CUDA pass through back to Windows. And I have TensorFlow

05:10.880 --> 05:14.480
set up with the Jupyter Notebooks and the JupyterLab working.

05:14.480 --> 05:19.400
I'm thinking of all of this as I hear you review the HP Dev1 laptop running Linux.

05:19.400 --> 05:24.360
And I wonder if a Windows 11 machine would be a sufficient, if not even better Linux

05:24.360 --> 05:30.560
machine for most people. Not for a Chris type that uses specialized avian podcasting software,

05:30.560 --> 05:35.120
but maybe for like Mike's hypothetical web developer type running Git, Node, Python and

05:35.120 --> 05:39.760
other software in WSL and not ever having to worry about driver issues. Even more so

05:39.760 --> 05:44.320
for a developer at large, maybe a developer in the enterprise where everyone runs the

05:44.320 --> 05:49.160
Microsoft suite of Office and Team Software. I'm even writing this in Linux and Chrome

05:49.160 --> 05:51.240
running under WSL.

05:51.240 --> 05:55.880
So do you think a Windows 11 machine is a viable alternative for devs that need Linux

05:55.880 --> 05:56.880
software?

05:56.880 --> 06:00.800
Yeah, right. I mean, I think we've talked about this before. You know, we're in such

06:00.800 --> 06:05.960
a state with the three major, the three families of the, you know, the major families of desktop

06:05.960 --> 06:11.240
operating systems that they're all good now, right? Mac is good. Mac, if you never want

06:11.240 --> 06:16.040
to charge it and it has infinite battery life and it's beautiful, it's good. Linux, if you

06:16.040 --> 06:22.600
want customability and to have your dev machine very much match your servers in a very likely

06:22.600 --> 06:28.360
way, great. Windows, if you have to do some.NET and do a booting, it's a pain in the

06:28.360 --> 06:29.360
ass.

06:29.360 --> 06:33.880
And I, you know, we could do a couple of shows on WSL and WSL too. It's really good. Like

06:33.880 --> 06:37.760
I know everybody likes to make fun of Windows and the fact that the registry still exists

06:37.760 --> 06:47.640
is terrible, but Windows 11 is fine. Not my cup of tea, but that's purely down to reference.

06:47.640 --> 06:53.520
That's what it's getting to. It's getting to what environment works better for you?

06:53.520 --> 06:58.720
What tooling works better with your workflow? And undoubtedly, probably should have said

06:58.720 --> 07:03.680
this first, what do you have the most experience with? What are you the most comfortable with?

07:03.680 --> 07:07.860
What it means is whatever your answer is to those things, there's just less and less downside

07:07.860 --> 07:13.560
now to whichever one you choose. And it also kind of means all the silly religious wars

07:13.560 --> 07:18.000
that were fought over desktop operating systems in the past have essentially been made irrelevant

07:18.000 --> 07:24.520
as they've all just sort of normalized. Thanks web technology and Linux. And you know, for

07:24.520 --> 07:29.600
some of us, that experience is Linux desktop. Some of it's the Mac, some of it's Windows

07:29.600 --> 07:31.000
and sometimes it's all of them.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Some of us, you know, we swing based on who's the highest bidder that night.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.600
Yeah. Neo Vim's got a big buddy in Aden. He writes in, I don't think Neo Vim gets enough

07:41.600 --> 07:46.520
love. I don't think Vim would be making the changes it is today if Neo Vim hadn't come

07:46.520 --> 07:51.920
along. Why Neo Vim? Well, they cleaned up the code base. It's larger and more distributed

07:51.920 --> 07:56.200
development team is definitely better and it has better defaults and abilities for modern

07:56.200 --> 08:00.120
systems. And now that Vim script nine is out, I'd be interested in your take on the rewriting

08:00.120 --> 08:05.680
of the Vim script engine versus just using Lua await, which is the direction Neo Vim

08:05.680 --> 08:11.680
took. I prefer the Lua choice as it's more widely applicable than Vim script and is going

08:11.680 --> 08:16.480
to have a wider development base in the longterm for the language itself. He's getting deep

08:16.480 --> 08:18.320
into the Vim ecosystem here.

08:18.320 --> 08:22.920
Yeah, that's that's good. I mean, I have not personally ever used Neo Vim in any significant

08:22.920 --> 08:30.560
way. I think I installed it like twice, but yeah, you're probably right that competition,

08:30.560 --> 08:37.360
right? The thing we don't have in American, the telco, for example, makes everybody better.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.200
So Neo Vim comes out, Vim gets better.

08:39.200 --> 08:43.100
Yeah. Yeah. That sort of was my take too. It's like, yeah, it makes sense. I'm not super

08:43.100 --> 08:46.560
passionate about this topic. Don't have many thoughts on it, but the logic checks out.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.000
Can I take a side, but related tangent here?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
You know, those are my favorite.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.960
You know, I decided to tweet that I was interested in looking at Zed. And thank you guys for

08:54.960 --> 09:02.000
all the invite codes, but I only needed one. Still, thank you. And you know what? I feel

09:02.000 --> 09:08.520
like I was concerned that VSCode was going to just butcher the editor field for a while.

09:08.520 --> 09:12.760
I don't know. Zed's pretty cool. I've been trying it out for a couple of days. It's a,

09:12.760 --> 09:17.440
it's definite. One, it feels snappy as hell, probably because it's written in Rust. And

09:17.440 --> 09:21.960
it reminds me a lot of maybe a potential Tex-Mate successor, which I'm not sure if that's what

09:21.960 --> 09:28.200
they're really going for or not. But I'm sorry, I mean Tex-Mate 2. Yes. Don't yell at me.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.320
I don't know. Does anybody who listens to the show actually know what Tex-Mate was?

09:32.320 --> 09:38.280
No? I'm old? Okay, great. In the eight days of the leopard and the snow leopard, it was

09:38.280 --> 09:44.400
the de facto developer editor on Mac. In fact, I'm pretty sure most editors were using Tex-Mate

09:44.400 --> 09:50.760
themes. They just write in packages for a very long time. Yeah. Yeah, Monodevelop used

09:50.760 --> 09:57.000
to. That's a whole different era, man. That was a different time. And you paid 70 bucks

09:57.000 --> 10:06.200
for that, baby. Yeah, you did. And you did it happily. Gary's got a lead that will take

10:06.200 --> 10:11.360
no questions, as my lead only knows one set of rules, and those are the US Air Force rules.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.320
I like to ask why a project of ours was denied or maybe why I'm filling out a spreadsheet

10:15.320 --> 10:20.520
that's listing our commits for the third time. He hates questions. He's a no questions kind

10:20.520 --> 10:26.640
of guy. Just do what I say. Any tips or resources for working with a no questions allowed development

10:26.640 --> 10:32.840
lead? Ooh, that's rough. Yeah, that just sucks, dude. Also, why do you have a spreadsheet

10:32.840 --> 10:38.200
of your commits? Because that's maybe how the lead likes to review them. I don't know.

10:38.200 --> 10:43.340
I mean, git log, it's right. There's nothing worse than when you're taking information

10:43.340 --> 10:48.640
out of one system and just transposing it to another system just so a lead can review

10:48.640 --> 10:54.280
it. Frustrating. Also, if you just like Gary, go on my GitHub. It's just Dominic M like

10:54.280 --> 10:59.440
everything else is except for my Twitter, which is weird. But I have a little terminal

10:59.440 --> 11:05.320
script. It's called Get Pretty Print. Your manager might love it. He may be happy, but

11:05.320 --> 11:10.880
your lead might love it. I don't know. I mean, I've met guys like this. I don't tend to love

11:10.880 --> 11:15.360
working with them because in kind of cray cray, I used to know a guy who would count

11:15.360 --> 11:20.200
the number of commits. So you every and the developers learned real quick. Here's what

11:20.200 --> 11:27.920
you do. One file, one commit every time. Oh, God. Yep. So yeah, that's uh, I don't know,

11:27.920 --> 11:31.440
Gary, you gotta you gotta roll with the punches and maybe see if you can, you know, maybe

11:31.440 --> 11:35.280
it's time for a change. Yeah, I was thinking that he said Air Force and I thought maybe

11:35.280 --> 11:39.920
he can't just easily change. That could be tricky. Right. He might be in. Yeah. Mm hmm.

11:39.920 --> 11:44.200
Mm hmm. I wonder. Keep us posted. Let us know how that goes and what your choices are. And

11:44.200 --> 11:47.880
if anybody has any tips, feel free to boost them in or email them into coder dot show

11:47.880 --> 11:52.600
slash contact. Gosh, that's a bad situation where you got a bad lead and you're kind of

11:52.600 --> 11:57.640
stuck there. I feel for you. Now, speaking of being stuck somewhere, if you're stuck

11:57.640 --> 12:05.600
in London, what I did there, the London meetup is nigh six p.m. local time, August 5th, Jupiter

12:05.600 --> 12:11.360
broadcasting dot com slash meetup for details on that. Alex from self hosted will be there.

12:11.360 --> 12:14.600
There's already one hundred and four attendees on the meetup. It's going to be outdoors.

12:14.600 --> 12:19.420
So that way there's fresh air. That's going to be a hell of an event. I hear Boris Johnson

12:19.420 --> 12:22.760
is coming. So that's going to be a freaking rager. Yeah, he's got a little more free time

12:22.760 --> 12:28.080
now. So he's going to show up. But still, just as much vodka as you'd expect. Now we

12:28.080 --> 12:33.840
do have the initial dates up for our West Coast tour that's coming up. Linode is making

12:33.840 --> 12:40.600
it possible for JB to go down and do a West Coast road tour and get a very special tour

12:40.600 --> 12:45.880
of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. And we'll do a series of meetups in southern

12:45.880 --> 12:52.400
Oregon, in Sacramento, in southern California and in Portland. And those will be although

12:52.400 --> 12:56.760
I don't see the Portland one on there yet. Those meetups are all getting listed at meetup

12:56.760 --> 13:02.440
dot com slash Jupiter broadcasting. And we'd love to we'd love to meet up with you. There

13:02.440 --> 13:06.200
it is. There's the Portland meetup. So we'll have them all there just so you know the dates

13:06.200 --> 13:13.680
just in case you're in the area. We're going to be in southern Oregon on the 20th of September.

13:13.680 --> 13:20.920
These are all September. We'll be in Sacramento on the 23rd and we'll be in the Pasadena area

13:20.920 --> 13:26.520
on the 30th and then we'll be in Portland on October 7th on our way back up. So if you

13:26.520 --> 13:32.000
are on anywhere near those places, do come out and say hi to us. It's it's it's a who

13:32.000 --> 13:35.380
knows who knows how many opportunities we'll have like this. And so it's a great chance.

13:35.380 --> 13:41.080
We also have a matrix group, a West Coast crew matrix group set up where you can chat

13:41.080 --> 13:45.920
with us, get details, coordinate with other people in your area. I'll have a link to the

13:45.920 --> 13:49.560
matrix room for that in the show notes, as well as a link to the meetup page in the show

13:49.560 --> 13:53.760
notes. But if you're in the West Coast area, come out and say holler, come say hi to us.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.920
Maybe we'll have like a cardboard cut out of you, Mike. You know, you're just like standing

13:56.920 --> 14:02.760
there next to me with a big smile or maybe like in your robe with a cigar and a martini,

14:02.760 --> 14:06.280
just like a cardboard cut out version of you. Yeah, that would work. I mean, why don't we

14:06.280 --> 14:10.920
all put our oculus is on and I can just be there. I think that's probably a good plan.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.080
Although I'm not sure the martini glass and the oculus are going to work well together.

14:14.080 --> 14:21.200
Smack, smack, clink, clink. There's only one way to find out above an open laptop, of course.

14:21.200 --> 14:28.120
Too soon, man. Too soon. Linode dot com slash coder. Go there to get one hundred dollars

14:28.120 --> 14:31.880
and 60 day credit on a new account. And it's a great way to support the show while you

14:31.880 --> 14:38.000
get to try something great out. Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting. Should try it

14:38.000 --> 14:41.160
for your next project, maybe the next thing you're building or the next thing you want

14:41.160 --> 14:45.800
to learn about, especially now that Linode has Kali Linux as a deployment option in their

14:45.800 --> 14:50.240
marketplace. It makes it super quick to try something like Kali out and learn a little

14:50.240 --> 14:55.400
bit about cybersecurity, but also test your own systems. It's a real legitimate tool.

14:55.400 --> 15:00.400
I love the upgrades that I have seen land over at Linode over the last couple of years.

15:00.400 --> 15:06.600
The rollout of their MVME storage, the rollout of the AMD epic processors, more features

15:06.600 --> 15:10.560
like database as a service. They started with one database and now they've added multiple

15:10.560 --> 15:15.960
databases. Hello, Postgres. Thank you very much, Linode. If you're a performance hound,

15:15.960 --> 15:19.520
you're going to love Linode. If you're a budget hound, you're going to love Linode. If you're

15:19.520 --> 15:23.000
a hound, you probably don't know what Linode is, but you get what I'm saying. Linode has

15:23.000 --> 15:27.840
been doing this for nearly 19 years. And over that time, they have had to refine it to stay

15:27.840 --> 15:32.500
competitive. They've really built something special here. So that's why they want to give

15:32.500 --> 15:36.480
you one hundred dollars. I think they know that if you try it and compare it to what

15:36.480 --> 15:41.560
else is out there, not only will you see that it's a great service with a beautiful interface,

15:41.560 --> 15:45.280
but it's also a better value than the hyperscalers that want to lock you into their crazy esoteric

15:45.280 --> 15:50.280
platform. And we live in this world now where they're constantly trying to abstract away

15:50.280 --> 15:55.560
all these services into individual things that they can charge you for. Linode is how

15:55.560 --> 15:58.720
we've built everything in the last couple of years because we can go there, we can build

15:58.720 --> 16:02.760
our infrastructure and it runs great. And if we ever need it, and I hear this from the

16:02.760 --> 16:07.000
audience all the time, if you ever need it, Linode has the absolute best service in the

16:07.000 --> 16:12.720
business. Their model is different than the hyperscalers, so they can offer you actual

16:12.720 --> 16:18.640
human support. That really matters. Go try it. Go see why we've been talking about it

16:18.640 --> 16:23.000
and go see why they're still sponsoring because Coder Radio listeners like you are still trying

16:23.000 --> 16:28.680
it out and discovering it's the best out there. It's really great. We've got a whole crew

16:28.680 --> 16:33.640
of Linode users out there now. Go become one of them and get that $100 and support the

16:33.640 --> 16:39.840
show. Linode.com slash Coder.

16:39.840 --> 16:44.000
Let's talk about declarative UIs because I love it when you get declarative and I have

16:44.000 --> 16:49.040
been hearing some buzz around Flutter recently. Brand new app just dropped that I want to

16:49.040 --> 16:52.720
try out. I got declarative on the mind and I think you do too.

16:52.720 --> 16:57.080
I do, I do. I do declare. What's the new app?

16:57.080 --> 16:59.440
Of course you're going to put me on the spot. It was a Bitcoin app, of course.

16:59.440 --> 17:05.320
Of course it was. All right. We should just talk about what declarative UIs are. Basically,

17:05.320 --> 17:13.160
it's back in the olden days of I guess the 90s and early aughts. Actually, I don't know,

17:13.160 --> 17:18.800
for a while. UIs were basically object oriented. You had a button. The whole thing was like

17:18.800 --> 17:25.480
... The metaphor was like, it's an actual button in your car or whatever. Yay. If you're

17:25.480 --> 17:28.640
familiar with skeuomorphism at all, that was a design language that was supposed to make

17:28.640 --> 17:32.560
things look like actual things. We had a lot of leather iOS apps for a long time. It's

17:32.560 --> 17:39.200
very... Wachowski Brothers, Keanu Reeves in 1999, we were having a good time in black

17:39.200 --> 17:40.200
leather.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.200
Yeah.

17:41.200 --> 17:48.200
Now, because the world is in a fallen state, we have multiple screen sizes. If you've ever

17:48.200 --> 17:54.240
done old school iOS development, that becomes increasingly hard. We have declarative UI.

17:54.240 --> 18:00.240
What does that mean? I do declare what my content is and what the data is and how I

18:00.240 --> 18:06.520
expect it to be broadly structured. A lot of this declarative UI stuff will look very

18:06.520 --> 18:13.280
like XML-y, kind of like a document adjacent. Chris, if you'll read us how Flutter explains

18:13.280 --> 18:16.520
because the wizards at Google are like the techno mages. They know.

18:16.520 --> 18:20.360
Yeah, they do. They say that this... They have an introduction, which we will link in

18:20.360 --> 18:24.960
the show notes. They say, frameworks from Win32 to the web to Android and iOS typically

18:24.960 --> 18:30.720
use an imperative style of UI programming. This must be the style you're most familiar

18:30.720 --> 18:37.440
with where you manually construct a full functional UI entity, such as a UI view or equivalent,

18:37.440 --> 18:43.800
and later mutate it using methods and setters when the UI changes. I think I just understood

18:43.800 --> 18:44.920
it less by reading that.

18:44.920 --> 18:49.360
Well, no. That's the old way, right? Let's just say... I'm going to just iOS it up to

18:49.360 --> 18:56.520
torture everybody. All right. Let's say I have Jar Jar view, and then on Jar Jar view,

18:56.520 --> 19:00.080
I have... I think it's... What is it? ViewDidLoad? That might be a view controller, but I'm going

19:00.080 --> 19:04.720
to call it ViewDidLoad. Then I would go Jar Jar view.background equals blah, blah, blah,

19:04.720 --> 19:12.160
color hash. Jar Jar view.title equals blah, blah, blah, my title. Literally, imperatively,

19:12.160 --> 19:17.600
line by line by line, I'm telling the view based on the loading trigger what it should

19:17.600 --> 19:19.940
look like manually.

19:19.940 --> 19:24.440
Then that view is my class Jar Jar view. I go into a view controller or some other type

19:24.440 --> 19:31.280
of container, and I'm like, okay, put the Jar Jar view on view controller did load,

19:31.280 --> 19:34.560
which is actually also called ViewDidLoad because I think I got the view one wrong.

19:34.560 --> 19:40.040
It's been a long time. Back in the day, we would literally denote the pixels, right?

19:40.040 --> 19:46.600
Like 20 pixels from the top, 10 from the left, 10 from the right, and whatever below it.

19:46.600 --> 19:52.120
That's the imperative style. That's... Back in my day, me and Decker Cain were doing that,

19:52.120 --> 19:57.520
but Google, the heroes, they are... I'm going to continue the quote. In order to lighten

19:57.520 --> 20:02.840
the burden on developers from having to program how to transition between various UI states,

20:02.840 --> 20:06.800
it's a me and Mario, but I slipped a little bit there. I turned into a Boo from the quickie

20:06.800 --> 20:11.800
bar. That was not good. By contrast, less developers crowd the current UI state and

20:11.800 --> 20:17.360
leaves the transitioning to the framework. Okay. We basically have... Think of SwiftUI.

20:17.360 --> 20:22.320
I know it's super popular with Ionit audience. Let's just genericize it, right? You have

20:22.320 --> 20:28.040
a view. You lay out roughly what you want. I want a table view. I have this item. Map

20:28.040 --> 20:34.440
it to the properties of this data structure, which could be some sort of object or it could

20:34.440 --> 20:41.120
just be like a hash, whatever. Lay it out. You're not telling it pixels. You're not imperatively

20:41.120 --> 20:46.120
saying do this, this, this, then this. You're giving it the structure and the data that

20:46.120 --> 20:51.920
you want, and it's basically Voltroning itself up. The advantage of this, wide declarative

20:51.920 --> 21:02.520
UI, is that in theory, in theory, it's less manual crappy imperative coding work. Arguable,

21:02.520 --> 21:09.120
but okay. You get something called two-way data binding in most platforms that do this,

21:09.120 --> 21:13.120
which if you're familiar with Angular is like the magical thing where you don't have to

21:13.120 --> 21:16.520
do... Because remember, let's go back to my old iOS app. If we have a text field in

21:16.520 --> 21:22.760
that Jar Jar view and someone types fork you Jar Jar, well, to actually get that back into

21:22.760 --> 21:29.680
the backing data model, I have to go Jar Jar.message equals fork you Jar Jar. With this kind of

21:29.680 --> 21:35.520
thing, it just automatically will do the two-way binding, assuming you know what you're doing

21:35.520 --> 21:40.080
and you're in a platform that does that, which most of them do now.

21:40.080 --> 21:45.960
The problem is the same problem we always have with this kind of stuff. That little

21:45.960 --> 21:51.720
like promise it'll basically look good on all your devices is basically not true. Having

21:51.720 --> 21:57.840
said that, I don't think this is bad at all, but this is like the Java dream that me and

21:57.840 --> 22:03.880
Duke cry every night over as we cuddle in our sun t-shirts, blankets.

22:03.880 --> 22:04.880
There it is.

22:04.880 --> 22:10.840
Write once, run everywhere just doesn't really work. Granted, now that a lot of front-end

22:10.840 --> 22:14.920
development has transitioned to like HTML5, which I don't even think is a term we should

22:14.920 --> 22:21.360
use anymore because that's old. That's 2012 talking. Let's just call it modern web. It's

22:21.360 --> 22:26.280
less about the actual platform you're on and more about the screen size and the screen

22:26.280 --> 22:32.280
aspect ratio and resolution, which I mean, I will say like I'm doing a bit of Angular

22:32.280 --> 22:40.760
backed by Ionic or Ionic or however you want to say that. It's sane. If I put it on an

22:40.760 --> 22:45.880
iPad versus a phone, it looks okay for the most part, but it is a little things you end

22:45.880 --> 22:52.120
up wanting to change it anyway. That's my long winded explanation of why you should

22:52.120 --> 22:56.360
look into declarative UI, but it's partially a lie.

22:56.360 --> 23:02.280
I feel like there's an elephant in the room with this stuff too, and that is you've seen

23:02.280 --> 23:07.640
a lot of apps that come out where the developer, maybe rightfully so, just doesn't want to

23:07.640 --> 23:14.120
invest time or money or resources into UI development. This can be a way where you can

23:14.120 --> 23:21.520
essentially ship minimum viable UI that actually survives platform updates frequently as well,

23:21.520 --> 23:22.520
but not all of them.

23:22.520 --> 23:29.680
So okay, let's get crazy. Let's talk about Swift UI. So for about a year, I've wanted

23:29.680 --> 23:34.240
this little prototype news reading app because I used to be an extremely heavy pocket user

23:34.240 --> 23:38.800
as anybody who's followed me on Twitter for longer than two years will know, but I'm just

23:38.800 --> 23:43.800
less and less inclined to use it. I kind of prototyped something up in Swift UI, just

23:43.800 --> 23:50.960
the UI side and like basic internal data, no server backend yet. And as long as I kept

23:50.960 --> 24:00.840
it to Apple's controls, it was really, really nice. I mean, I kind of get why Marco always

24:00.840 --> 24:07.460
uses Apple's controls now, because you know what? I could like magically implement dark

24:07.460 --> 24:14.800
mode. As long as I followed the HIG. The beautiful thing is I'm the customer for this app, so

24:14.800 --> 24:20.360
there's no one who's like, we need our special branding, special kind of like, God forbid

24:20.360 --> 24:23.560
whatever drawer they want made that doesn't exist in iOS.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.560
Users are the worst part about writing software.

24:25.560 --> 24:31.200
I really think every user who complains about the color blue, and I'm carrying the spoon

24:31.200 --> 24:36.740
from roughly 10 years ago now, should have to work in the God damn terminal.

24:36.740 --> 24:37.760
That's right.

24:37.760 --> 24:43.720
Not warp and not tabby. You know, we're installing Ubuntu 910. I'll give them 910.

24:43.720 --> 24:44.960
No fish shell.

24:44.960 --> 24:50.760
No fish. And I'm going to bust the auto complete on you. I'm going to mess with your Bash RC.

24:50.760 --> 24:57.440
There you go. That'll show them. That'll show them. No, it's really, it's really nice. It's

24:57.440 --> 25:03.440
definitely opinionated. It's got some fee fees. But if you're willing to tolerate its

25:03.440 --> 25:09.280
fee fees, it's a lot like my six year old, honestly. Like he, we play Mario soccer or

25:09.280 --> 25:13.900
Mario strikers, which is, should be called Mario soccer, but it's not. And he believes

25:13.900 --> 25:19.240
the way to win is to nuke me with red shells. And unfortunately that seems to be working.

25:19.240 --> 25:22.360
I hate the shells. I hate the shell. I wish I could turn it off and make it like FIFA

25:22.360 --> 25:28.660
and be like, all right buddy, let's go. I know the challenge with Swift UI in particular

25:28.660 --> 25:32.960
is the minute you have to import UI kit, which I actually have an old blog post when I was

25:32.960 --> 25:38.360
trying this out last year, it works, but Oh baby, you got to wrap that in some Swift UI

25:38.360 --> 25:43.040
goodness. And some of your old school delegate callbacks might be mad at you. Oh, and of

25:43.040 --> 25:47.000
course the biggest problem with Swift UI is the Swift part. Cause it's not objective C.

25:47.000 --> 25:56.400
Yes, I had to get it in. Um, but I would encourage you, I mean, I would suggest, and this really

25:56.400 --> 26:02.640
hurts me every time I do that. If you are a young budding, you know, glamorous or strapping

26:02.640 --> 26:08.560
or whatever wannabe iOS developer, leave the objective seat to the old guys and just pay

26:08.560 --> 26:13.320
us a lot of money to do like the three hours you need to fix your stuff. Go ahead and go

26:13.320 --> 26:20.480
straight into Swift UI. Oh, and it works across Mac OS and, uh, iOS. Oh, and it works on the

26:20.480 --> 26:26.520
watch now, which is super interesting. What's super bad about it is that you're, you need

26:26.520 --> 26:32.120
a beastly laptop because it reloads constantly. They'll solve that for you for a price. Yeah.

26:32.120 --> 26:38.320
$2,500 or 2250. If you listen to me, I Patel, you know, with your kid, you might be able

26:38.320 --> 26:41.400
to get an educational discount, right? Can't, can't you as a parent, I've actually never

26:41.400 --> 26:45.800
tried this myself, but there's educational discounts too. I mean, not to give even more

26:45.800 --> 26:49.840
excuses to buy max, but something to look into. So, you know, the small business discount

26:49.840 --> 26:54.360
used to be really good, but that I think that's the same as the education. It's not like 7%.

26:54.360 --> 26:59.840
Ah, I do know the educational discount has gotten less. The, the literal best buy. We

26:59.840 --> 27:05.120
hate Amazon. We're competing with them. Prime day sale was more than both my business discount

27:05.120 --> 27:09.360
and, uh, yeah, my fiance is actually taking some classes so she could, she has it through

27:09.360 --> 27:15.960
her school. It was about a hundred bucks cheaper just to go at best buys. Like, you know, we

27:15.960 --> 27:21.000
hate Amazon sale, which I'm pretty sure is why they did that. Hey man, works for me.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.240
Yeah. Competition again, here's looking at you Comcast. So you know what I'm surprised

27:26.240 --> 27:32.200
hasn't really come up at all is react. I mean, where does this fit? Because I hate it. Oh,

27:32.200 --> 27:36.000
thank you for life. Yeah. I mean, okay. All right. Well, there you go. No, react native

27:36.000 --> 27:41.600
react native is actually, I would say the pure flood. Okay. So we should, we should

27:41.600 --> 27:45.800
compare the three, the three we put in the doc flutter, Swift UI and react native Swift

27:45.800 --> 27:50.400
UI. I would say it's the most bastard eyes of these declarative UI frameworks right now.

27:50.400 --> 27:54.360
That's partially because they just have a huge transition they've got to make, right?

27:54.360 --> 27:58.520
And you've got to be able to mix your UI kit code in there and UI kits as imperative as

27:58.520 --> 28:05.280
they come. It's view did load bam dot background color. Let's do it. React native. I mean,

28:05.280 --> 28:11.620
comes from react.js, right? It's its own thing. Same with flutter and they're, they're real

28:11.620 --> 28:19.640
deep in this declarative UI stuff where their whole pitch, both them and flutter is to write

28:19.640 --> 28:24.580
your code. You can have some rules for different device sizes, but you know what your data

28:24.580 --> 28:30.480
driven your functionality driven everything. We, we used to call this reactive programming,

28:30.480 --> 28:35.640
which is kind of a different thing too, but most people doing reactive programming, we're

28:35.640 --> 28:41.560
also doing declarative UIs as kind of a byproduct. And they, they kind of go together really

28:41.560 --> 28:46.760
hand in hand, right? Cause it's less about, you know, you manually typing the code and

28:46.760 --> 28:53.320
it's more, um, you know, the object backing your view changes. The view automatically

28:53.320 --> 28:58.520
changes. So yeah, I mean if I would say if you just like have never heard of this concept

28:58.520 --> 29:05.760
before you had to pick one unless you're just that aspiring, you know, iOS developer, I

29:05.760 --> 29:10.960
would say take a peek at flutter or react native first. There are the, the purest implementations

29:10.960 --> 29:11.960
of this.

29:11.960 --> 29:16.440
All right. We have links in the show notes and of course you can always check the back

29:16.440 --> 29:23.680
catalog using tags, keywords. In fact, if you go to notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com,

29:23.680 --> 29:31.640
you can search for our previous coverage on react on Swift and on flutter all there. So

29:31.640 --> 29:36.200
good stuff, especially as I think flutter is, um, I think I'm beginning to change my

29:36.200 --> 29:42.800
mind on flutter. I think we're going to see outside of Google adoption more and more.

29:42.800 --> 29:46.840
You've got several projects happening at canonical. They're really close to their flutter based

29:46.840 --> 29:53.600
installer and there's this Bitcoin lightning wallet that is using flutter specifically

29:53.600 --> 29:57.320
because they want to target iOS, Android, and the desktop.

29:57.320 --> 30:02.480
Yeah. I think from where when we first covered flutter, um, and when actually a couple of

30:02.480 --> 30:06.160
years ago I interviewed the guy at the time who I think like ran flutter or something.

30:06.160 --> 30:11.560
He goes big shot and flutter. It's a, it's become really impressive. I don't know. I'm

30:11.560 --> 30:15.160
still clinging to my angular, which maybe we'll talk about the current state of angular

30:15.160 --> 30:23.040
slash ionic next week or a week after. But that's, uh, partially because I'm doing more

30:23.040 --> 30:42.400
pure webby stuff and dart scares me.

30:42.400 --> 31:05.360
In

31:05.360 --> 31:10.100
multiple different providers that could be across physical systems, virtual systems,

31:10.100 --> 31:11.860
mobile devices.

31:11.860 --> 31:13.560
It's fantastic.

31:13.560 --> 31:16.080
And you'll be impressed with how quick it is to get started.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.140
If you're a business, it'll work with your single sign on provider that includes two

31:19.140 --> 31:20.280
factor.

31:20.280 --> 31:25.140
And for me, the best part is, is every device now is accessible to me when I'm at work,

31:25.140 --> 31:28.820
when I'm on the road, when I'm at a friend's house, like anywhere I can get either with

31:28.820 --> 31:31.040
my mobile device or my laptops.

31:31.040 --> 31:35.520
They all just have tail scale and it's really intelligent about how it routes the traffic.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.660
So you're not just like dumping all your internet traffic into your tail scale network.

31:38.660 --> 31:40.120
It's intelligent about that.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.120
It works with DNS too.

31:41.120 --> 31:45.000
So if you want to throw a DNS machine in your tail scale network, you can start resolving

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
names.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
It has ACL support.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
It has sharing support.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.280
If you want to share one node or maybe just one port on a node with a friend, I do that

31:51.280 --> 31:56.400
with my buddy Alex devices connect so quickly and transparently.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.220
Once it's up, it's always on.

31:58.220 --> 32:02.120
That means it's always available and then you can start building around that.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.800
They're always on VPNs that get up and going in just minutes.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.520
So go try it for yourself for free for up to 20 machines.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.880
Go to tailscale.com slash coder.

32:09.880 --> 32:13.440
You go there, you support the show, you try out one of the best things that's come around

32:13.440 --> 32:16.760
in years and you get it for free up to 20 devices.

32:16.760 --> 32:23.120
That's tailscale.com slash coder.

32:23.120 --> 32:28.000
I wanted to document something that I thought was interesting happening in the tech industry.

32:28.000 --> 32:33.160
Do you remember it was a bit ago, it seems like 10 years ago, thanks to the last couple

32:33.160 --> 32:35.920
of years, but it actually wasn't.

32:35.920 --> 32:43.740
It was 2020 and 2021 when America's greatest cyber hack occurred, SolarWinds software was

32:43.740 --> 32:49.780
compromised and then all of the different government and large institution and enterprises

32:49.780 --> 32:54.320
that use the SolarWinds software, a lot of them got compromised as a result and it turned

32:54.320 --> 32:56.040
out it was some really poor practices.

32:56.040 --> 33:00.560
I believe with the way software updates were being distributed and checked and it was just

33:00.560 --> 33:10.160
this devastating attack and SolarWinds as a brand was essentially nuked from the sky

33:10.160 --> 33:11.560
and just drilled into the ground.

33:11.560 --> 33:12.880
Do you recall all of this?

33:12.880 --> 33:13.880
Oh yeah.

33:13.880 --> 33:22.960
So it's interesting to watch as the tech media begins the process of repairing the brand

33:22.960 --> 33:26.800
and I wanted to capture this so that way our audience could be aware of how this cycle

33:26.800 --> 33:27.800
works.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.840
Here's the general cycle.

33:30.840 --> 33:36.000
Large company and institution in the tech industry becomes well known, well established,

33:36.000 --> 33:44.080
brand equity is high, has a very embarrassing event, goes quiet for a year to two years

33:44.080 --> 33:49.480
and then begins working on a sustained campaign to bring its brand back.

33:49.480 --> 33:55.680
It generally starts with smaller media outlets, local if it's in the business tech cross section

33:55.680 --> 33:58.120
and then it kind of grows out from there.

33:58.120 --> 34:03.560
The headline reads, why SolarWinds just may be one of the most secure software companies

34:03.560 --> 34:09.560
in the tech universe by Jill at SC Media.

34:09.560 --> 34:15.640
I'm guessing SC Media looks like they focus on cyber security and other things.

34:15.640 --> 34:17.640
Yeah, of course.

34:17.640 --> 34:23.440
And she writes her opening sentence, a house gets burglarized, the owners buy a fancy alarm

34:23.440 --> 34:29.840
system, a hurricane knocks a house down, it gets rebuilt, bigger and stronger.

34:29.840 --> 34:33.840
Indeed there are a slew of analogies that could be applied to SolarWinds which just

34:33.840 --> 34:39.760
might now be among the most secure software companies in the tech universe.

34:39.760 --> 34:44.280
And you can kind of probably get a vibe for where it goes from here.

34:44.280 --> 34:48.360
But I'm closing the door on a few business opportunities because SolarWinds is actually

34:48.360 --> 34:55.600
a surprisingly large company and they actually own quite a few sub-brands that are interested

34:55.600 --> 35:01.300
in buying podcast advertising, but it shouldn't be able to work like this.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.380
They screwed up fundamentally.

35:03.380 --> 35:08.880
As a brand they should be dead, it should be sold off, it should be done.

35:08.880 --> 35:13.080
Instead this industry pleasing media is going to write these soft pieces about them because

35:13.080 --> 35:16.000
you know it's just tech, who cares, it doesn't hurt anybody.

35:16.000 --> 35:20.160
And they'll pump the brand and they'll pump the brand until they're back and they're bigger

35:20.160 --> 35:26.120
than ever and they're making billions of dollars again like they didn't make some sort of massive

35:26.120 --> 35:31.520
fundamental mistake that exposed millions of people's private information.

35:31.520 --> 35:35.680
And I find the process frustrating and so I just kind of wanted to document it here

35:35.680 --> 35:40.360
so we could see the cycle in the show so we could all be aware of how they do this and

35:40.360 --> 35:43.720
how their coverage isn't like regular media coverage.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.440
Oh they don't take it seriously.

35:45.440 --> 35:48.360
Right they don't, but I don't think the journalists, if you can call them that, they don't take

35:48.360 --> 35:53.380
it seriously either because it's not life and death stuff, it's not political scandals,

35:53.380 --> 35:54.380
it's tech stuff.

35:54.380 --> 36:00.120
We can even look at some of our, or my, more beloved tech sites and they've all weirdly

36:00.120 --> 36:06.600
turned into like navel-gazing pseudo reporting on the media itself site, which I get, you

36:06.600 --> 36:13.160
know Facebook decided to do crazy crap, but sometimes you just want a good old-fashioned

36:13.160 --> 36:18.520
hey man there's a new laptop out, you know, or like there's this weird gadget.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.160
You know where this is going to take us, right?

36:21.160 --> 36:23.440
My pet peeve.

36:23.440 --> 36:28.520
Large accounting consultancies realizing there's a bunch of little companies in a small metro,

36:28.520 --> 36:34.160
let's call it Tampa, and deciding that they are going to systematically rip that like

36:34.160 --> 36:40.440
basically just cut prices and go into every mid to somewhat large business to put those

36:40.440 --> 36:43.520
companies out of business.

36:43.520 --> 36:52.660
By hiring just massive offshore teams or a couple good coaches and in the past a lot

36:52.660 --> 36:57.600
of H1Bs, but I don't, somehow that seems less and less a thing, or at least maybe in Florida

36:57.600 --> 36:58.600
it's less of a thing.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.600
I don't know.

36:59.600 --> 37:03.520
In New York I used to see it all the time, but it's really like I'm not going to name

37:03.520 --> 37:10.400
names because I used to have a relative that worked at one of these, but these guys need

37:10.400 --> 37:17.160
to see more growth and they can't handle little ratatouille over here having even a piece

37:17.160 --> 37:18.160
of the bread.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.160
Right?

37:19.160 --> 37:20.160
No baguette for you.

37:20.160 --> 37:21.160
Can I fry a little bacon?

37:21.160 --> 37:26.600
It has felt like the last few years there has been decision after decision and policy

37:26.600 --> 37:34.320
after policy or strategy after strategy that is just absolutely crushing the small business.

37:34.320 --> 37:42.800
Like it started with the lockdowns which universally advantaged large companies like your box stores

37:42.800 --> 37:48.360
and disadvantaged small businesses, but we're also seeing it with the supply chain shortages

37:48.360 --> 37:49.620
now.

37:49.620 --> 37:53.120
Large businesses like Amazon and Walmart can actually afford to just fly their own jet

37:53.120 --> 37:57.600
planes and their own boats, but small businesses like the mom and pop hardware store near where

37:57.600 --> 38:01.020
I live can't get access to the same things.

38:01.020 --> 38:04.840
That's not one person or decision disadvantaging them, it's just a series.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.960
It's a structural disadvantage.

38:06.960 --> 38:12.880
On top of that, you have things like Blackwater that's going out and buying up real estate

38:12.880 --> 38:16.080
that's not only taking it from homeowners, but they're also buying up commercial real

38:16.080 --> 38:19.000
estate and offices that now drive the price.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Yes, they're my landlord.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Oh yeah, that's right.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Yes, that's right.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.880
But you get my point.

38:24.880 --> 38:29.120
It seems like this is getting gnawed at from several different directions.

38:29.120 --> 38:33.920
Maybe it's just that there's all of these giant institutions now and because these giant

38:33.920 --> 38:39.480
institutions are so big, they just suck up all of the resources around them.

38:39.480 --> 38:40.480
Well, this is the thing.

38:40.480 --> 38:43.440
This is what the Chinese have right.

38:43.440 --> 38:47.320
It turns out mercantilism was flawed, but fundamentally correct.

38:47.320 --> 38:53.760
There is just a limited amount of resources in a given area, and there is no such thing.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.760
I'll give you an example.

38:55.760 --> 38:59.680
COVID is definitely a part of this too, and I think they were able to use COVID to their

38:59.680 --> 39:00.680
advantage.

39:00.680 --> 39:05.560
There used to be five or six, and let's call it the Tampa Hillsborough County area, moderately

39:05.560 --> 39:13.720
small to medium size, bigger than the Mad Botter, or around that small, businessy, indie

39:13.720 --> 39:17.560
sized dev shops doing dev or dev-adjacent things.

39:17.560 --> 39:22.960
A couple of them put on their hipster glasses and plaid and said they were design shops,

39:22.960 --> 39:23.960
whatever.

39:23.960 --> 39:24.960
Same thing.

39:24.960 --> 39:28.340
Now there's, to my knowledge, three of us left.

39:28.340 --> 39:33.440
That barely counts because one of them just decided to offshore a bunch of their stuff.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.200
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.120
It's me, and I'll plug them source though.

39:37.120 --> 39:43.600
They're good, but they're also half in Australia, I think.

39:43.600 --> 39:48.720
The way the survivors survived was by niching down super hard.

39:48.720 --> 39:55.220
We do the automation stuff with Alice, and we do software for basically enterprise, line

39:55.220 --> 40:02.440
of business, run your business, get your analytics for your internal, whether it's your farm

40:02.440 --> 40:08.560
or you're repairing jet engines, those are basically our two big areas right now.

40:08.560 --> 40:12.000
Or you're a small business, want to automate some of your stuff, integrate multiple services,

40:12.000 --> 40:15.040
go to alice.dev, we can do that for you, very affordably.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.360
The other guys, they focus on cruise ships.

40:17.360 --> 40:19.840
SourceTode, they just all in on cruise ships.

40:19.840 --> 40:26.280
If you are a Russian oligarch and your yacht has not been seized, go talk to Greg over

40:26.280 --> 40:27.280
at SourceTode.

40:27.280 --> 40:32.520
He can hook you up, although I don't think he will, but he could.

40:32.520 --> 40:33.520
This is the thing.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.760
See, this is the thing.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.120
You have them sucking up the resources, right?

40:38.120 --> 40:42.720
You're making it harder and harder for these niche businesses to exist, which means... I

40:42.720 --> 40:48.080
think that's a whole other conversation, actually, but going back to the SolarWinds piece, this

40:48.080 --> 40:51.080
is why I think SolarWinds should just go away.

40:51.080 --> 40:54.840
It should be broken up into all its subsidiaries, all of its individual pieces, and it should

40:54.840 --> 40:58.680
be a dozen small little businesses, and we should be hitting the reset button from time

40:58.680 --> 41:01.760
to time to help keep this ecosystem healthy.

41:01.760 --> 41:07.320
But instead, we have this press coverage and this brand repair that they engage in, and

41:07.320 --> 41:13.720
I'm not even claiming that SC Media or SC Magazine was paid for this or that it's a

41:13.720 --> 41:14.720
native advertisement.

41:14.720 --> 41:20.320
It could be, but I actually think the way the incentive system works, because getting

41:20.320 --> 41:26.280
access to these CEOs and getting connections is what keeps these types of outlets going,

41:26.280 --> 41:28.320
they have to kind of do this stuff.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.600
It's the incentive structure.

41:30.600 --> 41:35.320
In order for them to get somebody at SolarWinds in the future to pick up the phone, they got

41:35.320 --> 41:37.240
to kind of engage in this sort of stuff.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.120
It's not even a malicious thing.

41:39.120 --> 41:45.040
I occasionally write book reviews, and I used to do the Manning Press, the early access

41:45.040 --> 41:46.040
books.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.920
They'd send to Dev, and they'd be like, hey, free book if you want to write a review.

41:48.920 --> 41:49.920
But they're always like PDFs.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.880
I used to get those too back in the old days.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.600
Back in the day, they don't do that anymore.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.000
And I would occasionally review them.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.720
Well, that was a mistake.

41:57.720 --> 42:03.360
It's like every Monday, my email box is deluged with, and it's always like a random crap.

42:03.360 --> 42:04.360
I know.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.800
I was willing to do a few like Linux on topic ones, and then all of a sudden it was just

42:07.800 --> 42:08.800
unbelievable.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.800
It's because, again, the incentive structure.

42:10.800 --> 42:16.160
Okay, so going back to this, and this is why I really think this matters, is the SC media

42:16.160 --> 42:17.760
doesn't even have to be doing anything malicious.

42:17.760 --> 42:24.000
The incentive structure of advertised based media is such that the reader is just not

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
the customer.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.040
So it's not in their interest to get you the most accurate information.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.640
It's not a malicious thing.

42:30.640 --> 42:35.920
The tech industry and the advertisers in that tech ecosystem are the customer.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.200
You guys have heard it a million times.

42:38.200 --> 42:40.840
If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.260
It's true in media too.

42:43.260 --> 42:48.920
And side note, this is why memberships are a big deal for our show.

42:48.920 --> 42:54.240
This is why the boosts are a big deal for our show, because it means our largest customer,

42:54.240 --> 42:58.680
our most important customer as a business, is our audience.

42:58.680 --> 43:03.280
You're our customer that gives us the leeway to work with other advertisers and pick the

43:03.280 --> 43:04.440
right ones.

43:04.440 --> 43:06.120
But it doesn't mean we have to, right?

43:06.120 --> 43:07.920
We have choice in the matter.

43:07.920 --> 43:09.160
That's the difference.

43:09.160 --> 43:11.000
You are the customer.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.960
But in the case of SC media, you're not the customer.

43:12.960 --> 43:17.200
I want to read this email that came into the show a couple hours before the show.

43:17.200 --> 43:23.480
Hello, my name is Monica, and I'm an outreach assistant at ZZB Agency, a small company representing

43:23.480 --> 43:27.760
a handful of real money gambling and betting related clients.

43:27.760 --> 43:31.320
While looking for potential partners for a content marketing campaign, I stumbled upon

43:31.320 --> 43:35.480
Jupiter Broadcasting and found that it would probably be of interest to our partners.

43:35.480 --> 43:42.120
So allow me to ask you, are you open to publishing paid articles with do follow real money gambling

43:42.120 --> 43:44.880
or betting related links in their text on their website?

43:44.880 --> 43:48.280
I think she's saying links that go to the gambling website.

43:48.280 --> 43:53.640
I'm well aware that the fact that this business is in general pretty sensitive and that any

43:53.640 --> 43:58.560
collaboration in this area would involve higher rates than usual if you're open to working

43:58.560 --> 44:00.200
with my partners of this type.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.200
Please let us know.

44:01.200 --> 44:06.360
You're asking price for a paid article with one live link in its body.

44:06.360 --> 44:08.440
Please include the price of creating the article as well.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.760
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

44:10.760 --> 44:15.480
Best regards, Monica came in this morning.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.480
Comes in all the time.

44:16.480 --> 44:18.680
I actually got three this morning to office hours.

44:18.680 --> 44:19.680
It's a brand new show.

44:19.680 --> 44:21.000
I got three like this.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.160
That's like extra shady.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.160
I know.

44:23.160 --> 44:26.880
I just need to pay you a little more and you know, keep it a secret.

44:26.880 --> 44:27.880
Don't say anything.

44:27.880 --> 44:31.680
The implication is don't put like a sponsored content thing under it.

44:31.680 --> 44:32.680
Yeah.

44:32.680 --> 44:33.680
Yeah.

44:33.680 --> 44:37.160
That kind of stuff comes into shows like ours all the time.

44:37.160 --> 44:42.200
And if you weren't the customer, eventually a business has to survive, right?

44:42.200 --> 44:45.760
And eventually you just the right kind of offer, maybe it's not that one, but the right

44:45.760 --> 44:46.760
kind of offer comes in.

44:46.760 --> 44:49.240
It's a little shady, but you're willing to do it because the money's good.

44:49.240 --> 44:52.240
And pretty soon it just becomes a standard practice of business.

44:52.240 --> 44:53.720
It's not even considered immoral anymore.

44:53.720 --> 44:55.260
It's just the business you're doing.

44:55.260 --> 44:58.280
And that is what happens in the tech press.

44:58.280 --> 45:01.180
All of the tech press is like this.

45:01.180 --> 45:02.180
It's bad.

45:02.180 --> 45:03.180
It's all like this.

45:03.180 --> 45:04.180
Right.

45:04.180 --> 45:06.360
And I mean, there's exceptions for sure.

45:06.360 --> 45:10.320
When I say all, I guess I'm really talking about all the big ones, like Mike's favorite,

45:10.320 --> 45:11.880
The Verge, a few others.

45:11.880 --> 45:13.200
Hey, OK, you know what, though?

45:13.200 --> 45:17.680
The Verge at least says when they're doing it, they put that they put that big sponsored

45:17.680 --> 45:18.680
banner.

45:18.680 --> 45:19.680
Right.

45:19.680 --> 45:20.920
And then I just don't click on it.

45:20.920 --> 45:23.760
But that's still there's still that problem.

45:23.760 --> 45:27.480
And I think it's one of the things that our show does not suffer from in some shows that

45:27.480 --> 45:29.520
you and I listen to do suffer from.

45:29.520 --> 45:33.240
There is that problem where if you want to maintain a relationship with individuals in

45:33.240 --> 45:38.560
a company, sources and whatnot, there's just certain things you won't say or there's just

45:38.560 --> 45:42.120
certain things you'll interpret a certain way because.

45:42.120 --> 45:43.600
You're incentivized to do it that way, right?

45:43.600 --> 45:44.600
It's just human nature.

45:44.600 --> 45:45.600
You know what I mean?

45:45.600 --> 45:50.680
And that just, I think, is a really rampant problem in tech because it's it's a close

45:50.680 --> 45:56.040
community and because it's not high stakes compared to other types of news coverage.

45:56.040 --> 45:58.920
I think it allows for those kinds of relationships to form more.

45:58.920 --> 46:04.560
I don't know for sure, but based on my 15 years of kind of watching all of it, I sure

46:04.560 --> 46:09.040
seem to observe observe that kind of behavior in that practice an awful lot to think it's

46:09.040 --> 46:11.560
just at this point pretty widespread.

46:11.560 --> 46:14.640
And so you see it in things like this brand repair campaign.

46:14.640 --> 46:20.880
If you go search SolarWinds on Google News, you would think the largest cyber attack in

46:20.880 --> 46:24.280
US history, which is what it was called over and over and over again, it even has its own.

46:24.280 --> 46:25.660
They gave it a name.

46:25.660 --> 46:32.280
You would think that if you looked on news.google.com for SolarWinds, maybe the largest cyber compromise

46:32.280 --> 46:36.640
that's ever happened in US history might show up.

46:36.640 --> 46:41.680
Instead what you will see is 20 or 30 spin articles that are part of a sustained campaign

46:41.680 --> 46:46.680
that's been going on right up until their earnings are announced in just a few days.

46:46.680 --> 46:53.220
To spin the brand as this recovery brand and Google News just surfaces what everybody's

46:53.220 --> 46:57.440
reporting and that's what you know, all these different little no name outlets are all publishing

46:57.440 --> 47:03.440
and it begins to create this noise and it just all the surfaces now in the feeds and

47:03.440 --> 47:06.520
I thought to be an interesting for us to be able to watch it happen in real time.

47:06.520 --> 47:07.520
That's really all.

47:07.520 --> 47:08.520
We're a little sad.

47:08.520 --> 47:11.400
Yeah, or perhaps could be a little sad.

47:11.400 --> 47:15.000
But at least it's good to know that's how these things go down so we can invent new

47:15.000 --> 47:20.720
thought technologies to process the information like that sounds great.

47:20.720 --> 47:27.080
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

47:27.080 --> 47:30.080
All right, we got some boosts.

47:30.080 --> 47:36.720
Trev dev boosted in with some leet sats 1337 five days ago, Mike, you can use ZSH and a

47:36.720 --> 47:42.960
completion plug in, by the way, like you could spell PG SQL correctly once and then if you

47:42.960 --> 47:46.840
use control E, it'll complete repetitive queries for you automatically.

47:46.840 --> 47:51.360
I mean, sure, these fangled new terminals offer a lots of stuff, but very little for

47:51.360 --> 47:55.680
a dude just trying to write some Python and also please don't feed the animals while visiting

47:55.680 --> 47:56.680
the zoo.

47:56.680 --> 47:57.680
That's right.

47:57.680 --> 48:00.480
Not sure why you would ZSH plug in at love, I guess.

48:00.480 --> 48:02.560
So yeah, probably shouldn't do that.

48:02.560 --> 48:08.240
Tim Apple boosted in with a row of ducks, two thousand two hundred and twenty two sats.

48:08.240 --> 48:09.240
I'm a duck.

48:09.240 --> 48:15.320
The UK duck loaded with talent when you read that letter from Lenart and you said 2014.

48:15.320 --> 48:16.320
I couldn't believe it.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.320
It seemed just like it was the other day.

48:18.320 --> 48:19.320
What a ride.

48:19.320 --> 48:23.320
Also, people are still bitching about system D all these years later.

48:23.320 --> 48:25.120
Microsoft has one thing right, though.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.120
Oh, wait.

48:26.120 --> 48:28.120
Forgot what it was.

48:28.120 --> 48:34.920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

48:34.920 --> 48:41.520
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

48:41.520 --> 48:42.520
regarding V.S.

48:42.520 --> 48:44.920
Code and Microsoft spying on you.

48:44.920 --> 48:47.720
You can just turn off the telemetry.

48:47.720 --> 48:49.280
That's what we do.

48:49.280 --> 48:50.600
Fair.

48:50.600 --> 48:55.320
I actually like I was saying last week and I'm surprised nobody said anything about this.

48:55.320 --> 48:57.960
I leave it on on purposeful.

48:57.960 --> 48:58.960
So you want to rep Linux.

48:58.960 --> 48:59.960
Yeah, that's right.

48:59.960 --> 49:00.960
I want to rep the Linux.

49:00.960 --> 49:03.040
I'm curious if anybody else does that.

49:03.040 --> 49:04.520
But nobody else boosted in.

49:04.520 --> 49:09.240
I do it for edge, actually, but I turn it off on Mac because they don't need to see

49:09.240 --> 49:10.240
that.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.240
There's enough Macs out there.

49:11.240 --> 49:13.000
I'm a closeted Mac.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.840
Bros and Wing boosted in with LeetSats.

49:16.840 --> 49:18.920
Mike and Chris, I have a dream.

49:18.920 --> 49:23.760
I want to be in my car on my hour long commute listening to Jupiter broadcasting when something

49:23.760 --> 49:26.920
interesting is talked about on the show and I have a thought.

49:26.920 --> 49:32.560
I just want to pause the podcast and say into the air, Siri, boost in Dakota Radio, save

49:32.560 --> 49:38.040
blah, blah, blah with X amount of sats without ever having to leave Apple CarPlay.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.040
What do you think?

49:39.040 --> 49:41.880
Is that going to be possible in the future?

49:41.880 --> 49:42.880
I wonder.

49:42.880 --> 49:43.880
I wonder.

49:43.880 --> 49:47.000
No, because aren't sats a proxy for money?

49:47.000 --> 49:52.200
Yes, but Fountain App is an iOS app that already lets you boost in and Castamatic, too.

49:52.200 --> 49:57.600
So there's there's there's podcast apps that let you do it so you don't buy the sats in

49:57.600 --> 49:58.600
the app.

49:58.600 --> 49:59.600
That's, I think.

49:59.600 --> 50:00.800
Oh, OK.

50:00.800 --> 50:03.840
So it's like if you buy like e-bucks or v-bucks, whatever it was, right.

50:03.840 --> 50:08.000
So you like to use something like Strike or Blue Wallet to buy the sats, which are in

50:08.000 --> 50:13.280
iOS, but they've been approved as like Strike is like a legit.

50:13.280 --> 50:14.280
Payments app.

50:14.280 --> 50:15.280
Well, then, yeah, you could probably do it, then.

50:15.280 --> 50:18.800
Yeah, I would think so, because Fountain is working on a CarPlay app.

50:18.800 --> 50:21.520
If the boost features in there, I'm not sure, but that could be pretty neat.

50:21.520 --> 50:25.520
You can mine Bitcoin on the road as one does.

50:25.520 --> 50:29.640
I've thought about that when I'm going down the road in the RV, I've got solar.

50:29.640 --> 50:33.480
I've got a really big generator or alternator in that thing.

50:33.480 --> 50:36.680
I have got more power than I know what to do with when I'm going down the road.

50:36.680 --> 50:37.680
So why not?

50:37.680 --> 50:38.680
Why not?

50:38.680 --> 50:44.760
Sir, license registration officer, I'm so close to a fiftieth of a Bitcoin right now.

50:44.760 --> 50:48.080
Yeah, I don't want to stop now.

50:48.080 --> 50:49.600
I might get some Bitcoin dust.

50:49.600 --> 50:50.600
I don't want to stop.

50:50.600 --> 50:51.600
Oh, man.

50:51.600 --> 50:52.600
All right.

50:52.600 --> 50:54.920
So the Golden Dragon boosted in with another row of ducks.

50:54.920 --> 50:55.920
Thank you very much.

50:55.920 --> 50:56.920
And here's something for your trouble.

50:56.920 --> 50:59.800
So the great show, guys.

50:59.800 --> 51:03.640
How would I go about learning how to set up a hosted service for my own that I can use

51:03.640 --> 51:07.820
outside my home and attach a domain name to it?

51:07.820 --> 51:09.600
You listen to self-hosted.

51:09.600 --> 51:10.600
That's a good start.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.440
I think Golden Dragon probably does.

51:12.440 --> 51:16.680
I was thinking, too, there's some good Leno guides on this.

51:16.680 --> 51:22.260
And what you really want is you get a DNS name, you register your domain name, and then

51:22.260 --> 51:27.320
you get like a guide for Leno that tells you how to point that domain name to your Leno.

51:27.320 --> 51:31.400
There's several ways to do that, including just changing the name servers, actually moving

51:31.400 --> 51:32.400
them and all that.

51:32.400 --> 51:33.400
You'll have to do some reading on that.

51:33.400 --> 51:34.400
Golden Dragon.

51:34.400 --> 51:37.000
And you probably want to put Cloudflare in front of that.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Yeah, absolutely.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
That's what I'm doing these days.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
I'm putting Cloud.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
I'm.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
Yep.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
So that's those Russian bots.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
Don't care.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
They're going to keep hitting every port they can find.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.760
Golden Dragon kept it going with a triple boost, one thousand one hundred and eleven

51:48.760 --> 51:49.760
sats.

51:49.760 --> 51:57.120
He says, which version of Carolina barbecue are you guys into?

51:57.120 --> 52:01.520
I went several years ago and had eastern northern Carolina style was very impressed.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.000
Hold on.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
Hold on.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Yes, there's more than one version.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.740
Oh, my God.

52:06.740 --> 52:08.020
You got to be kidding me.

52:08.020 --> 52:13.760
So them or Emacs or Golden Dragon go, you know, can I say something controversial here?

52:13.760 --> 52:14.760
I don't know for sure.

52:14.760 --> 52:16.680
I'd be willing to try this somehow.

52:16.680 --> 52:22.040
I think the Carolinans go on about their barbecue because they're just far enough away from

52:22.040 --> 52:24.120
Austin to eat real barbecue.

52:24.120 --> 52:28.880
And so they think they've got great barbecue because they've got good sauces.

52:28.880 --> 52:29.960
Right.

52:29.960 --> 52:35.780
But but great Texas barbecue starts with meat that is incredible.

52:35.780 --> 52:43.260
And then they custom design a sauce that complements the specific flavor attributes of that meat.

52:43.260 --> 52:46.360
And the two when they go together, change your life.

52:46.360 --> 52:50.280
And I've been hanging out with the Linux Academy and tell people too much.

52:50.280 --> 52:52.600
I'm telling you, Carolina barbecue is amazing.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.920
No, no, I'm telling you, it might be good.

52:54.920 --> 52:55.920
Right.

52:55.920 --> 52:56.920
I mean, it might be like really good.

52:56.920 --> 52:57.920
Right.

52:57.920 --> 53:02.440
But if you get the right barbecue in Austin, Texas, it will change your life.

53:02.440 --> 53:04.000
It'll change your life.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
You will not.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
You will leave the barbecue place.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
Not.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
Why can't we love them both?

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
Life changing.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
That's right.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
Maybe I'm wrong.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
I'm willing to I'm willing to try it.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
I'm willing to experiment.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.080
I'm willing to sacrifice that if I have to travel to Texas and the Carolinas to put this

53:18.080 --> 53:19.080
to rest.

53:19.080 --> 53:20.080
By God, I will.

53:20.080 --> 53:21.560
You know what I had for dinner yesterday?

53:21.560 --> 53:23.600
Did you have barbecue?

53:23.600 --> 53:26.920
Mango habanero ribs homemade.

53:26.920 --> 53:28.840
They were fantastic.

53:28.840 --> 53:29.840
All off the bone.

53:29.840 --> 53:32.280
Oh, I didn't make them, but they were great.

53:32.280 --> 53:33.280
All right.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.280
All right.

53:34.280 --> 53:37.540
Splurk boosts in with seven hundred and seventy seven sets.

53:37.540 --> 53:38.540
Great podcast.

53:38.540 --> 53:40.240
I really appreciate your perspectives on the industry.

53:40.240 --> 53:45.080
I just wanted to comment on the software conservancy issue we talked about last week, how they're

53:45.080 --> 53:46.840
raising a big stink about GitHub.

53:46.840 --> 53:52.580
It seems to me that the SFC and the FSF are actually anti freedom.

53:52.580 --> 53:56.880
They simply just don't have patience for devs or companies who want to make a living off

53:56.880 --> 53:57.880
GPL code.

53:57.880 --> 54:02.600
They feel more like a religious cult than an altruistic organization.

54:02.600 --> 54:07.440
Microsoft might not be the best open source player, but they are putting money and time

54:07.440 --> 54:14.240
into open source and in my humble opinion, that's way more valuable than naming and shaming.

54:14.240 --> 54:15.240
Wow.

54:15.240 --> 54:20.840
Now, I feel like he's not giving the FSC and the Free Software Foundation credit for everything

54:20.840 --> 54:25.520
they have accomplished, the projects they've supported, the infrastructure they provide.

54:25.520 --> 54:30.280
But I think what Splurk does touch on is the overall vibe that the broader community who

54:30.280 --> 54:33.920
doesn't follow all the nuances and developments is getting.

54:33.920 --> 54:37.600
And I think it's a problem for those organizations because I think it makes them less effective

54:37.600 --> 54:38.600
in messaging.

54:38.600 --> 54:39.600
I don't know.

54:39.600 --> 54:46.220
I'd give them a little more credit that I keep seeing this get back in my day, an easy

54:46.220 --> 54:51.680
way to get a laugh out of really any dev conference or especially Linux oriented ones was to dunk

54:51.680 --> 54:52.680
on Microsoft.

54:52.680 --> 54:58.760
And I feel like just because of how age and time work, many of the people who now run

54:58.760 --> 55:05.480
these organizations have a lot of that old like Microsoft is evil bias.

55:05.480 --> 55:06.920
And I'm kind of like, well, they're all evil, right?

55:06.920 --> 55:08.600
Look at what happened to our beautiful son.

55:08.600 --> 55:09.640
It's dead.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.740
And Red Hat is now joined IBM.

55:11.740 --> 55:18.400
So I, you know, I would rather a little bit of a little bit of demon blood and they survive.

55:18.400 --> 55:22.960
I think what you're touching on there, I could expand on just a bit by saying with IBM buying

55:22.960 --> 55:28.680
Red Hat and the changes we've seen in the tech industry and honestly also listening

55:28.680 --> 55:29.840
to some of those older clips.

55:29.840 --> 55:34.340
So we just recorded the Coderly for our members and we played some old clips, predictions

55:34.340 --> 55:38.560
and whatnot that we made from like 2014 and 15.

55:38.560 --> 55:42.720
And after hearing that, after doing that episode and then reflecting on stuff, I'm like, none

55:42.720 --> 55:45.680
of these companies really hold up over the long time.

55:45.680 --> 55:53.440
Like if anybody gets too brand loyal or really anything that's too centralized eventually

55:53.440 --> 55:54.900
will disappoint you.

55:54.900 --> 55:56.400
That's essentially what it is.

55:56.400 --> 56:03.760
And Linux was a great thing because it's such a decentralized spread out thing that it's

56:03.760 --> 56:08.360
not like one company, there's no Linux CEO, there's no like one company that is running

56:08.360 --> 56:09.360
Linux.

56:09.360 --> 56:11.440
I mean, there's the Linux Foundation now.

56:11.440 --> 56:14.920
Perhaps that'll be a problem at some point as it gets more and more centralized.

56:14.920 --> 56:18.480
But thank you, Slurk, that's some interesting stuff to ponder.

56:18.480 --> 56:20.240
I love the boosts that make us think.

56:20.240 --> 56:21.240
I love all the boosts.

56:21.240 --> 56:22.960
Thank you everybody who does that.

56:22.960 --> 56:26.280
Again, we, of course, we've done this for forever.

56:26.280 --> 56:30.280
We're always, we do this because we enjoy doing the show, we want to make something

56:30.280 --> 56:31.280
for you guys.

56:31.280 --> 56:32.440
So you guys really are our customer.

56:32.440 --> 56:36.400
And what's great about the boosts, what's great about the memberships is it aligns the

56:36.400 --> 56:37.680
business that way too.

56:37.680 --> 56:41.000
So we also, just to wrap it up, we've got a couple of thank you boosts.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.840
200 SATs were streamed from user 6594.

56:44.840 --> 56:49.560
We got an additional 222 SATs from Golden Dragon with an early thanks for the show and

56:49.560 --> 56:52.040
saying that his Python journey has been quite the trip.

56:52.040 --> 56:55.720
Golden Dragon on fire, on fire this week with the boost.

56:55.720 --> 56:59.760
Some of, really a big bulk of the support this week's episode came from Golden Dragon

56:59.760 --> 57:02.320
and he's in the live stream right now too.

57:02.320 --> 57:04.920
So like fist bump Golden Dragon.

57:04.920 --> 57:07.240
He's a coder completist.

57:07.240 --> 57:08.640
He probably has a robe.

57:08.640 --> 57:09.640
You're right.

57:09.640 --> 57:11.160
If he doesn't, he should be first on the list.

57:11.160 --> 57:13.280
He is officially a coder completist.

57:13.280 --> 57:15.760
There we go.

57:15.760 --> 57:18.160
Egon's going to have to share some of the wine.

57:18.160 --> 57:25.080
We also got 475 thank you SATs for a next episode boost coming from KPOVAC in also in

57:25.080 --> 57:26.480
the chat room right now.

57:26.480 --> 57:32.680
And we got a thousand SATs from X thumbs X who says plus one on the coder cocktail swag

57:32.680 --> 57:34.080
idea.

57:34.080 --> 57:36.800
Cocktail glass for the win.

57:36.800 --> 57:37.800
We got to get on that.

57:37.800 --> 57:38.800
We got to get a swag.

57:38.800 --> 57:44.320
We got to get on the other side of it, have a laptop just like sparking out a complete

57:44.320 --> 57:45.320
set.

57:45.320 --> 57:47.800
If you'd like to be a member, we would appreciate it.

57:47.800 --> 57:49.320
It's a great way to support the show.

57:49.320 --> 57:53.440
You get the coderly report that we release once a quarter, a little extra episode and

57:53.440 --> 57:57.320
you get an ad free version of the show and in the future, probably towards the end of

57:57.320 --> 58:03.600
the year or so you'll get a live version if you'd like a totally unedited, unscripted,

58:03.600 --> 58:06.420
whatever, whatever they call it behind the scenes.

58:06.420 --> 58:08.000
That's what I'm looking for.

58:08.000 --> 58:16.120
You can, I advise you though, the drew edited version, much better sound, much better pacing.

58:16.120 --> 58:18.200
Drew does magic really.

58:18.200 --> 58:22.520
So we'll always keep the ad free feed around too so that way members can benefit from that

58:22.520 --> 58:23.620
work he does.

58:23.620 --> 58:27.080
You can sign up at coder QA dot co for that.

58:27.080 --> 58:29.000
Keep an eye out members for the coderly report.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.440
It'll be coming out soon.

58:31.440 --> 58:35.160
We don't have a specific date yet, but cause we just sort of slip it into the work queue

58:35.160 --> 58:37.080
as we have it, but it'll be out soon.

58:37.080 --> 58:40.280
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send the people this week?

58:40.280 --> 58:44.160
Go to Alice.dev if you want some automation goodness.

58:44.160 --> 58:45.160
Who doesn't?

58:45.160 --> 58:46.160
That's right.

58:46.160 --> 58:47.160
That's right.

58:47.160 --> 58:48.160
Alice.dev for that.

58:48.160 --> 58:52.720
You can find the show on Twitter at Coder Radio Show and the whole network where announcements

58:52.720 --> 58:55.080
for all the shows come out and stuffs.

58:55.080 --> 58:56.480
That's at Jupiter signal.

58:56.480 --> 59:00.000
And if you've made it this far, a little pro tip.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.520
We're working on a brand new website.

59:01.520 --> 59:09.680
You've got a designer eye or if you're a Hugo expert, go check out Jupiter broadcasting.net.

59:09.680 --> 59:14.560
It's an MVP right now, but we're working on a static site that's generated by GitHub actions

59:14.560 --> 59:15.560
and then auto publishes.

59:15.560 --> 59:17.600
It's going to be awesome.

59:17.600 --> 59:21.000
We have a matrix room where we're discussing that and we have issues on our GitHub if you'd

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
like to peruse that.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
We'd love your input.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
This is nice.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.240
Thank you.

59:25.240 --> 59:29.000
