00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Coder Radio, episode 409, for April 12th, 2021.

00:07.000 --> 00:19.200
Oh, hey there. This is Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.200 --> 00:23.600
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology. And of course,

00:23.600 --> 00:27.400
this episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru. Cloud Guru now has that cloud playground.

00:27.400 --> 00:33.120
Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud sandboxes on ACG's credit card. Not yours. Get certified, get

00:33.120 --> 00:38.660
hired, get learning at a cloudguru.com. My name is Chris and our very own Florida man

00:38.660 --> 00:43.600
who truly has his heart in New Jersey. It's our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.720
You know, I was going to come in hot with the Jar Jar, but you got me on that one.

00:46.720 --> 00:47.720
I did.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.720
Yeah.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.400
I thought about it today. I thought, you know, you've been in Florida for a few years now,

00:51.400 --> 00:54.840
but you're a Jersey guy through and through, you know?

00:54.840 --> 01:04.180
This is sort of like the Yodas fighting Palpatine. He falls and then inexplicably just gives

01:04.180 --> 01:06.480
up when he was winning the entire time.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.160
Right. You kind of just ended up in Florida, but your heart's still in Jersey. But you

01:10.160 --> 01:14.360
fight the good fight down there, you know? And somebody has to keep count of the Gators

01:14.360 --> 01:15.920
and that's your job.

01:15.920 --> 01:21.200
Can I tell you, I saw a 10-foot Gator just like chilling on somebody's lawn the other

01:21.200 --> 01:24.400
day. I'm like, yeah, this is not a great place to be.

01:24.400 --> 01:28.520
Yeah. When animals can eat your dog, I don't think that's where I want to live. I like

01:28.520 --> 01:29.680
my dog too much.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.680
Or like your kid.

01:30.680 --> 01:34.720
I kind of, but then it's like, but your stomach's in Texas this week. So, you know, I stalk

01:34.720 --> 01:40.920
you on the Twitters like I do. And you tweet this picture of a steak breakfast. Like, what

01:40.920 --> 01:43.060
is this thing? A T-bone you're eating for breakfast?

01:43.060 --> 01:46.680
It was a New York strip. So very on-brand with the New Jersey.

01:46.680 --> 01:51.000
Oh, amazing. Didn't even realize it. Didn't. That's perfect.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.880
So this is, you know, once again, what happens, you fall asleep on YouTube. Inevitably, Jordan

01:56.880 --> 01:58.400
or Michaela Peterson comes on.

01:58.400 --> 02:02.520
Yeah. Okay. I was going to mention that you're tweeting, you're tweeting Jordan Peterson's

02:02.520 --> 02:07.920
daughter. Just picture. I was like, what's going on there? Like, are you being an evil

02:07.920 --> 02:13.080
genius and getting like some of her followers to notice your feed or are you actually trying

02:13.080 --> 02:14.080
to get her attention?

02:14.080 --> 02:26.320
Why not? Indeed. Why not? I think, I don't know. I think she's, uh, she's, she's probably

02:26.320 --> 02:29.440
not on the market, but I'm not sure. Isn't she in Canada? You'd have to move. You'd

02:29.440 --> 02:33.720
have to move. Last I heard they were like, he was like in some sort of weird Russian,

02:33.720 --> 02:39.960
like hospital or he's back now. He's back. Yeah. He's got a new book too. So, you know,

02:39.960 --> 02:45.320
watch out. You get in on this book thing, man, these guys, they can just like go MIA

02:45.320 --> 02:49.320
for like two years and then they've come rolling out with a book and now everybody's talking

02:49.320 --> 02:52.560
about him again because they wrote a book, wrote a book, you know,

02:52.560 --> 02:58.000
I was trying to write a book at one point and I guess I just failed to disappear. Is

02:58.000 --> 03:01.160
that like a necessary step? You just, you gotta, you gotta peace out for a bit. You

03:01.160 --> 03:05.200
gotta be aloof and mysterious, you know? And then if you don't have any strife to write

03:05.200 --> 03:07.520
about, you just got to create a bunch of it.

03:07.520 --> 03:12.400
Well, you could, I could just read the YouTube comments. I mean, there you go. There you

03:12.400 --> 03:20.840
go. Okay. So remember, let's go back in time for a moment. Let's do a robe, Mike. It's

03:20.840 --> 03:26.880
going to be so much fun. Let's do a robe. All right. So I had to make an executive decision

03:26.880 --> 03:34.640
this week. We had to just decide to move forward and at this point in time, cancel the international

03:34.640 --> 03:40.000
robe orders. And I hate to be on air saying that, tried so hard to be able to not have

03:40.000 --> 03:49.340
to say that, but with that loss of this battle, I have committed myself to winning this war.

03:49.340 --> 03:57.320
And I have eaten my humble pie from this experience, learned a lot, and I'm going to be talking

03:57.320 --> 04:02.080
more about what I have figured out. I've done like a whole post-mortem on the whole thing

04:02.080 --> 04:07.880
and realized where the failures lie. And I'm also entertaining several ideas of how to

04:07.880 --> 04:11.680
solve this problem in the future. And I'm going to work towards solving this problem.

04:11.680 --> 04:18.440
And I will, at some point in the future, well, at least I hope, have another batch of robes

04:18.440 --> 04:22.720
that I will then have at that point, figure out all the international stuff. And I will

04:22.720 --> 04:28.360
either be shipping it directly or I will work with an intermediary party like in the EU

04:28.360 --> 04:32.160
to have them act as a local distributor or something. I will figure it out.

04:32.160 --> 04:38.600
What would, what was it, Valerie? Valerie, I can't even remember the unfiltered soundboard.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.600
Which one?

04:39.600 --> 04:43.360
The one with some interesting comments about what to do with the EU.

04:43.360 --> 04:48.400
Oh, yeah. What was her name? Yeah, you're right. Victoria Nuland.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.400
Victoria Nuland. That's

04:49.400 --> 04:55.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah. F the EU was her famous quote. Yeah, I didn't, you know, because we

04:55.080 --> 05:00.400
have like a 30, 40 percent outside the U.S. audience, right? It's a significant demographic

05:00.400 --> 05:06.440
for us. I even got notes from people who said, hey, man, I'll even pay $185 of shipping for

05:06.440 --> 05:11.280
a $65 robe. I just want some cool swag for one of my favorite shows. And when you get

05:11.280 --> 05:14.960
notes like that, you're like, wow, OK, I'm going to figure this out. Like, this is something

05:14.960 --> 05:19.120
I really do want to figure out because I want to have all kinds of cool stuff that we can

05:19.120 --> 05:21.040
ship out, maybe in small quantities and whatnot.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.360
I just ordered my LUP beer stein.

05:23.360 --> 05:28.280
So, yeah, so the beer stein is is sourced through Zazzle and they have international

05:28.280 --> 05:34.360
shipping partners already. Where it got tricky with the robe is we went with something that

05:34.360 --> 05:40.880
no fulfillment center fulfills. Right. If I wanted to do a T-shirt, a cotton T-shirt

05:40.880 --> 05:48.320
or a ball cap, or if I wanted to do a face mask right now or a mug or a mouse pad, I

05:48.320 --> 05:52.960
could source that pretty successfully. And there's a lot of fulfillment places that just

05:52.960 --> 05:58.100
manage international shipping. They have incredibly competitive international shipping rates because

05:58.100 --> 06:02.560
they have facilities in those areas and I could fulfill that. But I didn't really want

06:02.560 --> 06:09.520
to do a cotton T-shirt or a ball cap or a mug for the show because I feel like Coda

06:09.520 --> 06:13.280
Radio being around for a while, like we're kind of beyond that stuff. That's like, you

06:13.280 --> 06:20.160
know, beginners merch. Right. We're a sophisticated podcast now. We've been around for a while,

06:20.160 --> 06:25.640
gone through a few losses, come back from it. You know, we're like we're like that couple

06:25.640 --> 06:29.360
now who like has gotten back together and we know each other's flaws, but we're still

06:29.360 --> 06:32.240
just going to work, make it work because we're not going to find anybody better. And like

06:32.240 --> 06:35.120
we're just now we're like in it forever. And so it's like, you know, you don't want to

06:35.120 --> 06:39.680
have beginner swag, you know, like first relationship stuff. That's embarrassing. Like you want your

06:39.680 --> 06:45.480
more sophisticated grown up stuff now. There's so much here. The fact that you're still determined

06:45.480 --> 06:50.040
to do this is amazing. I've been watching Battlestar Galactica. Let's just take the

06:50.040 --> 06:57.960
new one, not the not the 80s one. And I would say we are more like the exhausted command

06:57.960 --> 07:03.100
structure who has the number of survivors behind. You know, President Rosalind has the

07:03.100 --> 07:07.520
number of survivors on a whiteboard behind her at all time. And that number is not going

07:07.520 --> 07:16.000
up in a positive way. Right. So I think, you know, I mean, we lost Objective C. Mm hmm.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.920
You all fail to admit the glory that is the Phantom Menace. Right. Right. Continue to

07:21.920 --> 07:31.280
insist that Katie is good. And I still cannot change the background on my desktop without

07:31.280 --> 07:38.200
seeing tremendous crashes. Well, listen, all I'm getting from that is you're just encouraging

07:38.200 --> 07:41.040
breeding within the audience. That's what I'm getting from that statement. I don't really

07:41.040 --> 07:45.960
know what to make from that. That's exactly what I'm saying, because then we can be bold.

07:45.960 --> 07:50.860
We can and we can be very progressive. This is our growth strategy. We could indoctrinate

07:50.860 --> 07:56.200
them into the Coder Radio program at an early age. Coder Radio diapers, disposable diapers,

07:56.200 --> 08:01.360
and we could just do it as a subscription. Oh, man. Oh, yeah, man. But diapers, cloths,

08:01.360 --> 08:06.000
any of that stuff, you know, formula, anything that's a consumable with the babies, man,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.560
that's a whole stage of life. That's just prime for making money. You know, anything

08:09.560 --> 08:13.800
like that. You know, also, we ought to launch a whole pregnancy line of clothing of special

08:13.800 --> 08:17.720
swag just for pregnancy. And, you know, there's a lot of dads out there that like something

08:17.720 --> 08:21.360
a little more comfortable, too. So we could have one for the ladies. And like on the stomach,

08:21.360 --> 08:26.640
it just says compiling. Yeah, that'd be great. And then for different stages of the like

08:26.640 --> 08:30.320
different trimesters, different progress loading bars, you know, like a whole it's like a whole

08:30.320 --> 08:34.640
set that you buy that gets bigger and bigger as you're as the progress bar increases. The

08:34.640 --> 08:40.040
shirt actually gets larger. So it's more comfortable as you're further along. I mean, why has nobody

08:40.040 --> 08:45.160
thought of this, man? I'm just saying money on the table. I have seen one that's for dad's

08:45.160 --> 08:50.200
successful process forked or something. Oh, nice. Yeah. You know, you don't really get

08:50.200 --> 08:55.060
into anything if you understand the scope of the task before you start. That's true.

08:55.060 --> 08:59.600
For development, for media creation, whatever. Now I have seen the scope of the task and

08:59.600 --> 09:05.000
I think I see a path forward, but I don't know yet. It's very beginning of my journey.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.640
It's humbling. It's been a long time because I've been doing this for a while. It's been

09:07.640 --> 09:11.720
a long time where something like this has has gotten me. It's vexed me. And I've had

09:11.720 --> 09:16.400
to like, oh, shit, I don't know anything about this. You know, I'll get it, though. I'll

09:16.400 --> 09:22.980
get there eventually. Or you will die trying. I will, man. I will. I'm going to give it

09:22.980 --> 09:27.640
my damned best one way or the other. You know, we have some feedback to get into. I feel

09:27.640 --> 09:32.960
like Chuck here is just poking at you. Chuck writes in just for Mike, according to a new

09:32.960 --> 09:38.960
report that was released, Objective C has slid down the popularity rankings yet again.

09:38.960 --> 09:43.440
And it's pretty bad. This is, of course, Chuck has sent us a link that we'll have in the

09:43.440 --> 09:50.000
show notes. This is according to the Tiobi index for April 2021. And Objective C has

09:50.000 --> 09:54.760
now fallen out of the top 20 most popular programming languages as of April. Why would

09:54.760 --> 10:02.120
this upset me? This proves that somewhere in hiding the square bracket Jedi order that

10:02.120 --> 10:07.280
is Objective C developers has survived. OK, all right. I'm not seeing the connection,

10:07.280 --> 10:12.000
but I'm going to let you have it. You know, it's yours. Well, if there are so many people

10:12.000 --> 10:15.240
reporting that they're doing Objective C, unless they're all quarter radio listeners

10:15.240 --> 10:19.680
who decided it would be, you know, they're doing it like, ironically, drinking a PBR.

10:19.680 --> 10:26.480
That means that somewhere in the and I can only imagine a kinder land. My brothers and

10:26.480 --> 10:30.200
sisters live. They're still going. You're right. You're right. They have not been taken

10:30.200 --> 10:35.120
out by the Swift drones. Well, actually, this might make you feel better. Swift also saw

10:35.120 --> 10:44.600
a decline in popularity. Yeah, it has slid from the 11th place to the 15th place in a

10:44.600 --> 10:51.780
year. Not so good. Meanwhile, the snake, Python, continues to gain popularity and continues

10:51.780 --> 10:55.840
to see particular growth in the data science and artificial intelligence and measuring

10:55.840 --> 10:59.480
machine learning spaces, which I know drives our audience crazy. That seems to be what's

10:59.480 --> 11:04.080
driving a lot of its growth. And Visual Basic and JavaScript essentially stayed put in their

11:04.080 --> 11:11.860
ranks coming in at six and seventh, respectively. Damn it. PHP and ninth and SQL as a language

11:11.860 --> 11:20.560
in 10th place. So apparently writing SQL is more popular than Objective C or Swift.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.360
Well, yeah, that makes sense to me, though, right? Because SQL, you're going to get a

11:23.360 --> 11:29.360
lot of SQL. Yeah. And you're not just writing SQL. You're running SQL and like insert other

11:29.360 --> 11:34.120
language here, right? Yeah. No, that's it. And it's in like so many things. So I mean,

11:34.120 --> 11:38.640
it's the back. It's a back end storage for so much, especially if you're using like an

11:38.640 --> 11:42.360
ORM. And at some point, it's like, you know what? There's just such an there's an inefficiency

11:42.360 --> 11:47.560
here and I need to write just like a custom query. Yeah. We're a stored procedure. Oh,

11:47.560 --> 11:54.080
yeah. Hey, oh, lino.com slash coder. Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards your new

11:54.080 --> 11:59.720
account and go there to support the show. $100 is real money. Let me let me check this.

11:59.720 --> 12:06.520
Who authorized this $100? This can't be real. What's that? It's absolutely real. It's been

12:06.520 --> 12:10.480
real for a while. Uh huh. OK, so they just got to go to lino.com slash counter. Oh, all

12:10.480 --> 12:16.520
right. Well, if you go to lino.com slash coder, you will get a $100 credit to try out lino.

12:16.520 --> 12:21.260
They're my hosting provider. Been using them for a couple of years now. And once it was

12:21.260 --> 12:28.240
the moment to launch JB 3.0 and I realized, holy crap, I'm going to need a lot of infrastructure.

12:28.240 --> 12:32.240
It was just obvious to go with Linode. I wouldn't do it any other way. I am absolutely happy

12:32.240 --> 12:35.220
a couple of years in. And one of the things I think that's great about Linode is they

12:35.220 --> 12:40.100
have a lot of different distros and the various version of those distros to try and use and

12:40.100 --> 12:44.760
deploy. And I find that immensely useful when I'm testing and prototyping stuff. I have

12:44.760 --> 12:50.280
a project that I'm working on right now. Spoiler alert, it's hosting my own mail server. And

12:50.280 --> 12:54.960
I just thought, let's try it out on several different Linode setups and see which which

12:54.960 --> 13:00.100
set of packages, what system, which distro works the best for me. So I just set up a

13:00.100 --> 13:05.080
few different Linodes and tried it on each one. I took a shot kind of like just a racing,

13:05.080 --> 13:09.600
you know, just race to get installed on each one and saw which worked best for me. And

13:09.600 --> 13:13.720
I think that's immensely valuable. That's immensely valuable for me. And it also gives

13:13.720 --> 13:18.440
me a ton of experience to kind of judge where different distros stand up. And I just find

13:18.440 --> 13:23.120
that very, very handy. It's an example of why Linode's pricing structure makes this

13:23.120 --> 13:27.600
kind of stuff really super simple. They're often 35 to 50 percent less than the major

13:27.600 --> 13:34.760
cloud providers like AWS or Azure, while still being faster, better tools, a cleaner, much,

13:34.760 --> 13:40.860
much, much cleaner design. And they're independently owned and they have been since 2003. Years

13:40.860 --> 13:45.040
ago they became their own ISP. Now they have 11 data centers around the world, super fast

13:45.040 --> 13:49.200
interlinks between them, 40 gigabit connections coming to the hypervisors, crazy fast native

13:49.200 --> 13:55.400
SSDs on the machines. It's great. And they back it all up with fantastic customer service.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.920
So you're not going to get stranded. You're not going to get stuck. They're going to work

13:57.920 --> 14:02.520
with you by phone, by ticket, by email, whatever is best for you. Linode's committed to making

14:02.520 --> 14:07.280
that happen. And they're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing. If it

14:07.280 --> 14:11.660
runs on Linux, it runs on Linode. So go try them out. See what I've been talking about

14:11.660 --> 14:16.200
at linode.com slash coder.

14:16.200 --> 14:20.080
Now let's get into just a few more emails because, you know, we get we get some feedback

14:20.080 --> 14:25.140
from time to time. I actually thought we would get roasted for the hate we tossed Android

14:25.140 --> 14:29.880
last week because I was intentionally being a little incendiary and I didn't really get

14:29.880 --> 14:33.600
it. I guess maybe we've scared all those people away. But Jacob wrote in and said the Mac

14:33.600 --> 14:38.740
is garbage. When I started my career over a decade ago, I was developing on an employer

14:38.740 --> 14:44.120
provided MacBook. About two years ago, I switched to developing exclusively in a Linux environment,

14:44.120 --> 14:49.120
usually Kubuntu. My current work recently switched the entire organization to MacBook

14:49.120 --> 14:54.840
only hardware. And coming back to Mac OS after almost a decade of Linux, it feels like the

14:54.840 --> 15:01.080
desktop environment has just stagnated full stop. Multi monitor support is minimal at

15:01.080 --> 15:05.320
best. You still can't span a window across multiple monitors or even disable a monitor

15:05.320 --> 15:11.280
from within the OS. After comparing how capable and stable plasma was for me to the child's

15:11.280 --> 15:16.200
toy that Mac OS desktop environment seems to be. Well, it seems like Mac OS has just

15:16.200 --> 15:20.480
become an afterthought for Apple when compared to how iOS has advanced over the years. And

15:20.480 --> 15:23.840
I know here's a hot take with the M1 chip, but I won't be surprised if we just see a

15:23.840 --> 15:28.360
unification of iOS and Mac OS in the next decade now that it's all in one platform.

15:28.360 --> 15:32.500
My thoughts, Jacob. It's a kid like desktop environment.

15:32.500 --> 15:36.800
It's definitely dated, right? It's obvious that there can really, so they're holding

15:36.800 --> 15:41.620
back because in the hardware side, like the M1 is a true achievement, but it's obvious

15:41.620 --> 15:47.600
that they have something big planned for the next, let's say three to four years. And,

15:47.600 --> 15:53.600
you know, with, uh, they still call it catalyst. No, they gave it a real name, right? Combine.

15:53.600 --> 15:58.480
No, it's not that, but I like that. That's just, that is what it should be called the

15:58.480 --> 16:04.240
mulch mulch, whatever it's, they're going somewhere and they're not ready to go there

16:04.240 --> 16:08.280
yet. And it may well be like a hybrid OS.

16:08.280 --> 16:12.880
I find this conversation silly because I just think Apple has said it clearly Mac OS for

16:12.880 --> 16:17.360
the Mac machines and iOS, and then they'll share the fundamentals. A lot of the fundamental

16:17.360 --> 16:21.400
tech APIs, they're going to share a lot of the fundamental tech stack they're going to

16:21.400 --> 16:24.640
share. And now a lot of the fundamental hardware architecture, but they're going to have a

16:24.640 --> 16:30.920
separate desktop and OS for a mouse and keyboard driven interface versus an iOS driven one.

16:30.920 --> 16:36.440
And this reality cannot ever change until you see full fledged Xcode on iOS because

16:36.440 --> 16:38.280
otherwise you're always going to need a Mac.

16:38.280 --> 16:42.040
I also challenged Jacob here, and I don't know how much I have to virtue signal about

16:42.040 --> 16:45.280
how much I love Linux and how long I've used it. And the fact that I've hosted podcasts

16:45.280 --> 16:48.720
about Linux for 14 years, I don't know if I need to virtue signal all that first, but

16:48.720 --> 16:52.720
I find this complete bullshit that the Mac has stagnated and I'm not Apple's number one

16:52.720 --> 16:57.120
defender when it comes to a Mac environment. But you know, it strikes me that a couple

16:57.120 --> 17:03.120
of releases ago, they completely rewrote their desktop render from OpenGL to Metal, completely

17:03.120 --> 17:08.000
rewrote the whole damn thing and shipped it within one release cycle. Meanwhile, Wayland

17:08.000 --> 17:12.520
has taken like 12 years to even get to the stage it's at right now. So, you know, they

17:12.520 --> 17:14.480
can actually ship when they need to ship.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.320
And then the other thing that I think is pretty remarkable about Apple that you're still seeing

17:17.320 --> 17:20.760
the Linux space flail around like a bunch of idiots that don't know the value of a decent

17:20.760 --> 17:26.080
modern file system is Apple managed to deploy and ship APFS within a super respectable time

17:26.080 --> 17:30.120
window. And not only that, but they managed to convert both their mobile and their desktop

17:30.120 --> 17:35.560
user base and you never heard about mass reports of data loss. I'd like to see a Linux distro

17:35.560 --> 17:39.160
pull that off. And meanwhile, they're struggling to figure out if they should even ship Butter

17:39.160 --> 17:42.760
FS or ZFS. It's a total joke because their file system is just completely something out

17:42.760 --> 17:49.600
of the 80s now. And Apple has completely successfully rolled those things out. And honestly, that's

17:49.600 --> 17:52.960
just scratching the surface. That's not even bringing in the stuff that they've done security

17:52.960 --> 17:56.960
wise that I actually think has held up pretty well over the years. I mean, you can bitch

17:56.960 --> 18:00.120
and moan about gatekeeper all you want, but the implementation seems pretty solid. And

18:00.120 --> 18:03.000
the one thing they haven't done, which everybody said they would, even now that they've gone

18:03.000 --> 18:07.640
to the M1 platform, is they haven't locked that sucker down. You can still turn gatekeeper

18:07.640 --> 18:10.720
off. You can still right click open and say, yeah, I know it's not safe. I want to do it

18:10.720 --> 18:16.200
anyways. They've still left all of the sideloading style ways to get software on a Mac while

18:16.200 --> 18:21.320
bringing default security that is obvious and just works for end users that they don't

18:21.320 --> 18:24.640
have to think about. And I don't really see that in Linux because they're too busy fighting

18:24.640 --> 18:28.440
over snaps and flat packs. And if things should even be sandboxed in the first place, not

18:28.440 --> 18:33.000
to even mention there's no monetization strategy for people that are creating third party applications

18:33.000 --> 18:36.720
for the desktop. And at least people can make money on the Mac and have been doing so for

18:36.720 --> 18:41.120
10, 20 years. And I don't think any of that stuff should just be tossed away because plasma

18:41.120 --> 18:47.440
lets you define your monitors better. And then on the monitors angle, I will say this.

18:47.440 --> 18:51.440
Let me see the Linux box that can currently do what my MacBook is doing because I thought

18:51.440 --> 18:56.000
let's give this a go. The GNOME 40, it sure is a hell of a lot like the Mac now with its

18:56.000 --> 19:00.260
horizontal layout. But let's see how the Mac handles four different resolution monitors

19:00.260 --> 19:04.600
at different types of arrangements and rotations in a different refresh rates and some that

19:04.600 --> 19:09.720
are HDR and some that aren't. Let's see how the Mac handles that. Well, surprise, surprise.

19:09.720 --> 19:13.800
It handles it about a hundred times better than Linux does. And while plasma is the one

19:13.800 --> 19:18.040
exception that handles it just fine, GNOME Shell, even GNOME Shell 40 and all the other

19:18.040 --> 19:22.640
Linux desktop environments lose their crap every time my system reboots or goes to sleep

19:22.640 --> 19:26.800
and all of my monitors and all of their rotations are completely screwed up, hasn't happened

19:26.800 --> 19:30.860
once on the Mac yet. So I don't know what you're saying, Jacob, because to me it seems

19:30.860 --> 19:35.620
like multi-monitors still have a mixed bag unless you have one precarious special setup

19:35.620 --> 19:38.760
with a special right kind of video card and the right graphics card with the right desktop

19:38.760 --> 19:45.880
environment. So the thing is, I think we have to acknowledge where it's weak to acknowledge

19:45.880 --> 19:49.800
that it needs improvement. And then to appreciate the fact why people are not switching over

19:49.800 --> 19:55.680
to it and to appreciate the fact why the advantages of the M1 with a desktop operating system

19:55.680 --> 19:59.880
that solved all of the above issues that I just named right off the top of my head, then

19:59.880 --> 20:03.940
I think it's worth considering these problems so that way we can fix them and make this

20:03.940 --> 20:07.660
more appealing to people that would actually create software that makes it more usable.

20:07.660 --> 20:12.000
But until we get all those things fixed and checked off, the Mac is still a viable platform

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
that has done plenty of progress and we shouldn't discount that. And by the way, that's not

20:16.000 --> 20:20.040
even getting all the advances Windows has done recently with WSL and Windows 10 and

20:20.040 --> 20:24.440
the improvements they've done there. I mean like more than ever, Linux really needs to

20:24.440 --> 20:28.800
get its game up. And I think some distributions like Fedora 34 are doing a fantastic job of

20:28.800 --> 20:31.640
it. I got a little excited there, I apologize.

20:31.640 --> 20:36.240
You did. I would say like if I were like a true Linux advocate, I would be less concerned

20:36.240 --> 20:41.640
with the Mac except on the like, hey, you know, M1 battery life is amazing and more

20:41.640 --> 20:49.440
concerned with the pace at which Windows is getting good at doing the Linuxy stuff is

20:49.440 --> 20:56.040
pretty quick. Yeah. And they seem to be partnering with Canonical and the good folks at SUSE

20:56.040 --> 21:00.840
and basically whoever the hell will take their call. And I don't know, like we're still talking

21:00.840 --> 21:05.120
about file systems and like I think this whole snap versus flat pack thing is a waste of

21:05.120 --> 21:11.320
time. But that's because I have strong and well documented opinions on monetization on

21:11.320 --> 21:16.840
desktop Linux. I don't know. I guess if you're worried about eroding desktop Linux market

21:16.840 --> 21:19.920
share, I would be worried about Windows 10.

21:19.920 --> 21:26.360
And you know what that whole me getting worked up on my soapbox didn't even get into is the

21:26.360 --> 21:33.120
development options that are available and the lack of a coherent development story around

21:33.120 --> 21:37.960
the Linux desktop, unless maybe you go to a distro like elementary OS open to is trying

21:37.960 --> 21:42.960
to do flutter. Right. But that's a very new, very it was just announced like a month ago

21:42.960 --> 21:47.960
for their future applications. Right. And that would be the blessed development platform.

21:47.960 --> 21:54.800
But I, you know, can I throw in a story that we missed? Yeah. Infoworld, which not one

21:54.800 --> 22:01.560
of my favorite sources for reasons that we can discuss a different day, has a article

22:01.560 --> 22:07.320
on the decline of Heroku. You remember Heroku? Oh, yeah. It was a very beautiful, easy deployment

22:07.320 --> 22:14.220
thing if you just knew getting Ruby. It caught my eye because they're now owned by Salesforce.

22:14.220 --> 22:20.640
And I actually personally like Heroku, but things like doku exist and the pricing structure

22:20.640 --> 22:27.020
is just a little nuts if you know how to do anything with like Docker or frankly just

22:27.020 --> 22:33.440
run a server. So one of the co-founders, none of the founders are at Heroku anymore. Adam

22:33.440 --> 22:39.040
Jacob writes on Twitter, Heroku is like a fallen civilization of elves, beautiful, immortal,

22:39.040 --> 22:46.700
beloved by all who encountered it, but still a dead end. That's such a sick burn. You burned.

22:46.700 --> 22:52.440
Now I'm waiting for the Python trolls to write me in. Isn't that kind of like Ruby? Beautiful,

22:52.440 --> 22:58.360
but can't do half the stuff Python can do. The snake wins again. You know what? The snake

22:58.360 --> 23:05.040
always wins. So before I completely close out on my whole rant about my concerns about

23:05.040 --> 23:12.300
the Linux desktop, I say go check out linuxunplugged.com. I think I may have mentioned this on the show,

23:12.300 --> 23:16.760
but I interviewed the Lutris developer and he shared his perspective on a lot of uncomfortable

23:16.760 --> 23:22.720
issues facing Linux desktop software development still. It was an interview I was expecting

23:22.720 --> 23:26.080
to go a different direction and that's the direction it went and I think it tells you

23:26.080 --> 23:30.440
a lot of what people are struggling with from a developer's perspective who are trying to

23:30.440 --> 23:34.020
write software for Linux desktop, not to even mention some of the other basics to make it

23:34.020 --> 23:39.640
a decent workstation still. And I absolutely think if you get the right setup and if you

23:39.640 --> 23:44.280
know what you're doing, like you buy from somebody who makes something that works or

23:44.280 --> 23:47.160
you know how to get it all assembled, it's gonna work just fine. You're gonna have a

23:47.160 --> 23:52.520
good experience, you're gonna have a very powerful workstation. I think all that's true,

23:52.520 --> 23:57.480
but I don't think it's fair to say that the other platforms don't have it going on. Last

23:57.480 --> 24:03.080
but not least, Adrian says that I too have stopped playing with my Android ROMs for quite

24:03.080 --> 24:07.000
a while. I just used to tinker all the time, but now honestly I've been running stock Android

24:07.000 --> 24:13.440
since the pixel line. And he says there isn't really much keeping on Android, but iOS doesn't

24:13.440 --> 24:18.120
even have a file manager yet. So you see, geeks do care about this stuff. They do. They

24:18.120 --> 24:23.200
do care about that nitty-ditty gritty stuff like file systems and file managers. And yes,

24:23.200 --> 24:27.160
it does. It does have a file system and a file manager. You just can't do much with

24:27.160 --> 24:33.040
it because it's typical Apple. It's just very broken. I'm impressed how many apps can integrate

24:33.040 --> 24:39.200
with it, but it's not really a file browser for just like the iPad file system. No, no

24:39.200 --> 24:45.920
it is not. System76.com. They are systems that are born to run Linux over there and

24:45.920 --> 24:49.840
our friends had a special note they wanted me to pass along. This is my prop piece of

24:49.840 --> 24:54.320
paper that I have today and I am just milking it. But on this piece of prop paper, I have

24:54.320 --> 24:58.920
this supposed theoretical note that they have a few things going on. But the thing

24:58.920 --> 25:02.840
that I thought I should let you know about is that new keyboard that's probably going

25:02.840 --> 25:08.400
to be your new keyboard is Ni. We've talked about the System76 launch before and now we're

25:08.400 --> 25:12.880
starting to get some real hints about the launch and what it's going to look like. It

25:12.880 --> 25:17.240
looks like it's going to be a clean milled chassis with individually addressable RGB

25:17.240 --> 25:23.700
LED backlights, which I think is great, hot swap sockets, and a really simple layout to

25:23.700 --> 25:29.080
manage everything for like lighting or custom key bindings and combinations that will be

25:29.080 --> 25:33.640
saved to firmware. Love that because that means it's going to be persistent between

25:33.640 --> 25:38.240
different OS loads and distributions. And they're going to also ship a System76 keyboard

25:38.240 --> 25:42.720
configurator. And of course, the design and the firmware will be open source. They're

25:42.720 --> 25:47.840
starting to tease it right now. We don't have like exact images, but since it's all open

25:47.840 --> 25:53.000
source, you can actually see some of the renderings up on their GitHub page. So go to System76.com

25:53.000 --> 25:58.280
to see the progress on that. And while you're there, go check out the new Thaleo. I think

25:58.280 --> 26:03.520
it's Mira. Mira. Yeah, this the one. That's the one, Mike. Like that thing is the perfect

26:03.520 --> 26:08.280
sized Thaleo for me. Like if I was going to get a Thaleo, that's the one. And it does rise in

26:08.280 --> 26:16.200
CPUs, 128 gigabytes of RAM, and they've meticulously engineered, they tell me, the cooling system

26:16.200 --> 26:21.620
now on that thing. And they have this awesome like exploded diagram of it. I can't imagine

26:21.620 --> 26:27.000
why they did that. It's so rad now. You should go to the go to the page of the Thaleo and

26:27.000 --> 26:32.600
look at their exploded diagram of how they assemble it. It's modular. It's it's rad.

26:32.600 --> 26:36.560
I mean, they really did meticulously engineer it. They've really gone all in on it. Not

26:36.560 --> 26:40.360
to mention, it's just like one of the best looking desktop lines out there ever built.

26:40.360 --> 26:45.520
I mean, they are handcrafted in Denver, right here in the United States, but they just look

26:45.520 --> 26:49.680
so cool. So go to System76.com to see it all. And if you buy something, leave them a note

26:49.680 --> 26:55.000
saying the Coda program sent you. Longtime friends of the program. And I just love working

26:55.000 --> 26:58.800
with them because I think they have they've really nailed this. And this is a problem

26:58.800 --> 27:04.000
that Mike and I talk about all the time. And System76 has a solution for you. It's systems

27:04.000 --> 27:08.560
born to run Linux at System76.com.

27:08.560 --> 27:14.080
Did you see this news that Apple admitted that it keeps iMessage off Android for competitive

27:14.080 --> 27:19.520
reasons completely? Of course. What other? I mean, duh. OK, see, OK, OK. I thought that

27:19.520 --> 27:23.140
might be your take. And I kind of want so I thought maybe you should take that side

27:23.140 --> 27:27.000
of it because I think this is, man, I hate to see this because it's it's one of these

27:27.000 --> 27:31.900
things that tricks consumers. They don't appreciate the ramifications of getting kind of locked

27:31.900 --> 27:36.960
into the iMessage ecosystem. I don't think average users get it. And the key argument

27:36.960 --> 27:43.080
that Apple has is that here is that simply hoarding it over would be it would make it

27:43.080 --> 27:46.400
easier. The reason they don't want to do it. Check this out. This is like actually these

27:46.400 --> 27:50.280
are in court filings for the epic case that came out is because it would make it easier

27:50.280 --> 27:54.720
for parents to put kids on Android. That's they think would be the biggest loss. That

27:54.720 --> 27:58.400
makes a ton of sense to me, right? Because iPhones are expensive and kids are stupid

27:58.400 --> 28:03.760
and break things. Yeah, that's why they should let parents do that. Not to mention family

28:03.760 --> 28:07.600
members. They even had something in-house going for a little while. Eddie Q said in

28:07.600 --> 28:13.160
2013 there were plans to make iMessage for Android that would be fully cross compatible

28:13.160 --> 28:18.600
with the iOS platform and that users of both platforms would be able to exchange messages

28:18.600 --> 28:24.240
seamlessly with each other. That's a direct quote from Eddie Q. Then later on, in a deposition

28:24.240 --> 28:29.320
Craig Federighi said iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone

28:29.320 --> 28:35.200
families giving their kids Android phones. And then Phil Schiller in an email said when

28:35.200 --> 28:40.480
an email wrote in said, hey, iMessage is like the number one reason I can't leave the iPhone.

28:40.480 --> 28:45.320
Why won't you put this on Android? Phil Schiller wrote back, moving iMessage to Android will

28:45.320 --> 28:50.760
hurt us more than it will help us. This email illustrates why. So they got Craig, Eddie

28:50.760 --> 28:56.920
and Phil. All right, this is where Mike becomes evil. I don't understand why this is getting

28:56.920 --> 29:01.160
the play that it's getting. Well, it's because it's them admitting to monopolistic behavior

29:01.160 --> 29:07.840
in one sense, admitting that this creates lock in and then. How? How is it admitting

29:07.840 --> 29:13.880
to monopolistic behavior? If you if you have a product or I guess this is a service, right?

29:13.880 --> 29:20.580
Why would you let your chief competitor interrupt with it if that only serves to lose you customers?

29:20.580 --> 29:25.920
I think you only could really make the argument that they should win. And if they are of such

29:25.920 --> 29:30.440
a market size that it becomes it makes it impossible for anybody else to exist in the

29:30.440 --> 29:33.840
market, which I don't think they are that size. Right. And there's tons of messaging

29:33.840 --> 29:39.320
services now. And so it would be different if you couldn't SMS message an iPhone, right?

29:39.320 --> 29:43.760
If it was like it's iMessage, like, believe it or not, the next old next machines were

29:43.760 --> 29:50.840
like this. You could only email a fellow next user. Amazing. So they learned their lesson.

29:50.840 --> 29:56.320
But it's I don't I don't see this as a big problem. Like I have taken a look for, you

29:56.320 --> 30:01.280
know, because my son decided to smash my phone during FaceTiming grandma, because that's

30:01.280 --> 30:07.360
what we do. Oh, man. And I did not get the accidental damage because that's what I do.

30:07.360 --> 30:13.640
You self insured. Yeah, that's not that good with health insurance either. No, but that's

30:13.640 --> 30:18.080
how you make it sound like it's not a total like financial catastrophe is, oh, no, I just

30:18.080 --> 30:22.480
self insured. Yeah. I mean, I'm selling the iMac Pro if I can find any fool willing to

30:22.480 --> 30:28.080
buy it. I'm actually was looking at a mirror, believe it or not. One of my chief reasons

30:28.080 --> 30:34.040
for being on iMessage is kind of gone. Right. But I was not impressed. Even I was that the

30:34.040 --> 30:39.960
Samsung 21 or something that the Verizon guy was like drooling over. I was like, oh, but

30:39.960 --> 30:44.760
what does it get me with the iPhone? It's like it's two hundred dollars cheaper. I said,

30:44.760 --> 30:49.040
ah, he said, but if you get your if you're getting a plan, then they're both like the

30:49.040 --> 30:53.140
same price. And that's if you don't even care about the privacy ramifications of like having

30:53.140 --> 30:56.600
all of your stuff backed up to Google servers versus Apple servers. All right. And I do

30:56.600 --> 31:01.920
have like like concerns about that because I'm even strongly considering every quarter

31:01.920 --> 31:06.360
moving my business off of Google. Right. It's just that sort of you want to talk about lock

31:06.360 --> 31:12.520
in. That's pain that Google AppSauce. Is that what you're talking about? That Google really

31:12.520 --> 31:18.160
Google Drive. Yeah. Yeah. That's yeah. I'm hooked on. I'm hooked on the mail. I'm hooked

31:18.160 --> 31:25.000
on it, man. Yeah. It's that's that's tough. So I don't know. I mean, what's your angle

31:25.000 --> 31:30.120
on this? Because I think this is like the biggest no story ever. I mean, there's absolutely

31:30.120 --> 31:34.960
a part of me that would love it to just be like a like an open spec. If they would have

31:34.960 --> 31:39.720
open sourced FaceTime like WebOS. Well, remember when Jobs is up on stage and he introduced

31:39.720 --> 31:44.120
FaceTime and he said and tomorrow we're going to the standards bodies and we're going to

31:44.120 --> 31:48.200
open source it. And then, of course, that never happened. Apple got sued. Apple had

31:48.200 --> 31:56.460
to rearchitect FaceTime. And I just I imagine this virtual parallel alternative, whatever

31:56.460 --> 32:01.760
you'll have it reality where Apple actually followed through. And a lot of the stuff like

32:01.760 --> 32:09.400
iMessage and FaceTime and AirPlay is all open source standards that anybody could implement.

32:09.400 --> 32:14.560
And so the Apple ecosystem would just go so much further beyond just iOS devices and Apple

32:14.560 --> 32:20.660
devices. But that reality never panned out. And you're right. I can't come up with a good

32:20.660 --> 32:25.760
justification as to why they should give their competitors something that makes their platform

32:25.760 --> 32:31.960
special. And I think if Google had played their cards right, they would absolutely love

32:31.960 --> 32:35.640
to be in the same position that Apple is with iMessage. I don't think they'd do anything

32:35.640 --> 32:38.920
differently themselves. And now because they're in the underdog position, they'll push for

32:38.920 --> 32:44.820
standards like RCS and perhaps improve the situation for people that aren't on iMessage

32:44.820 --> 32:49.520
that are communicating with iMessage people. Because it sucks. You know, I'm in a couple

32:49.520 --> 32:55.740
of family group chats and the Android users stink the chat up. They really do. It's like

32:55.740 --> 33:02.440
they don't support tap back for just quick replies to comments. They often embed images

33:02.440 --> 33:09.360
weird. They don't support the same reply inline stuff that iMessage does. They crap up the

33:09.360 --> 33:16.600
chat. It's always like, oh, yep. There's cousin Jimmy using the Android device. Messing up

33:16.600 --> 33:22.920
the whole group chat now. So it'd be nice if I didn't have that experience, but I cannot

33:22.920 --> 33:27.040
come up with the compelling argument with the market realities that we have in the market

33:27.040 --> 33:30.680
shares realities that we have as to why Apple should.

33:30.680 --> 33:39.080
I almost feel like the sexier story to come so far of the epic IBM. Oh, my God. Oh, Apple

33:39.080 --> 33:46.440
would not like that. The epic Apple lawsuit is just how premeditated Apple is at controlling

33:46.440 --> 33:50.440
their app server, which I guess we knew. Yeah. But what I didn't know is how long Epic was

33:50.440 --> 33:54.280
planning to do what they did. Yeah. So that's the other side of this that's come out, is

33:54.280 --> 33:59.480
that Epic was playing a bit of a long game themselves and even even hired a firm. Yeah.

33:59.480 --> 34:05.300
Yeah. So according to Apple, Epic hired a PR firm in 2019 to work a media strategy called

34:05.300 --> 34:10.360
Project Liberty aimed at portraying Apple as the bad guy, which is probably where that

34:10.360 --> 34:15.680
video that came from that that 1984 mocking video that they had just right away. Yeah.

34:15.680 --> 34:18.160
And that they were preparing for this all along and that they knew this was they were

34:18.160 --> 34:21.360
going to run a risk with Apple and that they were just kind of getting their ducks in a

34:21.360 --> 34:25.160
line. And this is some of their example that it's premeditated. And that's where we're

34:25.160 --> 34:30.440
at right now. Right. Epic doesn't have to prove that Apple's a monopoly. Epic just has

34:30.440 --> 34:37.320
to make a case that Apple has monopoly like behavior. And it's a pattern of behavior that

34:37.320 --> 34:42.240
would suggest that just like Apple is going to try to make the case that Epic had a pattern

34:42.240 --> 34:47.760
of behavior of preparing for this about specifically trying to violate Apple's policies. And Apple

34:47.760 --> 34:52.600
actually kind of has a solid argument here. First of all, they point out that Epic Games

34:52.600 --> 34:57.980
earned more than 700 million dollars in revenue from the iOS app store and that Fortnite is

34:57.980 --> 35:03.560
distributed on other platforms that take even more commission than they do, that have the

35:03.560 --> 35:09.880
same limitations that the iOS app store does in terms of having your own built in app store.

35:09.880 --> 35:15.440
And they say they can't really be a monopoly like Epic is calling them because they're

35:15.440 --> 35:20.840
not a leader in the gaming market. They really are not super strong in gaming. And so they're

35:20.840 --> 35:25.240
not acting like a monopoly in the games, the gaming market, because they're simply not

35:25.240 --> 35:30.440
one. They wish they were more established in the gaming market. They say Epic's monopoly

35:30.440 --> 35:35.600
maintenance claim is premised on the notion that the antitrust laws preclude Apple from

35:35.600 --> 35:39.880
imposing conditions on license use of its intellectual property and impose on Apple

35:39.880 --> 35:43.940
a duty to deal with Epic on the terms of preferred by Epic to the determined of other developers

35:43.940 --> 35:50.940
and consumers alike. I don't know if you were going to make a call on this one right now,

35:50.940 --> 35:53.040
which way would you call it, Apple or Epic?

35:53.040 --> 35:58.440
Who I think is going to win. Mm hmm. Apple. I do too. I listened in on one of the live

35:58.440 --> 36:05.180
streams of the court preparing to hear the in person trials and they were doing this

36:05.180 --> 36:09.820
test pilot of live streaming these court sessions to the public because of Covid. You couldn't

36:09.820 --> 36:13.680
go to the courthouse to witness them if you wanted to. So they were live streaming them

36:13.680 --> 36:21.320
on YouTube and I and about 20 other people were watching this and and Apple's lawyers

36:21.320 --> 36:26.000
really had their together and they really knew how to talk to the judge with respect

36:26.000 --> 36:32.280
and Epic's lawyers seemed a little sloppy. They had to catch themselves like a couple

36:32.280 --> 36:37.540
of times, didn't refer to the judge properly. But additionally, Apple's lawyers and legal

36:37.540 --> 36:45.780
team were pushing to do this in person in court and Epic's legal team had been pushing

36:45.780 --> 36:51.680
to do it all remote over Zoom and Apple made this case for why why that would be more advantageous

36:51.680 --> 36:56.060
to Epic and I think the judge went with it and the judge ruled that they have to do these

36:56.060 --> 37:01.400
in person in the court. They can have some remote testimony over video if need be, but

37:01.400 --> 37:05.780
they're going to proceed with the in person trial and just listening to like that planning

37:05.780 --> 37:11.220
session for the court case, it really felt like Apple was very confident.

37:11.220 --> 37:17.060
I mean, we're not lawyers, right? But Apple doesn't have to prove anything, right? Apple

37:17.060 --> 37:24.060
can say Epic has to prove that they're a monopoly, which they're really not. By the way, it's

37:24.060 --> 37:27.440
defined right. Listen to Kara Swisher if you ever want a detailed explanation as to why

37:27.440 --> 37:34.500
that is or any of the really the verge or any place like that. And the other thing is

37:34.500 --> 37:39.960
Apple does have a contract with every developer, right? That's the developer agreement, which

37:39.960 --> 37:45.140
Epic was very obviously in breach of. So what Epic has to say is, yes, we breached this

37:45.140 --> 37:52.340
contract, but the contract was illegal because they're a monopoly. Well, that's a big lift.

37:52.340 --> 37:57.620
I mean, I could see a world where for however much money Epic screwed them out of in terms

37:57.620 --> 38:02.620
of the 30% cut or whatever number the cut should have been because I'm not sure if Epic

38:02.620 --> 38:10.220
is at 30 or 15%. Epic may end up paying them damages back, right? It seems like like both

38:10.220 --> 38:16.940
things are true, right? Apple is going to face some sort of regulation for the app store

38:16.940 --> 38:21.860
and it's just going to be industry wide, but they're also going to defeat Epic in this

38:21.860 --> 38:28.580
case. So also, I think it's worth remembering that Google also kicked Fortnite out for doing

38:28.580 --> 38:36.060
these actions. So it's complicated for Epic in that regard. And they're only choosing

38:36.060 --> 38:40.360
to go after Apple because I think that's the case they can win. But Google kind of did

38:40.360 --> 38:46.200
Apple a favor by going along with Apple and kicking them out afterwards. And I think what

38:46.200 --> 38:50.700
regulation does come down, it's going to be a much lighter hand than it would have been

38:50.700 --> 38:55.320
a couple of years ago. And Apple is already making the argument that look, we've done

38:55.320 --> 39:00.780
nothing but lower the rates in the app store. We've only lowered the price. And now developers

39:00.780 --> 39:04.660
that make less than a million dollars have even gotten a bigger break, which is, by the

39:04.660 --> 39:08.340
way, they'll say the majority of developers in the app store.

39:08.340 --> 39:13.020
And if you if you listen to that interview with Kara Swisher and Tim Cook, he went out

39:13.020 --> 39:18.020
of his way to say, I'd even let Parler back in, which, you know, I'm sure he's no fan

39:18.020 --> 39:23.100
of Parler, right? But which is not going to happen. Yeah. Well, no, but why? He's defending

39:23.100 --> 39:27.580
his flank to say we don't pick and choose based on whether we like the people, right?

39:27.580 --> 39:32.020
It's we have more terms. You follow our terms. You can be in our store. Mazel tov. There you

39:32.020 --> 39:37.420
go. If you're really curious about this or if you're like a little anti Apple, read the

39:37.420 --> 39:43.020
emails that were disclosed from the epic side about them plotting this entire campaign.

39:43.020 --> 39:45.620
They do not come out, come off as freedom fighters here.

39:45.620 --> 39:51.020
OK, now let's hit the pause button and alternate reality mode here for a second. But think

39:51.020 --> 39:54.420
about all of the shit we have bitched about when it comes to the app store and all of

39:54.420 --> 40:00.460
the clear abuses of power that Apple has clearly flexed over the years when it comes to independent

40:00.460 --> 40:04.780
developers, developers, especially even you. Wouldn't it kind of be nice for somebody to

40:04.780 --> 40:08.180
come along and punch him in the nose and get them to clean this act up and maybe even make

40:08.180 --> 40:13.820
it possible? Like, imagine just for a moment, Mike, for just a moment, if even one one outcome

40:13.820 --> 40:19.320
of this is that Apple was mandated to allow third party payment processing so you could

40:19.320 --> 40:23.860
use Stripe or something for subscriptions or whatever, it would be better for developers

40:23.860 --> 40:27.740
and users around the world. Yeah, I mean, there's going to be they're not going to.

40:27.740 --> 40:31.700
I it's not going to happen. I mean, this alternative reality, though, it's not good. I feel like

40:31.700 --> 40:37.380
I feel like that's the right. But that's the red line for them. You know, like my my position

40:37.380 --> 40:41.820
on all of this apps or stuff has mellowed out quite a bit, which is ironic because I

40:41.820 --> 40:46.100
think other people have become more militant as I'm kind of like, well, well, I think what

40:46.100 --> 40:50.500
it is is you have resigned yourself to the reality while others are now getting their

40:50.500 --> 40:55.140
livelihood is now being endangered. And so now they're making a noise where I think DHH

40:55.140 --> 41:01.020
is just like utter shock with how the App Store operates was. Yeah. Amazing. Right.

41:01.020 --> 41:04.980
Well, they came for you first because honestly, like, you know, if they go for somebody like

41:04.980 --> 41:08.380
DHH, that's going to get a lot more attention. But they come for you like we bitch about

41:08.380 --> 41:12.300
it here on the podcast. Right. But they they still get away with it. But there are there

41:12.300 --> 41:16.300
are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of me, like, you know, relatively

41:16.300 --> 41:22.540
small software companies that I mean, I should be fair. I currently do not sell any unless

41:22.540 --> 41:28.080
I'm maybe publishing like the Fleet Week app for for the Navy. So but I do not sell any

41:28.080 --> 41:35.460
of my own apps on the on the App Store right now. I'm not saying I never would, but we

41:35.460 --> 41:39.260
talked about this a million times. I don't want to rehash it too much, but I constantly

41:39.260 --> 41:43.780
have this problem where I look at my iPad Pro, I'm like, this is an incredible device

41:43.780 --> 41:47.980
that I would love to build software for. But then I look at the investment that would be

41:47.980 --> 41:54.300
required. And I read the, you know, the annually updated Apple developer, you know, not just

41:54.300 --> 41:58.700
the human interface guidelines, but the actual rules. And there's always like one or two

41:58.700 --> 42:04.100
that I'm like, is this close? And there's it's, it's getting better, right? They're

42:04.100 --> 42:08.280
liberalizing some where you can like ask them questions to a point. But it's it's it's a

42:08.280 --> 42:14.160
risk to invest all this capital and energy into developing something on a platform where

42:14.160 --> 42:18.460
they can just say no, you nailed it. That's exactly what the situation is. And so that's

42:18.460 --> 42:25.340
why I just think like, imagine a world where third party payment or third party apps, some

42:25.340 --> 42:29.500
sort of sideloading, like like it is on the Mac with gatekeeper, you could still have

42:29.500 --> 42:34.660
where developers, they what's it called? What's it called on the Mac when you sign it? Notarization?

42:34.660 --> 42:39.100
Yeah, no, yeah. Why couldn't they just use the notarization system that they have for

42:39.100 --> 42:44.420
the Mac on the iPhone? Obviously, not by default, right? They're trying to get a cut, right?

42:44.420 --> 42:50.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I just I know we should leave alternate reality world because

42:50.060 --> 42:54.140
it's just it's just a waste of energy. But I acknowledge that I think Apple's gonna win

42:54.140 --> 42:59.200
this thing. And I think Apple has the stronger case. And I think epic is from all all evidence

42:59.200 --> 43:04.500
we can see at this point in the public is likely in the wrong here. They knew the rules.

43:04.500 --> 43:09.020
But man, man, oh, man, if I could just have them win this so that we some of these things

43:09.020 --> 43:12.580
could be improved. I think it would address the primary issues people really have with

43:12.580 --> 43:16.260
the iOS platform. Well, the stronger case and where I think we'll actually see some

43:16.260 --> 43:20.860
sort of regulation and then we should jump off of this is basically the Spotify case.

43:20.860 --> 43:25.220
Oh, yeah. Right. And Apple's already backed down quite a bit on that because Apple is

43:25.220 --> 43:32.060
both the platform vendor and a direct application competitor. Apple does not make nor please

43:32.060 --> 43:37.340
should you try any video games, right? So they are not, you know, they're just as far

43:37.340 --> 43:41.460
as epic is concerned, they are indeed a store. And if you know anything about how selling

43:41.460 --> 43:46.060
software used to work, the deal with Apple is far better.

43:46.060 --> 43:50.580
Data dog.com slash coder radio. Now let's let's talk about data dog. This is a tool

43:50.580 --> 43:55.180
you should be using to help visualize your infrastructure analyze code level performance

43:55.180 --> 44:00.620
across your entire environment and troubleshoot issues faster than ever with data talk and

44:00.620 --> 44:05.020
communicate them with their beautiful dashboards. Go look at their dashboards, go look at them.

44:05.020 --> 44:09.220
Data dog.com slash Coder Radio just to go see these things. And data dog has this feature

44:09.220 --> 44:14.780
called continuous profiler. It automatically collects all the metrics from all the places

44:14.780 --> 44:18.520
your applications, your servers, your servers in production, your servers and testing like

44:18.520 --> 44:22.940
you can make it all clear and delineated. And then you can analyze data and results

44:22.940 --> 44:27.580
quickly with minimal overhead and get a unified picture of your environment by correlating

44:27.580 --> 44:32.260
code performance metrics with other monitoring data across your entire infrastructure in

45:11.780 --> 45:18.340
What do you think about talking a little history here on the show? You know, COBOL, we all

45:18.340 --> 45:25.100
know COBOL, the common business oriented language. It's been around since 1959 in one form or

45:25.100 --> 45:30.700
another, so clearly older than I. And it's actually just recently got a little bit of

45:30.700 --> 45:40.100
love from IBM. IBM has released version 1.1 of their COBOL suite of tools for Linux and

45:40.100 --> 45:48.020
the x86 environment. And they talk about like maintaining interoperability between some

45:48.020 --> 45:54.660
of their large mainframe platforms to legacy software never dies. It never dies. In fact,

45:54.660 --> 45:59.620
this set me down a whole rabbit hole. I was actually kind of really getting into this

45:59.620 --> 46:06.700
for a bit because, you know, COBOL, it runs so much, almost like still almost all of the

46:06.700 --> 46:12.900
major ATM networks run COBOL. Tons of government systems still run COBOL. For you as news for

46:12.900 --> 46:18.140
a little while, a lot of the COVID-19 cases and deaths and positives and negatives and

46:18.140 --> 46:24.100
all of that is being tallied on systems where the code is written in COBOL today. Oh, yes.

46:24.100 --> 46:28.660
It's still getting actively used, right? And it just blows my mind that this thing's been

46:28.660 --> 46:34.020
around since 59 and is still you can still get jobs for it. And it's it's just been recently

46:34.020 --> 46:40.060
updated and ported to Linux for the x86 environment and with with new features added just like

46:40.060 --> 46:45.940
last week. Just nuts. I mean, I'm pretty sure the Florida unemployment systems written in

46:45.940 --> 46:51.140
COBOL because they famously couldn't find vendors to to help them. Maybe it was for

46:51.140 --> 46:55.860
them. But well, so this is the trick now, right? Is it's becoming it's becoming a lack

46:55.860 --> 47:02.180
of developers to fulfill IBM's long, long promise of like these these large systems

47:02.180 --> 47:08.300
like the system 360 that launched in 1964. IBM pitched it as a promise of if you develop

47:08.300 --> 47:14.660
software for this today in 1964, you will run it in 40 years. And they did actually

47:14.660 --> 47:21.620
deliver on that. I found this awesome clip that IBM made a few years ago, I think like

47:21.620 --> 47:27.400
back in 2004, even they made this this hilarious, cheesy video about how awesome how awesome

47:27.400 --> 47:32.060
their mainframes are for inclusion into the Computer History Museum. And I just grabbed

47:32.060 --> 47:33.460
like a moment of it for us.

47:33.460 --> 47:39.780
You know, the 360 and the mainframe didn't just revolutionize the IT industry. With the

47:39.780 --> 47:45.500
360, the modern software era was born. You didn't have package software before the 360.

47:45.500 --> 47:50.860
Our computers enabled NASA to land the man on the moon in 1969. The modern financial

47:50.860 --> 47:55.980
services industry was built around the mainframe. And even today's airline reservation systems

47:55.980 --> 47:59.620
have antecedents going all the way back to the 1960s.

47:59.620 --> 48:06.020
We've done a lot of things based on 360 technology. Some of the programs we originally created

48:06.020 --> 48:07.980
back in 65 are still running today.

48:07.980 --> 48:19.980
The mainframe is here to stay. It's a technology we all grew up with and we know we're comfortable

48:19.980 --> 48:24.020
with. If I look at all the different technologies out there and what we can achieve and what

48:24.020 --> 48:29.460
we have achieved on the mainframe, it's the most reliable technology that we have today.

48:29.460 --> 48:31.940
Yeah, it's here to stay.

48:31.940 --> 48:32.940
Here to stay.

48:32.940 --> 48:37.100
That was pretty good. And then I got one more really short one. This is IBM's technology

48:37.100 --> 48:43.780
chief back in 2004 on the 40th anniversary of the launch of the IBM System 360, talking

48:43.780 --> 48:50.180
about how long-term compatibility was a key promise of what IBM was delivering. And of

48:50.180 --> 48:53.020
course they delivered some of that using, of course, Coolball.

48:53.020 --> 49:00.700
As I look back on those days, while the making of a revolutionary product was one thing,

49:00.700 --> 49:09.980
what was huge was that System 360 was a platform for genuine innovation. It was a defining

49:09.980 --> 49:18.900
moment in the information technology industry. You could say that the System 360 was innovating

49:18.900 --> 49:25.700
by anticipating the future, an information technology platform that would be compatible

49:25.700 --> 49:35.740
with systems yet to come. IBM made the promise then of computing that's always there, computing

49:35.740 --> 49:45.820
that offers what our industry has affectionately come to call the illities, availability, scalability,

49:45.820 --> 49:55.300
adaptability, flexibility, manageability. And the System 360 family was the foundation

49:55.300 --> 50:01.700
of those promises, promises IBM still extends today.

50:01.700 --> 50:05.380
If they can find developers for it. So maybe it's time to go write Cobalt, kids, because

50:05.380 --> 50:09.620
they're still looking for people to write applications.

50:09.620 --> 50:10.880
It gives me hope.

50:10.880 --> 50:13.620
We have one last email, but maybe we should save this for the Coderly.

50:13.620 --> 50:14.620
Let's save it.

50:14.620 --> 50:19.300
Bonus Coderly email. That'd be kind of fun. We haven't done an email in the Coderly before.

50:19.300 --> 50:24.140
So that is recorded every quarter and we release that for our members. It's a way to support

50:24.140 --> 50:29.980
the show. We have a membership program at CoderQA.co and you become a member and you

50:29.980 --> 50:34.940
support the show. You get a limited ad feed as a thank you and that Coderly report. Did

50:34.940 --> 50:40.260
I say that right? Anyways, we're recording one very soon, very, very soon. So it'll be

50:40.260 --> 50:44.600
in your members feed in just a few short days. So if you're not a member yet, you can sign

50:44.600 --> 50:49.300
up now at CoderQA.co and then you'll get that when we release it and we thank everybody

50:49.300 --> 50:50.920
who is a member.

50:50.920 --> 50:54.300
Go get yourself some Mike on Twitter. He's at Dumanuco and his company's at the Mad

50:54.300 --> 50:57.540
Botter Inc over there. Anything you want to plug this week, Mr. Dominic?

50:57.540 --> 51:02.100
No, if you need any Python or dare I say Objective-C development done, let me know.

51:02.100 --> 51:07.020
There you go. Nice. I'm at Chris Lass on the Twitter. The podcast network is at Jupiter

51:07.020 --> 51:11.940
Signal and the show itself is at Coder Radio Show. Links to some of the things we talked

51:11.940 --> 51:17.820
about today and that entire video for that IBM mainframe party at the Computer History

51:17.820 --> 51:23.720
Museum. That's linked in the show notes too. That's at Coder.show slash 409. You also find

51:23.720 --> 51:29.380
our contact form over there as well as our RSS feed. And I'd encourage you, I'd personally

51:29.380 --> 51:33.580
like to invite you to join us to the, to the live stream at the Coder happy hour, the live

51:33.580 --> 51:39.060
stream, Coder happy hour live stream, Monday 5 PM, 8 PM Pacific at jblive.tv. Did you get

51:39.060 --> 51:43.740
it? It's a live stream and you're invited. It's the Coder happy hour live stream. I've

51:43.740 --> 51:48.540
got to get it right. And I would like you to be there. It's the Coder radio happy hour

51:48.540 --> 51:54.980
live stream. I got it. Now you got to go cause I worked so hard for it or, or just download.

51:54.980 --> 52:15.620
See you next week.
