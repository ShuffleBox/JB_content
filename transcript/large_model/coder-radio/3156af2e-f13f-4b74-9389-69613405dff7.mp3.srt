00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 405 for September 26, 2022.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,160
Hello, friends, and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,920
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,800
From Sacramento, California, my name is Chris, and joining us from his podcasting base, it's

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,120
our host, Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
Hello, Chris.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,120
How are you in sunny CA?

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
Warm.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
It is warm here.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,760
It is like in the mid-90s, you know?

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,960
So I'm getting like a little last little surge of summer, but we're doing all right because

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,760
listener Jeff hooked us up with a great little spot and some power hookups, so I got the

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,240
air conditioners going.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,920
I really can't complain.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,720
You know, it's pretty comfortable as far as mid-90s go.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
And it's been a good trip.

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,240
We've already done two of the meetups, so we're halfway done, and that's been really

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
exciting.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,040
They've gone well.

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,040
At one of them, I got there early and managed to get a whole dinner, too, which was great.

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,300
You know, a little barbecue, and we're doing breweries the whole way, so there's always

23
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,300
great drinks.

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,300
Nice.

25
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,300
Yeah.

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,300
Yeah.

27
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,480
Our next meetup is this Friday as we release 6 p.m. at the Congregation Ale House in Pasadena,

28
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,920
which will be just after our JPL meetup, so there's just so much going on.

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,800
I have been running nonstop.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,240
I'm talking like getting up at 3.45 a.m., 3.30 a.m., 6 a.m. since we got off the air

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,720
last week.

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,080
It's been a mad dash.

33
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,520
Vacation it is not, but guess what?

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,480
We did get an email into the show, and it's a little spicy, so why don't we just kick

35
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,720
the show off with a spicy take?

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
Let's do some spice.

37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,120
Thrill 64, or I'm sorry, Thrill 46 via Matrix wrote in, hey, Mike and Chris, long time first

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,280
time, have I been duped?

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,160
I bought a PinePhone Pro, and the Rock Pro 64, and I own a PineBook Pro.

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,480
Wow, you're all in.

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,280
And all of them have been sold as basically developer editions.

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,720
I bought them thinking an army of developers would be creating software for these devices,

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,860
and then soon after we'd see a generation of consumer devices ship that would create

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,480
a user base.

45
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,160
Here we are, years later, and most everything they make is still in beta mode.

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,840
I'm not sure anything is close to mainstream adoption, and I feel silly for buying these

47
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,320
quote developer devices.

48
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,040
Developer for who?

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,720
Has it all been a scam?

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Is it a scam?

51
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
No, right?

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
It's not a scam.

53
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,200
It's really, really hard to start a developer ecosystem in the age of the giant, shall we

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,360
say, oligopoly ecosystems that exist.

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,040
And I kind of think the PineBook, I don't know much about the phone, but I feel like

56
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,640
a lot of the energy behind the PineBook has kind of been taken by the framework laptop

57
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,720
too in recent years.

58
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,480
Is that a fair assessment, Chris, of the kind of the tinkerer crowd?

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,560
Yeah, I could see that.

60
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,920
The dream of the PineBook was that Rock Pro 64 platform.

61
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,400
I kind of feel what they're saying here.

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,120
For example, they're selling the PinePhone Pro Explorer Edition, but it really isn't

63
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,420
any more refined than the previous PinePhone that wasn't a pro that they called a developer

64
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,420
edition.

65
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,560
Like nothing really changed.

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,280
The software state is really kind of the same.

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,400
And they kind of always wave it away by saying, with a little note on there, say, well, you

68
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,760
know, we're really transparent and upfront.

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,880
The PinePhone Pro Explorer Edition is aimed at Linux developers with extensive knowledge

70
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,280
of embedded systems or experience on mobile Linux.

71
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
And I kind of see what he's saying.

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,240
It's like they always are promising, well, these are for the developers today.

73
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,760
Look at your hands on it, and then later down the road, we'll make better versions that

74
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,280
regular people can buy, normals, except for that never comes.

75
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,100
It's just this perpetual beta for all of the products.

76
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,300
And it's kind of like they've just come up with this way of saying, well, but if we just

77
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,760
tell them it's just aimed at early adopters, then it's fine that it's not ever a complete

78
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,120
product.

79
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
Maybe that's true.

80
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Maybe.

81
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,760
But, you know, all right, this could have happened with other platforms, too, right?

82
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,720
And I feel like if you're jumping in super early, you're taking the risk reward of, I'm

83
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,840
coming in super early, probably going to be a nothing burger, this new platform.

84
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,840
But if it does take off, then I'm in there on the ground floor, right?

85
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,760
And you could really, if you're a developer yourself, for the writer, take huge advantage

86
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
of that.

87
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,440
And if you're a user, well, then, you know, you get to be one of the first users on the

88
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,540
platform, which is kind of cool.

89
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,120
Having said that, but basically, if you're looking for like an App Store ecosystem, I

90
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,760
don't think you're going to get that.

91
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,480
I do think the alternative to the big oligopolies or the duopoly is going to be like the web,

92
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
right?

93
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
PWAs or...

94
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Yeah.

95
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,480
I still have dreams about WebAssembly.

96
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,840
More, you know, literally websites, right?

97
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,920
Web apps that are just posted somewhere.

98
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,540
The future, you mean?

99
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,920
The future is 2006.

100
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,400
You know, one thing that does strike me, Kyron, I'm probably saying that, Kyron, actually,

101
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,240
in the matrix chat says, developing for the PinePhone is a nightmare.

102
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,720
All of the OS providers have done things differently.

103
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,760
Yeah, give that a ding.

104
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,680
I wrote a hack for Posh that meant that the phone would wake on call properly, but it

105
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,540
only works on Mobian and postmarket OS.

106
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,760
Everything else is weird.

107
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,560
The battle between Qt and Gnome is one that needs to be won as well.

108
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,320
That's also a great point.

109
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,520
That tear between GTK and Qt on mobile is even more acute.

110
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,140
And there's a lot of effort on both sides, and they're not really super compatible environments

111
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,360
in terms of look, flow, and feel.

112
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,600
Like Pine could never, never make...

113
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
They could never pull that off.

114
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,680
Right, they're not going to be able to change that.

115
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,960
So they have to wait for upstream, and upstream is too busy fighting between toolkits, and

116
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,960
they're not really fighting, but they're just too busy really doing their own things to

117
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,240
make something cohesive that a hardware manufacturer like Pine could ship.

118
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,520
Right, so this sounds like the Android fragmentation issues on steroids, basically.

119
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
I think so.

120
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,200
I mean, over time, things in Android have gotten better, but that took the commercial

121
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,080
hands of Google to work with vendors, to create the Treble project, to work on the AB boot

122
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
system.

123
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,040
You know, it's funny.

124
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,840
Last night, Listener Jeff and I flashed my Pixel 3 to Graphene OS, which is an alternative

125
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Google-free...

126
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Did you get any beads?

127
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
No.

128
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Maybe once I get a few more apps working, that's when I unlock the beads.

129
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
It's not bad, man.

130
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
It's not bad.

131
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,800
You know, you're definitely limited without Google Play services.

132
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,560
But if you wanted just a basic smartphone with some...

133
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,440
You know, I mean, there's F-Droid and Aurora Store.

134
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
There's some...

135
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
I have Nextcloud on here.

136
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
I've got VLC.

137
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,840
I've got K9 Mail, Element Chat.

138
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,000
I've got an open source fork of Telegram.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,440
I've got a Chrome fork that's de-Googled.

140
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,320
I got an open source keyboard that's pretty good.

141
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,720
You know, honestly, it's not that bad.

142
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,800
They can really do something with it.

143
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,920
I don't know how far they can really ever get away from Google.

144
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,240
They're always going to be subject to Google.

145
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,440
But this just seems like the way we should have gone.

146
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,540
This is where the community should have focused, is things like Graphene OS.

147
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,160
We should have just acknowledged it.

148
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,600
I don't know if these Linux-native environments or this Linux-native hardware, like the Pine

149
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,000
stuff, is ever going to have more than a few thousand users, you know, tens of thousands

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
of users at most.

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,360
It's just never going to get that...

152
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
It's never going to get that critical mass.

153
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,000
I've just had to come to accept that.

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,200
And so now I'm kind of looking at things like Graphene OS and thinking, boy, we probably

155
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,840
should have just gone this way all along.

156
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,020
I'm still waiting for my Firefox phone.

157
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,120
Are you getting a 14?

158
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Did you tell...

159
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Are you skipping it?

160
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
I am...

161
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,880
I mean, I'm not getting one now, right?

162
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,680
You know, I could always drop my phone.

163
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,280
Now, why haven't you just gotten their upgrade program?

164
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,080
You know, I've been avoiding the upgrades.

165
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,640
I'm still on a 12 Pro.

166
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,360
I bet you that upgrade program would be a write-off for you.

167
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:16,240
It would, but honestly, the last time I upgraded, I think I upgraded from an 11 to a 12 Pro.

168
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,160
And I screwed up one of my TFA apps, and that created such a hassle.

169
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,400
So I use my phone as an actual phone slash overcast player.

170
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,360
I just don't care that much, right?

171
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,420
I am noticing the battery health over the two and a half years, whatever it's been,

172
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,900
it's telling me it's 80% now.

173
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,400
If I got one, I think I'd want the Max in purple, which one is...

174
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,920
I did have one in the car.

175
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:50,040
I did look, but it's late October, and it's also like $1,100.

176
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,800
So it just doesn't feel worth it to me.

177
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
How about you?

178
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Or you're on the upgrade thing, aren't you?

179
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Yeah, I decided to do it.

180
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,200
But I actually intentionally waited because I don't want it to arrive until end of October

181
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
because I'm on this trip.

182
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Right.

183
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Yeah, I think it's...

184
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,800
You know, they got me...

185
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,560
They'll almost always get me with the camera.

186
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,520
And they got me with the satellite calling.

187
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,400
And then I'm actually downsizing, so I think I'm actually going to save a little bit of

188
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,920
money because the payment scales to the size of phone you get.

189
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,440
But we'll see.

190
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
We'll see.

191
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Maybe Graphene OS will work out.

192
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,360
I'm skeptical, but I am hopeful.

193
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
I really like...

194
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,000
The original Pixel 3 is the perfect size phone.

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's perfect.

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,480
It fits in my hand so well.

197
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,720
It fits in my pocket.

198
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,120
It's a little tall.

199
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,740
It's a little narrow.

200
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,280
It's such a thing of beauty.

201
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,160
I think it might be the best Pixel ever.

202
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
The Pixel 3, not the 3a.

203
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,360
The 3a is fine, but I have the Pixel 3.

204
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,980
I'm telling you, if I could replace the battery in this and be happy with Graphene OS, I would

205
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,480
try to make this my primary phone.

206
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
It's just such a beautiful size.

207
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
So I'm hopeful.

208
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
We'll see.

209
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,160
Maybe the iPhone 14 will be my last iPhone.

210
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,640
Here's my spicy prediction.

211
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
Nope.

212
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Yeah.

213
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,160
I think you're probably right on that one.

214
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,900
Linode.com slash coder.

215
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,400
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and it's just a great way to

216
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,880
support the show.

217
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,640
Linode makes cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible.

218
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,680
Linode is our cloud hosting provider.

219
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,800
It's where we deploy everything we've built in the last few years.

220
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,160
And we love the fact that Linode's performance, price, and support are all there just the

221
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,360
way we like them.

222
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,640
And we love the fact that you can tell they're Linux geeks too.

223
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,000
That's really what got them to build Linode nearly 19 years ago.

224
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,960
And now today, here they are 30% to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers out there that have

225
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,340
really specific platforms with specific features and languages that really just want to lock

226
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,340
you in.

227
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,620
Linode's an alternative cloud provider.

228
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,480
They have infrastructure, 11 data centers around the world.

229
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,400
They are their own ISP.

230
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,820
They have a fully functional, clean, easy to use API.

231
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,220
They integrate with your infrastructure management, and they can give you a full Linux platform

232
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,220
that you can manage.

233
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,720
And on top of that, they have one click deployment applications that are really simple.

234
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,120
And they have a bunch of great services on the back end that you might want to use too.

235
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,580
I personally, I use the snot out of the S3 storage.

236
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,840
They have S3 compatible object storage.

237
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,000
And I've just discovered yet another use for it.

238
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,920
I have Duplicati, which is a great Linux backup application.

239
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,880
And you can just point it directly at S3 object storage like Linodes.

240
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,860
And it's just so fantastic the flexibility you get with that.

241
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,720
You combine that with the API and the command line client that lets you easily create buckets

242
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,640
and move files around.

243
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,640
It's just a great way to share files in general for us here at JP.

244
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,700
But on top of that, the performance of their systems is just absolutely fantastic.

245
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,620
If you Google search cloud CPU benchmarks and you look at the results that Linode has put

246
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,560
out from an independent study provider, but Linode is hosting it up on their website,

247
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,140
the report reveals how the different VPSs and cloud providers stack up and how much

248
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,600
faster Linode systems are.

249
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
It's a great report.

250
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,080
It's from Cloud Spectator.

251
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,840
It's their CPU benchmark report.

252
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,160
You can go look that up, or you can go find it on Linode's website, and you can see how

253
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,840
Linode's performance stacks up.

254
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,960
When you combine that with PCIe MVMe storage, the fact that they are their own ISP means

255
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,600
their connections scream, right?

256
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,920
And then you realize the pricing.

257
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,240
It all comes together with Linode.

258
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
That's why we use it.

259
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,280
I think you'll love it.

260
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Go try it out.

261
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,540
It's fast, reliable cloud hosting.

262
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,800
You got to try it for yourself or your next project.

263
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,840
So go get that $100, support the show, and kick the tires for yourself.

264
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,320
Linode.com slash coder.

265
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,480
That's linode.com slash coder.

266
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,640
All right, Mr. Dominic, you are back on the Linux train.

267
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,540
Been using it for just over a month full time, I believe, you've gotten some hardware.

268
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,600
So I think that's definitely played a factor, the Dev1 and the Thalia, which we'll talk

269
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,300
about in a little bit.

270
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,760
So tell me what it's been like living the Linux life full time again.

271
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,200
It's been pretty smooth.

272
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,880
I'm living that pop OS life, the Thalia, of course, and the Dev1 come pre-installed with

273
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,360
it.

274
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,880
I am mastering the tiling keyboard shortcuts, which is just a much better way to handle

275
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,960
the whole tiling thing in PATH.

276
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,560
I'm liking it.

277
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
You know, it's funny.

278
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,580
I was getting irritated with Monterey, Mac OS Monterey, and some of the weird changes

279
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:32,080
that Mac continues to make to the Unix tools because they have to.

280
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
I don't know why.

281
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Right.

282
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
They always they always are making changes.

283
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,920
They're always making like strange Apple specific things.

284
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,480
I think a lot of it has to do with their developer tool chain goes through Xcode.

285
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,880
Every time you update Xcode, crazy shit happens to like your C headers.

286
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,400
But yeah, so decided I try it out again.

287
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,960
And honestly, a big factor in me purchasing this Thalia was I did briefly try a review

288
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:05,160
unit and I kind of missed Tactical Strategy RPGs and of course, MTG Arena, which also

289
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,200
runs on Mac, but I love it so far.

290
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,440
I mean, it's been very good.

291
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,480
I wrote a review of it.

292
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,160
It's pretty it's pretty fast.

293
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,880
It's I mean, it's got to be the fastest machine I've ever owned for day to day.

294
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
What I do.

295
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,280
Well, starting with the Linux side, the Pop OS side.

296
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,600
The only thing I'm noticing is some of the more interesting newer tools, like in particular

297
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,240
warp terminal, don't have Linux versions.

298
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,840
And that's been kind of a minor annoyance.

299
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:50,280
Having said that, the version of Bash on, I think I'm on 2204, does auto complete significantly

300
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,360
better than the version of Zshell on Mac OS.

301
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,840
So it's less of a hole in my day to day life, but it's still there.

302
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,440
I mean, every once in a while I'll get the like some of the JetBrains tools.

303
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,200
I feel like they render the fonts too smally.

304
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,480
But other than that, I mean, I have been very happy.

305
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,120
I have notably not installed any additional extensions on GNOME, because I just decided

306
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,080
to avoid that problem and stick with one desktop background.

307
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,560
Have you ever played around with the fish show?

308
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
I have.

309
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
We covered it like for.

310
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Yeah.

311
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
OK.

312
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
Yeah.

313
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Yeah.

314
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
I mean, that's pretty great on Linux.

315
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
You know, a lot of good auto completion in there and stuff like that.

316
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
It's great.

317
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
But I'm lazy.

318
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Right.

319
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Yeah.

320
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
I'm having a I am having a tougher time with pop.

321
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,440
I mean, I love our friends over at System 76, but I am having a I have I have a harder

322
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,840
time because I've been using traditional GNOME for a while now.

323
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,840
So switching back to cosmic and like not having the gestures to swipe to horizontal workspaces

324
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,840
I have found has been a little tricky because one of the things that I have really ingrained

325
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,280
with my GNOME shell usage is every major application window should probably have its own virtual

326
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
desktop.

327
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,640
And that's really doable on like a laptop screen when you're swiping sideways between

328
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
virtual desktops.

329
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,960
And I just kind of I find that workflow falls down with the cosmic layout.

330
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,000
But so you've been so you've you've now you've been using desktop Linux on the dev one.

331
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,720
You've now used it on the Thalia, which is a beast.

332
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,800
I'll talk more about my experience with the Thalia because I got one for review as well.

333
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,960
And I ran a ton of tests against it.

334
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,120
But I'm just curious to to just get to capture what is it for you that or is there a difference

335
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,760
between using desktop Linux on the dev one and using desktop Linux on the Thalia?

336
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,280
Just the form factor differences.

337
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Anything.

338
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,300
I was thinking actually in performance and if you can feel a difference, if you can tell

339
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,620
between the hardware or if it kind of the interface is just sort of fast, regardless,

340
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,760
just that kind of impressions.

341
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,080
I mean, the dev one is pretty fast.

342
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,360
I would say this is kind of horrible.

343
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,320
This is maybe damning with faint praise.

344
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,120
But the reason I'm able to use the dev one instead of a MacBook finally as my day to

345
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,340
day driver for a laptop, you know, when I'm like working at a bar, coffee shop or whatever

346
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:02,200
is or even just like in my kitchen because six year old the speakers, the onboard speakers

347
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,020
don't make me want to stab myself in the ears.

348
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,920
They are the they're the best Linux laptop speakers, I think.

349
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Right.

350
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,840
Which I would even say like I had the Gen one XPS and then I had a later generation

351
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,680
XPS was not the case.

352
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,180
You know, I kind of use the Thalia of different things, right?

353
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,740
Like the dev one.

354
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,640
It's kind of sad because I spent well, we could you have the link in the notes where

355
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,160
you can see the neo fetch for the Thalia spent like twenty one, twenty two hundred on the

356
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,080
Thalia.

357
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,880
And I use it a lot less than I do the dev one.

358
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,400
Ah, sure.

359
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,740
But when I'm using it, it's definitely heavier workloads.

360
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,680
It's usually something where I'm, you know, using a Windows client application that we

361
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:54,120
developed, hooking into a local host version of some Python or Ruby API that we wrote running

362
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,580
on the Linux host VM, right?

363
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,160
So it's like a Windows 10.

364
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,960
I'm still using Windows 10 for my VM because, you know, why not?

365
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,680
And a Linux and the pop OS host to do local API testing without, you know, touching the

366
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,960
actual database on a staging server or production.

367
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,520
I think that's great.

368
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,200
I mean, I like that workflow.

369
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,960
That's a little much to ask of the dev one, I feel.

370
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,080
Though I'm sure it's possible it would just lag a bit, right?

371
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,040
Yeah, I think your your impression is correct.

372
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,280
I was shocked at a couple of the jobs that I tested.

373
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,880
Just how much faster the Thalia was that I thought the Thalia failed to do the test.

374
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,400
But you know, when you look at the benchmarks and I'll link to a couple of them in the show

375
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,220
notes and the cool thing about these is you can actually then there's a command in that

376
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,940
link where you can run that exact benchmark against your system and see how it compares

377
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,840
to the dev one and the Thalia that I tested against.

378
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,220
And when you look at those benchmarks, it's almost what you'd expect.

379
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,200
The dev one delivers a lot for eleven hundred dollars.

380
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,060
The dev one is just like very impressive.

381
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,580
It just can't touch what the Thalia can deliver for like twenty five hundred dollars or twenty

382
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,920
seven hundred dollars or however you can figure it, right?

383
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,120
And you just that really bears out in the testing.

384
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,920
I mean, that they're just there's that reality of it.

385
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,680
In fact, when I was looking at it.

386
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:24,640
The dev one and the Thalia were pretty neck and neck on things that were like disk I.O.

387
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
related.

388
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,760
So if your job involves a lot of IOPS and disk I.O. stuff, you're not going to see a

389
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,640
huge increase with the Thalia unless you bought like a very fast drive for the Thalia.

390
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,720
But if you go with like the stock parts on both of them, when it comes to things that

391
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,720
are disk bound, they're just about match the Thalia is a little bit faster.

392
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,160
Obviously when it comes to CPU bound stuff, that's where the Thalia can really, really,

393
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,240
really, really pull ahead.

394
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,640
That's not the whole story, though, I found.

395
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,600
So I have some negatives.

396
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,960
In fact, I have kind of like a killer for me, perhaps, on the Thalia, a fatal flaw,

397
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
if you will.

398
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,560
But I'll get to that in a moment.

399
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,660
I'm just curious to know now that you've kind of deep dived into Linux again, just before

400
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,560
we move to finalize on the hardware stuff, what have you found that isn't working for

401
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
you very well?

402
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,480
What have you found that still seems to be busticated?

403
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,800
So I'd say a few things I did.

404
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,120
So I was playing Civ 5 with some of the System 76 folks and some other community people.

405
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,560
And I think this is not Pop or Ubuntu's fault.

406
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,200
I think this is more the developers of the Civ 5 port of Linux, because it was the native

407
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,400
version, not the Windows version.

408
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,080
Just like never imagine GPU CPUs with more than eight threads or eight cores.

409
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,680
You had to go in there and edit an INI file, which it just feels very Linux-y, right?

410
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,240
Having to Vim in to get a game to work.

411
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,120
I remember doing that for World of Warcraft years ago, having to just change a bunch of

412
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,320
settings via Vim.

413
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,120
Everything was kind of working out of the box.

414
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,360
I'd say a big thing I've done differently is I gave up on my irrational hatred of Flatpak

415
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,160
and I've just embraced the Flatpak lifestyle with the exception of VS Code still.

416
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Yeah.

417
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Yeah, VS Code, I agree.

418
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,080
Because I need it to be able to hit parts of the system that are right.

419
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,060
I agree with you on that.

420
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,160
If you embrace Flatpak and you're on GNOME, it is just an easier life.

421
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,400
Things are just a little simpler.

422
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,100
And those applications break less, too, because they're not tied to all the other system dependency

423
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
ies.

424
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Yeah.

425
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,100
I would say the only...

426
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
Okay.

427
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,440
I had two issues so far in about a month.

428
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,920
One is literally right before we came on the air, I had plugged in the...

429
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,680
I don't know what you call it, Chris, the U22 thing, the Zoom...

430
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Oh, yeah.

431
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Yep.

432
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
The U22.

433
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
The little...

434
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
Yep.

435
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
The U22.

436
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,480
And for whatever reason, Pop couldn't pick it up, so I just had to reboot and then I

437
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,600
picked it up.

438
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,840
I have no idea why.

439
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
Yeah.

440
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
Yeah.

441
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Yeah.

442
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
That could be...

443
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,840
Pop is using PipeWire now.

444
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Okay.

445
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,840
He's using PipeWire.

446
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
It's just new stuff.

447
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,600
I occasionally notice that it incorrectly, and this is only on the Thalio, so I'm not

448
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,160
sure what's up with that, will take my Wi-Fi to 2.4 megahertz or gigahertz, whatever it

449
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,720
is, instead of five, which cuts the speed in half.

450
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,840
But again, I disconnect the Wi-Fi and reconnect it and it's fine and it only seems to happen

451
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,200
after I let it go to sleep, but I haven't been able...

452
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,080
It's only happened twice in a month, so I'm not sure if that's...

453
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
Yeah.

454
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,640
Like interference, because I don't know how well this will age, but there's currently

455
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,440
a hurricane coming to where I live in Florida, so all the kids are out of school.

456
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,520
Right now, both kids are like gaming away, right?

457
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,240
One's on a Nintendo, one's on an Xbox.

458
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,760
Everything's got an online connected DRM bullshit thing, so it might just be my router is currently

459
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,920
getting smacked around a little bit.

460
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,400
I've had that on the Dev1 recently.

461
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Okay.

462
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,920
I've had the Wi-Fi not reconnecting, and I'm on Nix, too.

463
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,400
I'm not on POP anymore.

464
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,200
Okay, so that's weird.

465
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,920
Yeah, maybe it's a kernel driver issue.

466
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,620
Tailscale.com slash coder.

467
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,440
That's where you go to get a personal account for up to 20 devices for free, and that's

468
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,640
not just like a limited time thing, and it's a great way to support the show as well.

469
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,120
So Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

470
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,080
Just about everybody must know about Tailscale right now, because I feel like it's been changing

471
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,300
the remote networking landscape for the last year, just changing the way people do work.

472
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,200
It manages firewalls for you.

473
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,040
It takes care of NAT for you, and you can get it installed on your device, be it a computer,

474
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:35,600
a server, a phone, a Raspberry Pi, I don't know, a VPS, a VM, a container, home assistant.

475
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,300
I mean, you can get it up and running within minutes.

476
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:45,180
You quickly and easily create a secure, flat mesh network between your systems powered

477
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,400
by WireGuard's noise protocol.

478
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,160
Yep, it's a WireGuard mesh network, and they have a bunch of great features inside of there

479
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,840
as well, like TailScale Send.

480
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:00,120
You can use TailScale Send as sort of like AirDrop for all of your TailScale devices,

481
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,380
so you can send files between them easily.

482
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,120
And then there's TailScale SSH.

483
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,960
And also, just part of TailScale, it allows you to establish an SSH connection between

484
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,200
your devices.

485
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,040
You're not moving around SSH keys like an animal.

486
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,080
No, you're actually authenticating your SSH connection using WireGuard.

487
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,780
It's pretty awesome, you guys.

488
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,720
And you can try it up for free to 20 devices to really get a sense of this thing and see

489
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
how intelligent it is.

490
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,220
Like, when you're moving files between devices, if they're on the same LAN, TailScale knows

491
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,880
that, and it does it over the LAN.

492
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,560
You can use your TailScale IPs, it'll be protected, but they can transfer directly to each other.

493
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,360
And it's not gonna just route all of your traffic over the tunnel.

494
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,040
TailScale intelligently chooses what traffic is supposed to go to the TailScale network.

495
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,480
You know, it's TCP IP.

496
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,920
It knows how this can work.

497
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,400
You just needed software to do it right.

498
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
That's TailScale.

499
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,440
Then you combine that with their single sign-on support.

500
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,280
You combine that with the fact that they have ACL controls that allow you to share certain

501
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,800
machines or just certain ports with individuals.

502
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,080
It's so powerful.

503
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,200
It'll change how you do VPNs forever.

504
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,280
So go try it out, tailscale.com slash coder.

505
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:12,900
One more time, tailscale.com slash coder.

506
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,120
The big thing that we haven't mentioned is the Thaleo has seen a redesign of its case.

507
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,520
You touch on this in your review.

508
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,840
They've taken away that wood veneer side, and they've replaced it with more of a customizable

509
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,160
strip that you can put different looks on.

510
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,240
It's a clean, sharp look.

511
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
I like it.

512
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,360
I see one that's custom branded for events.

513
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
You know what I'm talking about?

514
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Yes, I do.

515
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
Yeah.

516
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,320
So I like the new design.

517
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,680
I was sent the Thaleo, the regular small Thaleo.

518
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
Did you end up...

519
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Now, but you got a review unit.

520
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
Let's talk about this for a moment.

521
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
You got a review unit.

522
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,240
I think you got a similar one with a different graphics card, and you turned around and said,

523
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
okay, great.

524
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
I'll buy one.

525
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,880
So which one did you actually get, and what made you decide to pull the trigger on buying

526
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
it?

527
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,440
So I actually got the wrong review unit.

528
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
Oh, interesting.

529
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,600
I got somebody else's review unit, so I had to send it back anyway, but I'm like, you

530
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
know what?

531
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,160
I'm just going to buy one anyway, so I'll just buy it.

532
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,280
I literally bought the first production one off the line, I was told.

533
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
I bet.

534
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, well, if you're buying it when the review units are going out...

535
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,640
Since I bought it before it came out.

536
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,360
The difference between this and the review unit is the review unit was more of a base

537
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,840
model.

538
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,120
This is slightly upgraded.

539
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,880
I went for a slightly bigger GPU, and I went up to 32 gigs of RAM.

540
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,680
Obviously, you can max it out at 64.

541
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,300
I know I've already heard from people who want to know why I didn't just do that.

542
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,600
The answer is I didn't feel like spending the money that second.

543
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Sure.

544
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,640
While you're looking it up, I'll tell you what my review unit was.

545
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:44,080
So mine came with the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12 core, base clock of 3.7.

546
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,760
They can peak up to like four something, though.

547
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,680
32 gigs of RAM, one terabyte Samsung SSD 980 Pro.

548
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,680
I had the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti eight gigabyte card in there.

549
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,040
And for most of my review, I was running Nix.

550
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,280
For some of it, I was running POP, but Nix OS with kernel 519.6, so the latest kernel,

551
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:13,520
ButterFS on the hard drive, and NVIDIA 515.48.07 as my NVIDIA driver.

552
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,880
And so it's a pretty beefy rig.

553
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:22,840
That 3060 Ti is no slouch, and that Ryzen 9 5900X 12 core is no slouch either.

554
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,000
How are you finding it for, I'm very curious for like video encoding if you're doing any

555
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
of that.

556
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Oh, yeah.

557
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,640
Oh, it's a screamer for sure.

558
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,660
It exceeds any of like my requirements by far.

559
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,660
It really does.

560
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,660
I really pushed this thing.

561
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,660
I was very, very impressed.

562
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,080
I don't know if you noticed this, but it gets warm.

563
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
To the touch?

564
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
Let me see.

565
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
If you really push it.

566
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,280
If you push both the GPU and the CPU, it gets really warm.

567
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Really?

568
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,880
And if you look at the internal design of the thing, and I'm not saying it's dangerous,

569
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,280
but I'm saying it's warm.

570
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,640
If you look at the internal design of the thing, there's an intake fan on the bottom

571
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,820
that's blowing upwards from the bottom of the case, and it's blowing over the GPU.

572
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:11,960
And then there's an intake fan above the GPU that's sucking in for the CPU.

573
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:19,020
So I reason that you're essentially blowing hot GPU air into the CPU air intake.

574
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:24,660
And so you get to a point where the CPU just cannot fully cool itself, so it begins to

575
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:29,280
thermal throttle pretty quickly when you're pushing both systems.

576
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:35,680
Now even thermal throttle, this thing, and I have it in the benchmarks, it's a killer,

577
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,720
but it is nonetheless thermal throttling.

578
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,280
And if you stress the CPU and the GPU, like maybe you're doing a machine learning analysis

579
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:48,840
job, something like that, training some models, the whole case gets warm to the touch.

580
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,160
You know, the RAM gets in the 80 Celsius degrees temperature.

581
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,880
The CPUs are getting to their max.

582
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,240
All of it is within spec.

583
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,220
I want to stress that, but it got a lot warmer than I expected.

584
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:06,040
And when you're when you're pushing that 3060, it's no joke, man, that machine is taking

585
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:12,140
over 300 watts of power to run the CPU and the GPU at full tilt.

586
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,040
So it is a massive draw.

587
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,740
And when it's idle, when you're not running the GPU and you're just kind of doing your

588
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,560
day to day stuff, it's still in the 100 watt range.

589
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,980
And that's just the reality still of the X86 platform.

590
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,020
This is not a knock against the Thaleo.

591
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,220
That's just the nature of this platform.

592
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:35,100
It's just striking when you're comparing it to, like, say, a MacBook Pro Ultra Max, whatever,

593
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:42,260
and you run some of the same tests and the MacBook Max Ultra Pro, whatever, never audibly

594
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:49,140
kicks its fans up, never gets warm to the touch and still does really well in the benchmarks.

595
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,360
And it's using maybe 30 watts to do all of that.

596
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,460
And the Thaleo is using 300 watts.

597
00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:00,320
It's getting better performance, but it's not like in the next galaxy better.

598
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,100
And so for me, ultimately, I think I would want a bigger Thaleo.

599
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,540
I'd want a larger Thaleo.

600
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,260
So there was more maybe room between the components to cool things.

601
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,580
Not that I think it's really a problem, but if I'm buying a machine like this, I want

602
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:21,580
it to last eight years and I don't necessarily want to heat soak the RAM, the Northbridge

603
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,980
and some of the CPU components.

604
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,020
So I would probably get a little bit bigger Thaleo.

605
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,860
And for me, that was kind of the fatal flaw and why I didn't order one, because I am in

606
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,420
desperate need of an improved studio setup.

607
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,420
I am going to spend some time running this as an OBS machine and just putting it under

608
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,540
that workload where it's doing streaming, it's doing some capture, but it's not going

609
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,060
to max it out.

610
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,940
And I want to see what the thermals are under that load.

611
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:52,460
They may be completely acceptable in that scenario because I want to underscore when

612
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,740
I'm looking at these high thermals, I'm rendering.

613
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:59,420
What I did is, for example, is I had FFmpeg rendering a video on a couple of cores while

614
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,140
I played a video game, not like a crazy video game like CSGO.

615
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,060
And this machine can easily, easily handle that kind of load.

616
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:13,240
And I could get into thermal throttling territory within five minutes in that scenario.

617
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Just things like that.

618
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,500
And then I just tried different benchmarks and different tests.

619
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,060
Again, even thermal throttled, it's still a monster, but you know, it's just something

620
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,060
to be aware of.

621
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,820
And I think it's in part because it's just it's a small unit.

622
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,700
The base Thaleo is adorably small.

623
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,180
It's kind of like peak PC design in a way.

624
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,480
It's a great case.

625
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,020
It's a great size.

626
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:39,220
The revisions to this case with that with that new replaceable strip, but also the back

627
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,260
paneling just is cleaner.

628
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,220
They've labeled the ports.

629
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,840
They've really embraced the ports on this Thaleo.

630
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,620
And the case is really solid.

631
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:53,220
And they've also included brackets and and things that really clamp the gear down, like

632
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,140
the GPU and stuff like that, so it doesn't fall off in shipping.

633
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,620
So it's a really solidly built PC.

634
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,860
It's just also very small, with extremely powerful components packed in there.

635
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,820
And they're all running within spec.

636
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,940
They're all absolutely within spec, but it's a little hotter than I expected.

637
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,860
And over 300 watts is a little more than I expected.

638
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,860
So it's all doable.

639
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,820
Yeah, it's interesting, because they also make a different body.

640
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:22,460
And I wonder one of my questions when figuring mine was how what effect because it's the

641
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,780
same case, do the different GPUs have on thermals?

642
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,820
I care less about thermals than you, because you know what I care about, right?

643
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,300
Speed and no sound?

644
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
No sound.

645
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
Yeah.

646
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
Fan noise.

647
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,300
Yeah.

648
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,180
Now, the last Thaleo I tested was the first first-gen Thaleo.

649
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,140
And that definitely I think I had a whole blog post.

650
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,900
It sounded like an aircraft carrier.

651
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:50,260
This is much improved, but I would note that my GPU is an AMD ATI, also NeoFetch, terrible,

652
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,520
terrible output here, device 743F.

653
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,660
That means nothing except it just means that it's like the baby AMD GPU.

654
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,420
So I'm not seeing that I have my hand that I'm not feeling any kind of thermal pressure.

655
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
Right.

656
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,980
Again, we're just doing squadcast right now.

657
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,140
So I have what?

658
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,140
Yeah.

659
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,140
Not bad, right?

660
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,460
And exactly, if you're just pushing one of the subsystems, like most video games, once

661
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,860
they're loaded up, they don't really push the CPU a whole bunch.

662
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,260
And when you've got like 24 virtual cores to work with, only a couple of them are doing

663
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,260
anything.

664
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:28,460
But what I've noticed, Mike, is the Thaleo Mira and Major and the Mega and the Massive,

665
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:32,100
those are the other bigger Thaleos that are physically larger as well.

666
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,580
They all have side venting.

667
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,060
And maybe that's just because they haven't like they haven't gone back and redesigned

668
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,060
those cases.

669
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,060
Or I don't know, maybe they have.

670
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:45,220
But I've noticed they seem to have a beefier cooling system, like the Mega and the Massive

671
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,160
especially have a lot beefier side cooling.

672
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
Maybe there's something there.

673
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,020
I'm sure we'll find out something I want to experiment more with.

674
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,060
And I think they could probably rightfully argue that it's not actually a problem because

675
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,460
you know, they've tested these things just to say that they are intricate and obsessive

676
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,620
over details is is understating how much they look at this.

677
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,660
I mean, they made a panel that's the that's the PCP, the chips in their damn keyboard

678
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,660
for the.

679
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
Yeah.

680
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660
Yeah.

681
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,660
It looks so great, actually.

682
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,080
I may still end up buying one once I do the OBS test.

683
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,260
If it you know, everything works out fine there in a real world usage, like when I used

684
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,820
it as my desktop for a couple of weeks.

685
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,020
Totally fine.

686
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,020
Totally fine.

687
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,020
Good, solid device.

688
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,220
You know, you've got to live with certain quirks of Linux when you have a large device

689
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:37,440
like that, like hooking up multiple displays can still be a little glitchy, but all manageable

690
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,540
and just such a rockin system.

691
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,260
You can really just push it and it just takes it.

692
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,540
So I really enjoyed my time with the Thaleo.

693
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,020
I'll give it I'll give it a chance as an OBS machine, but I haven't pulled the trigger

694
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,020
yet.

695
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,020
I'm glad you got one.

696
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,020
I think it's I think it's going to be good.

697
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,020
Yeah, it's nice.

698
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
I you know, it's funny.

699
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:01,940
I I'm I just went down a rabbit hole on this weird AMD GPU that I bought mostly because

700
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,620
I'm very sure that GPU prices are going down soon.

701
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,420
I just feel pretty strongly about that.

702
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:13,900
I wrote that in my review, but I didn't realize how low end this beige gobby again, awful

703
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,900
name.

704
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,580
Seriously, AMD, just crap.

705
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,380
It's holding up pretty well.

706
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:24,740
I mean, I was playing Spider-Man remastered on it, getting decent frame rates.

707
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,100
It looked bad as good as it would on a PS4.

708
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,640
My PS5, you know, pumped all the way up could could probably beat it.

709
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,460
And maybe there's tweaks I can make and be a little more aggressive, right, and ludicrous

710
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,380
to make it run better.

711
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,140
I'm kind of interested in what this new AMD architecture is going to do Thaleo aside,

712
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,140
to be honest.

713
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,260
This is a very affordable.

714
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,260
This was a two hundred dollar upgrade.

715
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,380
And the you know, the great thing about those AMD cards, they're going to work great with

716
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,540
your Linux desktop.

717
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,540
It's not going to be a struggle.

718
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,300
You're not going to go get some sort of weird Nvidia package and run through some sort of

719
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,300
install script.

720
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,300
You just plug it in.

721
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,380
If you got a modern kernel and they've upstream, the drivers just works.

722
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,120
And well, and usually for a couple of years, they're the same drivers.

723
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,780
So you just buy another one, a bigger one when you have the money and can almost always

724
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,780
just swap it in.

725
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,780
Yeah.

726
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,340
That's what I'm saying now, I think I'd probably go with a with a, you know, a medium, mid

727
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,860
of the road, mid road that I could get by with and I'd be happy with today GPU.

728
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,900
But I don't think I'd I'd go for like the biggest high end purchase you could just yet.

729
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,900
I agree with you.

730
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,900
Wait a little bit.

731
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,900
Save a few hundred bucks.

732
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,820
Yeah, I think so.

733
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
That's the way to do it.

734
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,900
But Thaleo is a it's a really solid system.

735
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,300
It made for a great next box.

736
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,940
And obviously it ran pop great as well.

737
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:38,460
So clearly I I want to say I was tempted to do I want to say it's the best desktop PC

738
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
right now that I know of.

739
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,900
I think it might be when you consider the unique case design, the work that goes into

740
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,820
the internals, just how slick of a system overall is and like the quality of like the

741
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,300
corners, the port holes, just the button even for the power.

742
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,020
All of it is so refined, so obsessed over.

743
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:03,580
I just don't know of any other desktop PC with that kind of care, that kind of uniqueness

744
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,660
to it.

745
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,180
It's a pretty special machine.

746
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,380
Booster Graham, let's do a few boosts.

747
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,380
What do you say?

748
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,780
Booster Graham, Booster Graham, Woden 501 boosted with 5000 sats.

749
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,020
He says, I got a future trip idea.

750
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,940
Once the new Intel fab opens in Columbus, get a tour set up and then take a trip way

751
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,260
over on the I-70 to meet us Midwest folk.

752
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,420
We've got craft beer and hotels.

753
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,500
Some of them have beer taps right in the rooms, he writes.

754
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,260
What that sounds very dangerous.

755
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,140
Holy crap, I would wreck myself.

756
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,140
That's amazing.

757
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,580
OK, well, you got a boost in and tell me which hotel specifically that I do want to get to

758
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,580
the Midwest.

759
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,100
So we're doing our West Coast tour right now.

760
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,140
I'm in Sacramento as we record because, you know, we did the East Coast.

761
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,020
We did the we did the we did like Denver area.

762
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,540
So it seemed like it was time to the West Coast.

763
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,220
But I you know, there's still so much room in between.

764
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,860
So Midwest is definitely on my list.

765
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,940
So send me the deets.

766
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,580
Sergeant Apple boosted in with two hundred and fifty sats boost.

767
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,140
Oh, I'm sorry.

768
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,780
Twenty five hundred sats.

769
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,540
He says on the future is the Web idea.

770
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,020
You guys have been kicking around.

771
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,340
Do we think Apple will ever come around and get on board with the Web?

772
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,460
Looking at iCloud Web apps, they're definitely short on Web skills.

773
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,220
Won't they just fight and stay native until the end?

774
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,220
Yes.

775
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,220
Yes.

776
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,620
There's all the fight and stay native till the bitter end.

777
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,620
So, yeah.

778
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,620
Why would they do that?

779
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,620
Why would they not do that?

780
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:37,060
I mean, and do you think long term this is what I mean, like I'm talking long term.

781
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,780
Maybe this is what makes their platform less relevant.

782
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,860
You got to remember, like the vast majority of software that gets written is for businesses

783
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:50,300
and other organizations, not the whizz, bang a let's blog about it, you know, indie apps,

784
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,300
right?

785
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,100
So I. I guess both things can kind of be true, right?

786
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,380
Like I think they're super cool.

787
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,420
Rogue Amoeba Panic.

788
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,420
They can still exist.

789
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:05,660
And that's awesome as native Apple platform developers, for example.

790
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,940
And I'm sure although there really isn't the equivalent on Windows, right?

791
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,260
That's kind of the weird part.

792
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:16,460
But OK, but the vast majority of us who are either, you know, doing contracting or are

793
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:22,500
writing, you know, business type applications or even utility applications are probably

794
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,660
going to be better suited targeting Web technologies.

795
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:31,700
The big pink elephant in the gin bar here is what the hell happened to WebAssembly?

796
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,660
Like I'm on a Carmen Sandiego level mission here.

797
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:42,460
Yeah, like I've I did dip my toes into certain subreddits.

798
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:47,260
And it just seems like there's like some zealotry, but not a lot getting done.

799
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,260
Who would have thought?

800
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
Who would have thought?

801
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,260
OK.

802
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,260
All right.

803
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,820
Well, let me know if you ever do find where in the hell WebAssembly is.

804
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,020
I sure would like to know.

805
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,940
I'm hoping it's not like that weird spin off of Carmen Sandiego where it's we're in time

806
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,940
this WebAssembly.

807
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,780
I guess you mean a couple of dinosaurs and Richard Stallman having to go get it.

808
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,040
You know, that's where it goes.

809
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
That's where it ends up.

810
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,780
It always ends up with RMS tire boosts in with twenty one hundred sats.

811
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:17,240
And he says, what is Mike and your opinion on what is better, Web apps or electron apps?

812
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,540
From what I can tell, most electron apps are just Web apps and browsers that have lack

813
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,540
security.

814
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,380
Also, he says shame on you for getting him back into Magic the Gathering.

815
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,900
He sold his cards six months ago, but you talking about it is making him regret selling

816
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,900
them out.

817
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,340
And he says on the uniform topic, Pearl snapshots are awesome and boots are where it's at.

818
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,340
So if you had to pick Web app or electron app, do you have a choice?

819
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:45,700
Do you have a preference, I should say?

820
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,340
Yeah, I would say Web app.

821
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:55,060
But my my revealed behavior seems to be electron app for like things like slack and element

822
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,220
I.O. or element, whatever.

823
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,220
Me too.

824
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,220
I would answer Web app.

825
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,140
But then, of course, I like having I like having things as their own.

826
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,820
I just like the proper notifications.

827
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,820
Yeah, that too.

828
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,820
Yeah.

829
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,820
Yeah.

830
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,540
But by the way, on the Magic the Gathering, you don't need to buy a big collection, my

831
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,540
man.

832
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,540
Buy singles.

833
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,540
You'll be fine.

834
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,540
There you go.

835
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,540
Yeah, you'll be fine.

836
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,540
Just get a few singles.

837
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,540
Where can it go from there?

838
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,540
Nowhere.

839
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,060
Oh, but the beer taps in the hotel rooms were great.

840
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,060
That's fine.

841
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,060
Everybody's going to be OK.

842
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,060
OK, you got me.

843
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,060
All right.

844
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,580
Ammar boosted with a thousand twenty four cents.

845
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,140
He says, Hello, Chris.

846
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,140
Hello, Mike.

847
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,220
I wanted to be a hipster, too.

848
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,340
I looked into Fleet as soon as they announced it.

849
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,820
But I I saw that they say in their FAQ section that it's mainly written in Kotlin, which

850
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,260
means it runs on a JVM.

851
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,260
All their stuff does.

852
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,580
Yeah, that's true.

853
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,940
They're considering open sourcing parts of the product or the technology behind it.

854
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,260
Both of those points are a big no to me, especially today in the V.S.

855
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
Code era.

856
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,260
But thanks for the show.

857
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,980
Yeah, it seems like Ammar also wanted to be a hipster.

858
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,980
Didn't work for him.

859
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:04,380
I'm concerned about JetBrains if before Fleet even officially ships as a product.

860
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:09,060
You and others are saying, where does this fit and why are they doing it like this?

861
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,060
That seems like a bad sign.

862
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,900
I know your point was the business market may keep it alive, but I don't know, man.

863
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,160
Just a little bit of a red flaggy.

864
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,160
You know what I mean?

865
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Just a little red flaggy.

866
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Oh, yeah.

867
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:27,100
I mean, the the IE6 level dominance of V.S. Code is it's nothing to sneeze at.

868
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:33,180
And Optimus Gray rounds this out with a big old row of McDuck's twenty two thousand two

869
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,180
hundred and twenty two sets.

870
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,180
Quacka Wacka.

871
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,180
It's a treasure.

872
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,180
Yippee.

873
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,860
And we're going to see Optimus Gray at JPL, too.

874
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,520
He says, I'm not a CPA.

875
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,260
But I have a program for them.

876
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,660
You may want to see if you can write off the recording mobile office when you're on a work

877
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,660
trip.

878
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,660
Again, not a CPA.

879
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,140
He says, I also gave a listen to the Drew cleaned up version.

880
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,180
And it's weird because he always listens live.

881
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,760
I missed the post show title talks, but, you know, I'm a member of the QA feed, so perhaps

882
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,980
I'll get it that way.

883
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,020
I need to be smarter about this kind of stuff.

884
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,020
He's right.

885
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,340
I could probably write off my mobile office.

886
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,100
There's probably a lot of things I could be writing off that I'm not.

887
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,740
I hate to solicit advice over the Internet on this kind of thing.

888
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,900
But if this is your area, specifically, if you're kind of familiar with what I do as

889
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,040
a business, reach out.

890
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,140
My tax bill is crushing and I need every defense I have.

891
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,340
So and I say that with no joke.

892
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,340
You wouldn't believe it.

893
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:30,260
You know, you just would not believe how reamed I get as a small business owner.

894
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,020
So I believe it.

895
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,020
Oh, yeah.

896
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,020
No, I know you would.

897
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,940
Oh, and the CPA is out there.

898
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,060
They know.

899
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:45,660
I think the people who just work nine to fives have no idea, have no idea how much money

900
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,660
we end up paying.

901
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,660
It's it's incredible.

902
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:52,820
Also, I just want to give a shout out to TACOF 751, who said, go check out Web three is doing

903
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,820
great.

904
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,820
It's the number three.

905
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,700
Web three is doing great, where the author is doing a fantastic job of documenting all

906
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,800
of the ridiculous things happening in the stupid world of crypto and Web three.

907
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,020
And it's brutal.

908
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:12,100
Didn't like the IRS dude or the head of the Fed to be like, this is all taxable security.

909
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:16,420
SEC said that about Ethereum the day after Ethereum announced their proof of work.

910
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,420
No, I'm sorry.

911
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:22,460
Proof of stake merge that, you know, for a security that one of the basic tests is, is

912
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,680
there a group of people managing it and is it something you're investing in expecting

913
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,860
a return based on the actions of those group of people?

914
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,860
That's Ethereum.

915
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,900
I mean, a lot of these cryptos have a group of people that are asking you to invest in

916
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,620
their thing, implying that you're going to get a return.

917
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,380
And it's called the Howie test.

918
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,140
There's multiple aspects of it, but that's one of the things that makes you a security.

919
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:45,360
And when you're a security, it's a totally different ballgame.

920
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,540
And you can't promote it like you can say, like property or real estate, you know, like

921
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,540
software.

922
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,540
Right.

923
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,540
Right.

924
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,540
You can say anything.

925
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,540
Yeah.

926
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,540
So no, but this is on this guy's site.

927
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,540
Web three is going great.

928
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,540
This is the story.

929
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,340
September 22nd, IRS gets permission for John Doe summons for taxpayers who don't report

930
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,340
crypto transactions.

931
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,340
Yeah.

932
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,340
Now that's for a particular exchange.

933
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,940
But yeah, that's what's going to happen now.

934
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,940
Oh, yeah.

935
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,940
Oh, yeah.

936
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,940
Oh, yeah.

937
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:14,220
This is, you know, potentially long term, a good thing.

938
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:20,180
We need a Hunger Games kind of cleaning out of these crappy crypto scams.

939
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:25,960
We need somebody to come through and just take them all out because so many of them

940
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,500
are pump and dump schemes where there is I'll just super brief because I think people need

941
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,100
to know this.

942
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,900
All of these cryptos after Bitcoin have a group of people behind them.

943
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,380
Ethereum is included in this list.

944
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:43,420
And the way that it all worked is that now all of them have a small group of developers

945
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,220
and they got what's called a pre mine.

946
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,660
So before the crypto even went live to the rest of the public, maybe they get like 20

947
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,840
million coins or a million coins or whatever their setup is.

948
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,540
So they get what's called a pre mine.

949
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,420
They get access to the coins before anyone else does.

950
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,020
Then once the crypto goes public on exchanges, people start buying and trading it.

951
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:07,840
Well, if you got something, a million of something for free and now it's worth a dollar, right?

952
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,920
It doesn't have to go big.

953
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,220
That's why so many of these cryptos are worth pennies.

954
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:15,440
If it goes worth 50 cents and you had a million of it, you're doing great.

955
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,980
And so now you sell.

956
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,480
And so you got the crypto token for nothing and then you dump it on the market.

957
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,380
And it's just this process that you repeat over and over again.

958
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:28,140
Ethereum is just a more complex version of this because they've done all of these little

959
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,780
things to constrain liquidity to make it easier for them to sell without causing the price

960
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,780
to dump.

961
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:38,740
And now they've launched proof of staking where you take your Ethereum and you give

962
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:43,600
it to a Coinbase or a crack and you give it to a third party and they stake it in the

963
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,260
network and you get yield off of that.

964
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:54,100
The funny thing is the developers have literally not written the code or published the code

965
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,540
to unstake.

966
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,300
Once you stake your Ethereum seems very suspicious, right?

967
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,260
It's locked up until they write the code and they won't be until some big releases down

968
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,020
the road and software is always on time.

969
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:12,060
Even in the most honest case, dude, the proof of stake merger was delayed by seven years.

970
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,140
They were trying to get it out.

971
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,140
It took them seven years to ship the proof of stake merger.

972
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,740
And now they're saying with the next merge, that's the next merger to that's when you'll

973
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,940
be able to unstick.

974
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:27,420
In the meantime, the founders that got all their pre-mined coins can sell, sell, sell,

975
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,520
and you can't sell your Ethereum because it's locked up staked.

976
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,940
You cannot withdraw it.

977
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,700
So they can now sell on the market with impunity and people can't pull out.

978
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,300
So it locks the liquidity and it locks the price in.

979
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,300
It is a brilliant scam.

980
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,100
They are pulling all the users of Ethereum and everybody, Oh, I want yield.

981
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:50,180
I want yield, I want yield and they're all fallen for it.

982
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,260
But I just, I can't believe we're watching this go down and Bitcoin suffers from none

983
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,260
of this.

984
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,260
There's no central person.

985
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,260
There was no pre-mined.

986
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,860
There's no staking.

987
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,440
It's not a security.

988
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:06,760
It has been declared by the SEC and the IRS as property years ago, reaffirmed by Gary

989
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,580
Gensler, the chairman of the SEC multiple times.

990
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:16,260
But yet we still see all these horrible scams that take grandma's savings and they just

991
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,300
need to be washed out.

992
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,820
They all need to go.

993
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:23,580
So maybe we'll see some of them, some of them fade away.

994
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:28,140
In the meantime, I remain here skeptical, keeping an eye on all things to call it out

995
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:33,420
as I see it, I'm watching them, I've got their number.

996
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,980
I know what they're up to.

997
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:40,620
I see that if you buy some of these crazy cryptos, you are their liquidity for exiting.

998
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,340
You understand that you're providing them exit liquidity.

999
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,300
That's how all of this works.

1000
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,460
My old man taught me something a long time ago.

1001
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,340
If you're sitting down at the poker table and you don't know who the sucker is.

1002
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,340
You're the sucker.

1003
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,340
You're the sucker.

1004
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,340
Kick it out.

1005
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,340
Leave.

1006
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,340
Yeah.

1007
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,340
Yep.

1008
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,340
That's pretty much it.

1009
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,000
So that's Chris's little pro tip for the internet.

1010
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,500
So Web3 is doing just great.

1011
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,740
You can go check that out.

1012
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,740
JPEX.

1013
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,740
Who would have thought they'd be so easy to sell?

1014
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,740
Right.

1015
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,740
God damn it.

1016
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,740
I should have thought of this.

1017
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,740
Yeah.

1018
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,460
That could have been us, dude.

1019
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,460
Jcoin.

1020
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,580
Mr. Hill.

1021
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,820
We could have done it, dude.

1022
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,820
We were on the air.

1023
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:20,820
We could have done it.

1024
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:21,820
Robes.

1025
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:22,820
We could still do Robcoin.

1026
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:23,820
We could do Robcoin.

1027
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:24,820
Yeah.

1028
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,820
Maybe.

1029
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:26,820
Maybe.

1030
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:30,120
You know, I knew I was in a good place because Listener Jeff here, where he's put us up,

1031
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,300
he's got a coat of robe.

1032
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,660
So I knew he was good people.

1033
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,660
You know?

1034
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,620
You know, he's a man of taste and distinction at least.

1035
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,620
Yeah.

1036
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,620
Right.

1037
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,620
Right.

1038
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,500
Well, I want to say thank you to our members for investing in our content production,

1039
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,540

1040
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,940
We'll have a new code elite pretty soon for you because the quarter is coming up.

1041
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,080
So if you'd like to become a member, CoderQA.co is where you go.

00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,020
Anywhere you want to send the good people, Mr. Dominic.

1045
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:02,340
Go to DominicM.com and read all my Linuxy updates.

1046
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,720
And we should say, if we didn't make it clear enough, your written Thalia review is up there

1047
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,720
as well.

1048
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,720
It is.

1049
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,860
And there might be something this weekend, depending on how whacked I get by this hurricane.

1050
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,860
Oh, man.

1051
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,100
I hope everything goes OK.

1052
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,100
You let me know.

1053
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,940
Hey, listen, if not, you know, we actually did a show, do you remember, when I was up

1054
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,940
in Jersey?

1055
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,940
Yes.

1056
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:21,940
We did one during Sandy.

1057
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,940
I remember.

1058
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,940
So I'm pretty sure we'll be back Monday at noon.

1059
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,940
Yeah.

1060
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,940
Yep.

1061
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,940
Noon, Eastern, 9 a.m. Pacific over at Jupiter.tube.

1062
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,860
