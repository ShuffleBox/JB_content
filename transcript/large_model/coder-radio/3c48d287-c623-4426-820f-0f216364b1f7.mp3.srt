00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,040
My name is Chris and joining us with his podcast pants on and hopefully feeling a bit better,

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,800
it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Hello Mike.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Hello Mr. Fisher.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,400
Yes, I'm feeling tons better.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,480
Oh, you must have done like the regime or something that you're like, you sound totally

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,480
normal again.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,840
I have a whole hippie approved regime of echinacea, vitamin C, vitamin D, make your jokes in the

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,360
comments.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,920
And what's the other one I take?

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Elderberry?

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
Oh, yeah, sure.

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,240
You got to get the elderberry.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,480
But I actually take it as a fluid, like just liquefied and that tastes like butts.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,880
Right, you just got to what you got to do is chase it with a little gin or vodka, you

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
know?

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
No, you can't.

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,360
Or because I negates the whole point is clean, eaten and good sleep is a big part of it,

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
too.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,360
That's it.

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,360
So I know that like some sort of like weird fever state, you ended up installing Windows

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
11 and gave it a go.

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,360
I mean, we shocked and appalled, but I'm here to support you.

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
Shocked and appalled.

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
Really?

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
Yeah.

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
So I do have a gaming laptop.

37
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
It's a Lenovo Legion.

38
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
It came at Windows 10.

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,240
So I upped it to Windows 11.

40
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,320
And I had some thoughts.

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,880
So I blogged it up my takeaway from your blog post, which will have a link to in the notes

42
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,640
was overall mostly positive, but there's still an element to the Windows experience that

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
I find very grating.

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,680
And you honed in on it.

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,200
You said the constant boardwalk pitches of like antivirus and aftermarket OEM services,

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,020
it just makes the desktop feel cheap.

47
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,800
You get hammered by all these OEM messages.

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,840
And like when you come from Mac OS or Linux, that's a huge difference on Windows.

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,120
And it just you know what, when you wrote that, Mike, you know what I pictured is like,

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,120
have you ever been walking down Vegas and had all of the guys like slapping the pamphlets

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,880
for lady dancers and stuff like that, just shoving pamphlets in your face?

52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,980
Many many times and I was very young, I was like 12.

53
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,880
One of my first times in Vegas, I was walking down the strip and there were so many pamphlets

54
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,640
all over the place because these guys are shoving in people's faces and you know, naked

55
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,720
half naked women are on them that a little seven year old child that we were walking

56
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,080
in our group with slipped and fell on the curb on one of these pamphlets and he landed

57
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,520
in a pile of half naked ladies, essentially, because they were pushing this stuff so hard.

58
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,680
And that's what Windows kind of feels like, but without the naked ladies.

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,520
Yeah, I mean, so, you know, I posted to Reddit got some feedback, mostly positive, a couple

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,480
people did point out, you know, you can uninstall of that.

61
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,980
And of course, I'm aware that you can uninstall programs on Windows, right?

62
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,400
My point being, you get the box and you spend like, if you want to get rid of all this crap,

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,880
you have to do this whole process of well, getting rid of all this crap.

64
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Yeah.

65
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,560
So you're giving me a job to do on my high end, expensive gaming laptop.

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,320
But I just want to assure folks, I am very aware of add remove programs.

67
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,920
There you go.

68
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Yeah.

69
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,180
But it sounds like you're able to get Python and fast API up in pretty much no time.

70
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,400
So I did I did something different this time, because, you know, a couple of times a year,

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,840
I like switch OS is for a little bit.

72
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,520
I actually used PowerShell instead of WSL to do everything.

73
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Oh, really?

74
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,200
So you're going like the native, completely native Windows route completely negative.

75
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,160
There's one caveat to that, but I think we'll do the Python stuff first.

76
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
It was pretty good.

77
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,280
I started in PowerShell 5, which is the default install.

78
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,440
And then, you know, in PowerShell, it's like, hey, dog, you can upgrade to PowerShell 7

79
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
and you should.

80
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
So I did.

81
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,040
There was no material difference for me in what I was doing.

82
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,760
But setting up Python, setting up a virtual environment for Python, pretty, pretty easy.

83
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,440
Setting up Postgres, super easy.

84
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,920
The only thing I didn't like is I kept forgetting to use the Windows terminal terminal instead

85
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
of PowerShell.

86
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,440
But once I had that set up, I think I put some images in the blog post like Windows

87
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,160
terminal is get ready to throw your tomatoes.

88
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,480
The best terminal I have used, granted, I use stock Mac OS terminal right now.

89
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,720
So I don't believe you.

90
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
I actually do believe you.

91
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,200
I saw your screenshots in the article.

92
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,240
It's a nice looking terminal.

93
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,480
You got a background in there, branded the company stuff in the terminal like TMB stuff.

94
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,360
That was pretty custom transparency.

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
It was really nice.

96
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Yeah, that stuff is nice.

97
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,320
You didn't have to use WSL for any of that, but it does sound like at one point you did

98
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,160
kind of end up having to use WSL to get some work done.

99
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Yeah.

100
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,960
So I was a little careful about this.

101
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,720
It's possible to do Ruby development in a purely Windows environment.

102
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,280
But it's not a good idea.

103
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,480
It's kind of hard to set up.

104
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,800
It really like Ruby was not meant with Windows in mind, right?

105
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,200
So particularly when I say Ruby, I mean Rails.

106
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,120
So I did just to see like how it would all run.

107
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,000
I didn't end up installing WSL.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,120
I didn't put this in the post because I thought maybe it's a future post, but I did do the

109
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,460
WSL to Ruby mine bridge stuff.

110
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,880
It was a little finicky, but it worked.

111
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,600
Having said that, if you just use Visual Studio from WSL with Ruby, it works exactly as you

112
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,520
would expect on like pop or Ubuntu or whatever.

113
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,160
I mean, it's fine.

114
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,560
Like if I was going to run Windows as a daily driver, I would almost certainly be running

115
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,960
Penguin, which is my WSL destroy of choice.

116
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,080
And I should add that Penguin and maybe I should do a post on this.

117
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,380
Penguin has quick starts for like Ruby and Node and Python and a bunch of other crap.

118
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,240
You noted on something else in there that I feel like I used to struggle with with Google,

119
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,920
but they have improved it greatly.

120
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,960
And that is a big issue you encountered.

121
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,520
Windows just simply does not understand that you can have multiple Microsoft accounts that

122
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
do different things in different contexts.

123
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,880
Yeah, it did not get that.

124
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,820
Like I have the, you know, Michael at the Mad Botter account, which is where my Visual

125
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,400
Studio and all my fun Microsoft dev licenses are.

126
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,560
And like my personal email, which is my Xbox account.

127
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,280
And the thing that made me go down this path was Age of Empires four.

128
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Oh, my God.

129
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,680
I really, really wanted to play like I needed that Xbox app working at one point.

130
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,360
And then I accidentally signed up for a second trial of Xbox Live or whatever they call it

131
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,940
Game Pass.

132
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,100
And I had to like cancel that and just get it to like, no, I understand that there's

133
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,080
two different accounts on here.

134
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,880
And that was just a bad process.

135
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,080
I had to actually go into the browser to sign in and just convince it that like I am who

136
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,720
I say I am.

137
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
Download the game.

138
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,360
I tried to sign up for the like xCloud streaming service that I guess is in beta, but they're

139
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,960
not clear if once you sign up to xCloud streaming, if you can get access to the web based streaming

140
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
version or not.

141
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,520
So I wanted to do a little three way shootout between GeForce Now streaming, Stadia and

142
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,320
the Microsoft xCloud thing.

143
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,840
So I go over there and I sign up for the xCloud gaming service.

144
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,360
And I tell you what, man, it is so obtuse and unclear.

145
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,520
And it doesn't even, it wasn't even clear if I had to have an Xbox to use it, which

146
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,940
I do not.

147
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,760
And it seems the xCloud streaming in the web browser is still unavailable and I had to

148
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
try to cancel.

149
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,440
I mean, it was the most convoluted signup process I have ever been through to sign up

150
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,260
for any kind of service, especially from Microsoft.

151
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,520
That's just a little side tangent.

152
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Their account stuff is in a really weird place now because they've increased and expanded

153
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,420
all of the things they use it for.

154
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,940
Even like playing Minecraft now, you have to have a Microsoft account, but they haven't

155
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,760
caught up like Google has where I can easily switch between four or five different Google

156
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
accounts in a day.

157
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,080
They got to get there.

158
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Yeah.

159
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,960
Well, and Google is like aware that you have multiple accounts and it's a simple dropdown

160
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,160
of like, okay, you want your personal because you're like listening to YouTube, but you

161
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,120
want your business because you're reading Gmail.

162
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Right.

163
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,120
Kind of felt like though your big takeaway from Windows 11 is sort of what you and I

164
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,960
have been getting at more and more is all of the major desktops have really stepped

165
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,640
up their developer support and game and Windows 11 seem, I mean, from, I have not tried it

166
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
much.

167
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,280
I have used it a little bit, but not much.

168
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,340
But what I've been, the feedback I've been getting is a lot of people like it.

169
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,560
It does the job and it's a good tool for getting their work done.

170
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,240
Seems like if you had to, for like a client or something like that, you'd, you'd get by

171
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,760
if you stayed in Windows 11.

172
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Yeah.

173
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
I mean, I wouldn't even say get by.

174
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,880
I would say it would be just fine.

175
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,680
I mean, it's, it's come a long way.

176
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,680
And I know a lot of this was in like later versions of Windows 10 too, but it's come

177
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,440
a long way since like the Windows eight, seven days, if you are a non-Microsoft developer

178
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,880
to the point where it's really kind of good.

179
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,480
There's a funny, like almost uncanny valley that Windows sits in right now because almost

180
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,900
always if you were to adopt Windows 10 and bring it totally current with all patches,

181
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,400
in a lot of ways that may actually be a better workstation OS than Windows 11 is right now.

182
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Yeah.

183
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,640
But it won't always remain that way.

184
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,000
Windows 11 is like, they've made some choices that are other choices that could have been

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
made, I guess.

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But you're not sticking with it.

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,160
It sounds like you're, you're not daily driving.

188
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,240
Well, it's my, it's my gaming rig, right?

189
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,520
And it's my gaming and visual studio rig.

190
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,720
Cause I, I got tired of fighting with VMs.

191
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,680
Hey, I wanted to say, as we get into the feedback, huge thank you to Drew last week who just

192
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
really did a hero's amount of work to save the show.

193
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,000
Our editor went above and beyond last week because let me just give you the high level.

194
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,080
During the recording of last week's episode, there was a massive storm in the Pacific Northwest.

195
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,260
We lost power twice and we've recently been eliminating the UPSs out of the studio because

196
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,280
of buzz and we really rarely have power outages.

197
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,060
And then go figure the power went out twice while we were recording.

198
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,420
Then after we finished recording, the power went out again and I was hours late getting

199
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,200
the files up to our next cloud instance for editing.

200
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,680
So of course there was data loss in the recorder because the power went out twice.

201
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,260
So Drew had to go to like double backups to recover some of this stuff.

202
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:23,740
Like he was in the project folder of the recording, pulling out stuff and Mike had device issues.

203
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,380
I think he switched to AirPods, his, his input switched to AirPods on one of the reconnects

204
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,860
and disconnects and Drew had to try to make that sound consistent.

205
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:36,320
It was a total show and not to mention there was a little bit of extra editing on the beeping

206
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,380
side too, which I just thought was hilarious, but he really went above and beyond last week.

207
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,260
So a big thank you to Drew for making this show actually listenable, despite all of the

208
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,460
crap it went through, he is the hero.

209
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:57,340
And I don't think we heard from a single person who disagreed with your take on web three.

210
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,300
It was, it was one of the show classics to tell you the truth.

211
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Yeah.

212
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,300
I found that kind of interesting.

213
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,420
I thought for sure we'd get a lot of like, usually when we go hard on anything we get,

214
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,540
we get pretty strong pushback.

215
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,540
You know, I, I thought this was kind of like my unique insight, but in conversations that

216
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,980
I had subsequent to the show, like DMS and stuff, I guess I'm kind of not alone on this,

217
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,300
that it feels like a lot of like would be startup people or like, you know, personalities

218
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,980
are like looking for the next big thing and God damn, they're trying to make this web

219
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
three thing.

220
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Yeah.

221
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,980
Yeah.

222
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,980
I don't know.

223
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,980
I think that's like an industry wide problem outside of web three, right?

224
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,860
I mean, I think Facebook changing their name to Metta for obvious reasons, but also like

225
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,060
they need to be the leader in some other revolution because mobile is like locked with Google

226
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,440
and Apple.

227
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,920
So they're going to try Metaverse, whatever the hell that means.

228
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:57,340
Are you just struck by the fact that we appear to exist now in a mostly grifter economy?

229
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,540
When you look at the political class, when you look at the crap that the tech giants

230
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,800
are selling us that they never fully deliver on, when you look at things like web three

231
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,780
and all the different initiatives online or my God, look at YouTube, look at all those

232
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:16,980
YouTubers, tell me, are we not predominantly now existing in a grifter economy?

233
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,620
And I feel like we're a couple of guys sitting here making an honest product.

234
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:27,420
I make a media product, you make a software product and we're surrounded by grifters.

235
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,500
And I think that's what triggers me the most about the web three stuff is it seems like

236
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,700
people who made some money and want to either double down on and make their next big bet

237
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,240
or they want to become famous because they're such narcissists and they don't even realize

238
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,300
they're grifters probably until it's too late.

239
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:50,840
Like it's just normal now for there to be a thing such as an influencer who just post

240
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,080
doctored pictures on Instagram.

241
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,940
And yet somehow we give these people credibility when they're really just grifters and it's

242
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,780
this everywhere now.

243
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,720
And boy, oh boy, I really, I worry about that kind of thing.

244
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,940
And I think when you look at how they talk, they wrap it in all of these massive ideals

245
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:15,980
about freeing society from corporate overlords and control and about centralizing your information

246
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,740
that you have direct control over and making it cryptographically verifiable and trusted

247
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,660
peer to peer payments that underline all of this with, you know, smart contracts backed

248
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,660
up by Ethereum.

249
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,320
Yeah, that stuff would be fantastic, but that is not reality.

250
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,380
We live in a world where trillion dollar companies have influence over the way and direction

251
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,440
the web and technology are going to go and they're never going to push it in a direction

252
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,780
like that regardless of what they say.

253
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:49,020
So it just seems like what you have is a bunch of people grifting in the middle, selling

254
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,860
a promise that can never be delivered on because of the fundamental structure of the market.

255
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,420
And it just is sad that they managed to convince so many people and it continues to propagate

256
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,420
what they do.

257
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,420
I don't know.

258
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:08,020
It's hard because there's definitely a way to go overboard on this, but like I look at

259
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:14,060
our businesses, it is very hard, but also kind of not that sexy to provide a product

260
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,820
that provides value or, you know, in your case, content, right, which I guess is a product

261
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:25,100
and just like do the work of actually generating more revenue than you spend.

262
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,700
But it's super sexy to never make money and then, quote, start a revolution.

263
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,700
What's it?

264
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Is it Thanos?

265
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Is that what it is?

266
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,700
I think.

267
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Am I getting that right?

268
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,340
That I mean, you think of the Theranos case is going on right now, right?

269
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,620
You know, I am certainly I got a lot of criticism because I was like calling bull on that a long

270
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,620
time ago.

271
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,620
Yep.

272
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,820
Like every article in the Theranos case was about the person of Elizabeth Holmes, not

273
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:55,380
like, hey, can I see an article from like a doctor, not, you know, some possibly politically

274
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,860
inspired journalist who happens to cover tech or science?

275
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,060
I really want to see like the medical journal or at least like quote the medical journal

276
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,860
in your fluff piece.

277
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:11,900
You're touching on our cult of personality culture now and grifters take advantage of

278
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
that.

279
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,340
That's what's happening is the personality leads the headline, not the actual hard work

280
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:24,100
or the details, but it's the story they can sell around a personality.

281
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,020
If you even see this happening in the Linux world where the founder of Rocky Linux, the

282
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,420
narrative now is that he founded Centos and now he's gone on to found Rocky Linux.

283
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,700
But that's not really true.

284
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,580
He was involved in finding something, founding something called Chaos Linux, which was abandoned

285
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,300
in effort of Centos and you know, like the whole thing is very nuanced, but there is

286
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:50,500
a narrative around a person that is, it's the way the media works.

287
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,460
They need to write, they need to, they need to fill airtime.

288
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,660
And if they can tell a story about Elizabeth Holmes, they're going to go that direction

289
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,740
every time because they don't have to be an expert on the product.

290
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,400
They don't have to be an expert on the market.

291
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,360
They just have to know how to tell a story.

292
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,100
And then what happens is people like Elizabeth can grift on that.

293
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,540
They can, they've been given this exposure.

294
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,780
They roll with the media and you know, they can get really far without actually producing

295
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,780
much.

296
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,820
You see it happen in Linux and you see it happen in the political sphere and you see

297
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,020
it happen in the technology space.

298
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,100
And I think that's part of why crypto gets such a bad name because it's so common over

299
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,300
there, even though it's totally nothing related to the actual core technology.

300
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,260
But it's weird because like the crazy VC back stuff is just taken on faith.

301
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,800
Like I just did a, got interviewed a few times, which hopefully the pieces come out good.

302
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,120
And the first step in every process was, Hey man, you got to like prove to me this isn't

303
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
just bull.

304
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Right.

305
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,940
And like serious, almost antagonistic kind of like show me like vetting.

306
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,120
I mean, I think that's good, but I think it should be that way for everybody.

307
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,000
But again, a VC is like a brand.

308
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's like a name.

309
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's a personality.

310
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,220
So if such and such VC backs you now, like their cult of personality rubs off on your

311
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,380
company and you're just taken as legitimate.

312
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,900
That's all it takes.

313
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,460
We are so obsessed with personalities and celebrities and we've made tech celebrities

314
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,460
now.

315
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,120
And it's the same thing, you know, Shem wrote in kind of speaking to this and wanted to

316
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,580
know if we had a take on solid.

317
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:23,420
Now solid is that effort started by sir Tim Berners-Lee that promises in his version of

318
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,300
a decentralized internet.

319
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,380
And he released this whole implementation in spec.

320
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,380
I got to be honest.

321
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,060
I actually was pretty familiar with it when solid was first announced, but it's completely

322
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,140
faded from my memory.

323
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,180
I can barely remember it now.

324
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,420
This is not going to be a thing.

325
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,900
Now, I don't know if this is necessarily a grift as much as it is someone's dream of

326
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,300
taking things to the next step.

327
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,300
No, I think it's legitimate.

328
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,300
It's just not going to catch on with the, with the general public.

329
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Right.

330
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,300
Right.

331
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,020
Well, there's, there's so much momentum around the way things are now, you know what this

332
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,020
reminds me of?

333
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,340
And I'm going to get some heat here.

334
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,340
Matrix.

335
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
Oh yeah.

336
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,300
Or how about, what was, what was the one I used to be on that all the Linux folks were

337
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,300
on for a while?

338
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Mattermost?

339
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,300
It wasn't matter.

340
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
It was Mastodon.

341
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,300
Oh, Mastodon.

342
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,300
Maybe it was.

343
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,300
Maybe it was Mastodon.

344
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,900
Mastodon still exists, but yeah, it's a niche.

345
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
It still exists.

346
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,900
Yeah.

347
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,620
It's definitely a niche, right?

348
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,060
Linode.com slash coder.

349
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,580
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

350
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,580
show.

351
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,620
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

352
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,980
You've got to try it out for yourself.

353
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,280
Maybe try it out for your next project.

354
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,920
It's what I use for everything we've deployed in the last couple of years, especially now

355
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,780
that Linode has been rolling out MVME upgrades to their rigs.

356
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,140
It's a great time to try them out.

357
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:40,740
I mean, the radical speed up available using MVME is a game changer for certain types of

358
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,740
applications.

359
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,780
In particular, a transactional service like a database or maybe an e-commerce site, it

360
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,980
can operate a lot faster when you use an MVME storage.

361
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,020
I mean, you'll really notice it.

362
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,900
Really anything that does massive parallelism, that's going to be a lot faster with MVME

363
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,660
storage because it's great at density.

364
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,420
It's really good at IOPS per gigabyte.

365
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,940
And even compared to traditional SSDs, you're going to see a big upgrade with MVME storage

366
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,340
on your server.

367
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,420
So if you're a performance hound like me, or your application truly needs that storage

368
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,100
throughput, Linode's team can help you sort through your options with MVME storage and

369
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,340
arrive at the optimum storage configuration for your environment.

370
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,280
I think you're going to find their pricing is great, 30 to 50% less than the major hypervisor

371
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,380
duopolies out there.

372
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,340
And they've got 11 data centers around the world that you can choose from.

373
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,320
So you're going to find something close to you or your customers.

374
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,760
Linode knows how to do this.

375
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,780
They've been doing it for 18 years, and they just keep getting better and better.

376
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,620
They're truly passionate about the technology.

377
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,880
Go try it for real and see for yourself, linode.com slash coder.

378
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
What an opportunity.

379
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,220
You get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you get to support the show and really

380
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,340
try this out, linode.com slash coder, $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, linode.com

381
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,340
slash coder.

382
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,900
Well, listener Chris just wrote in with a short email.

383
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,180
He says, I totally agree with your take on Apple and the Mac in the last episode, and

384
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,780
he feels like Mac OS has been withering on the vine for years.

385
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,880
But he says there's a 900-pound gorilla in the room that we aren't addressing when we

386
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,060
talk about the M1 and the M1 Macs and Intel responding with their chips.

387
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,040
He says, yeah, short term, the pandemic-induced binge buying.

388
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,460
But beyond that, there's really no money long term for the major players.

389
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,700
He thinks the desktop market's dead.

390
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
I'm wondering if you agree.

391
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,620
Do you think long term that the surge we're seeing with these desktops, and I'd say laptops,

392
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,860
is just a temporary thing while people build up for work from home and then the desktop

393
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,860
begins to fade again?

394
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,900
Yeah, I wouldn't say dead, but obviously this is just like people are moving and buying

395
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,220
larger houses in the burbs or even more rurally because they're working from home, and it's

396
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,180
nice to have a home office that has a door.

397
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,820
I think it's the same thing.

398
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Is it dead?

399
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,940
I don't know, right?

400
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,420
I think news of the desktop's demise have been greatly exaggerated.

401
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,780
I agree.

402
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,700
Certainly, particularly for Apple, the insane numbers they're putting up, or probably will

403
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,460
put up for the rest of the year, and I would say like the first quarter next year on the

404
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,940
Mac are going to go down.

405
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:18,220
But part of that is like the market, the people who buy Macs and use Pro Macs are super hungry

406
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,820
for like a good Pro Mac.

407
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,900
If my adventures in Windows and back in Linux and everything fail over the next few months,

408
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,820
I will be looking, do I get another Air, right?

409
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:34,280
Because they haven't released, and in particular the pros, they haven't released a laptop machine

410
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,420
this good in a while.

411
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,280
Their pricing's insane, but it's Apple.

412
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,860
It's a confluence of remote working and they have legitimately released good products.

413
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,380
Put it this way, no one is getting fired for buying Apple right now.

414
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,340
I'd say too, they've created pent up demand for decent machines.

415
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,100
By releasing crappy ones with keyboards that don't work, they have created an excellent

416
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
device.

417
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,100
Maybe they're geniuses.

418
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,180
I mean, maybe, because it seems like if you get them hooked on your platform, you can

419
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,060
kind of stretch things out like that.

420
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,100
But you can't have the escape key.

421
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,620
I wouldn't be surprised if things end up back that way again, but they still have a bit

422
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,620
longer to go.

423
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,980
They have more professional machines to replace.

424
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,300
There's still more pent up demand out there, so this cycle is not over yet.

425
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
You know what?

426
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,660
To the audience, nobody sent in like a productivity hack tip or hardware or anything like that,

427
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,660
which is fine.

428
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,660
Maybe nobody cares.

429
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,660
That's fine.

430
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,220
But nobody sent anything in last week and I was trying to collect a few more, so I'm

431
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,500
going to extend it for one more week just in case you got lazy and you thought, ah,

432
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
somebody will send one in.

433
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,060
No, I needed you to do it.

434
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,820
So go to coder.show slash contact and we're going to just punt it for one week because

435
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,660
honestly, there's a lot going on this week.

436
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:49,340
Some of it's happening today and we want to spend the show talking about that, but we'll

437
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,620
try to get back to it next week with productivity tips to make you work faster and better.

438
00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:00,100
Python, please stop screwing over Linux distros is the headline that caught my attention.

439
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,180
This is a real screamer from Drew DeVault, who seems to really know how to say things

440
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,820
to get people talking.

441
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,540
The man knows how to write a headline.

442
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,580
Yeah, he sure does.

443
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,180
For better or for worse, I might add, because I would say for worse.

444
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,900
Yeah, but he writes the Python community is obsessed with reinventing the wheel over and

445
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,620
over and over and over again, and I thought, all right, this is something our audience

446
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,820
is going to see.

447
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,260
This is probably something we should discuss.

448
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,380
He goes on to write.

449
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,380
Python is a mess.

450
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,940
I really want to like Python.

451
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,200
I've used it for many years in many projects, including Source Hut, which was predominantly

452
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,580
developed in Python.

453
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:43,580
But I simply can't handle it anymore, and I have been hard at work removing Python from

454
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,580
my stack.

455
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,260
He says I manage Python in the only way I think is sane, installing them from my Linux

456
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,820
distributions package manager.

457
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:58,020
He also maintains a few packages for Alpine, but he says he is sick and tired of dealing

458
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,420
with this half hazard approach.

459
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,960
Every one of these package managers, he says, is designed for a reckless world in which

460
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,540
programmers chuck packages into home pip, set up virtual environments and pin their

461
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,660
dependencies to 10 versions and six vulnerabilities ago, and then they ship their computers directly

462
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,580
into production in Docker containers, which aim to do the minimum amount necessary to

463
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:24,540
make their users' private data as insecure as possible.

464
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,240
None of these newfangled solutions address the needs of any of the distros, despite our

465
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,020
repeated pleas.

466
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,740
They all break backwards compatibility with our use case and send our complaints to Dev

467
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,740
Null.

468
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,180
I have seen representatives from every Linux distro making repeated separate pleas to

469
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,380
Python to address their concerns, from Debian to Arch to Alpine to NixOS, plus non-Linux

470
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,020
distros like FreeBSD and Olumos.

471
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Everyone is frustrated.

472
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:53,180
We've all been struggling to deal with Python right now, and Python is not listening to

473
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,180
us.

474
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:59,540
He says he calls on the PSF to sit down for serious, sober engineering work to fix this

475
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,080
problem, drop a list of use cases you need to support, pick the most promising initiative,

476
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,380
and put hours in to make it work properly, today and tomorrow.

477
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,060
Find something you can stick with and make stable for the next 30 years.

478
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,780
So you've been working with Python for a bit.

479
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,780
Has it been this dramatic for you to manage from a developer's end?

480
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,340
I have a very nuanced answer, no.

481
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,900
Is this guy like maintaining a distro?

482
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,900
Is that what he's doing?

483
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,500
Well, he's doing, he's maintaining packages for a couple of distros.

484
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,220
He maintains a few dozen Python packages for Alpine.

485
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,900
All right, but that's not like the use case.

486
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Yeah.

487
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,420
I mean, Alpine's pretty much like the go-to base for a container, which is probably why

488
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:43,340
he's, what he's complaining about is people are just kind of being lazy and pinning their

489
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:49,140
dependencies to, you know, 10 releases back that have tons of vulnerabilities and shipping

490
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,060
it inside a Docker container.

491
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,900
But has he heard of C++ and Clang?

492
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,900
It's worse.

493
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Trust me.

494
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,140
I mean, again, like my use, so the use case I have, right, since you made the comparison,

495
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:04,100
because I'm an end developer, but I have lots of Python environments on all of my machines

496
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,180
now.

497
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:11,260
And I even have some that are like experimental environments, like upping to 3.10, right?

498
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:16,700
Or for instance, before I upped to SQL Alchemy 1.4, or 1.4.1, I don't know, the 1.4 series,

499
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,820
I tried it out just to see.

500
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:25,420
And if it didn't work, I would have just blown away the venv and created a new one and it

501
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,420
would have been cool.

502
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:31,860
I mean, I, from an end developer's point of view, the thing I care about is building my

503
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,580
software or doing client work.

504
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,820
I'm perfectly happy with pip and end and virtual end and all that.

505
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,260
I have been tempted by poetry a few times, but that's mostly because I like the name.

506
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,980
He says part of the problem has been for the past few years, everyone and their cousin

507
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,760
has decided to solve different packaging problems in Python, but they've all created incompatible

508
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,060
messes.

509
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,100
All the solutions end up enjoying varying levels of success in the community, but none

510
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,460
of them are blessed as the official answer and none of them go away since they have users.

511
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,500
And it just becomes a growing and growing horizontal problem.

512
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Yeah.

513
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,460
I mean, the part that I kind of agree with Drew on is the security vulnerabilities, right?

514
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:21,660
It is super easy to pin your packages and your rex.txt to something old and just never

515
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,820
think about it again.

516
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,820
That's bad.

517
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,820
You shouldn't be doing this.

518
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,820
You shouldn't be doing that.

519
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,180
And yeah, you could get like a version of, I don't know why I'm picking on SQLAlchemy,

520
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:36,540
but it's the most common ORM folks in the Python world use, myself included.

521
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,300
You could get an outdated version of SQLAlchemy that has some sort of vulnerability in itself

522
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,260
or one of its dependencies, and that would suck.

523
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,320
I would also argue that that problem exists in literally every programming language in

524
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
the world.

525
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Right.

526
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
Exactly.

527
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,540
I'm not a package manager at all, like the problems that are described here also exist

528
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,160
in Bundler for Ruby.

529
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,540
They exist in, oh my God, Maven.

530
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,260
I haven't done Java in a long time.

531
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,260
I think it's Maven.

532
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,900
I think his point is there's too many options for Python, so it's a broader problem, but

533
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,940
I completely agree.

534
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,860
The fundamental issue is the same.

535
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,280
Sure, but there's too many options.

536
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,580
But if you look at the, I forgot, I think it was the stack overflow stats we looked

537
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,580
at.

538
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,860
We're using the default, the de facto default, which is pip, right, pipenv.

539
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:28,860
So I don't know, I mean, yeah, if you're super new and you make the mistake of not creating

540
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,740
a virtual environment in your project directory and you do like pip install, I don't know,

541
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:40,020
whatever, right, fast API, yeah, you have installed it to your home directory and that's

542
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,020
not good.

543
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,600
I mean, that's bad.

544
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,980
You don't want to be working like that.

545
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:50,220
But that's something, that's almost like saying back in the Objective-C days, it's like Objective-C

546
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,060
is a terrible language because all these people who are new to it don't know how to handle

547
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,060
memory.

548
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,060
Well, they just need to learn how to handle manual memory management.

549
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:04,260
And this for younger folks who don't remember those days or didn't do Objective-C, before

550
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,460
Arc, it was literally like C where you had to manage your own memory, but the Alec retain

551
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,140
release, all that good stuff.

552
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,860
I mean, I feel for him and his frustration, it sounds like he's certainly agitated.

553
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,420
I've also seen other of his posts where he complains about other package managers that

554
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,060
aren't the default.

555
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:27,180
So I think what Python has done, tying it back to my Windows post, Python has become,

556
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:33,500
or frankly is, maybe has been for some time, a very native working and native feeling development

557
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,960
of, I know it's not native code, but like you don't feel like you're doing something

558
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,460
foreign to that dev system you're on.

559
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,540
It just works, to quote Apple, on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

560
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:51,500
So as a developer, I'm go snakey, snakey, kill, kill, kill.

561
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:58,940
It strikes me too, that we have been discussing this core problem for a really long time.

562
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:05,040
The one of shipping out of date libraries inside a container or statically linked to

563
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,320
an application.

564
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,540
This problem just, it won't shut the fuck up.

565
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,420
It just keeps coming up all the time.

566
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,820
And I gotta feel like there's maybe another solution here.

567
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,540
Something that's like mandatory access controls or something that solves this at least from

568
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,020
another angle.

569
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:31,700
Because it almost seems like this is a fundamental compromise in making software that remains

570
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,820
consistent and ships for long periods of time.

571
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,620
I guess, but at some point, hard problems are just hard.

572
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,620
True.

573
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,220
Maintaining distros is hard.

574
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,220
Maintaining repos for distros.

575
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,220
I mean, it's just...

576
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,460
Let's say you had a self-hosted version of Alice that everybody has or something like

577
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,460
this.

578
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,460
Or it's like a version, or maybe you just have a dozen instances up in the cloud that

579
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,460
you manage for them.

580
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,500
So you've described the actual situation, okay, keep going.

581
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,900
What happens if one Python library in the container or a couple need to be updated every

582
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,940
couple of weeks, just when you look at all of them that are in use?

583
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,160
Do you really want to be in that situation where you're constantly having to ship new

584
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,900
versions of the container just because the underlying parts have to be updated once a

585
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
week?

586
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,460
That's kind of a straw man, a little bit, right?

587
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,460
Yeah, you're right.

588
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,780
But you could end up in a situation like that if you really wanted to keep all the software

589
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,780
current.

590
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,780
Well, let's take a real situation, right?

591
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,340
The open SSL vulnerability.

592
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,380
Because I, at the time, was doing mostly Rails.

593
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:29,500
You could get away with not updating open SSL, but that was a very, very stupid idea.

594
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Poor choice.

595
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,660
It was a poor choice.

596
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:36,180
But updating the underlying open SSL lib required you to update a bunch of your gems.

597
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,600
I don't remember the ones off the top of my head, but it was core to Rails itself.

598
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,520
So it was a thing.

599
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,620
That's the kind of thing where it is, yes, rip your hair out, the sky is falling, do

600
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,620
the update.

601
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,460
But like minor point releases for features, I don't know.

602
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:58,180
I tend to look at things like once a quarter-ish, with the exception of security issues that

603
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,740
I'm, like, I do jump on those.

604
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,020
But it's, I mean, it's Unix, man.

605
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,020
Just write a script.

606
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,020
I'm sorry.

607
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:11,820
Well, and the other reality is build for the world as it is and create something that you

608
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,260
can tear down and stand back up with relative ease, because you're going to have to tear

609
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,260
it down and stand it back up.

610
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
Well, it's not just that.

611
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,180
OK, so if you're saying you don't want to manage packages, the alternative is that you

612
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:25,100
have to write my new HTTP library, TCIP, ORM.

613
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,660
It just isn't that big of a price to pay relative to what the alternative cost would be.

614
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:35,460
It is interesting, though, like how many different takes there are on this, even just on Linux,

615
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,460
for example.

616
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,820
Like for the desktop application side, you've got Flatpak and AppImage, which are trying

617
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,900
to solve some of these problems.

618
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,300
You've got Snap.

619
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,300
You've also got containers.

620
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,400
I mean, you've got Charrutes even.

621
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,660
You've got all of these.

622
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,240
You've got 47 different ways to do it.

623
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,180
You really do, because it's clearly been a longtime problem.

624
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,420
And we've come up with a lot of solutions for it.

625
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,140
Wayland, I just have to say it.

626
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,340
I think the solution is just to spam DLLs all over the hard drive.

627
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
That'll solve it.

628
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:10,140
Listen, there is nothing that cannot be solved by dynamically linking.

629
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,140
Shortcut.com slash coder.

630
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,700
Have you ever really been happy with your project management tool?

631
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:20,580
I mean, most are either too simple for a growing engineering team to manage or so complex that

632
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,940
you have to have basically a dedicated person to poke people and prod it to use the tool.

633
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,200
That's where Shortcut comes in, formerly known as Clubhouse.

634
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
It's different.

635
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,840
I mean, it's better in just about every way.

636
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,580
It's a project management tool built specifically for software teams.

637
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
It's fast.

638
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,580
It's intuitive.

639
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,580
It's flexible.

640
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,580
It's powerful.

641
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,580
And all the other kind of things you're going to like.

642
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,300
Like, let's look at some of the highlights here.

643
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,940
It has a team-based workflow.

644
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,500
Individual teams can use Shortcut's default workflows or customize them so they match

645
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,780
the way you work.

646
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,580
And it has organizational-wide goals and roadmaps.

647
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,920
The work in these workflows is automatically tied into a larger company goal.

648
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,100
It just takes one click to move from a roadmap to a team's work to an individual update and

649
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
vice versa.

650
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,500
You really get fantastic visibility.

651
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,540
And it has tight VCS integrations.

652
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,540
If you use GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, whatever, Shortcut ties directly into them so you can

653
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,420
update your progress from the command line.

654
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,820
And I love to tell you guys about this because you know I'm a big fan of this.

655
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,220
They have a very keyboard-friendly interface.

656
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,780
You could rock it with your keyboard.

657
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,900
In fact, they have a power bar, which is a keyboard-friendly interface for the entire

658
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
thing.

659
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,820
You can do virtually anything without touching your mouse.

660
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,820
How great is that?

661
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,460
Go throw that thing in the trash.

662
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,780
They also have iterations planning.

663
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,180
I think this is fantastic because you can set weekly priorities and then let Shortcut

664
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,700
run the schedule for you with accompanying burn-down charts and all the other reporting

665
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,700
you need.

666
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,980
Go give it a try today and support the show.

667
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,500
Shortcut.com slash coder.

668
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,740
Shortcut, formerly known as Clubhouse.

669
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,820
Because you shouldn't have to project manage your project management.

670
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,820
Shortcut.com slash coder.

671
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:01,700
All right, so breaking today as we record the program, the entire Rust development moderation

672
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,340
team has resigned, effective immediately.

673
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,740
Holy crap.

674
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,500
The resignation has been done in protest of the core team placing themselves unaccountable

675
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,500
to anyone but themselves, they write.

676
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,780
Now, they have not shared details.

677
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,540
We're recording this on Monday, November 22nd, so we don't actually know anything yet.

678
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:28,660
However, if you go through all the threads, read different takes, it appears that a situation

679
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:33,580
that may violate the code of conduct came up and the consensus from the core team was

680
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,780
perhaps, or maybe not a consensus, but an individual member, we don't know, believes

681
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,940
that the core team cannot have rules enforced on them by a subcommittee, which would be

682
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,740
the moderation team.

683
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:51,620
However, when you read the formation docs of all of this, it actually to me very much

684
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,940
reads like the core team is held accountable to the moderation team.

685
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,540
And that may be the core of the conflict here.

686
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:02,340
We do not know at this point, but whatever it is, it was significant enough that the

687
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:11,300
entire moderation team in unison resigned this morning and they leave a note saying

688
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,500
that they suggest the Rust team members come to a consensus on a process for oversight

689
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,780
of the core team.

690
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:22,900
Currently, they're answerable only to themselves, which is a property unique to them in contrast

691
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,940
to all other Rust teams.

692
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:33,340
In the interest of not perpetuating unaccountability, we recommend the replacement for the mod team

693
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:38,700
be made by the Rust team members, not on the core team.

694
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,300
Things are not so good in Rust town.

695
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,140
Okay, so I have to make a confession.

696
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,140
Bless me, Fisher, for I have sinned.

697
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,340
I was actually coding all day today and did not see this.

698
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,340
I know, isn't this something?

699
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,700
Well, it just broke up like a couple hours ago.

700
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,060
So when we say moderation, we mean like what I think moderation means.

701
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,740
Like somebody did something, I guess, allegedly inappropriate.

702
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,740
Correct.

703
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,740
Okay.

704
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,060
But this person was like a core developer on Rust.

705
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,060
Allegedly.

706
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,180
We really have very few details, but it seems to be that person was a core team member.

707
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,900
They attempted to moderate the situation.

708
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,100
Was his name Boppy Kotick?

709
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,740
I don't know.

710
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:25,880
Because I feel like just like remove the whole Linux, the open source part of the story.

711
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,380
And I think we've described Activision.

712
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,500
Oh, man, I tell you, it's this kind of stuff.

713
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,460
You know, it always looks it's such a bad look, too, because it is it's bad for I mean,

714
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,460
this is terrible.

715
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,460
If this is true.

716
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,920
I mean, you know, those Facebook posts when somebody says, Oh, I'm so sad.

717
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,140
And then they don't say anything else.

718
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,980
And they want you to ask why they're sad.

719
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,980
Right.

720
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,100
It has that vibe to it.

721
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,420
I immediately on in front of those people.

722
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,420
So no, I don't.

723
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,620
But I do know of them.

724
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,620
It's so frustrating.

725
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,620
It's annoying.

726
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,860
And it has that vibe to it.

727
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,240
But they said the reason why we didn't say anything more is because we chose not to name

728
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,660
names or divulge specifics that could implicate anyone.

729
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,420
Even so, we felt we should state our reasons for resigning to avoid people making up their

730
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,860
own drama.

731
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,780
Which sort of implies this whole thing is drama, because instead of making up our own

732
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,260
drama, we just have their drama now that they've led the drama.

733
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
What does that even mean?

734
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
All right.

735
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,260
So I'm sorry.

736
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,260
I'm hippies.

737
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,260
I owe you an apology.

738
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,500
I need to be more into open source.

739
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
I'm getting back there.

740
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Don't worry.

741
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,500
My Pangolin arrives tomorrow or Wednesday.

742
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,500
Calm down.

743
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,740
I'm going to do the Linux challenge again.

744
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,700
There was no mod team, right?

745
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,940
Like it was you started the project.

746
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,900
You're the dictator until you decide that you're done.

747
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,900
Right.

748
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,020
And in most cases, your little project just dies.

749
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:42,020
Like my empty network because it was like people used it.

750
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,500
Nobody contributed back except for one dude.

751
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Right.

752
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,220
That's probably 98 percent of open source, which is fine.

753
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,300
And then like, you know, ASI HTTP came out and you didn't need it anyway.

754
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
So fine.

755
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,300
Yeah.

756
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,300
But every now and then something goes big.

757
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,300
Right.

758
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,740
So look, is the mod team like a board of directors of sort where they can, like, hold the I guess

759
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,180
the executives, for lack of a better term, accountable?

760
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:08,300
Or are they just like they're to police like the forums and I guess GitHub in this?

761
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,620
Now the mod team is the is the team I have the least knowledge about.

762
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,460
But my understanding is sort of the rust governance structure is the court.

763
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,660
If you look at it like an org chart, essentially, the court team is at the top of the org chart.

764
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,220
And then you have a bunch of different sub teams, well, at least a few different sub

765
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,220
teams.

766
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,540
And the moderation team was one of them.

767
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,980
And yeah, their role was to maintain a certain, you know, the code of conduct, community standard

768
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:33,660
and essentially the hall monitors, if you will.

769
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:39,740
But, you know, as chosen by, I believe, the core team, a lot of large projects that have

770
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:44,640
a lot of people interacting with the project, find that to be a necessary function.

771
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,020
But almost in all of these cases, it always ends up coming back around on somebody in

772
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,740
the court team, ironically, or not, I guess.

773
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,100
I'm sorry, my head is spinning.

774
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:02,500
So okay, so basically, the problem is my team allegedly found out that somebody did somebody

775
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,940
did something that is against their code of conduct, they believe.

776
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:14,020
They went to the core team because this person was a member of said core team and said, I'm

777
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,420
going to make up a name here.

778
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,620
Yo, dog, Steve Jobs over here did something bad.

779
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:22,780
You need to like throw him out or like chastise him in some way.

780
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,740
And the core team was like, um, no, go back to your little cave.

781
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,780
I mean, so is this like when like the cops arrest somebody and the DA is just like, no,

782
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,780
I'm not prosecuting it.

783
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,780
I don't care.

784
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,860
That's what it sounds like to me.

785
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:40,380
I think and you know, the rust team has really always played kind of politics on this stuff.

786
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:48,260
Earlier this year, there was a lot of hoopla around Amazon's influence over the Rust Foundation.

787
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,780
And an individual named Steve came forward and outlined his concerns.

788
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,280
And it just got buried.

789
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,460
And there was never really any information released by the foundation.

790
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:02,540
The Rust Foundation has since chosen an executive director.

791
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,540
And you know, there doesn't seem to be any influence by Amazon, but that whole thing

792
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:10,360
just got quietly put away and just, I don't know, like, there's been a couple other things

793
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,480
I've seen here where I just wish they were a little more transparent about this stuff.

794
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,220
And the problem is, is the moderation team shot first publicly now.

795
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,480
And so it's like, what is the court team even going to say?

796
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,660
What can they even say?

797
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,660
Nothing.

798
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,660
Just keep on trucking.

799
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,660
Maybe.

800
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,020
Since they didn't name the person, you don't have to worry about the Twitter rage, right?

801
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,020
I would just say nothing.

802
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,020
I don't know.

803
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,200
You know, we may see someone step down.

804
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,260
And that may be another indicator of what happened here.

805
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,360
But it's a little unsettling if you're if you're thinking rust is going to be the future

806
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,100
and you see politics being played like this, don't you think?

807
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,980
Well, they seem to keep having these kind of problems, not necessarily moderation, but

808
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:51,620
like weird stuff going on behind the scenes where it just I don't know, it seems like

809
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:57,540
a lot of energy spending on stuff, you know, other than developing rust as a technology.

810
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,540
Maybe that's unfair.

811
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,780
Maybe that's like, I don't understand how modern open source works, which if I don't,

812
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,780
I apologize.

813
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:07,120
But and I think, too, we're still figuring out how to implement some of these code of

814
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,280
conducts as well.

815
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,540
You know, and I think there is a bit of that, like, who's held accountable to it?

816
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,540
In what ways is it enforceable?

817
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,060
Like, there's still kind of ironing that out.

818
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,780
And I wouldn't be surprised if they're holding information behind there's probably some personal

819
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,420
nature to the story as well, right?

820
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,180
I'd like to know more, because it feels like rust is becoming more and more important.

821
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,620
We're talking about, you know, building drivers for the Linux kernel in rust, system 76 is

822
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,580
talking about building a desktop environment in rust, you're seeing rust using so many

823
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,700
different applications and industries now.

824
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,380
Like how much would this matter to any like any big organizations using rust?

825
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:47,900
Because I can't imagine like, someone being like, Oh, no, you know, the moderators are

826
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,900
mad.

827
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,300
Well, now we're not going to use rust, right?

828
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,420
No, especially when Bezos is sending, you know, penis pics to people.

829
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,180
I mean, I just can't see it.

830
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,780
I think what it does is it reduces confidence in the organization.

831
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,220
And that's why it's concerning.

832
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,420
But you're right, it's not this kind of stuff isn't going to impact anybody who's out there

833
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,460
working in rust, really.

834
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,020
But it's a big deal for an entire team.

835
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,140
That's what makes me think there's something, you know, to this, there's some fire to the

836
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,140
smoke.

837
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,100
Listen, I'm sure Reddit or Hacker News, the detectives are on the case.

838
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,100
Suss it out.

839
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,100
Yeah.

840
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,100
So true.

841
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,300
They totally are, right?

842
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,740
I'm sure it just comes down to a good old fashioned human power struggle, like it always

843
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,860
does of some form, I suppose.

844
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,860
Wow.

845
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,360
