00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTORadio, episode 307, recorded April 30th, 2018.

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
Hi everyone, and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly show taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
This episode is brought to you by our two fine sponsors, Digital Ocean and Linux Academy.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
I'll tell you more about those great sponsors as this here show goes on.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Chris.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
While that's great and all, it's not what really matters.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
No, folks, what matters is our host.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
It's Mr. Michael Dominic, and he's located in the one and only Florida.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Hello, Mike.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Hey, Chris.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Hello. Oh, what's the matter?

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
Well, you know, I wanted to see a young woman in August who, shall I say, has a big reputation.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
She sure does.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
And yet, I do not have the capital to afford the Snake Lounge.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Mmm. And what's the point if you can't have the Snake Lounge?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I guess I'm not going to be her endgame.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm of course referring to Taylor Swift.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
The one and only TayTay.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Long time fan you are.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
He was coming from Florida.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Inspiration of many late-night projects, too, funny enough, as it turns out.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah, let's just...

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
We'll move on. We're good.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
We'll move on.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
We probably shouldn't say much more.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
All right, Mr. Dominic.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Well, it's good to be...

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I feel like I haven't talked to you in so long, so it's just super good to talk to you.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
I know.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
I feel that we have fallen into the void somehow.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I mean, we get detached.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
You know, if we don't talk over the podcast, I just end up following your Twitter feed,

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
and you know where that leads to.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
That leads to...

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Taylor Swift, you're yelling at me?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Well, eventually, yeah.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
First, though, it leads to us talking about some of our topics today.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Mike and I have decided it's time to come clean.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
We'll have a little Coder Confessional.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
We like to do this from time to time, despite your preference listening, and it's really...

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
We don't care at all.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
I just want to make that super clear.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Keep sending those Reddit posts.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Keep upvoting them.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Have fun.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
This is why the good podcaster invented chapter markers, my friend.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
There you go.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Noah, you and I both have just had two very different experiences over the last couple

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
of weeks.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
So a week ago, we had Linux Fest Northwest.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
A week before that, Noah comes into town, and like a wrecking ball, Noah comes in here,

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
and we formatted every single PC.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
We reloaded every single operating system.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
So sitting in front of me right now, that includes one, two, three, four, five systems

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
in this room alone that were wiped, reset up, and everything we've learned in the last

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
year was put into these systems.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
And it was a big shift for me, a big transition, a big jump, and it's been really good so far,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
but I'm still in that early phase.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
And you just got done doing sort of a similar thing.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Yeah.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
So first of all, I hate...

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Sure.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
You were correct.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
It didn't work, did it?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Your prediction 305...

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
It didn't last long, huh?

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
...that some bit would flip, a flip-flop would just not quite get out of its position, and

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
I would see a blue screen and throw, flip my shit up on Windows 10.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
So the Windows 10 experiment had lasted two weeks?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Two weeks.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
And of course, at the same time, I'm watching all you hippies at Linux Fest Northwest, and

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
I'm thinking, wow, there's Emma.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
She's flashing all those Pop!

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
OS USB drives.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
They're cool.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Pop!

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
OS 1804.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Huh, I have two USB drives on my desk.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
And now all of my machines but the MacBook we're recording on, because I didn't have

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
time to set up a recording rig on Linux, now run Pop!

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
OS 1804 with Windows and a VM for various...

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, really?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
So you went full Pop!

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
OS, VM, Windows.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
The only time I have turned on my MacBook is to talk to you today.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
Now what was, do you have like a specific moment that was like the straw, or was it

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
a collection of things?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
You know, it's weird, right?

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
Because I know sometimes the listeners think I just like to bash Windows, which is not

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
the case.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I just don't like it.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
And it's pretty clear to me from my tweets at Paul Therot that not to do the Windows

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
people.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
So I really can't care more than you guys.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
And I kind of like Pop!

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
OS.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
I mean, I've made no secret of my general like of System76 for lots of reasons, including

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
they're going to start manufacturing products in Colorado, which I think is great.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I like Linux.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
They are offering an LTS stable version based on Ubuntu.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Everything I target to deploy to with a few exceptions is a Linux Ubuntu server.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
So, you know, it makes sense, right?

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
It's tough to, I'm not doing a lot of iOS anymore.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
I'm not a super big gamer, right?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
I have a two year old.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
So the whole gaming thing kind of went by the boards.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
All right.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Give me some meat here.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
So far I got an appetizer.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
But what is it?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
What is it that so you, this is like you're coming back here.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
You're circling back.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
What is it about Pop! OS that is appealing to you over Gnome?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
And I'm asking you from like, what makes you right?

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, I mean, just stock Gnome on or not stock Gnome, but canonicals Gnome.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
From the standpoint of I'm going to sit down at this thing and I'm going to do my work.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
What is it about Pop! OS that's appealing to you in that's very kind of specific, like

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
I enjoy using this.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
That's what I'm grokking is I enjoy using this.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
So I'm more likely to sit down and work.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
It's like this weird, untangible thing that makes you more productive.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Am I getting the right read here?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
And what is it?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Well, there's a couple of things.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
I was working in Unity for a while, right?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
At least half or part time.

06:17.000 --> 06:25.000
I think Pops implementation of Gnome is maybe less different than Unity.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Although I did also put Gnome 3 on that machine and use that.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I like the Pop! Shop.

06:31.000 --> 06:39.000
I know it's a dumb thing, but like it has Visual Studio, Slack and the basic stuff of my tool chain already in there.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
I actually like the UI.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I know people complain that it's pretty bright.

06:42.000 --> 06:51.000
And frankly, because it's based on Ubuntu, I get it's the same under the hood as my deployment target.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
So I know that's not really the me, why Pop?

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
Well, my laptop is a system 76 machine.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
And if it wasn't Pop, it would have just been stock 1804, right?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Canonical 1804.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
I'll tell you, there's a couple of things that they're doing in it that don't directly speak to me,

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
but I think could be appealing to someone like yourself.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
And Carl tweeted you about this, but they put a lot of work into that installer.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
And one of the things that Ian at system 76 was telling me while I was barbecuing was,

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
they have really cut the boot time down on that Pop OS.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
And they've really, really cut down a lot of the repeated tasks that you have to do when you're setting up a new system.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Like the installation process can be done on an MV&E system with a good processor.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
It could be done in just a couple of minutes.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Your install finishes in just a couple of minutes.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
And then it brings you through a post-installation process where you can set up encryption and accounts and stuff like that.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
And it's slick.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
They're doing a really good job there.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
And the Pop Shop, like you mentioned, is a collaboration between them and elementary OS.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
And it's pretty nice.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
They have some custom artwork that they've done in there, some banner images and whatnot that aren't in any other distribution.

07:59.000 --> 08:07.000
And lastly, and I think maybe the most appealing, they are implementing a recovery partition process,

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
which I don't really understand why other Linux distributions don't do this.

08:11.000 --> 08:20.000
SUSE did this back in the early 2000s, and what it essentially is, it's just like on a Windows machine that you get from Dell.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
And you can recover without having to get an ISO, without having to write a USB disk.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
You can boot into that environment and get your system back up and working again.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
And that seems like a pretty nice feature that really is, I think,

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
driven by the fact that they get support calls on their hardware and they have an idea.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Yeah, right.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
They have an idea of the things their customers are struggling with.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
And so they can add something to Pop OS that other distributions don't really have an insight into.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
And that's starting to get interesting.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah, I feel like, you know, a lot of my affinity for Pop has to do with,

08:55.000 --> 09:03.000
I see it as inherently more, not inherently, but theoretically in the future,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
it's going to be more tightly integrated with their hardware.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
And I know they would not appreciate this label, but really Apple as they ought to have been, right?

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Like it's Linux, it works with their hardware.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
You know, like one thing, and I know they didn't do this, it's just 1804 has a newer kernel.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
My AMD graphics card on that dumb Dell works out of the box, no problem.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
And I didn't have to do any crazy like compile this from source.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
And of course I can do that because I have to compile my own stuff all the time.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
But I don't want to, right?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
That's part of why the recovery partition works.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
It's really kind of about getting back up and running as fast as possible.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Right, multi monitor just works.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
High DPI works.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
I have a 4K monitor connected to the machine.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah, I think it's a solid system.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
You know, I do worry about a few things in Pop.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
Like it is not super clear where they're going with it.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
They did a lot of pretty work on the installer.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
But I find that kind of odd because you install for like five minutes because it's very fast install.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
And then you work at it for months or a year or whatever.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
This is the point I brought up to them.

10:18.000 --> 10:27.000
I said, guys, if things are all going right, customers are buying System76 machines with it already installed.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
And if they're having to reload their OS a lot, isn't that a bad sign?

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Why all of the effort on the installer?

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
And they were kind of cagey, but I think it's two reasons.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
The first reason that they're totally 100% upfront about is we feel like it's initial impression thing.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
You know, you try out Pop OS, you've heard of System76.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
You try it, you go, holy shit, this is like one of the best installations I've ever had on Linux.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
This is so great. I'm going to go buy a laptop.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
I don't know.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
It's one of the prettiest installs I've ever seen.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah, if that translates to laptop purchases, I don't know.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
But you know what?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
It's an interesting experiment.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
So let them have it.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
But the other thing that they're not really saying, but it's kind of obvious with all of the way they're positioning this,

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
is I think they want Pop OS to be bigger than just System76 hardware.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
Oh no, it works out of the box on my Dell Uber workstation.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Why not?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Why not?

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
And if you think about it, it could be really great to unify a business environment like yourself.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
So you got some System76 rigs, you got some Dell rigs, you got like maybe an HP Spectre and a NUC.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Put Pop OS on all of them.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Yeah.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
You could do the same thing with Ubuntu proper though.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
So that's why I go back to there's got to be a nut in there.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
Like for me, like with plasma, it's like coming back to peak computing.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
I've been using this phrase a lot and I apologize if you heard me say peak a lot recently.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
But it really is this for me.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
When I close a window and then I open it the next day, it opens right back where I left it.

11:54.000 --> 12:02.000
And when I have been working on my machine hard all day long, everything is still super fluid.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I can right click on a directory and say open a terminal here.

12:05.000 --> 12:11.000
I can really use the machine the way I want to use it.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
And it has downsides when you have that much flexibility and power.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
And that's mostly in the fact that you could be lost for years in just configuring and tweaking the defaults.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.000
But if you can kind of find a balance there and find a strategy, it is, man, I don't know.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I don't know how to describe it.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
It's like it's balance.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Yeah, well, it's more it's just I'm really excited.

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
I'm really excited by a really professional workstation desktop environment that I can load on any hardware I want.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And so I think you hit it.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
But I'll go and finish.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
No, that's really it.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
That's the thrust of it.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
So I think so because I didn't really have a good answer for your question the first time.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
I think I now understand, look, let me Dr. Phil myself here.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
The truth is, I don't have a valid hard reason right now.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
It could have just as easily been stock 1804.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Let me tell you what the reason is.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
If you go to their website right now and you look at Pop!

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
OS, they tell you this is for developers doing AI, IoT makers.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
It's all marketing and I get it.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
Where I've been trying to find an Apple machine for me and Apple is very much not saying this is not for you.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
This is for video editors.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
This is for artists.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
And you know what?

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Given the choice, I'll take the one that's for me.

13:26.000 --> 13:34.000
And I get that in a practical sense, the only – like I like some of the keyboard shortcuts because I'm used to Pop 1710 and they're basically the same in 1804.

13:34.000 --> 13:43.000
But I hope and I believe that if this is the way they're marketing their system, they're going to continue to focus on that market, right?

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I'm going to SL it.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
It could one day match Snow Leopard.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Well, wow.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Okay.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I mean, that's a high bar for you.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
So that's – I'm going to think about that for a second.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Not today.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
It's not there yet.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
There's still some rough edges and things.

13:59.000 --> 14:09.000
You know, one thing that you've got to give them, assuming that this hardware business holds out, they can cut a check to fly somebody out there to the office to work on something.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
They can hire a developer to bang something out.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
They can re-task one of their employees.

14:15.000 --> 14:28.000
When we first started talking about Pop OS, I looked at it from a perspective of how could a hardware company that's trying to get into a position where they can build their own stuff – they're not even there yet.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
They're not even off the ground yet.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
They've got to get inventory management figured out.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
They've got to hire factory workers.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
They've got to hire janitorial staff.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.000
I mean, there is so much more than just building a PC that they have to learn now.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
That some people make their entire career.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
And so you're telling me these people, a team of about 25, is going to launch an operating system?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
That seemed crazy to me.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
But there's a different way to look at it.

14:55.000 --> 15:04.000
And the other perspective could be they have way more capital and resources than a ton of other distributions out there.

15:04.000 --> 15:13.000
A lot of other distributions are built off the backs of volunteers, volunteer hardware, volunteer money, with a few paid developers.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Like in the case of Debian, perhaps.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Or Arch.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Look at Arch.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Do they?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Maybe they do.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Do they have the funds?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Arch does.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
But do they hire a random contractor to just bang something out if they need it?

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
Or fly someone from elementary OS out to Colorado so they can collaborate on an installer three times?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
I don't know.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
I don't know if they do those things.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
And System76 is in a position to finance that.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
Maybe not at the great extents that Apple or Microsoft or Google could.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
But maybe at an extent greater than perhaps other outfits could.

15:46.000 --> 15:58.000
And so if they can build on top of a solid Ubuntu base and just chip away over the next five years at different aspects, they might have something here.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
I asked them if they're going to stick with the LTS or if they're going to track current.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
And they're going to track current Ubuntu releases.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
So they're going to have a six-month iteration window here.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Right.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
And my understanding is you can optionally stay on the LTS.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Oh, yeah, maybe.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I don't know.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
I didn't clarify that.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Well, maybe I'm wrong.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Maybe they will just update it.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I don't know.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
See, that is something that could frighten me.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I wonder if you would like elementary OS when the next elementary OS comes out.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Because it's another level of refinement, I think, right now.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Because they've just been at it for longer.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
So think about my needs, though.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Right?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
And they're similar to your needs, except I don't do video editing.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
So I guess they're different.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
But in theory, this Dell is souped up.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
It's got 32 gigs of RAM.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
So this Dell is going to be fine for a long time.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
I will eventually need a new laptop because my Galago sounds like it's going to take off

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
and do an airstrike.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Yeah.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Which maybe I should just send it to them.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
Because they keep telling me to be fair, they've been good about that.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
And I need it so I don't want to mail it to Colorado.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
But I will eventually have to do that.

17:01.000 --> 17:07.000
When I'm in the market for a new computer, if POP is working for me, let's say six months

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
in the future, I decide, you know what?

17:09.000 --> 17:16.000
I want a different laptop or whatever or I hire somebody and they need a machine.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Don't you think the first thing I'm going to do is call them or look on their website

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
for a promotion and say, well, geez, I'm using POP anyway.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
I know guaranteed this will work with them.

17:27.000 --> 17:35.000
I don't want to say the big A here, but for my needs, and they do not like this characterization,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
but from the business perspective, it is the Linux Apple.

17:38.000 --> 17:46.000
Because if it doesn't work out of the box, you know, I challenge you to buy a Dell Ubuntu

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
machine from the consumer site and call their support line and watch as the lady's head

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
explodes.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
You call System76, it's all they sell.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
So you're saying that the POP OS strategy in your case could actually work.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
If you end up loading this on different hardware and you really like it.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I already did on a Dell.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Yeah.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Okay.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
And you really like it, then this may actually drive a laptop sale in the future for you.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Well, it's an incentive, right?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
So let's fast forward to like the end of the year.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
Right, the end of the year, assuming I don't lose a tremendous amount of money.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Assuming you're still in business.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Right.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Like that's when you want to do purchases, right?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Generally.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Get in that tax window.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
If someone's going to say, hey, why don't you sell your laptop and buy a new one?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Okay.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
If I'm using POP, I'm probably going to almost exclusively look at theirs.

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
Because I hate the process of buying Windows hardware, loading Linux on it, having to go

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
on like the IRC or telegram and having people say, hey, dumb ass, didn't you know that,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
you know, that exact model of AMD won't work till the next kernel version?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Like, no, I don't know that.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
And why should I know that?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Right.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
And then Dell being like, oh, well, you loaded a different operating system.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
So sending it back to you, which is exactly what happened.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
So because I failed to reinstall Windows 10 on it when I set it up.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
So I got stuck with that Optiplex.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
But actually, guess what?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I got the Mac Pro that I wanted.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
It's the Dell Optiplex running POP OS, and I'm happy.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
So shove it, Apple.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
All right.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
All right.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I will.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
I'm sorry.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Yeah.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I'll make my case, although you are surprisingly convincing me.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I didn't think you were going to do it.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Well, I'm just trying to get my job done, right?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
I don't care.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Like, I don't care about the distro wars.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
I'm sure elementary is fabulous.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
In fact, don't they employ the elementary guy?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Yeah, Cassidy.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Cassidy, right?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Yeah.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
He's one of the elementary contributors.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
I mean, Fedora's wonderful, but I don't want to reinstall every two months.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
No, that's fair, actually.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
I really can't argue with anything that you just said that all actually makes a lot of

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
sense to me.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
So I will attempt to give you my position, but I like where you're coming at with this.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
I really like where your head's at, and the fact is you've thought it through, and it

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
does seem like it could have a lot of long-time potential upside, but I'll give you my case.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
First, I'm going to mention DigitalOcean, do.co slash coder.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
Go there to get a $100 credit when you sign up with a new account.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
This is a big deal because you can build applications on DigitalOcean in seconds, and a $100 credit

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
will last you forever.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
It's a great opportunity to play with their mix and match droplets, a flexible droplet

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
plan.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
It's about $15 a month.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
You choose the CPU, the memory, the disk, whatever is best for your application.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
You mix and match.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
You've got a rocking system.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
You can get deployed in production in less than 55 seconds, or if you want to do some

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
testing or some learning, DigitalOcean is perfect for that.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
I run a couple of DO droplets just for myself, personal droplets.

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
Nextcloud and things like IRC backend servers, and we have a whole fleet of DigitalOcean

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
droplets for Jupyter broadcasting.

20:52.000 --> 20:59.000
Mumble servers, and streaming systems, and audio servers, and syncing servers, and backup

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
RTMP servers, and backup website servers, and backup download servers.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
I mean, it's incredible because in less than 55 seconds, you'll have an entire system.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Whatever resource level you need, you can get it deployed.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
It's a one-click to get the entire OS with the application, say like Ubuntu LTS with

21:16.000 --> 21:24.000
Nginx, or Ubuntu, my go-to, Ubuntu LTS 16.04 right now, but it'll be 18.04 soon, with Docker

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
installed from the official Docker repositories with the correct keys installed so everything

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
is signed, good to go.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Good to go.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
In 55 seconds, you've got an LTS system with Docker ready for you to just load something

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
off of Docker Hub.

21:36.000 --> 21:42.000
And I go from no system at all, in two minutes and 30 seconds, I've got an entire application

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
running, and I'm hitting it on the web.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
And whatever you're doing, it's like that.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
And then if you ever get stuck, they've got great support and great documentation.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
So go try it out, do.co slash coder.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Get a $100 credit, if it's a new account, and play around.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
My favorite system is just three cents an hour.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
So I think that $100 credit will get you pretty far.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
do.co slash coder.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Thanks DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
So I had a realization that I like new and shiny on some of my systems, but then there

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
are systems that I want to be incredibly boring, really boring.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
I'd even considered never updating them if it was practical, but of course that never

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
works out.

22:25.000 --> 22:33.000
And so I've been trying different stuff really for about a year to the day, a year and about

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
three weeks.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Just, I don't know.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
We started out with Arch and Gnome, and we've tried a whole bunch of different things.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
If people want the whole story, they can listen to Linux Unplugged.

22:43.000 --> 22:51.000
But at the end of this year, I started having people in the different communities kind of

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
come to me and say, hey, I think there's something going on here that you might want to take

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
a look at.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
You might like this, because I know some of the problems you've had recently, because

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
I was grousing on Linux Unplugged.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
And what essentially people were telling me was, take a look at Kubuntu.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Now, mind you, I've never been a Kubuntu user.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
In fact, I've always kind of thought of it as being the least attractive of the Ubuntu

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
flavors.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
80.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:15.000 --> 23:21.000
And Plasma Desktop is fine.

23:21.000 --> 23:27.000
But the last Kubuntu LTS was based on Plasma 5.5, which was not a solid release.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
So I just had a bad impression.

23:29.000 --> 23:37.000
However, to the Plasma developers' credit, since 5.5, every single version of the desktop

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
has gotten progressively better, uses less memory, more stable, more polished, better

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
themes, better art, better icons, better menus, better defaults, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
And they've started now that they've gotten to that point releasing LTS versions of the

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
desktop and of Qt.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
So with Kubuntu 18.04, the stars and the planets all lined up.

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
And you've got a base Ubuntu LTS with an LTS kernel as well.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Then you've got LTS Qt framework.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Then you've got LTS Plasma Desktop on top of that.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
So from top to bottom, the entire stack is LTS, and in Kubuntu's case, that's three years,

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
three years of the same Qt version, three years of the same desktop environment,

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
three years of the same base Ubuntu OS 18.04.

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
And that's also at the time when the Plasma Desktop is faster and uses less resources

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
than some of the other desktops like GNOME.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
And it's also my third or fourth go of trying Plasma.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
So I've kind of learned all the shit I've got to change to make it usable for me.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
And now I've kind of internalized all of that.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
And so I'm more receptive to using the UI.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
And it's sort of lined up with this whole LTS thing.

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
And so we decided to test it at Linux Fest Northwest because if we are going to break

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
anything, it's during the two-day shit show that is Linux Fest Northwest.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
Yeah, it's bad. It breaks every year. Every year it breaks.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Not this year.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Really?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Not this year.

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
This year, it was so easy that Chase, who was running the board, was actually playing pinball

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
on his laptop during the live streams because there was just nothing for him to fix.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Yeah.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Okay, so what do you attribute that?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I mean, that's a dramatic change from last year.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
I attribute it mostly to PulseAudio, OBS, and the Plasma Desktop all kind of having

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
multiple years of iteration now.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Okay.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
And we started using them early, and now they've been around for a while.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
And I think it's a solid 1804 release.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
I think 1804 absolutely played a part of that.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
And you combine it with a pretty stable stack.

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
And I don't know, I think Kubuntu is a really, really professional-grade workstation.

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
If you liked Windows 7, as if, say we're going to take Windows 7, and all the years since

25:59.000 --> 26:05.000
Windows 7 were just like cool advancements of Windows 7, like totally redoing the file

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
manager, totally changing the modularity of the desktop, adding cool notification drawer

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
support, and just all these things you could ever possibly dream of.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
And you put it into Plasma, and then you take about two years now of, well, how do we make

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
that look better?

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
How do we make that default a bit better?

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
How do we tweak that theme?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
How do we get a better icon there?

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
How do we get high DPI support a little bit better?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
And it's close.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
It's really getting there.

26:31.000 --> 26:36.000
I still have about a two-day, got to change all the defaults process that I go through,

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
but it's getting better.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
It's getting a lot better.

26:38.000 --> 26:44.000
And I've got it now running on, so I've got five systems in front of me, six total inside

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
this room, a seventh upstairs, and they're all solid.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
They're all super solid.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
I have three questions.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Four, but one's just preliminary to clarify because something you said I think was confusing

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
for the audience.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
So call this index zero.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
Everything was running on KDE or Kubuntu, so no Mac.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
That's what I mean.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
No Mac.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
No Mac.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Linux Fest Northwest.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Right.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Okay.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
So first question, does this put you out of the market for a Mac Pro and iMac?

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Is it possible for you to do everything you want now on Linux?

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
It's getting really, really, really close because I'm doing a lot less video.

27:21.000 --> 27:27.000
If I start up another big video project, I derail that progress, but yeah.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
Yeah, I'm also experimenting with replacing a couple of the Adobe tools, and that's going

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
pretty well, too.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
Now, why do you think video is the roadblock?

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
It's pretty hard for me to replace Final Cut, especially if I'm doing...

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Okay, so it's a tool chain issue.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Yeah.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Yeah.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
But there are competitors.

27:48.000 --> 27:54.000
So just this week, I covered it in Linux Action News 51, there was a large GIMP update that

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
added the ability to read attributes from Photoshop files that GIMP did not previously

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
have, which means some of the old art assets...

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Yeah, it's nice.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
Some of the old art assets that we could not open in GIMP before are now openable.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
I don't know if that means I'm going to use it, but I'm going to experiment.

28:08.000 --> 28:14.000
And then during all of this reload, I swapped out Audition, which is my multitrack audio

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
editing tool for something called Reaper, which runs on Linux.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
It doesn't require a Creative Cloud subscription either, which is a nice perk.

28:21.000 --> 28:27.000
And I'm giving that a go for editing this week on Plasma.

28:27.000 --> 28:33.000
So the only thing you're saying that seems a little like makes my skin crawl is that

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
you have two days of changing things to make it usable.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
See, that wouldn't pass the mustard for me.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Yeah.

28:40.000 --> 28:46.000
I do think that it's two days of not constant changes, but I open up the console, and I

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
realize, oh, I like the fonts a little bigger.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
I open up Dolphin, which is the file manager, and I realize I prefer the tree layout versus

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
large icons.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
But this is stuff you would do on a Mac, theoretically.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Oh, yeah, 100%.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Yeah, 100%.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
Okay, so it's not like you have to radically modify things to...

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
No, it's nothing too weird.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
It'd be really pretty much, with the exception of Gnome 3, it's pretty much like that for

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
everything.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Gnome 3, I just have to load a few extensions.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
You know, Gnome 3 is pretty good.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
It's pretty good.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
You just got to load a couple of extensions to make it good all the way.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
I like Spotify, which I think uses the Gnome extensions.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
It looks like it does.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Yeah, well, it uses the media thing where it can come up in there.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Yeah, it's nice, right?

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
It's nice.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
But Plasma will support that as well.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
So is this the year of the Linux desktop?

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Is that what we're saying?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Can we declare it?

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Can we throw the flag into the...

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
I don't know.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
I really was...

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
You know me, a couple of weeks ago, I'm like, this is not looking good.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
I'm having a lot of troubles, having a lot of stability issues.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
I could hang out here for three years.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
I could absolutely hang out here, let Wayland figure itself out, let all that stuff kind

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
of get settled, see where Gnome goes, see how all this canonical IPO stuff shakes out.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
I could totally hang here for three years.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
And I feel like...

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
That is the 800-pound Gorilla Write canonical is filing for an IPO.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Yeah.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
And you know what was awesome is we had everything all set up and all of a sudden one of the

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
machines started crashing.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
And of course it was our broadcast machine.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
So the live stream started crashing, our live stream recording started getting interrupted.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
We're like, oh, we just went through all this work and now we're having stability issues.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
What's going on?

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
Well, we dug into it and realized we had a bad power supply.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
But at that point, we were kind of getting worried about the installation because we

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
started having like weird application errors too.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
And we weren't sure about data corruption.

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
So we sat around and we're like, for like a good two hours, we're like, wow, man, what

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
do we get?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Do we kind of go buy new hardware and replace this machine?

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
Like, what are we going to do so we know this is 100% reliable?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
It runs 24-7.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
And if it has an issue, that means the show doesn't get done.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
So we want it to be 100% reliable.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
We kicked it around.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
And then, you know what we could do?

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
We said to each other, me and Noah, you know what we could do?

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
We could just swap the drives from the machine I have upstairs as my workstation.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
It's the same exact identical build.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
It's just got like a better video card.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
And you just take the disks out.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
You just put them out, take the MVD drives out, put them in the other one, swap them,

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
and you set it down.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
You boot it up and everything works.

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
There's no weird like reactivation of licenses that Windows might have.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
There's like, you know, like I didn't have like one version of Mac OS on this machine

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
and another version of Mac OS on this machine because, you know, it can't update to the

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
new high Sierra.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
None of that.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
None of that.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
It just the machines didn't care.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
The OS didn't care.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
And that abstraction away from the hardware.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I don't give a shit about the product.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I don't need it to be a trash can.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
I don't need it to be a beautiful iMac.

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
I just need it to be very, very fast and have a lot of disk.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
And I put it under my table and I never look at it ever.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Creature brother.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
And it was so nice.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Black box.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
That's all I want.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
It was so nice not to have to worry about any of that.

31:49.000 --> 31:55.000
And this having this, you know, generic workstation grade desktop environment on top of a workstation

31:55.000 --> 32:01.000
grade Linux OS was really, really good and very empowering for where we were at because

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
we went from having a major problem to solving it.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
And it was, you know, minutes to solve the problem.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
I really think if I if I stay out of video, which I don't know if I'm going to be able

32:12.000 --> 32:18.000
to, but if I stay out of video, I really think I would not need a Mac at all in my life anymore.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
And I really would be very happy.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
It's not even like a compromise that I'm finally achieving.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
It's I would really enjoy this.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
I have I mean, have a lot of plasma in front of me right now and I'm very happy about it.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Yeah, no.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
Next week I'm going to try to record on pop and I think it's going to be where is this

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
going to go?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Where is it?

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
As long as you can install Chrome, really.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
That's all you really need.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Right.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I mean, that's the fun as heard on last episode.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Right.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Damn it.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
He went back to that.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
How do we do that?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
All right.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Well, I do have we should move on.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
We have many more things actually to get to, including some random arse tweets by you.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
But also, I had a chat with some blokes from Microsoft a couple of weeks ago and I'd love

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
to.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Poor bastards.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
You're telling me.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
I'd love to.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
I'd love to share with you what they told me and then maybe a bit more on our development

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
desktop topic.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
But let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy for sponsoring this episode of Quota Radio.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
I was just having a chat with the folks from Linux Academy on Friday about coming down

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
to visit.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
I don't know if it's going to materialize yet.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
They're down in Tejas.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
And they're doing a bunch of live streaming.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
And I said, guys, we just crushed it with Linux Fest.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
We've really got something dialed in here.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Would you be interested in the Jupiter broadcasting treatment?

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Would you like us to come down there and get this all nailed down for you?

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
And it may happen.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
We may one day be doing a quota radio from the offices of Linux Academy.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
I don't know.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
It's all in the early days.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
But I love it.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
They're so passionate about this stuff.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
And that is what I get excited about.

33:47.000 --> 33:52.000
And they just released a whole bunch of new content.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
It really is just nonstop at Linux Academy.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
And they've got these real hands-on labs.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
They deploy a real environment.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Then you take that scenario-based lab.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
And they'll spin it up.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
If it's on AWS, Azure, if it's just a standard Linux course, or you want to learn some OpenStack.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
And then to supplement all of this, something I haven't mentioned.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
But don't forget, they've also got the Scale Your Code interviews.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
You may remember me talking about those.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
They're all still available online.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
You can learn from people that have solved real problems in the industry.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
There's over 1,200 hours of in-depth video content.

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
Plus there's labs, flashcard contents, hands-on training, and instructor mentoring whenever you need it.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
You may have heard these ads before and have never pulled the trigger.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Now is the time.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
That's the one that has an S.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
You support the show.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And you sign up for a free seven-day trial.

34:44.000 --> 34:51.000
And go check out 70-plus new courses, challenges, and learning activities that have been slammed down into Linux Academy.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Man, they're hustling these days.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring this here Coder Radio program.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
Now we move on in the program, Mr. Dominic.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
I feel good.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I feel like you and I just sort of came to a new understanding.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I like your Pop OS.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I think you understand what I'm coming at with the Kubuntu thing.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Like, we're coming to a new piece.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Maybe we're finally done.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
We found the good news of Tux.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
And by the way, we'll never be done.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Yeah, assuming this doesn't blow up on our face, which of course it will.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Oh, damn it.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Damn it.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
That's how it goes.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
That's how it goes.

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
Well, so you've been pretty busy on the tweeters, besides just reloading machines and talking with Paul Therot.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
So I got busy talking with some folks on Microsoft.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
And it actually ended up leading to a phone call.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
And to their credit—

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Are you leaving us for the mothership?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Is that what's happening?

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
No, it's just I had to wrap my head around this Azure Sphere OS thing.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
You know, like, what?

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
Microsoft is shipping a Linux kernel now?

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I mean, that is really weird.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
It was only a matter of time.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Yeah, that's what a lot of folks have said, I suppose.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
I just couldn't get it.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
I couldn't really grok it.

36:02.000 --> 36:10.000
So I ended up getting to talk with one of the individuals I think that's primarily responsible for the entire project.

36:10.000 --> 36:15.000
And it sounded like it really came down to a few things.

36:15.000 --> 36:23.000
Number one, an OS that was best suited for real-time operating system type tasks on really, really low resources devices.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
You know, think a hairdryer with a digital display.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
And then ranging to more sophisticated IoT devices.

36:30.000 --> 36:39.000
And then there was also the fact that people are like experimenting in like the skunk works of these different companies.

36:39.000 --> 36:48.000
And when they're experimenting, they're not grabbing the Windows source code off of kernel.org and then building their apps against that and their devices.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
They're grabbing the Linux source code because that's what they can get their hands on.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
They don't have to call up some suit and get a license.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
They don't have to have some sort of business agreement or some sharing code agreement.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
They just go check out the code.

37:01.000 --> 37:09.000
And Microsoft basically in my conversation with them said, in not so many words, that they can't really get around that fact.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
They can't get around the fact that the Linux source code is just available for you to grab and start building against anytime you want.

37:14.000 --> 37:21.000
And so what's happening is companies are getting, you know, half a mile down the road with these projects and then looking around.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Well, how are we actually going to make this sustainable?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
How are we going to update it?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
How are we going to get telemetry back on crashes and things like that?

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
And they don't have an answer.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
But they're not going with anything that Azure or Microsoft can do because it's not built on Windows.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
And they've been watching this and they said they were working on this thing for four years,

37:37.000 --> 37:43.000
adding in different components the entire time, planning to build it off of Linux because of this problem.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
That was something I hadn't even considered, you know, the lazy developer factor.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
They just want to grab the code and start working.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
Right. They don't want to worry about talking to the players.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
What did you think, though, when you saw Microsoft shipping a Linux OS?

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
No, you really were not surprised at all. I mean, that's a pretty big deal.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Come on.

38:00.000 --> 38:06.000
I have to say I wasn't that surprised only because I've also had some dealings in a much less public way with them.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
And all roads lead to Azure Billings.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Yes.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Right.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
It does.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
I honestly.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Yep.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
And this ties into my tweets with Paul Therot.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
I think the fellows at Microsoft are fine people.

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
But it's clear to me that Linux, Windows, Mac, God forbid, BSD.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
It's fine.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Business.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Right.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
As long as you're using something from Azure.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Yeah.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Which this will.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Yeah.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Oh, absolutely.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
In fact, that's the best part.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
In fact, you have to.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Yeah.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
It really is the best.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
It's the whole security service.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Yeah.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
So it's got this whole telemetry monitoring and secure update channel that.

38:47.000 --> 38:56.000
So when you read the press releases, you'll see that Microsoft has said that it's a Linux core with the security lessons that they've learned with Windows built in.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
So I had to know what those were.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
And I said, what are those?

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
What are those lessons?

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
And it sounds like it's a few things.

39:01.000 --> 39:09.000
But the things that mattered the most to me were the way they slip stream updates to Windows and the way that they do crash collections like the Dr.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
Watson of today where it collects crashes and submits it back.

39:13.000 --> 39:20.000
Those are very, very underutilized, underserved aspects of the IoT market right now.

39:20.000 --> 39:33.000
Well, and you know, for me, this is really interesting because Microsoft, which they now call Azure IoT and Microsoft used to be called Windows Embedded, is actually a pretty powerful development platform.

39:33.000 --> 39:47.000
And I can see a world where it makes economic sense because there won't be that Windows tax, right, for folks to develop their next great IoT project, their next great sensor using Azure spheres.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
And they just get all this telemetry and crash reporting for free.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
And the security guarantee that is, you know, that goes along with Microsoft.

39:54.000 --> 40:03.000
I know for our audience, that might not mean a lot, but in the enterprise, the Microsoft stamp of approval still does carry quite a lot of weight, as does the Linux talks.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
So the marriage of the two is I know it's so clever on their part.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
It's really cunning.

40:09.000 --> 40:22.000
And they can build on what's what Microsoft is super well known for, like Azure services, metric collection, shipping updates, working with companies at a business to business level.

40:22.000 --> 40:31.000
They can think it leverages all of that stuff that they have a good reputation for and completely leverages all the stuff Linux has a good reputation for.

40:31.000 --> 40:38.000
And and totally like if this was based around Windows IoT or whatever they would call it, it would be a dud.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
It would be a dud. But now it is based around Linux.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
We're talking about this weeks later. It's still something people are chewing on, still actively commenting on.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
And it is clearly because of the marriage of these two best of things.

40:51.000 --> 40:58.000
And in a way, after talking to them, I'm like, yeah, I think only really Microsoft is going to solve this because Microsoft can sit back and say, we don't care.

40:58.000 --> 41:03.000
We can be an implementation detail. We're part of your product. We don't have to be the product.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
Our label doesn't. But let me let me let me slow you down just a little.

41:07.000 --> 41:18.000
So the beauty, the value of Windows IoT or Windows embedded, which I know are technically two different offerings, but Windows IoT is basically replaced.

41:18.000 --> 41:28.000
Right. Yeah. Windows embedded is that you can develop in Visual Studio using Microsoft tools, which comes in a bunch of pre-built libraries that really help you.

41:28.000 --> 41:40.000
If you're using supported hardware, I will bet you I will bet you a beer that that same framework and compatibility will work on this Azure on this Azure spheres platform.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That would make sense. Why not, too? Right.

41:45.000 --> 41:51.000
Why not? That's that that is actually their advantage. Right. That's why they for better or for worse.

41:51.000 --> 41:59.000
I mean, this is my opinion. I know people are going to email. They right now have the best development environment and the best.

41:59.000 --> 42:05.000
Frankly, development platform for these embedded type, I hate the term IoT because it's such a nice word.

42:05.000 --> 42:13.000
I know I prefer it really is just embedded development. But for these type of IoT devices.

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
And you get the Microsoft stamp again for your for your customers.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
Yeah, you know, and you're going to you can you can say, yeah, well, we built it on top of that platform there for Microsoft.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
So, you know, it could even be it could even be I got.

42:27.000 --> 42:36.000
Actually, the more I think about it, it could even be a selling point if I knew that some smart platform device that I got was being supported via Azure sphere.

42:36.000 --> 42:43.000
I actually would feel better about that because then I know they've got a 10 year update channel supported and maintained by Microsoft,

42:43.000 --> 42:50.000
which is the number one thing I hate about IoT devices right now is that they're abandonware, essentially.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
And then they just become little security vulnerabilities that are just waiting to be exploited.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
Yeah. The commercial space is awful.

42:57.000 --> 43:05.000
Now, this this probably, if you think about it, is just the beginning, really, of this kind of thing.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
I bet you there are more shoes to drop. Look, look at the full context of it.

43:09.000 --> 43:15.000
You have.NET Core that comes out. You have Visual Studio Code that comes out.

43:15.000 --> 43:20.000
You have PowerShell Core that comes out. You've got Windows up on GitHub.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
There is this and then now we have this Azure Sphere OS.

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
There is this building and building and building of momentum.

43:27.000 --> 43:39.000
And in each individual case, what I think is important for us to remember here is that they represent about three or four years of work in each case behind the scenes.

43:39.000 --> 43:48.000
Like to them, to the folks at Microsoft, they were surprised that anybody gave a shit that Linux was baked into this thing.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
They legitimately were taken by surprise.

43:53.000 --> 44:01.000
They didn't think anybody was going to think that was a big deal because it's the Azure team and the Azure team has a lot of Linux running on Azure.

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
They're working with Linux every single day. They've already got a switch OS that's based on Linux in the Azure services.

44:06.000 --> 44:16.000
So to them, to the guys I was talking to in the Azure team, they already live, eat and breathe Linux every single day.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
And they didn't understand why this was a surprise to anybody on the outside.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
I mean, I think they do, but at the time they were still like, when I talked to him his day of announcement, they were still very surprised that anybody cared.

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
And we're like, well, we want you to understand the Linux part is just part of a three part strategy here.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
I'm like, yeah, I understand. You're also shipping Linux.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
And to them, it's like, well, of course we are. That's what we've been working with now for years.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
My point here is I think there's many more things are going to drop from Microsoft in this regard.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
I don't think I don't think we're done.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
No, I don't think we're done by a long shot.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
Oh, boy. Well, OK, good. Well, there you go.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
We have a link if you want to know more about Azure Sphere OS in the show notes.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
Coder dot show slash three zero seven.

44:56.000 --> 45:03.000
It really is just a weird, strange, long evolution of a lot of this stuff that we've been covering for quite a while.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
I don't know. I don't know what else to make of it. I think that's probably we can probably leave it there, I suppose.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
You know, I don't think there's probably much more to really.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Yeah, I don't think there's much more. I mean, these aren't shipping yet, so we'll have to see.

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
Yeah, there's going to be dev kits that hook up over USB and that will be super cool.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
Yeah, that will be. I wonder. I wonder how I wonder what it'll take to get your hands on one.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
If it wasn't that much, would you try one? Would you mess around with it?

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
If you just buy one. Yeah, I would. Yeah, I don't think you're going to be able to just buy one initially, though.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
It sounds like they were pretty hot to try. I don't know. I don't know.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
We'll see. I mean, that would be something I would definitely want to do.

45:39.000 --> 45:45.000
Now, if we were going to do anything else in this episode, it would definitely be mentioning the subreddit.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
We haven't really given it much love recently. CoderRadio.reddit.com.

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
I check it before we start every single podcast of the CoderRadio program to see if anybody has any feedback.

45:53.000 --> 46:00.000
CoderRadio.show is also like a great resource for links or subscribing or anything like that.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
Coder.show. I should I should just really get both because I always say CoderRadio.show.

46:04.000 --> 46:10.000
So I really should just I should just get both and forward them to the same place because I always mess that up.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
And if you haven't checked it out in a little while, go subscribe.

46:14.000 --> 46:21.000
Grab the audio version of this show, which now includes podcast chapter markers and all of that goodness,

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
which make it easy to jump around for the topics that you care about.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
And last but not least, we'd love to read a whole batch of your emails.

46:29.000 --> 46:36.000
If you go over to Coder.show.com. Mr. Dominic, before we wrap up, is there any other topics or things we want to send to people?

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
You know, things to mention, those kinds of things.

46:38.000 --> 46:45.000
No, follow me at at Dumanuco on Twitter and be sure to ask Chris about his home pod.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
Sounds great. Sounds great. Best podcast playback speaker ever.

46:50.000 --> 46:55.000
That's my review, as long as you like it in mono. Let's see. Yeah, I think that'd be about it.

46:55.000 --> 47:02.000
That and join the Airplay Revolution. Bluetooth must die, my friends. Down with the Bluetooth!

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the Coder Radio program.

Actually, this isn't just this week's. Surprise, surprise. If you haven't heard 306, that also came out recently.
