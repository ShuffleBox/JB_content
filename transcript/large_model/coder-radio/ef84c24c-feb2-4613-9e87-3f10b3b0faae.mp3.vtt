This is Code of Radio, episode 431 for September 14, 2021.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.680
Hello and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.680 --> 00:24.080
at the art and the business of software development and the whole world of technology.

00:24.080 --> 00:27.640

00:40.960 --> 00:46.400
My name is Chris and joining me at an odd time on an odd day is our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.400
Hello Mike.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.240
Hello and happy mystery day.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.840
Yeah, it is a mystery day, isn't it?

00:52.840 --> 00:55.440
Like why are we doing it on a different day?

00:55.440 --> 00:57.160
What are we going to talk about today?

00:57.160 --> 00:59.480
All secrets to be revealed in the show.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.160
I am in a new spot.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.560
This is my last time on the road that we'll do the show until I'm, you know, until the

01:04.560 --> 01:05.560
next road trip.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.560
Yep.

01:06.560 --> 01:07.560
Yeah.

01:07.560 --> 01:10.540
I'm sure that I'm sort of addicted to them, so I'm sure it'll happen again.

01:10.540 --> 01:13.320
But man, 40 days on the road.

01:13.320 --> 01:18.080
I am so looking forward to having my office, my desk, my studio.

01:18.080 --> 01:22.600
Oh my God, I'm so looking forward to it, dude.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.600
It's crazy.

01:23.600 --> 01:28.360
But you know what else, as just a total aside and go figure is right now we're like at the

01:28.360 --> 01:29.360
best spot.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.480
We've been on the entire trip in Southern Oregon.

01:31.480 --> 01:36.960
There's just this, there's a casino down here that Texas has this amazing RV resort that

01:36.960 --> 01:41.840
is got glorious high speed internet and shade, and it's just now I don't want to go home.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.240
I just want to stay here forever, you know?

01:45.240 --> 01:50.120
But then I saw you online, saw what you were doing, messing around with Android emulators.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.120
Like what are you doing over there?

01:51.120 --> 01:53.160
Don't you know you're all in on the Apple ecosystem?

01:53.160 --> 01:54.160
Yeah.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.160
Well, you know what?

01:55.160 --> 02:02.280
I actually don't tell anybody, but I actually like all technology and I tend to take a pragmatic

02:02.280 --> 02:03.280
view.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.280
You mean like the whole world of technology?

02:04.280 --> 02:07.360
Like a pragmatic view on the world of technology.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.360
Yeah.

02:08.360 --> 02:12.400
So I did pop open Android studio and I even tested out Maui.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.400
Okay.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.400
But be honest.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.400
What was it a bit getting there?

02:15.400 --> 02:18.160
I mean, I'm sure you got it working and you got to try Maui, right?

02:18.160 --> 02:19.160
But come on.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.160
It was a pain in the ass.

02:20.160 --> 02:25.640
Maui was a pain in the ass because the tooling for Mac just isn't there.

02:25.640 --> 02:26.640
Yeah.

02:26.640 --> 02:31.000
And the tooling in my VM for Windows also apparently doesn't work right.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.260
The Android AVD, the virtual device would not work.

02:35.260 --> 02:36.760
So yeah, it was rough.

02:36.760 --> 02:37.760
Sorry.

02:37.760 --> 02:41.720
But I did see a successful tweet that you did manage to get it up and going.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.840
I got it all up and running and it does look impressive.

02:43.840 --> 02:44.840
It does look promising.

02:44.840 --> 02:52.960
Now I have some, a little bit of a Microsoft, what do we call this?

02:52.960 --> 02:55.400
Once bitten, twice shy kind of thing going on.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.400
Baggage.

02:56.400 --> 03:00.760
New listeners can listen back to the episode on Windows Phone 8 when I lost a ton of money

03:00.760 --> 03:01.760
on that.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.720
I think we all have a little Microsoft baggage.

03:03.720 --> 03:04.720
I think we can all relate.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.620
I mean, who doesn't, right?

03:07.620 --> 03:10.440
I'm really hoping that this is different.

03:10.440 --> 03:15.280
And having said that, I decided to do the project and something stable.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.560
Well what does that mean?

03:16.560 --> 03:19.400
It means not Maui.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.600
It means it didn't make the cut, huh?

03:21.600 --> 03:22.600
Let me give you a hint.

03:22.600 --> 03:27.520
Give me a C and then if you were to add one to it, but if you were a programmer and you

03:27.520 --> 03:34.080
didn't want to like type, you know, C plus C or like C plus one.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.080
What might you do?

03:35.080 --> 03:39.720
You might do like a C and a plus sign and then maybe another one.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.280
You might, if you really wanted to get into it.

03:42.280 --> 03:45.640
By the way, we haven't talked about this much on the show, but my old man level has gotten

03:45.640 --> 03:48.880
to the point where I'm like, if I can't do it in Python, I do it in C plus plus and I'm

03:48.880 --> 03:50.960
grumpy about it, but it's fine.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.320
Our old man level was pretty high last episode.

03:53.320 --> 03:58.480
We got, we got some fired up emails and I didn't see it coming.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.960
We got our asses kicked.

03:59.960 --> 04:00.960
Ooh.

04:00.960 --> 04:01.960
Yeah.

04:01.960 --> 04:02.960
Yeah, we really did.

04:02.960 --> 04:03.960
We done been straightened out.

04:03.960 --> 04:08.880
So we brought up this topic about Apple shutting down the Slack channel about fair pay.

04:08.880 --> 04:14.840
And um, I think out of old habit, Mike and I went into like extreme stereotypical boss

04:14.840 --> 04:15.840
mode.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.280
Like, well normally we'll just go at it from like how people that run these corporations

04:18.280 --> 04:19.280
look at stuff.

04:19.280 --> 04:23.040
And we don't even disclose that like, Hey, we're about to do this thing because it's

04:23.040 --> 04:26.840
to us, it's just, it is the nature of the beast and it's how they think.

04:26.840 --> 04:32.200
But I think we managed to get enough people fired up that it's worth talking about it.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.880
He says, this is an email we got him from a listener, Joe, he says, I love the show,

04:35.880 --> 04:40.400
but your discussion about workplace organization and pay discussion, it rubbed me the wrong

04:40.400 --> 04:41.960
way.

04:41.960 --> 04:46.240
Even by the standards of the incredibly employer rights, happy us discussing pay and other

04:46.240 --> 04:49.960
workplace concerns is legally protected activity.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.640
There are rights that the labor movement in the U S fought tooth and nail and died for

04:53.640 --> 04:56.160
in the early part of the 20th century.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.400
And even if you are all on the management side, these rules have improved the lives

04:59.400 --> 05:05.320
of everyone in the U S I get your comments about outside political organizing, but that's

05:05.320 --> 05:07.000
not what the Apple stuff was about.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.840
It is about pay and working conditions and who's getting on and what's getting swept

05:11.840 --> 05:13.480
under the rug by leadership.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.240
This is textbook labor relations stuff.

05:16.240 --> 05:19.320
Sorry to be the annoying pro worker advocate, but I just felt like you're all were skirting

05:19.320 --> 05:23.760
the line of literally advocating breaking employment law.

05:23.760 --> 05:24.760
Thanks for the show.

05:24.760 --> 05:25.760
Sorry.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.140
I got a little ranty labor protections in the U S you're so weak.

05:29.140 --> 05:32.920
You got to defend what little bit we have left, Joe.

05:32.920 --> 05:38.920
This is a tricky one because I still, I still stand by a lot of what we said in, in the

05:38.920 --> 05:41.800
manager running a business to make a lot of money perspective.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.840
And I'm, I'm not trying to say it was, there's a big, it's just, if I can interrupt, there's

05:45.840 --> 05:49.280
a big asterisk on us versus Apple.

05:49.280 --> 05:53.760
You and I are so small that we are below the standards for most of those labor laws.

05:53.760 --> 05:54.760
Oh yeah.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.840
No, but I think both of you are probably channeling their position when we were talking about

05:57.840 --> 05:58.840
it last week.

05:58.840 --> 05:59.840
I mean, right.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.400
I was like, Oh no, you will not discuss wages and slack, right?

06:02.400 --> 06:08.960
Like because we're small enough that I can give that edict and you know, yay, Florida's

06:08.960 --> 06:09.960
employer.

06:09.960 --> 06:10.960
Well, right.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.800
I think I was a little callous when I said, you know, this is a lot of people who are

06:13.800 --> 06:15.960
antisocial that don't want to have this conversation.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.720
And I still kind of stand by that too.

06:17.720 --> 06:25.920
But what I mean by it is discussing pay and how much you make is, is super not done in

06:25.920 --> 06:28.880
the U S it's very awkward and I think it might be different on different coasts a little

06:28.880 --> 06:34.760
bit, but on the West coast it is, it is like territory you just don't get into.

06:34.760 --> 06:37.880
And you know, if you do, it's with people you really trust.

06:37.880 --> 06:38.880
It's not just the West coast.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.280
It's completely disrespectful to ask someone what they make.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.280
Like, right.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.000
It is also, it's a question like you teach your children.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.040
You don't ask that.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.760
I think the writer's correct that the Apple case is different, but I think in my head

06:48.760 --> 06:53.960
I still had the Google case and the Microsoft cases, you know, we do some military contracting

06:53.960 --> 06:55.600
every once in a while.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.600
It's fun.

06:56.600 --> 07:00.400
Making six figures should not be bitching that they have to like do a contract for their

07:00.400 --> 07:01.400
country.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.400
Right?

07:02.400 --> 07:08.360
If you don't want to do the job, quit, get no one employment and go fork yourself.

07:08.360 --> 07:09.360
Okay.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.360
Seriously.

07:10.360 --> 07:15.080
And if you're not a U S citizen, you're afraid to lose your H one visa, then you don't belong

07:15.080 --> 07:16.080
here.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.280
Get out.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.080
That's the one that's going to get us in trouble.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.720
But honestly, these are U S corporations.

07:21.720 --> 07:26.560
They actually do owe some sort of loyalty to the country.

07:26.560 --> 07:32.600
And the fact that like Sundar Patrai would stand up and be like, Oh, we're going to work

07:32.600 --> 07:33.720
with our employees on this.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.600
No, you work here.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.600
That's it.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.600
You don't want to work.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.600
You don't want, you have a problem.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.080
The door's over there.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.560
This is why I believe so much in tech education.

07:42.560 --> 07:45.320
So these whiny bitches can be fired easily.

07:45.320 --> 07:46.320
Right?

07:46.320 --> 07:50.720
Like so that there's not such a, a need for good, like Google proof or Microsoft proof

07:50.720 --> 07:56.240
engineers, because this is insane because again, I always bring up the special, the

07:56.240 --> 08:03.120
inspector, but my personal hero, uh, the president of China, mr ping is not afraid of these people.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.960
They do not have the same problems.

08:04.960 --> 08:09.040
You were an engineer at, you know, well look what just happened to Jack Ma.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.040
I think that's the best example.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.040
Right?

08:11.040 --> 08:12.040
Sure.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.040
Okay.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.040
He got a little too mouthy in prison.

08:14.040 --> 08:23.400
I know I'm not advocating for fascism, but I sometimes worry that our best technical minds

08:23.400 --> 08:26.440
don't understand how good they have it.

08:26.440 --> 08:33.940
And like, yes, we are not perfect in any way, but I believe we're the best alternative to

08:33.940 --> 08:39.360
what currently exists, you know, on this planet at least maybe, I mean, if the Vulcans showed

08:39.360 --> 08:43.520
up, listen, all right, I might be, you know, live long and prosper, right?

08:43.520 --> 08:50.420
I might turn coat, but I just, I don't know, like a thing that would have made me happy

08:50.420 --> 08:56.240
is if like, you know, Sundar Prachai or, um, Satya Nadella stood up and said, if you are

08:56.240 --> 09:00.160
in the divisions that work on these contracts and you refuse to work on them or you leak

09:00.160 --> 09:02.600
or protest, you're simply fired.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.200
And none of the Silicon Valley fired, none of this bull where you get six months pay,

09:06.200 --> 09:09.360
you're fired, get out for cause.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.360
No unemployment.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.040
We're going to, we're going to go after you.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.540
Oh, is this another New Jersey episode?

09:14.540 --> 09:15.540
I know.

09:15.540 --> 09:20.320
I mean, I think it's, I think it's truly how, how it's, it's a valid perspective on this.

09:20.320 --> 09:24.320
People also, our grandfathers went to Europe and Asia to fight wars.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.720
I mean, this is crazy.

09:25.720 --> 09:31.920
You can't write some code because like, get over yourselves, knock it off you guys.

09:31.920 --> 09:39.080
I mean, I, I have to admit I have seen excessive forms of what I think people would commonly

09:39.080 --> 09:42.760
describe as entitlement, uh, in the tech industry.

09:42.760 --> 09:45.620
Um, but that aside, I think it's really two issues here.

09:45.620 --> 09:49.380
You have this entitlement that is some people just have it throughout all different industries

09:49.380 --> 09:53.560
and certain people out there think, you know, they're, they're God's gift to a particular

09:53.560 --> 09:55.120
industry or something.

09:55.120 --> 10:01.480
You have that as an issue that I think is a separate issue from fair pay and how we

10:01.480 --> 10:02.480
talk about it.

10:02.480 --> 10:07.320
And I think it's sort of, it's sort of sad that we don't have like a solution, like a

10:07.320 --> 10:12.560
technological solution where people could input information into, into some sort of,

10:12.560 --> 10:16.060
you know, free database and it would average out pays and areas.

10:16.060 --> 10:20.680
The lady who Apple demanded her, that she use her personal account and then her phone,

10:20.680 --> 10:22.820
this is what she's alleging, alleging.

10:22.820 --> 10:26.400
And they have pictures of her breasts, like, and go on Twitter if you don't know what I'm

10:26.400 --> 10:27.400
talking about.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.360
Like Apple is clearly wrong, right?

10:30.360 --> 10:35.320
Like this is, and the pay equity stuff, like I am 100% with you on that.

10:35.320 --> 10:40.680
Like there should be no pay discrimination on pay, um, you know, on pay for gender, race,

10:40.680 --> 10:42.240
religion, whatever.

10:42.240 --> 10:47.520
Um, but it's not one issue, I guess is what I'm trying to say, Chris.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.620
What I probably could have said better last week and what I think about when I'm thinking

10:50.620 --> 10:56.160
about this week is I still don't really feel like maybe it should be, maybe it shouldn't

10:56.160 --> 11:01.560
be, but I still don't really feel like Apple's Slack instance is necessarily the best place

11:01.560 --> 11:06.320
for these kinds of unstructured conversations that are extremely, extremely landmine filled

11:06.320 --> 11:09.520
that could lead to all kinds of staff issues.

11:09.520 --> 11:13.440
So I'm not really sure how I feel about that because it is maybe equivalent to what might

11:13.440 --> 11:14.880
happen in a break room.

11:14.880 --> 11:18.060
If you know, you had a group of employees in a break room, they'd be using the company's

11:18.060 --> 11:21.020
facilities to have these conversations.

11:21.020 --> 11:27.120
So I'm, I've sort of loosened on it, but ultimately I feel like we need something that's a solution

11:27.120 --> 11:30.240
that is company agnostic.

11:30.240 --> 11:34.320
It is, it is, it is like a, it is a, it is a more generalized database.

11:34.320 --> 11:39.840
So you could have a better idea of what fair pay is across multiple companies.

11:39.840 --> 11:43.660
There's a lot I think that has just been naturally suppressed because a lot of this goes the

11:43.660 --> 11:48.060
way of the employer and the workers take what they can get cause they want paid.

11:48.060 --> 11:53.040
It's not, it's, it's not as cut and dry as I think I was thinking about it last week.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.040
Um, yeah.

11:54.040 --> 11:58.760
And the stuff about the personal device and, and all of that, it's, it's so funny and it

11:58.760 --> 12:03.080
totally undercuts their message with CSAM and all that kind of stuff, dude, it's super

12:03.080 --> 12:04.080
creepy.

12:04.080 --> 12:08.640
It's, it's these kinds of stories that expose the duality of their public image.

12:08.640 --> 12:13.080
Oh, like Janice, the two face card, your favorite email came in this week.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.560
Um, uh, was it from Micah?

12:14.560 --> 12:15.560
Right.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.560
Was that what it was?

12:16.560 --> 12:17.560
Uh, yes.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.560
Micah.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.560
Micah.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.560
Yeah.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.560
You caught this and then we'd started discussing it and West caught it.

12:21.560 --> 12:25.840
Uh, Micah wrote in and he says, I'm regarding the conversation about whether the ship has

12:25.840 --> 12:29.120
sailed on the Linux desktop, which we talked about last week.

12:29.120 --> 12:33.400
I hate to say this, but in a lot of ways I think it has.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.680
Linux 19 is a second career for me.

12:34.680 --> 12:38.320
I was a lawyer who taught myself JavaScript and then switched careers.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.280
Before I switched, I was a dedicated full-time Linux user.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.640
I did all my software development and playing around on Linux.

12:43.640 --> 12:48.480
I was really convinced there was no way I would ever use windows unless for some reason

12:48.480 --> 12:49.720
maybe somebody hated themselves.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.560
They like being trapped in a walled garden.

12:51.560 --> 12:58.520
Uh, it was Linux or bust, but then I got my first job as a software developer in a window

12:58.520 --> 12:59.520
shop.

12:59.520 --> 13:04.960
Well, I was skeptical at first, but it turns out development in windows is actually pretty

13:04.960 --> 13:05.960
painless.

13:05.960 --> 13:10.720
Besides VS code, windows terminal and WSL first WSL one and now WSL two, the windows

13:10.720 --> 13:14.480
developer experience just isn't the horror show that some concerns on the internet would

13:14.480 --> 13:15.480
have you believe.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.640
Hell, native windows development is pretty good too.

13:17.640 --> 13:21.320
PowerShell is pretty powerful if you take the time to learn it and common bash commands

13:21.320 --> 13:22.360
are alias these days.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.380
So really a lot of what you already know works.

13:24.380 --> 13:27.500
He goes on to say, what really amazed me though was WSL.

13:27.500 --> 13:31.280
It really does virtually everything I need in Linux development and in my workflow.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.280
It's fast.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.640
I let you get the Linux file system, lets you get access to VS code, IntelliJ.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.420
I can seamlessly connect to all of it.

13:37.420 --> 13:39.920
It's a damn near native experience, he says.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.820
And that's the thing, the stuff I need Linux for when writing code, it's just not generally

13:44.820 --> 13:49.360
desktop stuff that, you know, there's nothing wrong with normal plasma.

13:49.360 --> 13:54.240
They do their job, but really what I need when I'm writing software is the command line.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.400
There's just a lot of talk out there too about Apple's M1 being a game changer and it does

13:57.400 --> 13:59.680
seem great from a hardware point of view.

13:59.680 --> 14:05.000
But to me, WSL too is the real challenger to desktop Linux.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.280
That's what we should be talking about.

14:06.280 --> 14:10.260
We now live in a world where you can get virtually all the benefits of Linux and the universal

14:10.260 --> 14:14.720
application compatibility of windows without dual booting.

14:14.720 --> 14:19.240
As a Linux user at home, well, I'm starting to find this amazing and a little scary at

14:19.240 --> 14:20.240
the same time.

14:20.240 --> 14:25.000
It's WSL, not the M1 that threatens to make Linux desktop totally unnecessary.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.300
We literally had this conversation months ago and Micah, I honestly, like I bought that

14:31.300 --> 14:39.000
Lenovo ThinkPad and gave it to an employee who then is not here anymore.

14:39.000 --> 14:46.200
And then to someone I know, but if I were to buy out, I, okay, how can I phrase this?

14:46.200 --> 14:50.600
Once you install WSL2 and I'll plug Penguin because I'm from WhiteFoundry, I like them

14:50.600 --> 14:51.600
a lot.

14:51.600 --> 14:58.760
It's a Debian based flavor of WSL with a lot of like dev stuff pre-initialized.

14:58.760 --> 15:04.280
It's scary how the combination of WSL2, if you stay on the Linux file system, as you

15:04.280 --> 15:09.120
said correctly Micah, and use VS Code, it's scary how efficient that is.

15:09.120 --> 15:15.680
Now granted, you lack the sort of evidence grease of being on Mac, or shall I say the

15:15.680 --> 15:21.600
good taste, but Snow Leopard's never coming back and Chris, I'm still using Addium.

15:21.600 --> 15:26.240
Fair, you'd be right at home, you are a natural Windows user.

15:26.240 --> 15:34.320
Let me ask you a question, when I do command space Addium, it launches and granted it doesn't

15:34.320 --> 15:39.760
scroll by itself anymore and I can't turn it to dark mode anymore.

15:39.760 --> 15:45.440
And sometimes when Wes puts an image in, I can't see it, but God damn it, this is good

15:45.440 --> 15:47.000
enough for the enterprise.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.840
It worked pretty well back in the day, I will give it that.

15:49.840 --> 15:54.800
I think the key to this entire conversation is what does it matter?

15:54.800 --> 15:58.840
Like it's fine, if you end up on Windows but you're using WSL, good, I mean you're still

15:58.840 --> 16:04.960
using Linux, you're still utilizing open source and free software, I'm struggling to really

16:04.960 --> 16:10.080
figure out what the problem is because for me, the number one problem with Windows will

16:10.080 --> 16:15.280
always be there, it is Windows, I do not want to use it.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.120
Why is there a problem?

16:17.120 --> 16:23.420
If we're all talking about building something great, whether it be Linux server side applications

16:23.420 --> 16:32.080
or whatever, do you really care if I'm on Mac and you're on Linux and Wes is on Linux

16:32.080 --> 16:36.840
and some random dude I'm making up right now called Paul, no relation to any other Paul

16:36.840 --> 16:41.980
as anybody might think of this on the show, is on Windows 11 and bitching about it.

16:41.980 --> 16:42.980
Who cares?

16:42.980 --> 16:46.920
In a weird kind of sad way, it almost matters more what browser you're using than it does

16:46.920 --> 16:49.200
what desktop environment you're using or desktop OS.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.040
All right, I'm going to get spicy.

16:52.040 --> 16:58.400
The Windows developers that are installing WSL 2, I'm pretty sure they're coming from

16:58.400 --> 17:01.940
Mac and they're still targeting Linux.

17:01.940 --> 17:08.480
These are, and we talked about this last week and we got some heat, these are Linux developers,

17:08.480 --> 17:13.520
they're running in Bash or ZShell or Fish or whatever shell they prefer, but you get

17:13.520 --> 17:15.160
my point, right?

17:15.160 --> 17:18.120
They're writing software that runs on Linux.

17:18.120 --> 17:22.120
Android developers are running software that runs on Linux.

17:22.120 --> 17:28.420
I know I'm repeating myself, but I think we need to, it's just such an important point.

17:28.420 --> 17:32.760
Bitching about what desktop environment, an individual contributor to the community, and

17:32.760 --> 17:37.200
when I say the community, I mean the tech community, runs is a waste of time.

17:37.200 --> 17:41.120
Yeah, and it seems like it's even more of a waste of time now than it ever has been,

17:41.120 --> 17:43.360
you know, when you look at the size of mobile too.

17:43.360 --> 17:48.520
Well also, if we're all running VS code, seriously, if we're all running VS code, it like literally

17:48.520 --> 17:49.520
doesn't matter.

17:49.520 --> 17:52.040
Everybody's just using some Chromium code base, right?

17:52.040 --> 17:54.160
It's either an Electron app or a browser.

17:54.160 --> 17:58.520
And you can call VS code Addium or like the other 15 editors that are out there, right?

17:58.520 --> 18:03.760
Like someone just hired a new guy at TMB and he said, oh, can I use my, you know, I like

18:03.760 --> 18:05.560
this client.

18:05.560 --> 18:10.400
And I'm, I mean, apparently we had covered it on the show, I didn't know, called Kraken.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
Are you familiar with this?

18:11.400 --> 18:12.400
Oh yeah.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.400
Oh, you know Kraken?

18:13.400 --> 18:14.400
Yep.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.400
We talked about it a while ago.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.400
We did?

18:16.400 --> 18:17.400
Mm-hmm.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.400
Good.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.400
I don't remember.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.400
I was probably loaded.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.400
He showed it to me.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
I'm like, that's nice.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.400
And then I looked it up.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.720
I'm like, dude, you know, you're just running an instance of Chrome, right?

18:26.720 --> 18:27.720
Yeah.

18:27.720 --> 18:31.080
And his exact words to me, yeah, but I, you know, I'm not a command line guy.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.080
Why?

18:32.080 --> 18:36.280
My preferred OS is windows.

18:36.280 --> 18:41.680
Then I gave him pop OS and we'll, I'll keep updating on his corruption to Linux.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.680
Yeah.

18:42.680 --> 18:43.680
I'd be curious.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.640
Get Kraken works good on Linux too.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.000
So, but that's my point.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.640
It's the same experience on all three.

18:51.640 --> 19:00.280
I lost the bet to a BSD guy last week for major OS's BSD is real and it just, all right,

19:00.280 --> 19:01.280
next feedback.

19:01.280 --> 19:04.600
Next listener, Nick writes in and wants to know the value you get from a QA team member.

19:04.600 --> 19:09.240
He writes, you mentioned recently that you've been hiring a QA person in your company.

19:09.240 --> 19:14.640
What value do you think a QA member will bring to your team, uh, that devs can't already

19:14.640 --> 19:15.640
do?

19:15.640 --> 19:16.640
I mean, devs can test.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.520
So why not just have some of them work on QA for a while?

19:19.520 --> 19:23.000
I'm curious to get your thoughts on the QA role in your company.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Thanks Nick.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.080
Damn you, Nick.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.080
You caught me.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.080
Okay.

19:27.080 --> 19:32.040
So the QA role is just a very, very, very, very, very junior dev role.

19:32.040 --> 19:38.920
Uh, they do QA, but we give them dev tests and I don't know if this is going to be a

19:38.920 --> 19:43.720
reference that makes sense, but it's basically the, uh, you know, biology 100 class for liberal

19:43.720 --> 19:44.720
arts majors.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.720
Right?

19:45.720 --> 19:46.720
Hmm.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.720
Yeah.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.720
It's like getting them started, right?

19:48.720 --> 19:49.720
Low expectations.

19:49.720 --> 19:55.400
It's people we might not have hired for straight dev role at that salary that we're willing

19:55.400 --> 20:01.080
to give a shot on this role and see how they do for about a month.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.880
And can I go deeper into this?

20:02.880 --> 20:03.880
Oh yeah.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.280
Oh my God, this is so bad.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.080
This is so bad.

20:08.080 --> 20:13.480
We used to treat bootcamp graduates the same as we treated college.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.000
It's a super duper junior role.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
I don't even know what to say.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Right?

20:17.000 --> 20:20.040
It's like our, you seem enthusiastic.

20:20.040 --> 20:24.960
Normally wouldn't give you the higher job, but we'll give you a shot.

20:24.960 --> 20:29.040
And the way I see it, Chris, is it's my way of giving folks a chance who maybe I wouldn't

20:29.040 --> 20:30.680
normally just throw out their resume.

20:30.680 --> 20:31.680
Right.

20:31.680 --> 20:32.680
Right.

20:32.680 --> 20:35.400
It's a good way to get somebody in an entry level and if nothing else, they can get some

20:35.400 --> 20:40.800
QA work done and if they show the interest in the talents and are motivated, they can

20:40.800 --> 20:41.800
work their way up.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.440
It sounds like it's a clever idea really.

20:43.440 --> 20:50.780
I think very sly cool lino.com slash coder.

20:50.780 --> 20:54.880
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account and you can go there to support

20:54.880 --> 20:55.880
this here show.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.360
You know, it's just over a year we have an independent now.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.360
So thank you.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.840
Everyone who's taken advantage of our sponsor offers gives us an opportunity to work with

21:02.840 --> 21:05.780
a company that we could enthusiastically recommend to.

21:05.780 --> 21:11.920
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing and now 18 years later,

21:11.920 --> 21:16.420
Linode is the largest independent open cloud provider in the world with 11 data centers

21:16.420 --> 21:17.540
around the world.

21:17.540 --> 21:20.800
They are their own ISP too, so they're super fast.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.280
Linode's mission though remains unchanged since they started in 2003.

21:24.280 --> 21:29.440
Now that they're on their own ISP, now that they really have refined and honed the experience

21:29.440 --> 21:31.480
too, it's a great time to become a Linode customer.

21:31.480 --> 21:35.960
I've been watching them really grow over the last couple of years and over time I've taken

21:35.960 --> 21:39.360
advantage of some of their ancillary services, I guess you could put it.

21:39.360 --> 21:44.120
I mean services that are beyond just great virtual servers like their S3 compatible object

21:44.120 --> 21:48.840
storage and their VLAN support and their powerful DNS manager, which makes it really easy for

21:48.840 --> 21:51.720
us to kind of quickly set up projects.

21:51.720 --> 21:55.440
You would be surprised at how quickly we can get machines going to help supplement a segment

21:55.440 --> 21:58.080
Linux unplugged or to test something out for the show.

21:58.080 --> 22:02.320
It's something we do pretty frequently and I really appreciate how slick they make all

22:02.320 --> 22:03.320
of that.

22:03.320 --> 22:07.160
And as you learn how to use the system too, you can really get moving quick.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.820
But on top of that, Linode's got Kubernetes support, they got Terraform support, I mean

22:10.820 --> 22:16.080
a lot of stuff, but they managed to just display it all with a really clean, simple to use

22:16.080 --> 22:17.080
interface.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.920
That's why I think you should go over there and try it, linode.com slash coder, get that

22:19.920 --> 22:24.200
$100 and try it out and you'll find they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the major cloud providers

22:24.200 --> 22:25.200
out there.

22:25.200 --> 22:29.680
66% of companies are saving money now by mixing with alternative cloud providers from the

22:29.680 --> 22:35.400
big hyperscalers to companies like Linode and then you're going to find Linode systems

projects, they provide hosting and all kinds of technical expertise.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.320
It's pretty cool.

23:04.320 --> 23:08.060
And they made this Jupiter colony reunion trip possible as well so that we could go

23:08.060 --> 23:10.640
out and see some of you out there.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.360
Linode's dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing out there.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.480

23:23.360 --> 23:28.520
Linode.com slash coder.

23:28.520 --> 23:34.600
Well today as we record, Apple just got done unveiling the iPhone 13 pro and the pro max

23:34.600 --> 23:38.440
and the mini and all the things that they have now.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.720
And well, there's not a lot really for us to dig into.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.640
All the models are going to be available to preorder starting the Friday that we record

23:44.640 --> 23:47.400
that September 17th at five am Pacific.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.440
They're going to ship on Friday, September 24th.

23:50.440 --> 23:56.320
They have an A15 bionic CPU with a six core CPU and a five core GPU, which seems to be

23:56.320 --> 23:57.440
a pretty nice bump.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.200
They've managed to keep that going.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.160
They're adding now a variable refresh rate.

24:02.160 --> 24:08.080
They call it, of course, like pro motion and they're offering a one terabyte storage option

24:08.080 --> 24:10.200
on the higher end.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.760
Anything about this event strike you?

24:11.760 --> 24:18.520
I refuse to answer questions that the IRS may later want you to discuss with me.

24:18.520 --> 24:22.760
Yeah, they had some iPads they announced as well, some watches.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.400
So I mean, there's a selection of stuff.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.880
So OK, the watch stuff struck me.

24:28.880 --> 24:29.880
Really?

24:29.880 --> 24:33.440
So long time listeners will know back in 2015 I took a pair of heart attacks.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.440
Good time.

24:34.440 --> 24:35.440
A lot of fun.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.440
I have a heart condition.

24:36.440 --> 24:37.440
New listeners.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.440
Shocker.

24:38.440 --> 24:44.120
So I have been I was actually, you know, this course, I was a fan of traditional watches,

24:44.120 --> 24:46.760
meaning like, you know, mechanical watches.

24:46.760 --> 24:47.760
Right.

24:47.760 --> 24:51.160
But once that happened, I switched to a smart watch.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.600
I went to I mean, I think we have episodes on the right.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.920
I tried the fossil watches.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.760
Remember those that were at Google Play?

24:56.760 --> 24:57.760
Oh, yeah.

24:57.760 --> 24:58.760
Google I.O. rather.

24:58.760 --> 24:59.760
Yeah.

24:59.760 --> 25:00.760
Yeah.

25:00.760 --> 25:01.760
I tried a lot of the Android watches.

25:01.760 --> 25:07.640
I tried way too many of those are terrible and the way the battery life is way too short.

25:07.640 --> 25:14.240
I honestly, I'm going to be a day one purchaser of the new Apple Watch.

25:14.240 --> 25:18.920
Having this is super inside baseball, but I think it's important.

25:18.920 --> 25:25.000
Having a real time kind of tracking of my heart rate and my EKG, you know, as good as

25:25.000 --> 25:30.360
Apple can get it or ECG, as they call it, as good as Apple can get it is important to

25:30.360 --> 25:31.360
me.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.360
Hmm.

25:32.360 --> 25:35.880
OK, so much so that I forget how but ugly this watch is.

25:35.880 --> 25:39.560
Was there a big rumor that it was going to be like flat edges and all redesigned and

25:39.560 --> 25:40.560
a totally different look?

25:40.560 --> 25:43.720
And it doesn't look like I was hoping I was hoping it looked like like a regular watch.

25:43.720 --> 25:44.720
Right.

25:44.720 --> 25:45.720
Yeah.

25:45.720 --> 25:46.720
It didn't look like that happened at all.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.000
So that was what I was.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.800
But I'm definitely the seven they've better sensors, increased health, you know, software

25:52.800 --> 25:54.880
compatibility with external devices.

25:54.880 --> 26:01.280
I'm not loving the idea of having to buy more dongles for Apple stuff, but whatever.

26:01.280 --> 26:06.480
From a dev perspective, I'm not sure that the Apple Watch gives you anything.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.800
The iPhone 13, the better refresh rate.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.800
That's fantastic.

26:09.800 --> 26:15.840
If you're watching movies on your iPhone like an animal, but I mean, games will look prettier,

26:15.840 --> 26:20.720
but your average game developer is going to have to focus on older devices anyway.

26:20.720 --> 26:25.980
But the thing that struck me and that I impulse purchased was the iPad mini.

26:25.980 --> 26:28.320
But there was only one color that was acceptable.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.320
Gold.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.320
What?

26:30.320 --> 26:33.280
It was purple because on brand with the mad botter.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.280
Oh, they have a purple.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.280
Yep.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.280
Heck, yeah.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.280
That's cool.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.280
It looks fantastic.

26:39.280 --> 26:42.040
And I have been an iPad mini supporter for years.

26:42.040 --> 26:48.080
And I frankly think Apple has been making a huge mistake by not treating the mini.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.880
They treat it like the device you give your kid.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.200
No, the mini is a viable tablet.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.240
They hardly ever update it.

26:53.240 --> 26:56.840
They launched it in 2012 and they've done it with two updates or something ridiculous

26:56.840 --> 26:57.840
like that.

26:57.840 --> 26:58.840
Yeah.

26:58.840 --> 26:59.840
It's only gotten two updates.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.840
Yes.

27:00.840 --> 27:04.720
But she's and you can tell when a developer wrote an iPad app and they didn't think about

27:04.720 --> 27:09.440
the mini because like it's like the toolbars just like encroach upon the content space.

27:09.440 --> 27:10.440
It's terrible.

27:10.440 --> 27:13.080
They're also going to include a smart folio case with it all.

27:13.080 --> 27:19.880
You know, this event, from what I did see, I think the virtual events are done with me.

27:19.880 --> 27:24.960
I find these now to be kind of boring.

27:24.960 --> 27:31.240
It's a perfect sanitized, packaged up version of Apple's reality delivered to you in a live

27:31.240 --> 27:32.240
stream.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.240
Steve Jobs is dead.

27:33.240 --> 27:36.440
I like when it's live because there's there's mistakes.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.320
There's ums and ah moments.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.840
There's there's just there's a reality to it.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.840
Like the device has to actually be able to do the things they say it can do.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.640
But in these videos, it could all be CG.

27:45.640 --> 27:46.640
It just doesn't matter.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.880
Well, there's more drama to the live performance.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.680
It's an actual stage performance.

27:50.680 --> 27:51.760
This is like Santa.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.680
This is I mean, this is corporate PR.

27:53.680 --> 27:54.820
I mean, they're all corporate PR.

27:54.820 --> 27:59.640
But this is like, if I was a PR executive, I would think this is how all events should

27:59.640 --> 28:00.640
go.

28:00.640 --> 28:05.640
It's like two hours of mainline corporate PR that is just and they do a fantastic job

28:05.640 --> 28:09.720
with the cinematography and the effects and they put it all together in the flow and that

28:09.720 --> 28:10.960
they give a lot of thought to it.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.120
And I'm not trying to take away from that.

28:13.120 --> 28:17.600
But I'm just saying as it lands on me, I can even catch this one live, you know, like,

28:17.600 --> 28:18.600
okay, well, we'll see later.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.600
I got other stuff to do.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.000
I'm moving my RV.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.920
I think for me, I'm more interested in the software side of the Apple platform this year.

28:25.920 --> 28:32.040
iOS 15, iPadOS 15, I think, are actually pretty significant, especially on the iPad side.

28:32.040 --> 28:36.800
And these devices don't really they'd like there wasn't something that was significantly

28:36.800 --> 28:39.240
introduced that I'm like, oh, yeah, well, that's gonna be great.

28:39.240 --> 28:43.460
It's like, okay, well, mostly everything I want is going to be software side this year.

28:43.460 --> 28:46.380
New cameras are always are always nice to see, I suppose.

28:46.380 --> 28:48.240
And promotion is nice to see.

28:48.240 --> 28:51.600
And my mini, you know, I got the iPhone mini this time around.

28:51.600 --> 28:52.600
Oh, really?

28:52.600 --> 28:56.640
I've really been regretting it for for about three, three or four months.

28:56.640 --> 28:59.240
Maybe about halfway through, really, for six months now, I've probably wanted to get rid

28:59.240 --> 29:00.800
of this iPhone mini.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.040
It's got the battery life of an Android phone.

29:03.040 --> 29:06.880
So it's completely disappointing, completely unacceptable and imbecile.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.560
The camera I miss having the zoom.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.200
It gets hot as hell all the time.

29:12.200 --> 29:17.880
My battery health is like down to 85 86% already, I assume because I'm having to constantly

29:17.880 --> 29:18.880
charge it.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.840
So it's just it's heating up all the time and wearing down.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.160
Hang on, Chris, you need to pause.

29:23.160 --> 29:27.800
Drew, I'm vomiting right now because he mentioned Android twice.

29:27.800 --> 29:34.720
And I've been doing Android student development and there he goes.

29:34.720 --> 29:35.720
There he goes.

29:35.720 --> 29:36.720
Sorry.

29:36.720 --> 29:37.720
All right.

29:37.720 --> 29:38.720
Sorry.

29:38.720 --> 29:39.720
All right.

29:39.720 --> 29:40.720
Let's keep going.

29:40.720 --> 29:41.720
So I think I'll get a big one this time.

29:41.720 --> 29:42.720
I think I'm going to go the other way around.

29:42.720 --> 29:43.720
I'm gonna get a real big one.

29:43.720 --> 29:44.720
You're going all the way.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.720
Wait, wait, wait.

29:45.720 --> 29:46.720
Are you getting the regular one?

29:46.720 --> 29:47.720
Are you going pro max, man?

29:47.720 --> 29:51.120
So I'm going to I'm going to swing so hard the other direction that my head's going to

29:51.120 --> 29:52.840
spin because I got the upgrade program.

29:52.840 --> 29:56.840
I understand if you ever get mugged, you could just kill the dude with that.

29:56.840 --> 29:57.840
It's a weapon.

29:57.840 --> 30:02.400
I got to say, as stupid as it is, the pro res video actually is appealing to me.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.400
Really?

30:03.400 --> 30:04.400
I know.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.040
I actually do a lot of video on my phone for family stuff.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.800
I do family videos and stuff.

30:07.800 --> 30:10.040
So is it really that much better?

30:10.040 --> 30:15.760
Well, any time I can work with uncompressed source or I guess pro res is kind of like

30:15.760 --> 30:21.500
what flack is for audio, it's it's compression, but it's lossless compression as lossless

30:21.500 --> 30:22.700
as it can be.

30:22.700 --> 30:26.880
But when you're working with iPhone footage that's an MP four or something like that,

30:26.880 --> 30:32.440
it's already really squished down and anything you do with it is going to double encode it.

30:32.440 --> 30:36.040
But with pro res, you can bring it in and work with it and not encode it all the way

30:36.040 --> 30:37.240
down until the very end.

30:37.240 --> 30:41.720
And so you maintain quality and that's going to matter more as these cameras get better

30:41.720 --> 30:42.720
and better and better.

30:42.720 --> 30:43.800
You're going to want to be able to maintain that quality.

30:43.800 --> 30:47.640
So I mean, it's going to take up a lot of space, but I'm going to use it immediately.

30:47.640 --> 30:54.240
I use pro res even on our Linux OBS system in the studio when we're recording video.

30:54.240 --> 30:59.340
I record to pro res on Linux because it's just a fantastic codec.

30:59.340 --> 31:00.340
And I don't know.

31:00.340 --> 31:03.320
I actually haven't done the digging to know if it's actually true, legitimate pro res

31:03.320 --> 31:09.000
or if it's some rebrand of some other codec that Apple, they could be doing that, too.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.680
But that kind of stuff, those technical details actually do appeal to me.

31:13.680 --> 31:17.640
And I think that's where the Pro Max continues to kind of be an appealing phone for people

31:17.640 --> 31:20.580
who are technical and into the iPhone.

31:20.580 --> 31:23.800
There are actually some of us out there who are geeks and like iPhones.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.720
What are you talking about?

31:25.720 --> 31:29.560
There's a lot of people out there like that.

31:29.560 --> 31:30.560
I know.

31:30.560 --> 31:31.560
I know.

31:31.560 --> 31:32.560
Just sometimes it feels like people don't think so.

31:32.560 --> 31:35.280
I just want to say Mac was the Linux of Linux.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.280
You know.

31:36.280 --> 31:37.280
Wow.

31:37.280 --> 31:38.280
Before Linux.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.280
Yeah.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.280
Wow.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.920
You know, all in all, I think these things are getting pretty boring as far as like,

31:42.920 --> 31:45.440
you know, these are not must have devices anymore.

31:45.440 --> 31:50.200
They didn't introduce any new technology or like revolutionize some AR app.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.160
None of that's really happening anymore.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.160
And good on them.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.160
You know what?

31:54.160 --> 31:57.040
We don't really need everyone buying new phones every year.

31:57.040 --> 32:00.720
And I don't necessarily think Apple needs your money either.

32:00.720 --> 32:03.960
So I think it's great for people who are on like the iPhone 10 right now.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.440
This is a no brainer update.

32:05.440 --> 32:09.640
But for those of us are on the iPhone 12, unless there's like part of the upgrade program

32:09.640 --> 32:12.500
or there's some other reason you'd want to upgrade or like maybe you're super disappointed

32:12.500 --> 32:13.960
with your phone.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.760
I think this is kind of a skip year for most people.

32:16.760 --> 32:22.520
I mean, spoiler, it is for me, except for the iPad mini, which I bought because it was

32:22.520 --> 32:23.520
purple.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.320
There's probably one other Apple topic we could we could discuss before we move off

32:26.320 --> 32:27.320
of Apple completely.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.960
Yeah, I think we should talk about the epic lawsuit.

32:30.960 --> 32:35.920
Every journalist, every scummy tech journalist is like epic kicked Apple's ass at Apple one,

32:35.920 --> 32:36.920
right?

32:36.920 --> 32:37.920
Apple straight up one.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.360
There's a couple things, though, that I want to talk to you about in here when you look

32:40.360 --> 32:41.360
through this.

32:41.360 --> 32:46.720
So you know how Apple already had this reader category of apps in the App Store where they

32:46.720 --> 32:50.560
could kind of get out of the cut like Netflix is in there and stuff?

32:50.560 --> 32:51.560
Yep.

32:51.560 --> 32:55.720
This judge is kind of defined a new category for Apple in the App Store where different

32:55.720 --> 32:57.100
rules can apply.

32:57.100 --> 33:02.360
That's what's essentially happening here is what what Judge Gonzales Rogers did is essentially

33:02.360 --> 33:09.520
say gaming is and can be treated differently than all other app categories in the App Store.

33:09.520 --> 33:13.840
People can have different rules about in app purchases and all of that stuff for games

33:13.840 --> 33:15.720
than anything else.

33:15.720 --> 33:20.240
And games are a huge part of Apple's App Store revenue.

33:20.240 --> 33:24.440
According to the ruling, the judge said 70 percent of Apple's App Store revenue comes

33:24.440 --> 33:25.600
from gaming.

33:25.600 --> 33:29.840
And in there, they're like, yeah, this whole category is can have totally different rules.

33:29.840 --> 33:33.440
And so now Apple has the reader category and the gaming category where they can have different

33:33.440 --> 33:37.280
rules that don't have to be the uniform same like they used to be.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.040
I think that's going to be huge for them.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.880
People just sort of won in a weird way.

33:41.880 --> 33:46.160
Yeah, because the judge also said not a monopoly near a monopoly, but not a monopoly.

33:46.160 --> 33:50.880
They have a 55 percent share of the mobile game transaction market, which is that new

33:50.880 --> 33:57.480
category that was defined and extraordinarily, quote, extraordinarily high profit margins,

33:57.480 --> 34:00.200
which can be a sign of monopoly power.

34:00.200 --> 34:05.200
But despite considerable profit and power, quote, this is a quote here.

34:05.200 --> 34:09.120
These factors alone do not show antitrust conduct.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.400
Success is not illegal.

34:10.400 --> 34:14.880
Well, then, yeah, that's probably pretty good for Apple, too.

34:14.880 --> 34:15.880
Right.

34:15.880 --> 34:19.920
I mean, that's got to be that's got to be the icing on the cake here for them.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.800
And then they can point to all these changes to say, well, look, we're trying not to be

34:22.800 --> 34:23.800
a monopoly.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.140
Well, so I really thought about it, right?

34:25.140 --> 34:28.120
Like you can have let's just take the most generous view of this.

34:28.120 --> 34:32.360
You can have a like a little button that says buy with your credit card and like strike

34:32.360 --> 34:34.800
put something in your app, which I don't think Apple is even allow.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.520
I think it's going to have to open safari.

34:36.520 --> 34:40.680
But let's even assume that you can do that.

34:40.680 --> 34:44.360
As a consumer, I would always use IAP.

34:44.360 --> 34:47.320
I would always use Apple's IAP.

34:47.320 --> 34:48.320
It's safer.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.240
And if something is terrible, you can get a refund.

34:50.240 --> 34:51.240
Right.

34:51.240 --> 34:52.240
Yeah.

34:52.240 --> 34:55.880
And for memberships and subscriptions, I having all of my memberships and subscriptions in

34:55.880 --> 34:56.880
one spot.

34:56.880 --> 34:57.880
Yeah, it's invaluable, actually.

34:57.880 --> 34:58.880
Yeah.

34:58.880 --> 35:03.880
I may even be willing to pay slightly more per month to have an easy cancellation, you

35:03.880 --> 35:08.720
know, and I'm way more likely to subscribe if I know I can cancel easily.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.960
Just you know, I think that's human nature.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.200
And that's what Apple system offers.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.440
And if they could keep that somehow.

35:13.440 --> 35:16.680
But honestly, man, you could deliver that with some sort of API if they really could

35:16.680 --> 35:17.720
be bothered.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.600
You know, it's not their style, but if they could be.

35:19.600 --> 35:24.400
Yeah, but then I can do that's going to be one of the features of using Apple system

35:24.400 --> 35:28.400
for the customer is that easy cancellations, right?

35:28.400 --> 35:31.400
No, you have to call and talk to some rep, you know.

35:31.400 --> 35:34.520
Well, I'd say the easy cancellations, easy purchase.

35:34.520 --> 35:37.460
You already have you already have current payment info because it's how you pay for

35:37.460 --> 35:41.720
everything in the Apple ecosystem, including your iCloud storage and crap like that.

35:41.720 --> 35:46.140
But additionally, it plugs in the currently it plugs in with their family controls.

35:46.140 --> 35:48.520
So my kids have to seek authorization.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.200
I get a prompt on my phone.

35:50.200 --> 35:54.640
I use face ID to authorize the purchase on my phone for their phone.

35:54.640 --> 35:59.240
And then everyone in the family has access to that app to that, you know, all could be

35:59.240 --> 36:01.500
done with an API as well, but is unlikely.

36:01.500 --> 36:04.480
But Apple has to figure it out because as part of this, the judge is going to have an

36:04.480 --> 36:09.440
injunction soon that prevents Apple from banning those external links or buttons or other calls

36:09.440 --> 36:11.600
of action.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.680
It's not really clear on on what they're going to be able to limit.

36:14.680 --> 36:20.140
But previously, you know, this has been to the extent of if you have a privacy policy

36:20.140 --> 36:25.360
and you tap that and it brings you to a, you know, in app safari page so you can read the

36:25.360 --> 36:30.840
privacy policy off off your website, if anything in their links out of that, like a like a

36:30.840 --> 36:35.920
policy statement or your logo, Apple would deny your apps entrance into the app store

36:35.920 --> 36:40.080
simply for linking outside the app for the privacy policy during a payment information

36:40.080 --> 36:43.500
like it's they've been extremely strict on this kind of stuff.

36:43.500 --> 36:46.240
So they're going to have to find some middle ground.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.240
Worst story here.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.980
I have personally had the Code Journal iOS app.

36:49.980 --> 36:53.480
This is way, way back a decade now.

36:53.480 --> 36:57.880
It's to my website at the time, my personal website.

36:57.880 --> 37:03.600
And on there, I had a thing where you could pay me a couple hundred dollars for a I can't

37:03.600 --> 37:04.600
remember what I call it.

37:04.600 --> 37:08.760
It was like a basically like, should you build an app consulting session, right?

37:08.760 --> 37:12.760
And I had like a little ghetto stripe API thing done in Ruby.

37:12.760 --> 37:16.640
That was enough for them to reject that version of the app.

37:16.640 --> 37:19.280
It was a three click process to get there, though.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.280
Yeah.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.280
And they did it.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.280
And they did it.

37:22.280 --> 37:25.160
Because, you know, they're told to protect the revenue stream revenue.

37:25.160 --> 37:28.400
And if they if they let one through the cracks, then it sets a precedence.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.400
So they would do it.

37:29.400 --> 37:36.440
But ultimately, I mean, ultimately, this face facts the on mobile, the revenue for developers

37:36.440 --> 37:39.360
on the iOS stores.

37:39.360 --> 37:43.440
If you can only pick one platform, that's that's going to be it, right?

37:43.440 --> 37:46.900
That's the interesting thing here, because the only other option really in the mobile

37:46.900 --> 37:49.960
space is the play platform and on Google.

37:49.960 --> 37:55.520
And they so clearly, in my opinion, are helping each other right now by making these slight

37:55.520 --> 37:59.920
adjustments kind of in conjunction with each other, not necessarily the same time, but

37:59.920 --> 38:05.240
around the same time and normalizing and standardizing the marketplace and the way they have.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.840
They are helping each other.

38:07.840 --> 38:12.400
They they they are so dependent on each other to get through this right now.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.400
It's gross.

38:13.400 --> 38:16.960
And I think we get caught up in the Apple versus Google war.

38:16.960 --> 38:21.100
But the reality is these two companies need each other desperately to get through this

38:21.100 --> 38:22.880
antitrust stuff.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.420
And it's gross.

38:24.420 --> 38:27.280
And it's it's completely leaving developers in the lurch.

38:27.280 --> 38:31.280
And the regulators will look at and go, oh, well, it's fine.

38:31.280 --> 38:32.280
There's two of them.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.280
There's a Coke and a Pepsi.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.320
And they're keeping each other competitive.

38:34.320 --> 38:38.560
But the reality is, is they're they're making concessions where they have to.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.880
And they're each they're each looking at each other and working closely together, maybe

38:41.880 --> 38:43.960
not directly, but very closely in step.

38:43.960 --> 38:44.960
Right.

38:44.960 --> 38:48.680
And you get the email that was revealed where, you know, they were talking to each other

38:48.680 --> 38:51.240
and saying, let's work as one company on these issues.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.240
Yeah.

38:52.240 --> 38:53.240
Yeah.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.240
And that was a bit ago.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.240
But I would imagine that still stands.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.240
Right.

38:56.240 --> 38:57.240
It's life or death stuff here.

38:57.240 --> 38:58.400
So survival.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.000
All these lawsuits are about a bit ago.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Right.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.280
So who do you think benefits then from I mean, we knew we knew you and I said it from the

39:04.280 --> 39:05.280
day one.

39:05.280 --> 39:06.400
We knew this was going to go Apple's way.

39:06.400 --> 39:07.400
We called it immediately.

39:07.400 --> 39:12.520
No one benefits, not even Apple, obviously, but besides Apple, you know, who benefits

39:12.520 --> 39:18.000
some crafty big game developer who who somehow has people's credit card information on file

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
that could charge them slightly less, but take advantage of, you know, a three point

39:22.000 --> 39:25.800
five or five percent credit card fee and avoid Apple's 30 percent cut.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.680
The little guy doesn't get anything from this.

39:27.680 --> 39:32.120
I don't have quite the bad look on it that you do, but because I think I think we're

39:32.120 --> 39:37.440
at this stage, we're forgetting the very clever political public battle.

39:37.440 --> 39:42.040
So Epic fought not only in the court, but they also fought in the court of public opinion.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.960
And they played that game better than Apple did.

39:44.960 --> 39:49.360
And I think they took Apple down more than a couple of pegs in the eyes of the development

39:49.360 --> 39:50.360
community.

39:50.360 --> 39:53.280
They lay led with that campaign right away.

39:53.280 --> 39:58.080
I mean, they came in and they beat Apple at their own messaging game for months during

39:58.080 --> 39:59.080
this thing.

39:59.080 --> 40:01.280
And they got those emails out and that testimony out.

40:01.280 --> 40:06.680
I think that is going to be the long term damage that this case did.

40:06.680 --> 40:08.600
And that's not insignificant.

40:08.600 --> 40:12.920
What is the difference between September and July?

40:12.920 --> 40:17.840
If you're an indie developer with limited resources and you can only target I'm sorry

40:17.840 --> 40:23.160
for an indie game developer, I'll even make it more specific with limited financial resources

40:23.160 --> 40:28.200
and going to target one platform, nothing, nothing.

40:28.200 --> 40:33.280
If you want to make money, if you want to feed your family, the answer is still iOS.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.240
So Epic has accomplished nothing.

40:35.240 --> 40:38.760
And by the way, Epic are not the you know, they're not Joan of Arc here.

40:38.760 --> 40:44.200
They're not, you know, some some white as snow virgin warrior coming in, right?

40:44.200 --> 40:46.460
They wanted to open the Epic Games store on iOS.

40:46.460 --> 40:49.680
And by the way, you should see the I mean, and this is something the judge mentioned

40:49.680 --> 40:55.760
in her 185 page ruling that they pull the same bull on their developers on the Epic

40:55.760 --> 40:56.760
Games store.

40:56.760 --> 40:57.760
Yeah.

40:57.760 --> 40:58.760
And she's like, also, I'm looking at this.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.260
This is not really going to impact your bottom line.

41:00.260 --> 41:03.100
You've clearly just optimized your business everywhere else.

41:03.100 --> 41:06.360
And this is the last part you're making great margins, you're not making great margins

41:06.360 --> 41:07.360
on.

41:07.360 --> 41:08.360
And so you're just trying to optimize this.

41:08.360 --> 41:11.080
This isn't going to make or break you guys like she called them out on that, too.

41:11.080 --> 41:16.520
Like, I don't know, for me, part of the show is the you know, the plight of the indie developer.

41:16.520 --> 41:20.940
And somebody wrote in said, Hey, I'm your team of three people.

41:20.940 --> 41:25.200
We're building a game, we're releasing it on iOS, well, how should we do our payments,

41:25.200 --> 41:30.480
I would say do an app purchase and use every new Apple API you can.

41:30.480 --> 41:33.600
And if you can do it in Swift, right?

41:33.600 --> 41:40.480
Like release right after a new version of iOS, because ultimately, money talks and this

41:40.480 --> 41:42.680
bull is just walks, right?

41:42.680 --> 41:46.220
Like Epic is full of right the back of the turtle as long as you can really.

41:46.220 --> 41:48.320
But Epic wanted to be a new turtle, right?

41:48.320 --> 41:50.900
They wanted to be.

41:50.900 --> 41:54.120
They wanted to be their own platform on somebody else's platform.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.120
And I hate them all.

41:55.120 --> 41:58.320
I missed the dream of the open web from the 90s.

41:58.320 --> 42:02.200
There's that there is that an optimist gray is really he's nailed in the chat room.

42:02.200 --> 42:05.360
The people who benefit the most from this are the lawyers.

42:05.360 --> 42:12.840
Yeah, well, the lawyers get 30% of the fun to help indie developers out of that was cute.

Did you notice that JDK 17 was out?

43:56.480 --> 43:57.480
Did you have a party?

43:57.480 --> 43:58.480
Oh, yes.

43:58.480 --> 43:59.480
I had a Java.

43:59.480 --> 44:03.280
I'm Oh, God, you've added me.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.280
Chris.

44:04.280 --> 44:05.280
Listeners.

44:05.280 --> 44:06.280
Yeah.

44:06.280 --> 44:09.040
My name is Mike and I have a confession.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.040
Oh, no.

44:10.040 --> 44:11.920
I no longer use a French press.

44:11.920 --> 44:15.560
Oh, oh, oh, are you using a cake up?

44:15.560 --> 44:16.960
Did you go cake up?

44:16.960 --> 44:18.640
Actually, so this is complicated.

44:18.640 --> 44:24.800
Keurig makes a coffee pot, like a regular drip pot with a cake up system.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.080
So is it still a cake up?

44:26.080 --> 44:27.080
But they're just dripping it.

44:27.080 --> 44:28.080
No, no, no.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.720
One side is the cake up system.

44:29.720 --> 44:33.360
Oh, and one side is like a regular like Mr. Coffee system.

44:33.360 --> 44:34.360
You got to be kidding me.

44:34.360 --> 44:35.840
Mom, that's serious.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.200
I'm looking this up right now.

44:37.200 --> 44:38.200
It exists.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.200
Yeah.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.120
I mean, so you got you got yourself one of these.

44:41.120 --> 44:42.120
I see.

44:42.120 --> 44:43.120
Yeah.

44:43.120 --> 44:44.960
Man, I just don't know that Keurig's though.

44:44.960 --> 44:49.980
So can you put like ground up your own ground up coffee beans in the drip side?

44:49.980 --> 44:52.340
So straight up on the regular side.

44:52.340 --> 44:54.400
It is a literal regular coffee machine.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.040
You put a filter and you put coffee grounds.

44:56.040 --> 44:58.200
I need a link to this thing.

44:58.200 --> 44:59.360
Chat room go find me a link to this.

44:59.360 --> 45:00.800
Would you somebody in the chat room find me a link to this?

45:00.800 --> 45:03.600
I got to see this Keurig with drip now.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.600
Yeah.

45:04.600 --> 45:05.600
No, I just can't be.

45:05.600 --> 45:06.600
What?

45:06.600 --> 45:07.600
Wow.

45:07.600 --> 45:08.600
I'm on their website now.

45:08.600 --> 45:09.600
I'm like I'm browsing Keurig's website.

45:09.600 --> 45:10.600
And you're right.

45:10.600 --> 45:12.300
They've gotten into drip coffee.

45:12.300 --> 45:14.480
Is it the K duo single serve?

45:14.480 --> 45:15.480
Is that what you got?

45:15.480 --> 45:16.480
K duo coffee Mako?

45:16.480 --> 45:17.480
Yeah.

45:17.480 --> 45:18.480
Yeah.

45:18.480 --> 45:19.480
That's that's what I have.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.480
The K duo.

45:20.480 --> 45:21.480
Huh?

45:21.480 --> 45:22.480
And I never ever use the cake upside.

45:22.480 --> 45:23.480
Then why'd you get the duo?

45:23.480 --> 45:24.480
You know, I was a recent divorcee.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.480
We all done crazy.

45:25.480 --> 45:26.480
I did a little crazy.

45:26.480 --> 45:27.480
I don't know.

45:27.480 --> 45:28.480
Yeah.

45:28.480 --> 45:29.480
You got you get it.

45:29.480 --> 45:30.480
You get a weird coffee maker.

45:30.480 --> 45:31.480
I understand.

45:31.480 --> 45:37.160
I did the same thing because like I was too tired for the French presses and whatever.

45:37.160 --> 45:41.040
Well, you know what?

45:41.040 --> 45:42.040
I'll put a link in the show notes.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.040
I don't know why.

45:43.040 --> 45:45.640
You know, JDK 17 is great.

45:45.640 --> 45:48.160
It's yeah, it's Java.

45:48.160 --> 45:49.160
It'll be fine.

45:49.160 --> 45:50.160
Keep going.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.160
It's Java.

45:51.160 --> 45:52.160
It's going to be fine.

45:52.160 --> 45:53.160
Right.

45:53.160 --> 45:54.160
It's you know what?

45:54.160 --> 45:55.160
That could be our tagline for every time we talk about Java.

45:55.160 --> 45:56.160
It's Java.

45:56.160 --> 45:57.160
It's going to be fine.

45:57.160 --> 46:01.880
But one actual interesting point about this release, sorry, guys, is it is an LTS release.

46:01.880 --> 46:05.680
And the last LTS was JDK 11, believe it or not.

46:05.680 --> 46:11.000
So all the new goodness that you've had, I think Lambdas, I don't remember when Lambdas

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
came in.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.160
The only Java project I've done in the last few years has been JDK 8 and it's like living

46:16.160 --> 46:17.160
in hell.

46:17.160 --> 46:18.160
But great.

46:18.160 --> 46:19.160
17.

46:19.160 --> 46:22.400
Before we run out of here, I usually when we're on is every now and then if there's

46:22.400 --> 46:27.680
a good like punch Facebook in the in the face story as we go, I like to do it.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.680
Right in the dick.

46:28.680 --> 46:29.680
Let's do it.

46:29.680 --> 46:33.000
Wall Street Journal has a story today that internal documents that have leaked from Facebook's

46:33.000 --> 46:38.720
own research shows that Instagram is harmful to a sizable percentage of its users, especially

46:38.720 --> 46:43.840
teen girls, but has taken a few steps to remedy it.

46:43.840 --> 46:48.400
In depth, internal research shows significant teen mental health issues.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.880
Oh, man.

46:49.880 --> 46:55.120
OK, but like, duh, they're evil.

46:55.120 --> 46:58.280
They continue to do evil things.

46:58.280 --> 46:59.860
Honestly.

46:59.860 --> 47:01.880
This is where China has an advantage.

47:01.880 --> 47:03.600
Maybe they just shouldn't exist.

47:03.600 --> 47:04.600
Right.

47:04.600 --> 47:10.680
But yeah, the problem right now, it's like the other things online push kids towards

47:10.680 --> 47:16.160
social media because I see my kids like, can I get a tick tock dad like what can I upload

47:16.160 --> 47:20.520
to YouTube like they get on YouTube and they see this stuff.

47:20.520 --> 47:25.420
YouTube is like the platform that like they get all their information from and then they

47:25.420 --> 47:28.160
learn about other social media platforms from YouTube.

47:28.160 --> 47:30.280
It all starts with YouTube.

47:30.280 --> 47:36.200
Why not a federal law requiring kids not to have Facebook until they're, you know, 18

47:36.200 --> 47:37.200
or 21?

47:37.200 --> 47:40.360
Hell, they can't have a beer, but they can have Facebook that makes them kill themselves.

47:40.360 --> 47:41.360
That seems great.

47:41.360 --> 47:42.360
Right.

47:42.360 --> 47:43.360
Huh.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.520
I mean, have we ever talked about limiting technology like that?

47:45.520 --> 47:48.680
I mean, I'm trying to think of something that's considered modern technology.

47:48.680 --> 47:51.400
I mean, obviously we we already limit technology like that.

47:51.400 --> 47:54.440
The automobile, automobiles and guns.

47:54.440 --> 47:58.320
And I mean, that kind of but I'm trying to think of like modern computing technology

47:58.320 --> 47:59.320
and software.

47:59.320 --> 48:04.160
Pornography is technically not legal for kids to do.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.740
So we are to do this.

48:05.740 --> 48:06.740
That is true.

48:06.740 --> 48:07.740
That is true.

48:07.740 --> 48:12.840
And you could probably even find an argument that social media is more harmful than a lot

48:12.840 --> 48:13.840
of porn.

48:13.840 --> 48:14.840
Although maybe not.

48:14.840 --> 48:15.840
I don't know.

48:15.840 --> 48:16.840
I have a five year old son.

48:16.840 --> 48:23.040
I would rather give him a martini right now than let him have a Facebook account.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.200
I could totally see what you're saying.

48:24.200 --> 48:27.320
It's like, yeah, it's less dangerous, less harmful.

48:27.320 --> 48:31.040
I mean, this is not that I would give my kid a liquor, don't people don't like call Dreyfuss

48:31.040 --> 48:33.200
or whatever or Child Protective Services.

48:33.200 --> 48:34.200
Right.

48:34.200 --> 48:35.200
Right.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.200
No, I follow what you mean.

48:36.200 --> 48:38.000
Yeah, I feel like this is something everybody knew but didn't talk about.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
But they did the math.

48:39.000 --> 48:44.040
And it's like, OK, yeah, young girls, teenage girls are killing themselves.

48:44.040 --> 48:47.480
And by the way, when we say teenage, these are still children we're talking about.

48:47.480 --> 48:48.480
And they knew.

48:48.480 --> 48:49.480
Right.

48:49.480 --> 48:54.140
They did their own research and they found out they knew the whole time.

48:54.140 --> 49:00.320
So maybe like we just borrow a couple of Chinese cabinet members.

49:00.320 --> 49:03.320
I'm just kidding.

49:03.320 --> 49:04.320
Borrow everything else from there.

49:04.320 --> 49:07.880
You know, I don't know if it might not be a Jersey week, it might be a Beijing week.

49:07.880 --> 49:11.760
I tell you what, I enjoyed some great egg rolls this week.

49:11.760 --> 49:12.760
Yeah.

49:12.760 --> 49:13.760
You know what?

49:13.760 --> 49:16.920
I you know, one of the number one things I'm missing from the studio is the air fryer.

49:16.920 --> 49:23.240
I got myself a used air fryer for lunches and make some great egg rolls in that thing.

49:23.240 --> 49:27.160
Dude, the air fryer is one of the things you feel you don't need.

49:27.160 --> 49:31.740
But once you have one lunch, lunch is like a two minute ordeal.

49:31.740 --> 49:32.740
You know what?

49:32.740 --> 49:33.740
I don't even need a deep fryer anymore.

49:33.740 --> 49:36.000
I got a deep fryer and I'm not even going to use it anymore.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
You have a deep fryer?

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Yeah.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Oh, yeah.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
What kind of oil do you use?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Peanut oil whenever I can.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
Yeah.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
I just got a wild hair one time.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.640
I was like, I want to get a nice deep fryer.

49:44.640 --> 49:48.540
And I got one and then it made the entire place stink so bad that I don't really want

49:48.540 --> 49:49.540
to use it.

49:49.540 --> 49:51.360
So then I was like, I'm going to get an air fryer.

49:51.360 --> 49:54.160
But because I just bought a deep fryer, I can't go buy a new air fryer.

49:54.160 --> 49:56.980
So I have to get a used air fryer.

49:56.980 --> 49:59.980
So I got myself a used Phillips air fryer.

49:59.980 --> 50:03.000
And if the damn thing isn't the best thing I ever did for my lunches, I don't know what

50:03.000 --> 50:06.660
is like because I I will always cut my lunches first.

50:06.660 --> 50:09.100
Like that's the first thing that goes in my day is lunch.

50:09.100 --> 50:12.900
And then I end up not eating enough and I go on air and I have an energy crash.

50:12.900 --> 50:18.240
So being able to throw something in that air fryer and have it kind of crunchy and crispy

50:18.240 --> 50:19.920
without all the oil and the stink.

50:19.920 --> 50:20.920
I'm getting hungry.

50:20.920 --> 50:21.920
I'm going to miss lunch.

50:21.920 --> 50:27.400
It's just I know I did to actually talk about food.

50:27.400 --> 50:30.520
I cut lunch today because I had to get to this spot so we could record.

50:30.520 --> 50:32.240
So I just drove through lunch.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.240
Damn.

50:33.240 --> 50:34.240
All right.

50:34.240 --> 50:36.800
