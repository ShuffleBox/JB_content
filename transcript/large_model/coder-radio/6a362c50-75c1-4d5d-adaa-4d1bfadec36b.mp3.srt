My name is Chris and joining us every single week, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,600
Hello, Mike.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,800
Hey, I'm happy to be on the Blaze.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Thank you so much, Chris.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Yeah.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Yeah.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,480
This is our new exclusive right-wing streaming service where we unintentionally upset people.

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,240
Can we call it the no spin zone or is Papa Bear or Riley going to sue the shit out of

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
us?

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
Yeah, sure.

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
You know, he's still going.

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Is he really?

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,000
You know, that old coot is still, he's got like, he talked some YouTuber into helping

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,360
him out with some setup and the production quality, like the lighting and the cameras

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
are not...

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
It's got to be bad.

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
They're not good.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,560
Well, it's weird because like Glenn Beck faced the same problem, but he's like, yo,

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
I got my whole network.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Now I'm good.

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,760
I feel like Bill Wright is just like a little too old, I hate to say it, but...

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:38,720
It is wild how many different streaming platforms and services and et cetera are out there today.

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,920
Like, I was thinking about this last night as we were watching a Star Trek Lower Decks

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
with the kids.

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Nice.

34
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,480
And you know, that's a CBS all access show.

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,240
Yeah, it is.

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,360
And we're sitting there watching it and we can just pull this up whenever we want it.

37
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,320
There's no commercials.

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,960
There's no like waiting around until Thursday night when it airs.

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,520
And then we, you know, or like when I was a kid, if I wanted to see a cartoon, I'd have

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,760
to watch it Saturday morning.

41
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,200
That was when I was going to watch cartoons.

42
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,560
Like they don't have to do any of that now.

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,140
I literally had this conversation with my son and he looked at me in a state of, I can

44
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,720
only describe it as confounded horror, that there was a time when one could not just simply

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,440
watch whatever, you know, insert your kid's favorite cartoon here, right?

46
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Right.

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
At On Demand.

48
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
He's like, but Dad, Netflix.

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,480
I'm like, okay, there was no Netflix.

50
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,680
Brace yourself for this.

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,960
There was no YouTube either.

52
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
You know, like...

53
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
He is not allowed on YouTube.

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
But yes.

55
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Good call.

56
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
But you know, it's a funny reaction.

57
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,240
Like when I stay in a hotel room with the kids and the TV comes on and we're watching

58
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,720
something and then it breaks for commercial and the kids are just like, what the hell

59
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
is this?

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,800
I've also had to have the conversation explaining the concept of a commercial.

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Yeah.

62
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Yeah.

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Pretty funny.

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
But I enjoy it.

65
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
We love our sponsors.

66
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
That's true.

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,160
And I just started watching the Ted Lasso because everybody's been going on about the

68
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Ted Lasso.

69
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
Oh, how is it?

70
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
I haven't seen it yet.

71
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
It's good.

72
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Is it really?

73
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
So frustratingly good.

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Yes.

75
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,680
I really don't want to pay for Apple TV Plus.

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
I know.

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Because you know, it's getting out of hand.

78
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
And I don't need another damn show.

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Yeah.

80
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,520
But like, I have to pay for Picard because the world hates me, which is I think, is that

81
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
the CBS one too?

82
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Yeah.

83
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Yeah.

84
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,160
I pay for Peacock because I must have been drunk and just paid for Peacock.

85
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,440
I wanted all of the law and order apparently.

86
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,160
I honestly don't know why I have Peacock when I have Hulu.

87
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,720
And I pay for like the super Cadillac Hulu because I like soccer.

88
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,240
And apparently if you're in the US, you need to pay more money to like soccer.

89
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
Oh, geez.

90
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,720
Then you'd really like the Ted Lasso show.

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,760
He's a soccer coach, right?

92
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
Isn't that the whole?

93
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
That's why I resisted it.

94
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Because it was sports.

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Yeah.

96
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
Yeah.

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Yep.

98
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,120
Well, if you ever notice, I'm a little wild on Twitter on Saturdays talking about how

99
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,760
much Manchester United sucks because it's all about Chelsea.

100
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,040
I'll leave it there.

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Sports ball.

102
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
Man, sports, huh?

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,360
It gets me so riled up.

104
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
I know.

105
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,800
Chris is like, let me tell you something.

106
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,640
Linux Mint is going to win the NHL Stanley Cup.

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,840
Man, I'd love to see that.

108
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,440
Then they're going to pitch a perfect game while dunking on Shaq.

109
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Boom.

110
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,280
I'm just waiting for a NASCAR, a NASCAR car to come racing by with a Linux logo on there,

111
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,560
like a distro logo.

112
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
You know what?

113
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,760
I'm going to throw it down here.

114
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
System 76.

115
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,400
It's time to get into the NASCAR game.

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Oh, yeah.

117
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Yeah.

118
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
They seem like big NASCAR folks.

119
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Oh, yeah.

120
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,200
Oh, they definitely do.

121
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
You want to know something adorable?

122
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,220
That's the last thing I'll say about my kids.

123
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,420
But you know, we took the kids with us on the Denver road trip to see everybody.

124
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,840
And we brought them to the meetup.

125
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,600
That was great.

126
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,760
And we had a listener, Mike, show up and really great guy, like, you know, the kind of listener,

127
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,580
like it's just it's so cool to meet people like listener Mike.

128
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,800
And he turned out to be a Cessna pilot.

129
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,120
And he also offered to take a bunch of us up for a couple of hours on a scenic tour

130
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,780
of Denver in his Cessna.

131
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,100
And I got to bring Dylan with me.

132
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,260
And you know, it was a great experience.

133
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,340
But I'm not kidding you if the bigger impression for Dylan might not have been when Carl from

134
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,000
system 76 took Dylan around in his Tesla.

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,860
Dylan's mind was blown by the Tesla and he got to turn on the fart whoopee cushion settings

136
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,520
and he got to see it in the rainbow road mode.

137
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,460
And I mean, Carl was such a sport.

138
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,280
He took he took both Dylan and Abby out for a spin in his Model 3.

139
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,520
And I think that was probably the highlight of Dylan's road trip.

140
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,340
That was awesome and also I did not know there was a rainbow road mode.

141
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,660
Yeah, just like, yeah, from like Mario Kart.

142
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,660
No, that's awesome.

143
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
Yeah.

144
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:49,100
So last week we set a small part of the Internet on fire unintentionally.

145
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,780
And you know, this is a tricky one for us because I know I blew it in one way and a

146
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:00,080
big way is I get really caught up in the practical aspect of the situation.

147
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,340
Like we were talking about fair pay and we were talking about that slack channel that

148
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,980
Apple shut down.

149
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,380
And I just sort of had this natural reaction of like, yeah, of course Apple did that.

150
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,380
Right.

151
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,780
And of course, Apple doesn't want you using a company slack channel to talk about pay.

152
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,840
I don't think I did a good job of articulating it from the worker standpoint.

153
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,420
So I know I can totally understand why people who are dealing with this issue right now

154
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,980
at their workplace would get super upset.

155
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,820
But I kind of feel like some people when they got so upset, missed an opportunity to hear

156
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,020
this from a business owner's standpoint, which is a valuable perspective, I think, for people

157
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,560
who are negotiating better pay to understand it, like when we talked about it last week,

158
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,580
I think we were very much thinking about it in the way an Apple executive would think

159
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,620
about it.

160
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,500
It's a business owner mentality versus a worker mentality.

161
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,220
And I think that is actually the core of the conflict.

162
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,660
Yeah, it's a hassle and you kind of don't want to deal with it.

163
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,660
Right.

164
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,660
Yeah.

165
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,660
Right.

166
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,660
For the business owner.

167
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,660
Right.

168
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,660
Yeah.

169
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,060
So let me just on this subject, some were constructive, others were less.

170
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,060
And this is what I'm saying.

171
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,660
Like, I think maybe an opportunity was missed here.

172
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,980
Like Chris B wrote that he fired a podcast to hear a usually interesting code of radio.

173
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,620
But what he heard instead was some bizarre far right extreme political triad sounding

174
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,820
like a radio broadcast from the dying days of the Weimar Republic.

175
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,220
Employees are actually fully purchased property of their own employer.

176
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,220
Anyone who doesn't want to work to the death of the industry is a traitor to the fatherland.

177
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,300
Seriously, off the rails, guys.

178
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,900
OK, so one, no one mentioned slavery.

179
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:45,780
Like I just like if some Chris, I'm sure you're sincere, but I obviously don't think slavery

180
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,780
is good.

181
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
Right.

182
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,020
No, I would not be surprised to hear that.

183
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,420
Nor am I a fan of fascist German governments.

184
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,900
So my point was like and actually there was another email that you didn't highlight in

185
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,900
the doc here that actually sort of changed my mind.

186
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,900
Right.

187
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,580
And I think I kind of pissed off the folks more.

188
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,580
It's funny because like what I preach is not what I practice, right?

189
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,060
People who work, you know, at TMB can talk about their salary.

190
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,180
It's kind of lame because we all have basically the same salary, but just do it by your experience.

191
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,180
So I do that because I don't want to be accused of like prejudice or whatever.

192
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,780
I realized like for years I've been talking about how folks I won't name names, but large

193
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:32,100
consulting companies that you have definitely heard of abuse the H1B system to the detriment

194
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,020
of the H1B recipients, right?

195
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,060
To lower wages on all people.

196
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,740
This is something we covered a lot back in the day on the show when it was happening.

197
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,020
Years ago when Disney, yeah.

198
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,300
And I realized that and someone sent me a nice message pointing out that there is an

199
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,420
internal kind of logical inconsistency in my arguments.

200
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,280
Basically like you and I have what, like, I mean, whatever less, I think we both have

201
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,580
less than like 10 employees, right?

202
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,580
Yeah.

203
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,900
So it's not like we're robber barons with like 400 people digging, you know, laying

204
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,420
railroad track.

205
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,060
We're closer to the worker side of life, particularly me, right?

206
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,260
Because I sell development services effectively.

207
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,260
Yeah, for sure.

208
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,180
I do think it's bad when people like when Apple and Adobe and Microsoft or I can't,

209
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,740
I don't know if it was Microsoft, but it would definitely Apple and Adobe have a secret agreement

210
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,140
to collude to lower wages, right?

211
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,720
I think it's bad when companies, I won't say the name, but you can Google it.

212
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,980
There was a story about this, hire H1B visas explicitly to make them work unpaid overtime.

213
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,320
And then basically knowing that if they don't do what they want, they'll fire them.

214
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,980
And that is effectively deporting them.

215
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,980
I think that's bad.

216
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,600
I think it's bad for the folks getting the visas.

217
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,600
It's bad for small companies like mine that have to compete for these consulting jobs,

218
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,060
but need to pay like reasonable wages.

219
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,300
It's bad for Americans, British, Indians, anybody trying to get these jobs.

220
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,660
If these large firms know that they, I mean, excuse the crude language, but they effectively

221
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,140
have these folks by the balls because if they lose their job, they get deported.

222
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
That was my point.

223
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,300
Not that we, like we should not allow immigration, that it's abusive.

224
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,620
Let's be honest too about what does getting deported mean?

225
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,100
It means losing out.

226
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
It destroys their life.

227
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,740
They ruin your entire life.

228
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,740
Everything you've built up.

229
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,780
Imagine you have, you know, your kids are in school here.

230
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,780
That's horrible.

231
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
Yeah.

232
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,640
My point is if we're going to have the H1B system, and I've been saying this for years,

233
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,820
you can go back to 2014, 2015.

234
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:41,620
The recipients of the H1B visas must have, and not just in writing, but like actual in

235
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,460
practice, the same protections as domestic workers.

236
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,860
And it just isn't the case, right?

237
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,100
I mean, you could Google it.

238
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,820
There's horror stories.

239
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,460
I mean, we'll name one name, right?

240
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,140
Because we covered it years ago when Disney just laid off all their IT people saying that

241
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,140
they were redundant.

242
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,060
And then a month later outsourced everything to H1Bs and to one of these large consulting

243
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,300
companies that isn't notorious for treating their folks like crap.

244
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,660
Another example is the verge has the H1B folks and the contracting folks, not all of them

245
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:19,000
are H1Bs, but that that company for the, they hire another consulting firm to do their moderation.

246
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,100
These people themselves are being mistreated.

247
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,480
My point is if you're going to have employees, you should treat them well, right?

248
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
That's basically it.

249
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Yeah.

250
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,020
And I think that is an ongoing conversation that if you haven't heard the back catalog,

251
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,940
you know, they didn't have all of the context for your position in the last episode.

252
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,620
And again, I should have been more eloquent, right?

253
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,100
Well, I mean, neither of us were at our best because it was at a different show time.

254
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,180
I was in a hell state called Tucson.

255
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,900
Dude, you're going to get ripped apart by Tucson folks now.

256
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,900
I don't know what you're doing.

257
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,900
I hope.

258
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Bring it.

259
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
They can bring it.

260
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,900
They live in a failed hell state.

261
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
And I'll say it right now.

262
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,900
All right.

263
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,700
Can someone suggest Tucson is a failed hellscape, please?

264
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,740
The rest of Arizona seemed great though.

265
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,060
Anyways, Drew, our editor, put it really well.

266
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,860
He said, you guys are wrong about this in the most Florida way possible.

267
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,700
Fair pay is a huge issue in the country right now.

268
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,440
It's less of an issue in Europe because they have actual laws to protect workers.

269
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,100
In contrast to this, the dystopian nightmare we call workers rights in air quotes, he says

270
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,060
with a wink and a nod, heavily implies that the right is that you can work, not that you

271
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,680
have rights while being a laborer.

272
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,380
He writes case in point, Colorado passed a law recently requiring companies to post a

273
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,620
real legitimate pay scale on job postings.

274
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,580
Some companies decided they would rather not have employees in Colorado rather than let

275
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,460
people know what others are paid.

276
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,380
Some tried to skirt around it by posting something like a dollar to one million.

277
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,580
And then, of course, they got smacked down with fines.

278
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,580
That's amazing.

279
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,580
I have a story about that I'll share in a second.

280
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,580
He finishes though with the employees at Apple should have known better than to have a chat

281
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,340
room within a company property.

282
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,380
Apple had every right to shut that down.

283
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,640
But when they start telling the employees that they can't have those conversations inside

284
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,140
or even outside the company, they're becoming thought police.

285
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,660
You don't pay these people while they're off the clock and off property.

286
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,420
Get the out of here trying to tell them what they can and can't talk about on their own

287
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,420
time.

288
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,420
Sincerely, your editor.

289
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,420
P.S.

290
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,420
Don't fire me.

291
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,420
No, you nailed it.

292
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,420
No.

293
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,420
Yeah.

294
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,380
I mean, so the pay scale thing is so I worked at a bank forever ago, lifetime ago, and every

295
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:33,580
position in the company in the H.R. book had a pay scale that was posted like, you know,

296
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,860
I.T. was probably thirty five to sixty thousand or so or maybe forty thousand to sixty thousand.

297
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,980
And you knew that if you had the I.T. position one, you would get something in that range

298
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,860
and you knew everyone else in that position was making that pay.

299
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,140
And that was true for many, many years until it wasn't when they wanted to promote me to

300
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:59,420
sort of incentivize me, but it was above what was public in the pay scale.

301
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,660
So the the one time they just paid me more and didn't say anything about it.

302
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,420
But then when it came time the next year to do something else again, they just created

303
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,860
a whole new position and decided that had a new pay scale and they just created it spontaneously

304
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,580
and said, well, now you're a server technician level three.

305
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,820
OK, where did one and two go?

306
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,140
And they just sort of invented new pay scales.

307
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:24,300
But I thought when the system was working properly, it was kind of nice to know that

308
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,480
if I wanted to jump over to, say, working in the branch side of the bank, these were

309
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,100
the salary ranges I could expect.

310
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,700
And if I shot for top tier, I could expect to make as much as this.

311
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,160
And that worked.

312
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,880
But that's something that company chose to implement.

313
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,300
And I wish we could utilize technology in a way to create something like Glassdoor,

314
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,660
but better and decentralized that also helps us discuss pay in a way that would actually

315
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,120
be appealing to Americans who are culturally awkward about this.

316
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,780
And it's a real hard spot for me.

317
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,580
This whole thing, and I think it affected the way I talked about it last week.

318
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,340
Honestly, at this point, it's a joke.

319
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:06,700
But let's say somehow I ended up making three hundred thousand dollars a year doing this

320
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:12,220
job, which I can't imagine how that would ever happen.

321
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,700
But let's just say like that would be my high end of what I could ever expect for success

322
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
is three hundred thousand.

323
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,860
It's not, you know, it's not in the grand scheme of things.

324
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,220
It's not a ton of money for media.

325
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,300
But I'd be I'd be over the moon to make that much money a year.

326
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:32,980
And if that ever went public, it would significantly damage my brand.

327
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,860
Back in the day when I worked in I.T. and I was making a good chunk of change because

328
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,720
I was charging one hundred and twenty an hour for my clients, and I also had podcast revenue

329
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,860
coming in from sponsors.

330
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,420
It became scandalous in the community when I bought an Oryx, like Chris, Chris just spent

331
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,620
three thousand dollars on a laptop.

332
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,100
He must be making so much money.

333
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,340
Well, I'm not going to listen anymore.

334
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:00,020
You know, like there is a big part of the Linux community that responds extremely negatively

335
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,740
to financial success.

336
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,740
And it's not all of them.

337
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,300
And I don't even think it's the majority, but in a weird way for me, if I were ever

338
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,580
public with how much money I make, because ultimately it's probably going to be more

339
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:15,540
than somebody in the audience, even if it's not very much, they it creates this brand

340
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,840
problem for me.

341
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
And it's the craziest thing.

342
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,220
And I think I don't think this is true, like in other communities, you know, you have YouTubers

343
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,660
who kind of flaunt giving away money.

344
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,060
You got you got like ATP, the accidental tech podcast where they literally brag about the

345
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,580
thousands of dollars they spend on monitors and stands and they each make over five grand

346
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,020
a month per episode, apparently.

347
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,020
Right.

348
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,820
Like they've mentioned it on the air.

349
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,820
Probably more since that membership of theirs, because they have a ton of members.

350
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,460
Like it's it's like, you know, our members are like essential to keeping the show on

351
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,460
there.

352
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,940
Their members are helping them buy Apple Watches.

353
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,620
It's a whole other scale of money they're making and Tesla's right.

354
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,820
And actually, all kinds of crazy stuff.

355
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,580
I mean, if you listen to the show, it's clear that money isn't a problem.

356
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,100
And they also have other alternative revenue.

357
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,660
I mean, they're making good money and it's not considered a bad thing.

358
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,260
And I think it's because the Apple community, you know, it's sort of a high, high spend

359
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,620
bar to even get in.

360
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,620
And so it's just normal.

361
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:16,460
But in in the audience that I serve, there is a portion that would be very it would be

362
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,460
very upset to hear he makes 300,000, which, by the way, I got to be clear, I make nowhere

363
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,540
near that.

364
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,620
Not even close.

365
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:29,980
But it would even though for me, it would be like the success of my career of this particular

366
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,740
trajectory to make that much, you'd be like, it'd be like a life goal for me to achieve

367
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,740
that.

368
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,320
And I, you know, I would imagine life would be great.

369
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,820
For a good portion of the audience, they would be angered.

370
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,480
And I think they'd probably tune out.

371
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,140
And so when I think about wage transparency and talking about how much I make, it's a

372
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,700
scary topic for me, because it has so many negative, negative ramifications for me.

373
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,880
So I that also influences how I think about this.

374
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,620
Because not only do I own a business, and not only have I done a lot of hiring, where

375
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,740
depending on when I hire somebody, and what's going on in the market, and what the needs

376
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,660
of the business are, if they come in at the right time with the right ask, they're going

377
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,300
to make more than somebody that came in a couple of years ago when the market dynamics

378
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,960
weren't the same.

379
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,980
And it's an unfortunate reality, and I've seen it play out in multiple companies.

380
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,860
But it's like, there's a lot of things that influence how much a business is willing to

381
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,860
pay for somebody at what time.

382
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,420
And every now and then, like, you're the right person with the right skill set, with the

383
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,280
right ask, and the business says yes.

384
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,980
And it doesn't necessarily mean they're a better coder than somebody else already on

385
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,860
staff or a better tech or a better podcast or whatever it is.

386
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,200
But it means that they bought at the right time, essentially, you know.

387
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,340
And that also can, when employees find out about that disparity, it can create a lot

388
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,660
of issues inside the team.

389
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,320
I don't necessarily know what the answer is there.

390
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,060
And I do feel like workers should have access to as many tools as possible to negotiate

391
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,780
with these large, especially these monstrously large companies.

392
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,700
Because the employers and the businesses have all the tools in the world, from all kinds

393
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:16,200
of tactics to literal tools to personnel to lawyers, they have all the tools in the world.

394
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,500
So I do think workers need access to more information and more resources, but I just

395
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500
don't know what the answer is.

396
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,940
And I think it's a more complicated problem than we really give credit for.

397
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,620
Yeah, I think it gets messy too, the smaller, like it's very easy to say that like Apple

398
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,380
should not quote, interfere with organizing or whatever.

399
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,780
But you know, if you have a company of like five people, and everybody's making roughly

400
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,500
the same amount of money, and the company, like all small companies, is always on the

401
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,820
edge of life and death.

402
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:52,460
There's just not like enough fat there to have this massive drain of like constantly

403
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,180
fighting with the employer.

404
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,180
I don't know.

405
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,180
I mean, one, I don't know about other places.

406
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,580
I know in Florida, if you're small enough, a lot of these things don't really apply.

407
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:07,300
But I feel like there's just a fundamental difference between the huge tech companies

408
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,580
and like, JB and TMB, right?

409
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,900
It just seems oh, yeah, like you and I are not making 300 times more than our employees,

410
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
right?

411
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,900
It just.

412
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,140
And you know, think about it in terms of employee disparity.

413
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,460
I thought about this when we were getting those emails, and we you know, we didn't talk

414
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,360
about with Apple is imagine being an employee there, right?

415
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,900
Maybe you're like responsible for some subsystem and iOS or some component of the desktop or

416
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,340
whatever.

417
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,620
You now work for a company that's willing to pay like 30 million dollars to do Ted Lasso

418
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,300
and pay those to pay the staff of the Apple TV arm.

419
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,500
Millions of dollars in payroll, millions, right?

420
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,780
Like the difference now between what a developer makes and what Jennifer Aniston makes, who

421
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,380
are both now employees for Apple, is gross.

422
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,180
And that is a whole new level of disparity.

423
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,940
And I don't I know it's different markets and all that, but like at the end of the day,

424
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,100
if you're an employee at Apple, that's a reality for you now.

425
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,500
And that doesn't sit well with me.

426
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,780
Like I'm thinking about it, like in my exact case, the difference between me and my current

427
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:14,420
lowest paid like employee, like full time employee is, I think, like four or five dollars

428
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,460
an hour.

429
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,780
It's a lot narrower in our in our area.

430
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,500
Yeah, I don't know.

431
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,260
I think it's kind of crazy.

432
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,980
lino.com slash coder go there to get one hundred dollars and 60 day credit on a new account

433
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,780
and you go there to support the show.

434
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:34,660
Of course, Linode started in 2003 is one of the very first companies in cloud computing.

435
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,900
I got hip to them about two years ago.

436
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,700
And what I realized is for 18 years, they have been focused on being the best in this

437
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
area.

438
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,380
They haven't been led astray and done a million different little strange things.

439
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,580
Instead, they have focused on making cloud computing accessible, simple and affordable

440
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,580
to all.

441
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,180
And if you are starting a project, Linode is a fantastic way to go.

442
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,580
And they have systems in place that help take care of your box, like with snapshots and

443
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,540
backups if you ever need them.

444
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,140
And they make it really easy to get started.

445
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,660
I frequently deploy a Debian box with Docker preinstalled.

446
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,700
But for example, you could just one click deploy next cloud or maybe Jitsi if you want

447
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,700
to replace Zoom.

448
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,420
They have a lot of just hit a button, deploy the app and get started type stuff.

449
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:19,540
But they also make it really simple for you to go the DIY route if that's what you prefer.

450
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,700
That's why that one hundred dollar credit is so great.

451
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,020
Plus, you get access to their S3 compatible object storage, cloud firewalls, VLAN support,

452
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:33,060
a powerful DNS manager and really great 24-7 customer support.

453
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,580
Linode is always making an investment in their infrastructure.

454
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,580
Their high end CPU boxes have AMD epic processors.

455
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,740
They have super fast SSDs.

456
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,780
They are their own ISP.

457
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,540
So their network connection is fantastic.

458
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,020
And they have 11 data centers around the world.

459
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,860
I mean, it really just doesn't get any better than that.

460
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,340
While I was on our Jupiter Colony reunion road trip, it was Linode that kept the lights

461
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,340
on here.

462
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,980
My on-premises server went down and I ended up having to shift all of my workload to the

463
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,500
Linode instances that I had set up before the trip.

464
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,860
And that kind of stuff is so great too because you can use Linode as part of like a multi

465
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,860
cloud strategy.

466
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,340
Maybe you have multiple cloud providers.

467
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,580
You want to spread out some risk.

468
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,020
Maybe you have on-premises and you want to augment that with a cloud option like I did.

469
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,780
Linode is super flexible in that way and you can run your entire infrastructure up there

470
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,580
because their pricing is 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the major duopoly cloud providers

471
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,580
out there.

472
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,460
So go get started and get a hundred dollar 60 day credit by going to linode.com slash

473
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
coder.

474
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,340
You get that one hundred dollars and you support the CoderRadio program and make it possible

475
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,820
for us to keep going.

476
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,700
That's linode.com slash coder.

477
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,900
Apple today, as we record, so probably two days as you're listening to this, has released

478
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:51,940
iOS 15 and iPad OS 15 along with the watch stuff and I assume the Apple TV stuff.

479
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,260
I wanted to note it since it's happening today on the show and there is actually one real

480
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,940
significant feature in here that I think is decent.

481
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,500
But you have any off the top of your head thoughts about the iOS 15 release?

482
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
None.

483
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,900
I'm actually curious what the feature you think is important is.

484
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,900
Well you know what I'll say this.

485
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,220
I've been using the beta the entire summer on the iPad.

486
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,220
Really?

487
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,220
Mm-hmm.

488
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,220
Way better on the iPad.

489
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,920
They just did one thing and it was really simple is they just made the multitasking discoverable.

490
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,780
They put little tabs in stuff and gave you clues of how to use it.

491
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,240
It's relatively the same but it's so so much better now.

492
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,900
There's a feature in there that I haven't played a lot with because I've really been

493
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,140
waiting for it to land on the phone.

494
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,740
And I think it's a great example of A, the kind of area where Apple was really really

495
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,740
behind for essentially all of iOS and then just sort of leapfrogs with a feature set

496
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,700
that it looks really really competitive.

497
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,180
And then the other thing about it, so B, is it sort of really checks that sync across

498
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:57,300
all your boxes and I cloudify this for everything in the ecosystem the way only Apple really

499
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,300
does these days.

500
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,420
So I'm talking about here is the focus feature.

501
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:07,060
So at a high level the idea behind the focus feature is it's like do not disturb but way

502
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,300
more turned up to 11.

503
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,740
So when you want to focus on a particular task like say maybe you're recording a podcast

504
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,180
or you're flying a damn drone or you're trying to sleep or read a book or play a game on

505
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,620
your device.

506
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:24,060
You can enable that particular focus to silence notifications from specific apps or people.

507
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:30,360
You can also at the same time trigger automations and shortcuts and rearrange your home screen

508
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,820
for that particular focus.

509
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,100
So it's do not disturb on steroids where it touches all this other stuff.

510
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,220
And then you can sync those different focuses so like I'll have one for podcasting, I'll

511
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,780
have one for driving.

512
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,960
You can sync these different focuses across all your devices.

513
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,500
Everything that's either on the latest version of the latest Apple OS.

514
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:56,580
But for me the biggest thing is as you're using it you can start to add people or notifications

515
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,820
to the focus mode or remove them.

516
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:06,180
It gives you a surprising amount of customizations where I could say allow notifications from

517
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:12,420
Mike and Wes but nobody else and it will actually recognize you assuming that the developers

518
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,260
are using the new APIs.

519
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:20,020
It'll recognize you across chat services so iMessage, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp.

520
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,260
If it's using the new API it'll know it's you regardless of the chat application they're

521
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,260
using.

522
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,660
So I can just put you in there as a contact and that means any app you want to use you

523
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,940
can break through and I can specifically allow or deny apps.

524
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,980
So I can say in the case of like when I'm flying the drone this has actually been, this

525
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:42,780
has been a really frustrating problem is because the universe hates me just like when I'm podcasting

526
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:47,060
when I put my drone up in the air that's when I start getting all the push notifications

527
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,820
you know motion notifications, Slack notifications, everything.

528
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:57,380
And the horrible thing about iOS is you can be in do not disturb mode but if you allow

529
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:02,060
banner notifications and you have your screen on you will get those notifications and if

530
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:07,420
you have an iPhone mini and you're flying a drone those banner notifications cover up

531
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,340
a significant part of the screen you're using to fly the thing.

532
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,620
So I can literally be in mid-flight and not able to see where I'm flying because of these

533
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,980
damn notifications or I can be recording a podcast and they break through.

534
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,900
So with these focus modes I choose the task that I'm doing and I will have only certain

535
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,180
allowed applications through and I will have custom home screens so I don't even have to

536
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,380
see the badges of the other apps.

537
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,060
And then they're going to do some things we'll see how it works like some contextual suggestions

538
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,860
based on you know things that it's observed which they seem to get right about 30% of

539
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:46,660
the time but the 30% they get right is pretty clever and in terms of iMessage which is what

540
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:53,100
my family uses for better or for worse it'll let them know I'm in a focus mode and not

541
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,700
seeing their notifications and then there's also some way for them to say this is urgent

542
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,700
break through the focus mode and let him know I need him to see this notification sort of

543
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:10,140
like slack can do and I think that is going to be a feature that genuinely changes how

544
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:17,140
I use my devices and how I'm interrupted which is a rough interruptions are rough for me

545
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,260
and it also is one of those stupid it's a small stupid little thing but it makes me

546
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:29,940
go huh you know if I had a M1X Mac with Monterey it would get silenced when I silence my phone

547
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:36,120
or my watch like they all the iPad the Mac the theoretical Mac that doesn't exist they

548
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:42,180
all would get it and that is extremely appealing to me it's a small stupid thing but yet huge

549
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,380
for me personally.

550
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,580
Really I didn't sell you I thought that was a pretty good explanation.

551
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,860
No because I because I can already hear the complaints like you monster well I can already

552
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:58,380
hear like the family tech support I'm gonna have to do when someone mistakenly puts some

553
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,580
app on a block thinking you know like oh come on you know this Chris you get all kinds of

554
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,020
crazy calls from relatives right like yeah you're the tech guy in the family like I've

555
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:13,060
seen all right my love you and also I understand you love collective bargaining and I'm very

556
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:18,540
sorry but like the woman can destroy an Apple TV in ways that I didn't know were possible

557
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,500
really an Apple that does seem like the impossible.

558
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:27,140
So like giving more settings to my relatives it's just there's a reason I make them pile

559
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,820
life it was to avoid this.

560
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,820
Yeah like you know what I want them to do nothing.

561
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:41,560
I don't even again sorry ma but like she discovered how to turn her phone off.

562
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,500
She's a very smart person but she thought off was silent.

563
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,420
This is years ago when like smartphones were new and that was just a problem right now

564
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,300
granted we're talking the iPhone.

565
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,780
Oh God what was the first one of horizon was it the four or the three G.S.

566
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:03,500
It must have been the I want to say four but I don't know I felt like it took forever for

567
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Verizon to get it.

568
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,940
Yeah well there was a setting you could like change what the button did from like off to

569
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,460
silent or something sleep silent.

570
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,900
Yeah OK it was sleep to silent you could change it and she changed it and she just kept turning

571
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,340
her phone on silent and then being mad that her phone wouldn't ring and like my opinion

572
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,900
is that setting should not exist.

573
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
Right.

574
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,900
I'm just like no.

575
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,860
So I don't love that what you just described it took you at least two and a half minutes

576
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,660
to describe on a technical podcast.

577
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,660
Yeah OK.

578
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,660
All right.

579
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,660
OK.

580
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,660
You're right.

581
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,660
It does seem a little complicated.

582
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,660
Yeah it does.

583
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,580
But it's like it is the new do not disturb and I think they've just taken do not disturb

584
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,380
and they've made it a focus now.

585
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,340
I think it's way better than it was the notification system seems uniquely improved in fact it's

586
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,060
got other things in there too now like silently collecting notifications and just tucking

587
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,580
them away in a tray until you want them instead of like blasting them in your face a lot of

588
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,780
things like that that I think are a nice step up but you're right it is complicated.

589
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,740
You know they're not doing a lot this year.

590
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,060
I think Apple is paying the covid tax this year because let's be honest the iPhone event

591
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,060
was kind of a snoozer.

592
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,060
It was a dud.

593
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,940
Yeah but they're not doing a lot but they're doing more than their nearest peer competitors

594
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,940
for sure.

595
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,040
Unless you care about folding phones and I just want to say at the rate I destroy hardware

596
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,700
can you imagine a folding phone.

597
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,260
Would I even get it out of the box if I could do it right.

598
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,260
I wouldn't.

599
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,260
I kind of liked the clamshell phones but I don't think I want something that thick in

600
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,260
my pocket.

601
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,180
I'm talking the tools you know the same way.

602
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,180
What do they call the Samsung.

603
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,340
Yeah the fact the things that unfold into a tablet basically.

604
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,820
Yeah I can't remember the name but someone will will have it in the comments.

605
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,460
What are your thoughts though on on on the 13.

606
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,460
Did you order one.

607
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,460
Did I ask you last week.

608
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,100
No but you and I are iPad mini brothers apparently.

609
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
No I don't have one.

610
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,100
I thought you ordered one.

611
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,420
No I got a 13 Max Pro.

612
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,420
Really.

613
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,420
Yeah I do like the mini.

614
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,540
I think that's a good iPad but no I don't have one.

615
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,660
I had the I what you're thinking of is I had the iPhone mini with the iPhone mini.

616
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,660
That's what it was.

617
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,660
OK.

618
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,660
Yeah and it's been a disaster for me.

619
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,660
It's just been a dumpster.

620
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,660
So I like to read.

621
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,140
In fact we're going to have a review of it if I ever finish it like you know Manning

622
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,820
presses like technical books.

623
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,820
Oh yeah.

624
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,060
And I find that on the regular Kindle they're kind of garbage because you know you don't

625
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,500
get the syntax outlining or whatever.

626
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,100
I cannot express how painful dropping an iPad pro on my face is with the keyboard attached.

627
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,100
Oh yeah.

628
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,980
When you're sitting there reading in bed and yeah you start falling asleep and you just

629
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,880
like knock your own ass out.

630
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,540
So the mini and also my son has discovered cut the rope.

631
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,540
He's a little late.

632
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,080
Stop being mean to the five year old and fruit ninja.

633
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,060
So he is enjoying the best of 2014 mobile games.

634
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,780
Hey you know what you have to do next is get him on Angry Birds.

635
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,460
I mean you know what the classics are the classics.

636
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,820
How much money those those rovio guys made on Angry Birds.

637
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,760
Seriously it's not anymore dude.

638
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,140
You know it's it they got a version in the arcade now and it's all just like you know

639
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,140
all built in.

640
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,500
No no in-app purchases or anything.

641
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,460
Yeah that's that's it's a while.

642
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,540
They're all going for that subscription revenue now.

643
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,780
Hey get down to 15 percent Apple tax after a year.

644
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,540
Yeah so we'll see.

645
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,540
Yeah I got that.

646
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,540
I've got the big one.

647
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,540
It's problem problem.

648
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:14,220
I'm also I also think live text is a decent feature where you can select the text in photos

649
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,900
in like a screenshot or in Safari or I've actually already used that a couple of times

650
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,900
on the iPad.

651
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,900
So we'll see.

652
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,860
Anyways I just wanted to note that it's here and we're aware of it and I think focus was

653
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,980
probably the only thing that's really going to change my productivity with these devices

654
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,300
and I think it is a nice little note of of system wide setting sinking that Apple could

655
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
do.

656
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,260
They could do a lot more of that if you think about it there's a lot more things they could

657
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:44,740
sink across all these devices and if they got it right and didn't screw it up.

658
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,280
That's pretty compelling feature set for me.

659
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,300
I just want to remind all I was developers of the cloud API you know and sinking and

660
00:33:51,300 --> 00:34:00,940
if they got it right OK Datadog.com slash Coder radio go there and see why Datadog is

661
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,940

679
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,780
Let me tell you about an experimental operating system that Microsoft has developed.

680
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:32,060
It's called Singularity and it's designed to eliminate some of the shortcomings of existing

681
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:37,060
operating systems such as the general security vulnerabilities failures and crashes due to

682
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:42,980
drivers extensions add ons and of course crashes due to unexpected interaction between apps

683
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,100
and an overall lack of performance and robustness.

684
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,620
So they are aiming big here.

685
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:53,620
Their strategy is to utilize a safe programming language no more of C's shenanigans as Microsoft

686
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:59,480
says they will use verification tools impose constraints that will make verification easier

687
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,700
and they have a new architecture and design that they think is tops.

688
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,340
Do I have your attention are you impressed?

689
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,340
No of course not.

690
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,340
Yes I should know better.

691
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,260
It's a very fascinating theoretical study that they did.

692
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,020
There's just one little catch.

693
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:24,820
The last release was in November of 2008 just an old it was an experiment about 18 years

694
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:31,360
ago they thought would make for a better platform for the long run kind of like Google's fuchsia

695
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,780
today that's the first thing I thought of when I saw this is this makes me think of

696
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,780
what Google is doing right now with fuchsia.

697
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:42,380
Okay I mean first of all what does it say for programming language are they just saying

698
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,620
they're doing rust because you know that's great for the hashtags on Twitter.

699
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,020
Well there was no rust 18 years ago was there.

700
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,980
So it's C sharp.

701
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,860
It's Longhorn 2.0.

702
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:56,260
Yeah maybe they actually do have it up on GitHub now so one could go sniff around.

703
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,860
I wonder if this kind of thing like these rich companies you know they do this kind

704
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,100
of stuff these skunkworks projects whole new operating system and then the business

705
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,380
sort of just says that knock it off we got a good thing going over here we're not going

706
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,440
to reinvest in all this because like what ultimately is going to happen to fuchsia is

707
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,420
either Google will slowly replace Android and roll it out to first all its IOT devices

708
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,540
and then its mobile devices and then put it on Chromebooks eventually or in a few years

709
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,000
they're just going to they're just going to give up it's just going to kind of wind down

710
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,820
a little bit because the Linux kernel or whatever that is that they need changed will adopt

711
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:36,940
what they're doing and the business will say ah good enough I mean it just seems to happen

712
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,180
over and over.

713
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,180
It is C sharp.

714
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:45,980
Oh you know of course it is oh yes well I wouldn't expect anything else from you know

715
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:51,020
this is like this is their dream and I have a similar dream or I have a dream I think

716
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:56,520
it's not similar but I have a dream that like I keep going back to that keeps like not working

717
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,580
and I respect them for not giving up is that a dot VBS file get out oh it's got to be right

718
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:09,380
I mean come on get out a VB all right you know this repo we're going to we need to put

719
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,100
this in the chat room this repo is worth a look there's some stuff happening here okay

720
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,660
yeah and I'll put in the show notes too there's also a PDF paper they wrote which I'll put

721
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:22,380
that in the show notes as well it's pretty great singularity how about that and you know

722
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,940
it's the new Microsoft so of course they put it up on GitHub wait what's iron hang on did

723
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:33,980
the PowerShell there it is all right wait wait no way really oh yeah there's a lot but

724
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:40,780
it's mostly C sharp sure of course using common system collections and link you man this is

725
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,260
wild because this is what they were saying back in 2008 this is long software runs on

726
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:49,220
a platform that has evolved over the past 40 years and is increasingly showing its age

727
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:53,860
the platform is a vast collection of code operating systems programming languages compilers

728
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:59,700
libraries runtimes middleware etc and they're calling that as super old and this is 18 years

729
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,660
ago I just want to say I'm looking at some of this code granted this is my cursory but

730
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,780
like this is actually pretty good like if you want to learn C sharp and like hardcore

731
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:16,260
C sharp not like you know you're just doing Xamarin or whatever I would check this out

732
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,260
there's some like they're doing a lot of like bitwise opera they're doing some good stuff

733
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:26,620
here like yeah yeah yeah well their whole idea was if we were going to start today and

734
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:32,500
learn and use everything we've learned how could we use that to create the basis for

735
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:38,580
quote more dependable system and application software singularity exploits advances in

736
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,180
programming languages and tools that create an environment which software is more likely

737
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,540
to be built correctly program behavior is easier to verify and runtime failures can

738
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:52,620
be contained this is fascinating I would actually suggest that like especially our newer developers

739
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,780
or folks wanting to get into it who write us all the time if you are at all interested

740
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:02,380
in the dotnet world or even you know now even just like programming patterns this repo is

741
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:08,460
actually this is this is beefy I was gonna make fun of it but and then in the show notes

742
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:15,600
I'll have a link to a story from a developer who decided to start taking phone support

743
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,700
after never doing it he only opened up in Japanese because he's primarily Japanese and

744
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,300
he had a Japanese phone number I would hope he speaks Japanese if he's only doing Japanese

745
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,900
phone support but of course you know it's kind of an interesting experiment because

746
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,300
he says most of them were polite he says probably mostly because Japanese culture I was yeah

747
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,600
I was just yeah but he did get a few upset calls and this was the key insight that I

748
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,820
thought it almost it almost made me go like maybe I should like have a phone line for

749
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:45,580
like a week the people could call he says you can detect critical parts of your product

750
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:50,420
there are times when there's large problems that's obvious but there's small little things

751
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,780
that the phone calls would expose to him that he realized everybody must be hitting and

752
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,860
that he should probably fix and he says of course there's also an opportunity to improve

753
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:02,740
listening skills and get a better understanding of what clients explain they want and what

754
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:07,500
they actually want but the insight that he essentially was getting bug reports even though

755
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,320
they didn't realize that's what they were gave him critical feedback of a data point

756
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,060
he was missing when the application was in the field without phone support and I thought

757
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,100
isn't that interesting you know and he didn't make a big deal about it I think he just put

758
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,980
it like in the about page or something like that but sure enough he'd get calls the other

759
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,780
thing he said is that if he went a while in between updates in the past people would just

760
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,380
kind of assume the project was dead yes but now people would call him and say hey are

761
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:38,060
you still maintaining this and he could say yes and then he'd have a sale I don't love

762
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:44,020
the fact that most business communications have moved to like slack or email or like

763
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:51,220
you know Trello in my case because we're TMB uses Trello enterprise it's horrible sorry

764
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,660
you guys I can just say like if there is a problem which software always has bugs there's

765
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,740
always a problem people are much much much nicer on the phone than they are on oh yeah

766
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:06,100
sure in fact it it's easier to get a detailed bug report when you're actually on the phone

767
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,940
with someone or better yet in person with them not only are they nicer usually but they're

768
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,300
more generous they'll be they'd be willing to check test more things and do more steps

769
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:19,100
for you over the phone right to walk you through it yeah I mean I I've definitely found that

770
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:25,340
like I mean I mean I've been on both sides of this equation right but like DMS or emails

771
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:32,740
you get at like 2 a.m. or probably like you need to take them with some charity because

772
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:37,340
they're not going to be good you know customers get frustrated I guess my thing is if I had

773
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,540
a consumer facing app like I used to a code journal if I opened like just like I guess

774
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,260
the phone line can't be my phone line it has to be like some kind of view view over IP

775
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:52,340
solution because don't you think you just get too much like random questions this seemed

776
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,440
like his situations best case scenario where he put it in the about version for the Japanese

777
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,000
version of the application so it's very specific I'd be willing to release code journal in

778
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,580
Japan only and have phone support I know they sound great over I mean I can't translate

779
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:13,100
the text into Japanese because I don't know if you have Google Assistant answer and I'm

780
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:19,660
pretty sure I can't compile it anymore but whatever right yeah there is that problem

781
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,620
I've always liked the idea of hearing from the audience that's why I went on that road

782
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:30,180
trip for me I know implicitly with with without any doubt that going out there and meeting

783
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:35,740
the audience gives me a much better understanding of who these people actually are than what

784
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:41,460
I get through social media and chat rooms and I say that all the time so not a big surprise

785
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,580
there but it's like I have to drill the point home because if people aren't frequently experiencing

786
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:53,620
that difference it's I think our our brains sort of normalize it out and we sort of forget

787
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:59,940
how low bandwidth these relationships truly are and we we don't really have a brain that's

788
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:04,300
adapted for a low bandwidth style of communication so we put a lot into that communication that

789
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,180
isn't there because that's how our brains are built that when you're talking to somebody

790
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,420
you see their facial expressions and you see how they're holding themselves and you also

791
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,000
just sort of humanize them more like those emails we got a lot of times if you respond

792
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,900
to them and say you know hey so and so and such and such and I'm sorry or this like they

793
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,000
realize oh yeah right no man I'm sorry I forgot I forgot actually you're a person right you're

794
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,420
not in facts and a Nazi robot for instance right and I probably I've probably heard that

795
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:35,740
a thousand times in emails when I respond but I but I will tell you a little bit like

796
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:40,420
remember way back in the day gather around children in 2012 when I used to respond to

797
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:45,420
YouTube comments now I don't yeah because there are people who are just trolls right

798
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,340
who are just gonna like yes you know and I feel back I've been on both sides of this

799
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:55,460
especially like I'd like to say when I was younger but not that much younger it's very

800
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,860
easy when you're like staring at a slack channel you're staring at a telegram or whatever to

801
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:05,460
forget that whatever thing the person did that annoyed you they are a person who probably

802
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:10,060
has their own stuff going on right how do you know right like you can use me maybe they're

803
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:13,900
going through like an awful divorce right and it's just like whatever they're a little

804
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:18,380
messed up maybe yeah hell maybe they got an offender bender right or some health issue

805
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:22,500
or some health issue yeah and we both had pretty severe health issues over the course

806
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:28,320
of the show yeah I don't know it's something I try to do I would recommend especially as

807
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,420
more of these communications become these asynchronous messaging services right is it

808
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:38,220
clear the direction we're going better or worse you got to remember that like the person

809
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,100
might just have like especially in the age of COVID right everybody's kids are home like

810
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:47,620
people are tired you know people are just run down you got to give a little bit of charity

823
00:46:53,620 --> 00:47:00,460
weeks yeah yeah the hell I was going through I realized I shouldn't have done shows that

824
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,780
last week like the last two weeks you could argue but that last week where I was like

825
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:11,040
trapped in Tucson and it was a hundred and something degrees every day in the RV and

826
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,980
I mean like I just shouldn't have done the shows but I I didn't plan to get stranded

827
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,060
somewhere so I didn't have any backup plans you know the other thing about the behind

828
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,580
the scenes about last week's episode to which people don't know is if you listen to a drew

829
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:29,380
does such a great job but we had all kinds of like crazy strange drifting latency and

830
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:35,820
yeah it like oh god it was so brutal and so awful I shouldn't have done the shows but

831
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:42,240
I think my kid Mike's son was whiling out in the other room right like I think we should

832
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,980
have just said sorry but yeah yeah you know what you know what like you know what big

833
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:52,140
podcast networks do like you know that Roman Mars guy he just he features another show

834
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:57,860
and says I would love to feature stoked this week yeah this week we're featuring something

835
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:02,200
from our catalog and you know then they just roll it and that's that's how they get away

836
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,740
with it I just want to say stoked email him hey you know what stoked was great it was

837
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:12,100
fun I like stoked I don't know why stoked went away well I do know why but well cuz

838
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,700
Star Trek online got a little weird for those of you don't know which would be everybody

839
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,680
I used to do a podcast way back in the day it was a video podcast with some decent production

840
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,920
values I'll add it was awesome yeah and cuz I'm such a big Star Trek guy and we we got

841
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,060
early access to this Star Trek online game which is still going to this day but we got

842
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:34,700
I call that Fisher privilege we were very early we got very early access so they were

843
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,860
here in the event in Seattle and the guy that ended up later on running the project for

844
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:43,420
a while but the guy that was working there let us film for a bit before he shut us down

845
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,280
like he was supposed to and so we had solid few minutes worth of gameplay footage on YouTube

846
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,780
and from there we just sort of took off because we became like this rumor house for the game

847
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:56,700
before it launched and we started a podcast and there's a lot of fun for a long time until

848
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:03,860
until it wasn't the game got bought also my co-host got acquired by the company that we

849
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:08,500
were covering because you really knew his stuff so then you know we had to shut it down

850
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,140
and focus on other things and that probably was for the best you know isn't it gone down

851
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:20,640
though the game yeah no it's still going I don't know how many get out yeah yeah really

852
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,180
yeah it's still going it's free to play now too of course Star Trek online all right well

853
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,860
I think we need to end the show because I know where I'm going oh Windows only never
