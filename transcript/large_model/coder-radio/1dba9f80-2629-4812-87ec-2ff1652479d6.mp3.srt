00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTORadio, episode 377 for August 31st, 2020.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello friends, and welcome to KOTORadio,

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of software development and the world of technology.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So many career possibilities in the cloud

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and so little time.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
ACG's learning paths help you take the right courses

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to prepare for architect developer security

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and many other high paying cloud jobs.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Get hired, get certified,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and get learning with paths tailored just for you.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Acloudguru.com.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And joining me this week, as always,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
is our host, the delightful and wonderful

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Mr. Michael Dominick.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello, Mike.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hello, Chris.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hello.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hello, it's fun to be doing this live again.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's got a whole energy to it.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's beautiful.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, also, if I make a mistake, everybody, you know.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, and you can record falsettos again,

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
so I'm sure you're happy.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes, I am quite happy.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There we go.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, we have so much to get into.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Want to say thank you, though, to our audience

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that is live watching right now,

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
because we didn't really know when we'd be back

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
when we recorded the last one,

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
so we just kind of tossed it out there later on,

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and enough people showed up that made it worth it.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So we have about 200-ish,

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
240-ish people watching right now.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hello to all of you out there on the live streams

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and in the chat room.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's good to be here,

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and if you're wondering what the heck is going on,

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
yeah, it's back.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Your podcatcher isn't lying to you.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The show is truly back.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Acloudguru and Jupiter Broadcasting

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
have made the mutual decision to separate

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and restore Jupiter Broadcasting independent media status.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The demerger will allow for Jupiter Broadcasting

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and Acloudguru to dedicate their resources

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to specializing content that they do best,

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Jupiter Broadcasting in creating Linux

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and open source podcast content

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
catered to enthusiasts and industry professionals,

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and Acloudguru in creating comprehensive

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and hands-on multi-cloud computing,

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Linux and DevOps training for businesses and individuals.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Acloudguru and Jupiter Broadcasting

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
share many commonalities,

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
such as the passion we have and respect

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
for each other's missions

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and the investment we've made in creating

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
accessible, accurate, and engaging content

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
that makes a difference to the audience.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We also share a belief in the importance

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
of giving back to the open source community.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
As such, Acloudguru will continue

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
its support of Jupiter Broadcasting

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
with a sponsorship arrangement

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and will continue to explore

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
other content collaboration opportunities

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
in the future.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So there's a lot to talk about today,

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
including tons of going on in the news,

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Jupiter Broadcasting's big news.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So, Mike, I thought something

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
we should start with, because we're still

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
kind of getting the wheels back on the cart here,

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
is the announcement that Coder Radio

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
is launching a membership program.

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And this one's really by the seat of our pants,

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I have to be honest with you, because

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
some planning just

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
hasn't been able to take place because of the state

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
of the agreements that were in place

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and all of that work being done.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Mike and I started talking about it this morning,

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
just a little bit before we started the show.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And one of the things that we want to do is

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
we want to kind of give you

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
a piece of mind that this show

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
is not going away again.

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Because I know that it can kind of

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
make you a little apprehensive

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
if the show went away once, it could happen again.

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And as somebody who is now

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
launching his independent business again,

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm thinking about it very much from a, well, how do we

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
make it a sustainable production

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
so that way we don't have

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
that issue again? And

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
one of the things that

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
will become more apparent

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
is one of the ways I'll be achieving

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
that is by taking on sponsors.

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But one of the other ways I'm doing that is for a limited

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
set of our shows, we're launching

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
membership programs. And

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
we don't really have some

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
grand offering here.

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We'll have an ad-free feed that

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
has no ads with the exception of ones

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
that are contractually obligated.

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And on top of that, we're

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
going to do something kind of fun for our members

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
that we're going to call the Coderly

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Report, Mike? Is it the Coderly

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Report? Is that what we decided to call it?

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's going to be a fun name. Coderly. Coderly, like quarterly.

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes. Coderly. Maybe that's the way

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to do it. Yeah, and this

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
will be a quarterly members show

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that sort of review of the trends and things that

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
we thought mattered over the last

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
quarter. We'll sort of just, you know, we'll

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
just, Mike and I will know because when it's the end of the business

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
quarter, it's time to do a Coderly.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh god.

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's going to be embarrassing

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
every time.

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is going to be bad. Every time you mispronounce

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
it fumbling every episode.

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The Coder, the Coda, the Cuda,

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Cuda, it's an NVIDIA thing we're doing, right?

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So we're going to make this

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
all available to our members

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
even if I can't say it right.

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And there's a URL you can go to.

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
CoderQA.co.

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
CoderQA.co where we'll have a link

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
in the show notes. And that membership

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
essentially is

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
our hope. Our goal with it is not to

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
make a bunch of money. It's not to be rich

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
with the show. It's not even to make the

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
revenue of a single sponsor.

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It is our hope to get enough of you

147
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and it will take several hundred of you, but it's enough

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
to hopefully get enough that we

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
can make sure an editor can

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
be paid to edit and produce

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the show. That the fee to host the

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
show can be paid. That Mike and I get

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
something, even if it's just beer money,

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
for doing the show. So that way

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the show doesn't run at a loss.

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Say like this week when

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
we have a short ACG sponsor, which you just heard

158
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
a bit ago, and that's it. No other

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
sponsors. This is the sponsor, essentially

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the audience. And so we want to make it

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
a production that is sustainable. And I

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
know this isn't the

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
perfect time to be asking this, but that is

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
actually the very reason I am asking. Because

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the podcast advertising

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
market is going through a

167
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
massive reduction. A long

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
time coming one, in my opinion, as somebody who's

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
been podcasting for 15 years,

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think we have seen a bubble

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
recently where every single company

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
in the world has a podcast, every individual

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
has a podcast, tons of sponsorships,

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and with

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the COVID economy,

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
that is falling through the floor

177
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
right now. And I want

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
to make sure that we have something sustainable here.

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
When we bring sponsors on,

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
those are there because I know some of you

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
either are not interested in a membership

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
or would just prefer to

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
support the show by engaging with

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
our sponsors, which is a 100%

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
perfectly fine way to support the show.

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If a membership is not for you,

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I pledge to do my best

188
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
to do good ad reads that are sponsors

189
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
that we believe in, so you're not really

190
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
losing out anything. If you prefer a show

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that is ad free, that helps

192
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
support the production and keeps the show going,

193
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
we'll have an option for you. And

194
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
that'll be at CoderQA.co.

195
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So you can become part of the Coder Radio

196
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
QA team. And that's

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
what we're calling our members as our QA team.

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I think what we'll do is

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
we'll set the price at $8

200
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
a month, but I'll do the same thing that

201
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I did for Unplugged is I'll do a founder's

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
discount. So it'll be promo code

203
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
founder again, and

204
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
this time, instead of giving out a 100

205
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
because they went really quick.

206
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Founder? No, Jar Jar.

207
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
J-R, J-R? Yeah. All right.

208
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay. Yeah, no, all right. You gotta keep it on

209
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
brand, right? Right. So all lowercase,

210
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
all lowercase, J-A-R,

211
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
J-A-R, and that'll drop

212
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
the membership to $6 a month indefinitely.

213
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And I will make 200

214
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
of those available because they went so quick last

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
time. So 200

216
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
of the Jar Jar promo codes to

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
make it $6 a month.

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you can't support us, just

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
spread the word about the show. Maybe leave a review from

220
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
time to time if you appreciate it or

221
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
engage with one of our sponsors.

222
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And we are absolutely grateful.

223
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We are grateful to have you listen, and we are grateful to have you

224
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
do that. If you are in a position where

225
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you can support us and you'd kind of like to invest

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to make sure that the show continues to go.

227
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I mean, you know, Mike and I, as long as we can make this

228
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
work, we're going to do it. Because this show

229
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
had been running since 2013,

230
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
like a clock. And so

231
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
what we want to do now is just do

232
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
that again. We just want to repeat that again, but we want

233
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
to do it in a climate that makes it sustainable.

234
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So that is at coderqa.co.

235
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Every time you type in Jar Jar,

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
we so appreciate it.

237
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You did

238
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
just lie to them. We were running

239
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
since 2012. You are lying.

240
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Really? I muted and I went on

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to the old Reddit.

242
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Episode 1, June 11,

243
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
2012 is when we made the announcement.

244
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay. Wow. Okay.

245
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, I think I've said 2013

246
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
before as well. Well, now I know.

247
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm glad you caught me. There you go.

248
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Well, let's get to feedback. We're going to do that towards the top

249
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
of the show for a bit here. So coderradio.show

250
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
slash contact if you want to

251
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
send us your feedback or you can hit up either one

252
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
of us on Twitter. And we got a lot

253
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
of positive feedback

254
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
regarding the relaunch of the show. Surprise, surprise.

255
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We kind of were hoping

256
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
that would happen, I'd say. But every time it

257
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
came in, it's still really great to see it because you're like, okay,

258
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
good. It was the right choice. Yes.

259
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This isn't an embarrassing retraction

260
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
coming up, right? Good, good, good.

261
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah, we're definitely not in that territory.

262
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'd say we're very safe

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and far from that territory.

264
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What was the general sense you got that

265
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
people want to see in the show? A lot, actually.

266
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So I

267
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
mistakenly threw this on Twitter thinking

268
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
only a few people would reply. I was

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
wrong.

270
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There was a lot. Now, some of it's kind of like contradictory,

271
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
like, you know, make it

272
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
serious, make it funny, have more guests,

273
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
don't have guests, right?

274
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
A surprising amount of people

275
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
are interested in like

276
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
DevOps-y stuff.

277
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Another one that really threw me for a loop was

278
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
a lot of people asked about the macOS

279
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
ARM transition, which I was genuinely

280
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
shocked with, considered the

281
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
amount of trolling I used to get,

282
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
which makes me think, did I corrupt

283
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
a bunch of you to Mac? Is that what happens?

284
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So, I mean,

285
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I will probably pick up an ARM Mac at

286
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
some point because I have to support software

287
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
that I wrote. The other thing was

288
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
specific

289
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
requests for Wes, which of course,

290
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
right, and for Wes to torture

291
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
me with languages of the week. Yeah.

292
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So, might have to change that to

293
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
month. That was rough last time. People

294
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
like that, you know, they like that, and I could

295
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
see, I also would be down for a challenge

296
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
from time to time as well. Ooh,

297
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
party time. I mean, mine probably can't be as grand,

298
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
but maybe that'd be interesting.

299
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Just gotta print hello Jar Jar.

300
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think I could

301
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
manage that. Of course, it depends on what you make

302
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
me print it in, I suppose, or with.

303
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Objective rust.

304
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I wondered if

305
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
you saw that story.

306
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Four people sent it to me on Twitter, and two

307
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
people emailed me on Hay. We probably dropped

308
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
it in some chat thread somewhere too, I would imagine.

309
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah, I think actually West is.

310
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So yeah, objective rust.

311
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It is exactly what it sounds like on the tin.

312
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You can interface rust and objective C.

313
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What sort of

314
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
sick masochist would have seen this and

315
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
decided to try it? I don't know.

316
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I hope someone in our audience

317
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and I hope they write in with like a

318
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
a breathless justification.

319
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Even I'm like, you know, this is probably

320
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
not what you needed. Yeah, because you take

321
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
the super wild language of objective C

322
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and then marry it to the super strict

323
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
super safe rust and you

324
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
get cognitive dissonance.

325
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't know. Sadness.

326
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's but it's fun. It's a good idea

327
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
if I guess you have tons

328
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
of objective C code and you want to now

329
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
start coding in rust. Yeah.

330
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, I'd love to hear somebody do that.

331
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't think there's I think there's

332
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
one individual and it's the creator.

333
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Maybe I'm wrong.

334
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I mean, everybody does love rust right now, so

335
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
maybe I am wrong. It could be.

336
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I think I saw a lot of people that

337
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
said, you know, they were just happy

338
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
it's back. It is interesting.

339
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I mean, you must have saw this, too.

340
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's like people that somebody will say

341
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'd like to hear you more. I'd like to hear more

342
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
about your work set up. Like somebody specifically asked me about

343
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
like our desk setups and then somebody else

344
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
wrote it and said, you know, don't talk so much about the

345
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
desk or don't actually what they're well, I think

346
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
what they say is don't talk so much about the work stuff

347
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
or something. Right. No laptops of the. Yeah.

348
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it was.

349
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah. Got a couple of those.

350
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah, that's what it was. And so you kind of

351
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
see different. I kind of thought when I saw

352
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
the desk set up when I was like, actually, that would be kind of fun because

353
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I just got a new desk because

354
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
you know, I'm thinking more about the ergonomics

355
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
these days. So maybe in the future, maybe we'll talk about

356
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
that. I was surprised by arm transition

357
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
stuff, and I think maybe it's

358
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
because people are looking at just from a development

359
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
workstation standpoint and wondering

360
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
what's it going to be like to develop for

361
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
an x86 server running in the cloud on

362
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
an arm laptop? Yeah, I mean,

363
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
although you have to remember, we used to get a lot of like

364
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
iOS dev questions, too, right? I

365
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
think there's like a very quiet, very afraid

366
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
group of iOS

367
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
developers in the JV community.

368
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, they're huddled with the dot net guys

369
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
kind of, you know, worried

370
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
about cannibalistic penguins.

371
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You know, it's just

372
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
it wasn't that long ago

373
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
that what OS you ran

374
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
was super contentious. It just seems

375
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
like we got really tribalistic

376
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
with our tools. And then

377
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't know if it's just 2020 in general,

378
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but I feel like this was happening really

379
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
even back when I was on the show is

380
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
something started to change

381
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and all these different OSes just

382
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
sort of looked like different types of tools

383
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
to me, you know, like ones

384
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
snap on and one some cheap

385
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
tool from, you know, Harbor Freight

386
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and other ones, some super nice brand tool

387
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
that does something special but costs a ton of money.

388
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And when I started seeing them like that, I think

389
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
that everything sort of dialed down. And I think

390
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
it wasn't just you or I that had that.

391
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I think a lot of people in the community

392
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
began that kind of reframing

393
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
of the way they saw this stuff.

394
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And maybe it was in part the changes

395
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
of Microsoft. Maybe it's in part Apple's

396
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
focus on mobile. So I'm

397
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
going to give some credit to VS Code here,

398
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
right? VS Code, no matter what OS

399
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
you're running on. And I know people are going to write and say, well, there

400
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
are subtle differences. Yeah, but they're

401
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
really subtle, right? A lot of developers

402
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
regardless of Mac, Windows, PC,

403
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
whatever, Linux, right?

404
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
If you're in VS Code, you're kind of in VS

405
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Code. You're using the same plugins, using the same

406
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
tools. Your config files are exactly

407
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
the same, right? Your build files.

408
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yep. I don't want to swing the standard

409
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
hammer and ring the bell here, but

410
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
it's made it so if

411
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
you're on VS Code and I'm on VS Code and

412
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm on Linux and you're on Mac or whatever,

413
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
we kind of have the same tool chain

414
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
now. Yes, I very

415
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
much had this realization

416
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
months ago when I was using VS Code, which

417
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I've used a lot, but I started

418
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
using it exclusively when I was working on

419
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Docker compose files and config files

420
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
because just the way

421
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
it displays YAML makes

422
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
it so, so simple for someone

423
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
like myself who has to edit a

424
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
YAML file once a quarter.

425
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And so I don't spend a lot of time with

426
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
YAML and you know, it's very

427
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
specific and it's formatting and

428
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
the way Visual Studio

429
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Codes YAML plugin renders that

430
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
just works with my brain.

431
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And I had this realization as I'm sitting

432
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
there on my Linux box, SSHed into a

433
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
server that I'm running Docker on and I'm editing

434
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the compose file

435
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
in VS Code, which

436
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
in the background is doing an SSH

437
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
connection to my server and editing

438
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
this test file on my server in

439
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
real time as I hit save in the editor.

440
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I realized at that moment

441
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
like this is 100%

442
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
parity with anything I

443
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
could do on a commercial platform. And I was on the

444
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Linux desktop for reasons that are just

445
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
like maintenance work. I had to boot into

446
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
the spare Mac I have lying around and

447
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
it was just easier instead of setting up a new

448
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
PyCharm tool chain to test this thing in Safari

449
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
to simply just like, you know, I'm going to

450
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
pop up in code and run the flask

451
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
extension, whatever.

452
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And I was up and running from

453
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
had it turned on this machine in

454
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
three months

455
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
to I found this

456
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
really, really, really lame bug in

457
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Safari and was able

458
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
to document it, throw it into Trello, which is what we're

459
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
using for bug tracking these days and like

460
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
move on and get back to my lemur and fix it, right?

461
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Trello for bug

462
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
tracking, huh? It's not ideal.

463
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Huh? We can have a whole

464
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
torturous story about our QA

465
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
process, but I would be interested in

466
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
some tools discussion because yeah,

467
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm trying to stand up all that stuff right now.

468
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But yeah, that does seem maybe like another

469
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
episode. It's a separate show.

470
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Anyways, if you want to give us your feedback

471
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
coder.show slash contact

472
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
get it in there.

473
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So there is some news over on the GitHub

474
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
land, not necessarily on the features

475
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
of GitHub, but on what

476
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
runs GitHub. If you've

477
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
been following Ruby, maybe you

478
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
dabble in it yourself like Mike

479
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
then you may be aware

480
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
that the upgrade to 2.7 has been

481
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
a little thorny. It's been

482
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
the topic of conversation in the GitHub community

483
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
as well as the Ruby community

484
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
because it's been something that GitHub

485
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
is working on to revamp

486
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
their underlying platform. Now

487
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Ruby 2.7 came out in December

488
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and it looks like GitHub completed the

489
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
migration to 2.7 in

490
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
July. If you're not familiar with their

491
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
stack, they're running on Ruby since the very beginning.

492
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It was Ruby and Rails, but

493
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
hasn't been that for a while.

494
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Ruby 2.7 is a unique upgrade

495
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
because the core team has deprecated

496
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
how keyword arguments behave.

497
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So with this release

498
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
future versions of Ruby will no longer

499
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
accept passing an options

500
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
hash when a method expects a keyword

501
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
argument. So at GitHub, that

502
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
was a big problem. They had

503
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
over 100, no

504
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
11,000 warnings that they had. It was

505
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
11,000 warnings that they had to fix.

506
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And they are big

507
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
they say. We'll have a link in their blog, but

508
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
they're big and they make the case in here. They're big

509
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
on sticking to current

510
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Ruby as much as possible, to stable Ruby

511
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
as much as possible, and they make quite

512
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
the argument for doing so as well.

513
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, so there's a kind of a lot here and

514
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't know that it's worth it because I'm sure

515
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
at some point we discussed this in the past, the whole

516
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
GitHub's like, originally it was like a Rails

517
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
app way back in the day and it has

518
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
evolved for various reasons and

519
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
it's still kind of some Rails

520
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
in there somewhere, but

521
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
it's, I don't know, they've done

522
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
a lot, right? If you're

523
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
GitHub, your needs and your scale

524
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
are just crazy. Yeah,

525
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I mean, pulling off a project like this

526
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
must just be monstrous. Yeah, so

527
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
there's kind of two big things

528
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
operating here though. One, I had

529
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
a similar painful experience with a

530
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
granted much smaller application

531
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
because not GitHub. 2.7

532
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
is quite the lift and if you're the kind of

533
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
person who treats warnings

534
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
as errors, you're going to be sad,

535
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
really sad. But

536
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
that led me, and again, thanks

537
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
to Wes for sharing this, this post

538
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
from Matz, the creator of Ruby on, not

539
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Ruby on Rails, of Ruby, right? DHA

540
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
has created Rails, Matz created the language

541
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
on how

542
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
to, you know, maintaining a programming language

543
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
over time and updating it. You know, the

544
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
desire to keep it current with whatever

545
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the new hotness is in the general

546
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
software development community while

547
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
keeping, you know, stability and compatibility

548
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
for, you know,

549
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
old curmudgeons like me who don't want to have

550
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
all their stuff broken, right? Right.

551
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The reason I put this stuff in the notes for

552
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
this week is Ruby 3 is going

553
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
to be coming out and

554
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
there's a lot there. For one,

555
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Ruby 3 is going to add basically

556
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
a form of static typing,

557
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
which, if you know anything

558
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
about Ruby, is quite the change.

559
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's going to focus a

560
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
lot on a form of

561
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
coding currency. They're not doing

562
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
the whole async thing that

563
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
many other languages have done, so I

564
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
don't feel like diving into that too much.

565
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But there's a lot of change

566
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
coming to the Ruby world, and we're early

567
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
days on this. Actually, like,

568
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Square is the one who has the proposal

569
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
for the new static

570
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
typing, and Stripe

571
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
is the company,

572
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
ironically, their direct competitor,

573
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
who makes a static analysis

574
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
tool called Sorbet,

575
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
which all of this is hilarious to

576
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
me, because you have this dynamically

577
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
typed language, and what is one of the most

578
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
popular tools to use with it?

579
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
A static analyzer.

580
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And what are they adding in the 3.0?

581
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Static typing. Or a form

582
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
of static typing. Optional static typing, mostly.

583
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Because we've seen this, right?

584
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Python 3 added optional types,

585
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
or suggested types, whatever they call it.

586
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You know, I'm struggling with this question,

587
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Chris. Is this a factor of these

588
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
dynamic languages becoming used

589
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
for huge projects, and at some point you actually

590
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
do need some sort of typing?

591
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Or is it Thor being angry

592
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
that I'm besmirching his beloved Ruby?

593
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I tell you, so here's another question to ask.

594
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Here's another way to phrase the question.

595
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Would they make this change if they thought it would

596
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
turn off future developers?

597
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'd argue no. I'd say if they're sitting around going,

598
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
we think this long term will appeal

599
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
to future Ruby developers.

600
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's always the way these projects end up going, is they're always

601
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
trying to grab the next wave

602
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
of developers, and trying to make it

603
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
appealing. I think there's also a competitive

604
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
nature to this,

605
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
trying to prevent bleeding to other languages.

606
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So I'm going to put on my old man hat.

607
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I think a dirty thing

608
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
that is true,

609
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
but only to a point, and is very

610
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
obnoxious to say,

611
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
is that at some point, static typing

612
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
or something close to it

613
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
actually does help when you hit a certain amount

614
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
of complexity in your code.

615
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And it's significantly helpful, right?

616
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But, if you just want to get started

617
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
with something quickly, you maybe

618
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
want to be a little loose, or a little more

619
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
dynamic. I know that's kind of a

620
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
spicy hot take, that's going to get a lot of

621
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
crap thrown at it.

622
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
But, if it weren't true,

623
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
then why does every large

624
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Rails project, or otherwise large

625
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Ruby project, or many large Python projects

626
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
for that matter, always end up

627
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
using some sort of static analysis tool

628
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
to basically,

629
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
or write unit tests

630
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
that they're basically doing type checking that a

631
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
compiler would have done for you. I'm not saying all unit tests

632
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
are like that, so I'm not

633
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
anti-test. I'm just saying that

634
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
it seems like you hit a certain

635
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
scale, and then you end up

636
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
recreating the functionality

637
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
that a static compiler would have given you, or a static

638
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
type checker, rather, would have given you.

639
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah, I think you're right, and I also think you're anti-test.

640
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No, I'm just kidding.

641
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That is not a label I want in 2020,

642
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
alright? I know, right?

643
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I want to get your take on this.

644
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So, before we get to their final

645
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
take, this I just thought was a

646
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
neat little trick

647
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
that they pulled off to make this upgrade possible

648
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
while they have a whole team

649
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
going. They said,

650
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
just like we did with our Rails upgrade,

651
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
we set up our application to be dual bootable

652
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
in both Ruby 2.6 and

653
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Ruby 2.7 by using

654
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
environment variables. This made it easy for

655
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
us to make backwards compatible changes

656
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and merge those to the main branch,

657
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and avoid maintaining a long-running

658
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
branch for our upgrade. It also,

659
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
of course, made it easier for the other engineering

660
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
teams who needed to make changes on the system while

661
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
they were working on the new version and all of that,

662
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and this is the system that they follow,

663
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and they talk a little bit about this

664
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
process, and it seems to me, Mike, is they've

665
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
kind of come up with a process

666
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
to address the rapid development nature

667
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
of Ruby, and

668
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
it's kind of clever. No, it's super

669
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
clever. I mean, I don't know how viable that is for,

670
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
you know, smaller teams.

671
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It seems like an awful lot of engineering

672
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
effort to me, but it's,

673
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
yeah, I mean, that's the kind of thing when you're

674
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
GitHub that you end up doing,

675
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
right? It's

676
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
something you can do. It's something you have the

677
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
luxury to do. Right. You have the resources

678
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and, you know,

679
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
this is maybe not featured enough,

680
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
but GitHub traditionally has been a major

681
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
player in the Ruby community,

682
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
so it's kind of, you know,

683
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I don't know where they're going these days, but

684
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
they're certainly in the

685
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
conversation, right? Yeah.

686
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay, this is what I wanted to get your take on.

687
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So they write, on the blog,

688
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
falling behind on Ruby upgrades has the

689
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
drastic negative effects

690
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
on stability of your code base.

691
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Upgrading Ruby supports your application health,

692
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
improves performance, fixes

693
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
language and framework bugs,

694
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and guides the future of the language.

695
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So they really kind of make a hard

696
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
sell for staying really current with Ruby.

697
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah, the Ruby ecosystem is super

698
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
unforgiving for people who just want to

699
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
pin to an old version and stay back.

700
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I think they're trying to be the model

701
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Ruby citizen, in a way, right here.

702
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yeah, I think so, right? I mean,

703
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
great old example from a couple years ago.

704
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Was it Heartbleed, the one that

705
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
screwed up the OpenSSL libraries, or was that

706
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Spectre? I always get them. Oh no, Heartbleed, yeah.

707
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Heartbleed. You know, let's just take your standard

708
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Ruby project. Let's just say you have a Rails app, right?

709
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You have

710
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Bundler, you're installing gems,

711
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
you have a gem file, you're happy.

712
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You pinned your versions, you pinned your gems,

713
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
you're chilling for like two years, everything's

714
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
great. Uh oh, the

715
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
OpenSSL version's bad, and like,

716
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
you have to, you know, as a security

717
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
requirement, change the SSL library

718
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
that you're using, right?

719
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Uh oh, the OpenSSL

720
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
gem no longer,

721
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
the old gem cannot work with the new

722
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
OpenSSL library. Now you have

723
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
to update that SSL gem, but

724
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
your other gems for things like, I don't

725
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
know, Bootstrap or whatever other,

726
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
you know, literally gems are the

727
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Ruby equivalent of packages, right? That's what they are.

728
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So rely on the old

729
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
OpenSSL gem. Now you have to

730
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
update almost your entire application,

731
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and you have to do it in basically an

732
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
emergency situation. Where

733
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
if you had been doing incremental updates,

734
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
you would have avoided that problem.

735
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And I know this isn't unique to Ruby

736
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
or Rails, but this is the kind of thing that

737
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
in general, gem authors tend to

738
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
be pretty aggressive on deprecating

739
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
old versions of their gem.

740
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So yeah, I mean I

741
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
made this mistake once, it was

742
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
bad, it was a rough week and a half

743
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
of work, and now I do

744
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
quarterly updates, or I'm sorry, coderly

745
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
updates. Hey!

746
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You're way better at it than I am.

747
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's the new Jersey accent.

748
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
We're used to mumbling our way through R's and L's.

749
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah, so I do

750
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
coderly updates on Rails

751
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
projects, assuming people actually have maintenance

752
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
contracts. Well, very good. You know, this

753
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
would be normally the spot we'd have an ad break

754
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
right here. You know, like this would be

755
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
the spot, but we don't have an ad, so...

756
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I can plug something. Are you? Yeah, yeah.

757
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Plug something. I had J. LaCroix

758
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
of LearnLinux.tv on the Mike Dominic show.

759
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Go check it out.

760
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Nice. URL for that?

761
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That's a good point.

762
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Automator.show. I forgot

763
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
the URL.

764
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That's why I don't do the ad reads people, because I'd be like,

765
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
go buy a Linux server from...

766
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Eh, you'll find it.

767
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Just do a Google.

768
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Are you in the Storm area at all down there?

769
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Any of that hitting you? I'm in Florida.

770
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You know, one day

771
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
we're going to be doing the show and Florida's just going to sink.

772
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I know. Hopefully it'll be while we're live

773
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
just for historical purposes, not for you.

774
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Well, you had that with Sandy.

775
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yeah. Back in New Jersey.

776
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah, that was good.

777
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Well, almost seeming like

778
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
it was

779
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Epic and Apple doing Coderadio

780
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Solid. What we have

781
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
foretold, and specifically you,

782
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and what I have warned with Apple's

783
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
ever increasing appetite for services,

784
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
what we have talked about on this show

785
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
seems to have become the number one

786
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
tech news story right now.

787
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And that is Apple versus

788
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Epic, which is just

789
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
continuing to develop. And you know what, Mike?

790
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Do you know there's a bit of an irony with this?

791
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
At least in my opinion,

792
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
this last couple of weeks, like

793
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
last week, was the 25th

794
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
anniversary of Windows 95.

795
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
That's perfect.

796
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Isn't it? Because you can point at Windows

797
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
95 as kind of the time when

798
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Microsoft started to really have the tech

799
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
community resent them. And that resentment

800
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
really started to build with Win 98

801
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
and then when they bundled IE,

802
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and then it really developed all the way

803
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
to an antitrust that the government

804
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
was actually successfully prosecuted.

805
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And then there were people that were monitoring

806
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Microsoft for years, and it changed

807
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
the game in a lot of ways. And

808
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I think Windows 95,

809
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
you could really kind of mark as the

810
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
beginning of the general tech community's awareness

811
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
of this.

812
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It was 25 years ago. Now here we are,

813
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and it's happening to Apple all over

814
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
again. People have known for a while,

815
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
but it's been kind of in the tighter tech circles,

816
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
the more tech literate.

817
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But now this is busting out into the

818
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
general audience, just people

819
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
who buy Apple products and people who

820
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
play video games.

821
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And I don't know if this is too bold of a statement, but this

822
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
feels like this is the worst

823
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
pushback. This is the broadest

824
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
recognition of this problem we've ever seen.

825
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, for sure. I mean,

826
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
yeah, it's one thing for two

827
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
guys to be, you know, kvetching on

828
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
a podcast, but when

829
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Epic is suing you in every jurisdiction

830
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
they can find, Spotify's going after

831
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
you in Europe, oh, and you're getting summoned to

832
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Congress, which, by the way, can we just stop?

833
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Tim Cook claimed in front of

834
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Congress that they treat all developers the same

835
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and charge 30% the same

836
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
when they've admitted

837
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
they don't? Yeah. That seems

838
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
bad. Yeah, I don't get that,

839
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and maybe Apple's justification for that

840
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
is they classify the

841
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
businesses they've cut custom deals with as

842
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
something different, but, yeah,

843
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
they've clearly made deals in the past with

844
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Amazon, I think Netflix they've made a pretty public

845
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
deal with, and others.

846
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Microsoft for Office, they

847
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
did one for Adobe. Right.

848
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
There must be some lawyerly way that

849
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
he's safe.

850
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So there is some nuance to this.

851
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
What Epic essentially wants here is

852
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
their own currency and their own app store

853
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
inside

854
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
the Fortnite video game, and that

855
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
may be where it's far above and beyond

856
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
with anything that Amazon or Netflix

857
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
or Microsoft have asked for.

858
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
They released an update that tried to bundle

859
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
some of this into the app. It was sort of

860
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
the beginning of this process, and Apple rejected

861
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
it. This has

862
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
de-escalated, or this has escalated, I should

863
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
say. Yeah, there's no de-escalation happening.

864
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah, no, it's continued to escalate.

865
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
In fact, at this point, pretty badly

866
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'd say, and now Apple really looks to me like

867
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
a bully. So Epic

868
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
was ready when Apple

869
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
started to say no

870
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and reject the app.

871
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Epic went all in with a sort of

872
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
killer time, 1984-esque

873
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
inspired ad that

874
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
was well executed. Incredible.

875
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
They had a lawsuit ready to go,

876
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
they had talking points ready to go,

877
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and they continued to push it.

878
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It has so far

879
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
not seen any resolution,

880
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
and to this point now,

881
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Apple has confirmed that

882
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
they have pulled

883
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
the authorization, I

884
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
believe, for Epic's

885
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
developer account. When you become a

886
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
developer, you have to pay a $99 a year

887
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
subscription, and there's also keys that

888
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
have to be signed. All of that's been deactivated.

889
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So there's some nuance

890
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
with that, though.

891
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Epic, like many big corporations,

892
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
is not in fact one company,

893
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
which I did not know. Yeah, sure.

894
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So there is a developer

895
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
account for Fortnite, and I guess

896
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
they made some game called Infinity Blade that

897
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I know nothing about, but sure.

898
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That is the account that got

899
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
deactivated. Apple wanted to

900
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
deactivate the one for the Unreal engine,

901
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
which would have screwed about

902
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
50% of the indie game developers

903
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
because they would have

904
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
just, that would have been devastating.

905
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
For those who don't know, Unreal is,

906
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
if you've heard of Unity, Unreal

907
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
is the Pepsi to their Coke, right?

908
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Or the Coke to their Pepsi, whatever.

909
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Is that fair, though? Oh, the market share.

910
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Yeah, but I mean, Unreal is a hell of an

911
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
engine with a very interesting... That's true.

912
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
For Unreal, it's more of a high-end engine.

913
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah, with an interesting

914
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
monetization strategy on that one. But anyways,

915
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
all of this is just in service of the conversation.

916
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
We'll have details linked in the

917
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
show notes. And I think a lot of people

918
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
when they talk about this, they talk about it in the cut,

919
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
like 30% cut from

920
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Apple. They talk about it in those terms. They talk about

921
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
the subscription prices here.

922
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I think if you zoom out,

923
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
though, this is really about,

924
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
if you buy a thousand dollar

925
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
device, should you be the one that ultimately

926
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
decides what gets installed on it? In my

927
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
opinion, that's the bigger conversation here.

928
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's telling to me that that is not an argument

929
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
that anybody who matters in this conversation,

930
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
i.e. Apple or Epic, are making.

931
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Right? Apple's taking a paternalistic view

932
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
of we are protecting the user.

933
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Epic's saying Apple is, like, you know,

934
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
limiting us. No one's saying, well, what about

935
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
the user? Except for you. That's good.

936
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Well, and why is no one really bringing up

937
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Google in this? Because they were also removed

938
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
from the Play Store. I believe there's also

939
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
a lawsuit with Google and Epic,

940
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
but no one's discussing that.

941
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Well, there's two obvious reasons, right?

942
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
One, Epic did not make an amazing

943
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
parody commercial for Google.

944
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah, okay. And Google does not

945
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
claim to be, like, the underdog

946
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
who's treating developers fairly. In fact,

947
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
oh, also, Google didn't go nuclear on them.

948
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Right? Like...

949
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
True. Apple did not, like, even

950
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
blink on this. They didn't, like, say,

951
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
take a breath, SimSweeney, calm, sit down,

952
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
let's talk about it. Apple just went, no, you're

953
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
not doing this.

954
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You know, man, recently they've really kind of been over the top.

955
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It really seems like this year they cranked it up.

956
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Did you hear that they also were screwing around

957
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
WordPress trying to get a cut of the...

958
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I saw that. Yeah. Yeah. And that's just

959
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
one of many recently that they've

960
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
done this to. If you listen to

961
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
or read Ben

962
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Thompson's Daily Update,

963
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
he apparently,

964
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
according to him, heard from

965
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
many, many, many

966
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Apple developers who have had this happen

967
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
to them, but they are afraid about

968
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
breaking non-disclosures if they...

969
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Retaliation. Yeah. Yes. Exactly.

970
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So, retaliation

971
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
would be a concern, so they're just not saying anything

972
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and instead they're trying to figure out how to make a way

973
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
to give Apple their cut. And Apple seems

974
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
to be of the opinion that they deserve it.

975
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
When you read their internal emails that get leaked,

976
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
they talk about

977
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
developers essentially as freeloaders

978
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
that should be grateful.

979
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I would say the word is sharecroppers.

980
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Yeah.

981
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
When in reality, it's the App Store that brings

982
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
nearly all the value to the

983
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
iPhone. Nearly all of it.

984
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And so, Apple should be

985
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
doing everything in their power to make

986
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
developers happy. I mean, there's

987
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
two simple solutions here as far as I

988
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
see it. Number one, allow

989
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
separate pay systems. You know, the developer

990
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
chooses. And number two, allow for side

991
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
loading. And I'm not saying that's a good

992
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
solution, but it just seems like

993
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
if Apple does those two things, they can do anything they want

994
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
with the subscriptions that they run, they can do anything

995
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
they want with the App Store. I almost don't think

996
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I mean, I would like them to do side loading,

997
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
but I don't even know that this

998
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I don't even know that that's necessary, right?

999
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So there's I think

1000
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
a mistake is that a lot

1001
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
of people are focusing

1002
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
on the 30 percent. Yeah.

1003
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Which is onerous, sure,

1004
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
but it's, you know,

1005
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
it is what it is, what it is, right?

1006
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It's their store front. Right. But the

1007
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
the restrictions on

1008
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
what you can do. See, and I tweeted

1009
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
about this. It's like like

1010
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
we were doing a show. What was

1011
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
it last year or year and a half ago where Lana

1012
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Del Rey? I was very happy about this. Lana Del

1013
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Rey was the singer at some iPad event

1014
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
that released the iPad Pro. I

1015
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
bought one that day, right? I was like all

1016
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
in. Then I went to research

1017
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
doing an app using the Thunderbolt port

1018
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
on the on the iPad

1019
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
or I'm sorry, the USB port on the iPad

1020
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
and it was completely technically

1021
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
possible to do what I wanted to do, Chris.

1022
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Like a lot of work

1023
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
but possible. Can't do it

1024
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
because Apple doesn't want you to.

1025
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And to me, that's like, whoa,

1026
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
whoa, whoa. Hang on. If I want to sell somebody

1027
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
an app, which granted in today's

1028
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
business model, you would never like

1029
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
outright sell them an app. But, you know,

1030
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
if I want to license somebody an app and

1031
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
they want to buy it,

1032
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
why are you getting in? Like, obviously

1033
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
protect from malware. Do your thing.

1034
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But why are you standing between us telling me

1035
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
yes, we have this technical functionality,

1036
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
but only we can use it?

1037
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
That seems kind

1038
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
of bad. Yeah,

1039
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm not saying I agree with this statement,

1040
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
but I think Apple sees

1041
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
their devices more like consoles

1042
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
than they see them as portable computers.

1043
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Clearly wrong. That's not true. The iPad

1044
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Pro is like one of the best laptops on the market,

1045
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
which I know is a hot take. But

1046
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
well, no, actually,

1047
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I tell you what I went on. I want to

1048
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Texas trip and

1049
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I took two devices with me, the

1050
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Pine Book Pro and the iPad Pro

1051
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
with the keyboard, you know, the overpriced

1052
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
expensive but super great keyboard.

1053
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
The Pine Book just couldn't really

1054
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
keep up much beyond a single

1055
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
application at a time. And it came

1056
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
to the point where when it was time for me to go into

1057
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
an office and do a little bit of work, I was taking

1058
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
the iPad with me. And then when you combine that

1059
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and this would be true for any device like this in

1060
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
this category, when you combine that with a good

1061
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
keyboard and an LTE connection,

1062
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
the ability to just sit down

1063
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
and say like a new office space where

1064
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
nobody's given you the Wi-Fi information yet

1065
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and you just need to get some stuff done

1066
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and just have a connection and have

1067
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
everything work and have that performance

1068
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
be absolutely 100%

1069
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
consistent.

1070
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It does make it a really great

1071
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
portable laptop.

1072
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It is not a tablet anymore, but I

1073
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
still think the way they see the distribution model

1074
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and the security model is much more

1075
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
in the console frame of mind than it is

1076
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
in the portable computer frame of mind. And

1077
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I think that's one of the clear divisions as they see

1078
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
it between the Mac and the iOS

1079
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
platform. I mean, I use my iPad

1080
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
very much in the way you described. Well, I should say used

1081
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
back when I could leave the house, but anyway.

1082
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Sorry, let's

1083
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
forget about what people believe in ideals

1084
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
here. Let's just get down to brass tacks.

1085
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
If you're Apple and you have

1086
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
three weeks in a row of John Syracuse,

1087
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Marco Arment, and Casey Liss,

1088
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and I feel like that first one really scares you

1089
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
a little bit, just like beating on you

1090
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
for being a bully and being greedy and

1091
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
doing all these bad things because

1092
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
they're not just hurting big developers.

1093
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
In fact, they're usually nicer to

1094
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
developers. Don't

1095
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
you just wake up and say our dedicated

1096
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
fans are literally John Syracuse

1097
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
was writing Mac OS reviews or

1098
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
OS 10 when it was called that for

1099
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
a decade

1100
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
or more, definitely more

1101
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and they're beating

1102
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
up on you. Doesn't

1103
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
that kind of

1104
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I don't know. Doesn't that hit some cord or

1105
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
is it just too much money? We can't

1106
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
overcome the money.

1107
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You know, this is so this goes back to

1108
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
sort of by grave prediction

1109
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
when I was on the show

1110
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and I kind of came on here and I said I have a warning

1111
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and I think this is going to make Apple

1112
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
a less appealing platform for developers.

1113
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And I said their drive for

1114
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
services is going to change the

1115
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
company in so many ways.

1116
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And this is one of those ways

1117
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
when you have revenue

1118
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
stagnating, or I guess the other way to put this

1119
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
is growth stagnating in

1120
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
a lot of your key categories

1121
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
like iPhone.

1122
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You need to show that you're really

1123
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
hustling on those services. That's what

1124
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
all this Apple TV plus stuff is.

1125
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
That's what all these huge announcements with

1126
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
celebrities like

1127
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Steve Carell who did Space Force. Now he's doing

1128
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the morning show

1129
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
like these big names that are just

1130
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
famous out there. They're doing that because

1131
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
they're trying to show the market

1132
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
in part. They want successful content

1133
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
obviously and they want to recoup an investment.

1134
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's also a signal. It's a signal

1135
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
to Wall Street. It's a signal to that stock

1136
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
price that we are investing

1137
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
in the long term in a big way

1138
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
in services. And they are

1139
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
determined on those quarterly reports

1140
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
to show that services revenue

1141
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
increasing because this

1142
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
is a narrative that we've seen play out with every

1143
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
major tech company. Wall Street wants to see

1144
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
growth somewhere. And if

1145
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
you can show growth in a category

1146
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
even if it's only a small fraction of your

1147
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
business. If you can show growth in that

1148
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
category then you show Wall Street

1149
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
there's something worth investing. The news continues

1150
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
to be positive. People continue to buy

1151
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
your stock. Your stock price goes up.

1152
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
You have now fulfilled your duty as the CEO

1153
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and the people that are in the administrative level

1154
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
of Apple and the board's happy.

1155
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It's a really complex dynamic situation

1156
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
that is forcing this. And I think also

1157
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Apple has

1158
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
two underlying factors about them

1159
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
that come from that jobs DNA.

1160
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Number one is

1161
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and I'm going to come back to this. They don't run to the

1162
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
press and chew someone out. They don't go

1163
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
this guy is a real jerk.

1164
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
You're not getting the full story. They don't do that.

1165
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
They generally allow for the

1166
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
passage of time and the court documents to come

1167
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
out. And then several months later you realize

1168
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
oh Tim Sweeney came along

1169
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
he made this ridiculous request

1170
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
to Apple. They were completely dicks

1171
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
about it. And now that's why Apple's responding

1172
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
this way. That kind of stuff generally

1173
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
comes out with time. But right now it looks

1174
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
really bad because only one primary

1175
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
side has spoken on this issue.

1176
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So you have that. Number two is I think Apple

1177
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
is really just internally

1178
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
jerks about this kind of stuff.

1179
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They think they are the gods

1180
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
gift to developers and end users

1181
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and you should be grateful for being

1182
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
on their blessed platform.

1183
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And how dare you just hang

1184
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
out in their store with free rent and

1185
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
not cut them in on the deal. If you

1186
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
came in our store and you're selling

1187
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
those baskets we want to cut

1188
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
those baskets. We deserve a cut of those

1189
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
baskets because it's our storefront that

1190
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
got the customers buying those baskets in the first

1191
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
place. And that's how they see it.

1192
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I mean there's so much there. One

1193
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
the Tim Sweeney emails did already come

1194
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
out. And if you haven't read them Chris. Oh my god

1195
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
they're great. Oh really. I know I have

1196
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
not seen those. He and I share a few

1197
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
character flaws. Oh my god.

1198
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
He's like you said this to Tim Cook.

1199
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
What did you think he was going to say.

1200
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Oh you're right. I'm evil. I'm so sorry. Let me stop.

1201
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
What. Yeah. He just ignored you and said

1202
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
no. Yeah. Like

1203
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
so your basket

1204
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
analogy is interesting because

1205
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
they're not just saying we want to cut your basket.

1206
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
They're saying oh and we're going to pick which baskets we have

1207
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
which they're operating

1208
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
like a retail store. But they're in fact not

1209
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
a retail store. Right. Right.

1210
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
They're saying you can have these baskets

1211
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
of these types and we get this

1212
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
much money from those baskets from these like

1213
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
basket weavers I guess. I don't know.

1214
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Okay.

1215
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Maybe too far with the baskets. But like

1216
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
why. At

1217
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
some point and I granted this will take like

1218
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
five years but doesn't

1219
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
they just undercurrent

1220
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
frustration among developers

1221
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
like

1222
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I can't stress this enough. It's

1223
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Marco Armit and John Syracuse who

1224
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
are now criticizing them. That's

1225
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
you know that's like the pope losing the

1226
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
nuns. Yes I agree.

1227
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
But for the people that don't attend the church

1228
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
sort of business as usual.

1229
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
This is I think because it's

1230
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Fortnite a different case it is

1231
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
it's a wider known issue and it's bringing it

1232
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
to more general public awareness.

1233
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But otherwise you really just have

1234
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
some priests who have been taking

1235
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
this stance for a few months and the people

1236
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
that attend the church are aware of the issue but outside of that

1237
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I think it's I think it falls

1238
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
mostly on uninformed ears.

1239
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You're probably right then. So you think that the average

1240
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
person who buys an iPhone or an iPad

1241
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
doesn't understand that they

1242
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
are fundamentally not getting the best

1243
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
applications the best experience they could.

1244
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Correct. And although

1245
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
maybe put a different way they just

1246
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
fundamentally value different things. They

1247
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
fundamentally value Apple

1248
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
doing this police work

1249
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
at the front doors to make sure

1250
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
that apps are safe. True.

1251
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
There is something to that

1252
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
because I don't really hesitate

1253
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
installing anything on my iPhone. You know there

1254
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
could be something that's like copying clipboard contents

1255
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
or something that's spying on my use but

1256
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
in terms of like something taking over my device

1257
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and loading up with ads or taking

1258
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
over my DNS or anything that's

1259
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
actually going to permanently change my OS

1260
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
that would cause me to have to reload. I am not

1261
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
concerned in the least and in

1262
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
part it's because of the OS design

1263
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
but in part I also

1264
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
think it's knowing in the back of my mind that

1265
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
app review exists and it's doing

1266
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
some of that work up front and it has

1267
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
created a

1268
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
low risk

1269
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
environment to try apps and that

1270
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I think is good for developers because it means people

1271
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
are more likely to tap that install button

1272
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
and I think consumers

1273
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
perhaps like that

1274
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
a lot more than they would like being able to

1275
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
sideload an app or have an app

1276
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
store in Fortnite. Well I don't think

1277
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
anybody but Epic wants

1278
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
an app store in Fortnite. I mean yeah.

1279
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
No kidding. There's no

1280
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
angels here right. We're very Catholic today

1281
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
by the way. Yeah.

1282
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So okay.

1283
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Do we want to dance with the devil

1284
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
here and make a prediction. Oh

1285
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
yeah I'm curious to see what you think. I think

1286
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and this is based on just

1287
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
an obsessive amount of reading from lawyers

1288
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
on this. Fortnite is up for an

1289
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
epic loss here because all

1290
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Apple is going to do is say what

1291
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
monopoly. Ever hear of Android.

1292
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah. And game over.

1293
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I agree. That's the thing is Apple

1294
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
doesn't even have a majority market share.

1295
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
No. And it's

1296
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
it. I hate going

1297
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
back to ATP but like John Sercuser tried to make

1298
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
an argument about well Apple has a majority

1299
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
of the people who spend money on their phones

1300
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
but that that's not going to hold up. I mean that come on.

1301
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah. Yeah. It seems

1302
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
weird to me that a billion dollar company is

1303
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
going so like it's one thing when like

1304
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
you know Basecamp goes nuts

1305
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and like starts yelling at Apple right

1306
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
or like a small developer writes a nasty blog

1307
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
post whatever whatever because you

1308
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
know when you're small sometimes you

1309
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
you're like a badger right. You have to be a little

1310
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
vicious or else you'll just get crushed

1311
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
but that picks a billion dollar company

1312
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
like they must think they

1313
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
have a case. So

1314
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
it seems that there's possibly over

1315
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
100 million Fortnite players

1316
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
on iOS and perhaps somewhere around

1317
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
20 30 million on Android.

1318
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
There's not really super current numbers

1319
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
in Epic's case. You could you could

1320
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
argue that Apple has a more direct impact

1321
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
over them because they maybe have more users there but

1322
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I think you're right. That's such a nuance

1323
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
there. And the truth is there's more Android devices

1324
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
and it's the same problem over there just slightly

1325
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
slightly less egregious

1326
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
and then there is coming

1327
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
back to this the end user aspect

1328
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
of it. I 100 percent

1329
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
every single time if I can subscribe

1330
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
to something on my iPhone versus doing

1331
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
it on the web every time without

1332
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
question every single time every time

1333
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
it's so much easier to go into my iPhone

1334
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and just cancel a subscription. I don't have to call

1335
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
anybody. I don't have to go to some website remember

1336
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
a log in. I just one unified

1337
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
place I can see all my subscriptions

1338
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
and I do this for things like

1339
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
streaming when I don't need to stream

1340
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
like a CBS All Access when they're not running Star

1341
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Trek. I just pause it as

1342
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
you should. That's why they're creating so many Star

1343
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Treks. But my point is there is

1344
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
a user experience

1345
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
aspect to what Apple enforces

1346
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
that I think they could argue

1347
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
is more valuable.

1348
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I think to us it's

1349
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
not. And that's you know ironically

1350
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
why we should be Android users

1351
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
because you can already sideload on Android right.

1352
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I mean this is really is a non-issue

1353
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
although Epic did try to do that

1354
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
for a while right. They tried for 15 months.

1355
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Yeah and it did. It didn't work

1356
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
because that's crazy right.

1357
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Yeah. And by the way we shouldn't be Android

1358
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
users because we have done years of episodes

1359
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
on Android's failure on tablets.

1360
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So that's true. It's true.

1361
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I have a Fire tablet and

1362
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
it is so bad.

1363
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm pretty sure I ordered the ad

1364
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
free one and it still shows ads

1365
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
on the lock screen. It fires

1366
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
the Amazon like don't call me a Kindle

1367
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
right. Yeah I they're just

1368
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
so cheap there sometimes you can get them. I'm

1369
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
not kidding you for 60 bucks. Oh it's like

1370
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
a Google Home.

1371
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And I yeah they actually will also act

1372
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
as echoes. But what I do

1373
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
is I wall mount them and I use them to interface

1374
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
with my home automation system. So

1375
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
they're they're consoles with just screens up

1376
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
all the time. But they work for that. They're single

1377
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
purpose tablets. Yeah well for 60

1378
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
bucks and they last. I mean I've got

1379
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I've had it going now for well over a year. They

1380
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
just great. Yeah I just have

1381
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
the screen scheduled on and off and

1382
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
oh my lord it rocks.

1383
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It's pretty high tech. So what's your

1384
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
prediction. Is it is a straight defeat

1385
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
as I'm thinking or what do you think.

1386
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I mean Epic has really

1387
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
put themselves out here as fighting

1388
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
the people's fight to take

1389
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
down Apple's restrictive practices.

1390
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It's a pretty big walk back the

1391
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
people's fight to get more money

1392
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
from iOS users and have the Epic Games

1393
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
App Store on iPad. I know

1394
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I know you're right. You're right. You're right.

1395
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
No but I would prefer

1396
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
they win. I'm being a little snarky but I would

1397
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
prefer they win. I just don't know. I would too.

1398
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I would prefer they win as well here

1399
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
even though I don't as you say I

1400
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
don't think there is any heroes or any angels in this

1401
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
particular fight.

1402
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But Epic is just the right

1403
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
size where they're not so big

1404
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
like a Facebook or an Amazon where Apple

1405
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
is just going to automatically do a deal.

1406
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But they're not so small that they can't

1407
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
afford this fight. So they're kind of the

1408
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
perfect fighter for this

1409
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and they've obviously got their game

1410
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
and like I was saying

1411
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
before it's one of those

1412
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
issues Fortnite that reaches the people

1413
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
it goes beyond the church of tech

1414
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
and I think that

1415
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
combined makes them a very

1416
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
unique fighter. I'm going to say

1417
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
their developer account gets

1418
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
reinstated

1419
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
for the next

1420
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I was going to say the next coder but that's probably too soon

1421
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I think that's too soon. Well Apple

1422
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
has already offered to forgive

1423
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
them if they just put the old version back in.

1424
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
All right I'll take a risky bet. I'm going to say by

1425
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
next episode they've

1426
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
they've come to a resolution on that

1427
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
so on just the developer

1428
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
account aspect

1429
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I may wait till that episode to make my

1430
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
prediction on what happens. The only reason

1431
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I think you could be right there

1432
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
is because you know I am not a

1433
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Fortnite player. Neither am I.

1434
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
But in reading up on this I've had to like learn what the

1435
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
hell Fortnite is. And apparently

1436
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
they have some deal with Marvel

1437
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
and it just came out. Oh yeah

1438
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
cool. So there's got to be a lot of kids

1439
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
who like want to play on their iPad

1440
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I know they have a new season release they're doing

1441
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
and it's not available on iOS.

1442
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I don't know maybe everybody's home because of COVID

1443
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
so that maybe they're on like Xbox.

1444
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Yeah. Yeah. This is

1445
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
the weirdest situation where don't you kind of

1446
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
just want to send them to marriage counseling. Yeah

1447
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
you really feel like this should be

1448
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
like two reasonable businesses that

1449
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
both want to serve customers and make money should be able to

1450
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
work this out. Well even like even like just

1451
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Apple right. It's an Apple therapy like

1452
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
we understand that

1453
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
you want this thing. You would like to

1454
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
get 30 percent everything that touches

1455
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
the iPhone but you can't

1456
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
have that. So is there

1457
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
some accommodation we could reach here

1458
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
to like make you happy and

1459
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
have you not you know

1460
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
act like Kronos eating all the

1461
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
this got weird but

1462
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
you know what I mean. Yeah

1463
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I do know what you mean. You look at it iOS

1464
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
has been around what 10 11

1465
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
years now and you

1466
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
could see it maybe being justifiable for the first

1467
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
few years but it would have sort of been like

1468
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
when the Web came to the Mac

1469
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
and Apple would have tried to try to

1470
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
take a cut of every transaction on the Web. It's just

1471
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
at a certain point the scales too ridiculous

1472
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
the platforms become too common.

1473
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Oh my God you're right.

1474
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I mean I'm right. They're going to get

1475
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
killed. Apple had this fight once before

1476
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
with Adobe Flash and they crushed them

1477
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
yeah right out the gate. They

1478
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
destroyed the entire flash market and

1479
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
they were a lot weaker back then as a company

1480
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
too. And Adobe was an important

1481
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
partner. They in reality could go a

1482
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
lot harder at Epic than they can at Adobe

1483
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
right. It doesn't seem like Apple has

1484
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
them because Epic agreed

1485
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
to the terms of service. So they're violating

1486
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
a contract they agreed to if

1487
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
the contract's legal. Right. That's Epic's whole argument

1488
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
that it's not. Yes. Right. Right.

1489
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But Apple I think it's a pretty good case.

1490
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
It's our store front and it's not even the

1491
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
biggest one. I mean that's a good that's a

1492
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
good I don't see what a hell of a fight

1493
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
and it what it really is about

1494
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
though I think again like I started with is about

1495
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
the freedom of what you can do with these devices.

1496
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And this is just the beginning of

1497
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
that question. Oh yeah absolutely.

1498
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
This is like the first big part of that conversation.

1499
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Then once this gets settled

1500
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
the next question becomes well what about

1501
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
users because right now this is about why I'm a company

1502
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
and I want to make more money to my

1503
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
and I have I don't have a direct relationship with my

1504
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
customers that use these general computing devices.

1505
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That's essentially an abstract version of what

1506
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Epic's argument is. But what about the end

1507
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
users. When does that conversation happen and

1508
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
what precipitates that conversation

1509
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
where I don't know if we'll have one or if

1510
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
we'll we'll see Mr. Dominic

1511
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
you know before we go

1512
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I was chatting with

1513
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
the team and I think

1514
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
the way this episode will these episodes

1515
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
will land will be Wednesday evenings

1516
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
at coder dot show Wednesday probably

1517
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
being you know generally

1518
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
the Pacific time or somewhere in there but

1519
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
so go subscribe just so you get it automatically

1520
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
when it comes out at coder dot show

1521
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
slash subscribe and then you

1522
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
just get it when we release it or

1523
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000

air and go set it all up.

00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It's going to be one of those. So go

1539
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000

membership for the first 200.

1542

That's a pretty good deal right there.

1543
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And it really it means a lot to us.

1544
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
We're excited to do this show and

1545
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
as both of us being small businessmen we

1546
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
know we got to do it in a way that is

1547
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
sustainable and also in a way that

1548
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
justifies it being on the calendar

1549
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
every week you know for the first few weeks of course

1550
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
of course it's super exciting. But what about a year

1551
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
what about two years from now. How do we continue

1552
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
to justify to ourselves and we think even

1553
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
if there's not a sponsorship that membership will help us do it.

1554
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Thank you very much. Coder QA

1555
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
dot co. Mr. Dominic give

1556
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
us a plug for the Twitter feed or somewhere for people

1557
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
to get a hold of you. Yeah go to at

1558
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Dumanuco on Twitter. I am finishing up a

1559
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
project and you can watch me cry

1560
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
because goddamn that last 10

1561
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
percent. Yeah

1562
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
right. I know isn't it always the way it is.

1563
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I feel you. It's always the way it is.

1564
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Plus like right now I've got like a dozen

1565
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
projects going just to get the business back up.

1566
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Oh it must be crazy for you. Yeah I

1567
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
am very fortunate I was able to sneak out

1568
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and I spent a night in the woods last night

1569
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and then I drove into the studio so I could do the show

1570
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and that I find to be

1571
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
recharging. There's things that keep cropping

1572
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
up tube just because you know when

1573
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
you're a business there's things you never

1574
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
expected you'd have to deal with

1575
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
to actually operate the business. So the

1576
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
one that was solved last

1577
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
week is the furnace

1578
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
in the studio is really really

1579
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
old. It's like 20 years old right.

1580
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It's really need to be replaced

1581
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and the venting that

1582
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
goes from the water heater to the furnace

1583
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
that runs in the garage

1584
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
collapsed when we had a new

1585
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
roof installed over the summer.

1586
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Well the server for JB

1587
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
is out in that space and all of a sudden

1588
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
the garage started getting really really

1589
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
moist because the water heater was venting

1590
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
directly into the garage the server

1591
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
garage. Oh no.

1592
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Why is it so moist. My server is

1593
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
going to have mildew. What's going on here.

1594
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And then we started looking around and realized that the venting

1595
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
collapsed. So we had the roof fixed

1596
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
which made the venting collapse and so

1597
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
now we've had the furnace replaced and new

1598
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
venting put in. And so now the

1599
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
server garage is not

1600
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
mildewy.

1601
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
That's what it's like to run a small business right there

1602
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
in a nutshell. And that was just one of the many

1603
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
projects. That sounds right. Well thanks
