00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 469 for June 6, 2022.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,920
Hello friend, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,640
at the art and the business, the software development, and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,640
Positioned right up here from the sunny Pacific Northwest, we're joined as always by our

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,520
host, Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,520
Hello Mike.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,840
Hello Chris, and your brother in good hair was spending some time with us earlier.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,160
He's sort of the hair king really, isn't he?

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,160
Really the lord of the hair.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,920
The hair force one, you could say.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
Something else, I tell you what.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,760
Yeah, I also am wearing my uniform.

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,280
You like my new, look at that, huh?

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,120
Pretty snazzy Star Trek uniform I got here.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,240
I decided now you can just call me Captain Pike.

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,160
Well, I have to tell you, I have seen all but the most recent episode of Strange New

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,080
Worlds, and with apologies to President Roslin.

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
I'm in love again.

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
Oh, really?

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Number one, if you will.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
If number one, yeah.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Of course.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
I know you.

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
I know you.

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,120
For me, I'm kind of a nurse chapel guy myself.

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,640
I could see that, because you're a little more quirky over there.

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840
I'm like, no, I want some command presence.

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,600
But you know, to tell you the truth, I am pretty impressed with this new Star Trek series.

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,720
You and I recently got on here, and we were yelling at the clouds about the new Star Trek

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,760
and the kids that write it, and then Strange New Worlds comes along, and they haven't screwed

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
it up so far.

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Yeah, it's really good.

33
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,440
Isn't it the same writers?

34
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,160
It's mostly the same team, but you know, I've been thinking about this.

35
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,640
Why is it so much better, right?

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,960
Why is it better?

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,520
And I think I've got a few reasons.

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,160
I think number one, they had to break out of their mystery box formula, because it isn't

39
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,400
one overarching story where they build and make more and more intense as the season goes

40
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
on.

41
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,080
The problem there, that I always have with Picard and Discovery, is they don't deliver

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,200
when they build and they build and they build, and then they just don't deliver.

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,680
The ending, like the season finale, it's always such a mediocre delivery.

44
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,680
But with the episodic nature of Strange New Worlds, they can't do that.

45
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,520
They can't just keep opening mystery box after mystery box.

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,680
They kind of have to keep it tidy per episode, and they're doing character arc stuff.

47
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,160
But that, I think, has been a big limiter, and I think it's forced them to solve a big

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,360
issue that a lot of us had with it.

49
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,720
I think number two, they're working with legitimate source material, right?

50
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,360
This is a 50-year-old pilot they're working with here.

51
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,660
The source material was created by the original team.

52
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,680
It isn't a whole cloth creation like Discovery and Picard are.

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,960
Yeah, I mean, they can't have that much source material, can they, though?

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,320
They've got to be doing something.

55
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,540
I mean, you've got Spock, you've got Ohura, you've got the Enterprise, you've got Pike,

56
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,120
you've got the Era, you've got all of the stuff that we know about that Era, like the

57
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,080
Klingons, the Romulans, right?

58
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,940
It really provides them, yet it's like a framework.

59
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,860
But because it's so vague, like you kind of just said, there's also a lot they can... It's

60
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,520
sort of like the perfect balance for this new writing team, I think.

61
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
This is my theory, at least.

62
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,440
This is... Because you want to look at it almost from a product development standpoint,

63
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,840
because the first couple of versions, Picard and Discovery they launched, I think don't

64
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
hold up as products.

65
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,340
I think they had systemic problems.

66
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,480
But then they got this one so far, they've got it right.

67
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,080
Now, they could still screw it up.

68
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,360
But what changed, right?

69
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,560
And was it an institutional thing?

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,980
Was it a leadership change?

71
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,280
Was it a team change?

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,440
Was it new constraints that just forced a better outcome?

73
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
Sometimes it's that.

74
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,240
But I can't help but think, what changed?

75
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,080
What made it a better product?

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,240
That I think there's a lesson in there for anybody.

77
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,360
I wonder if it's that we all know how the story with Captain Pike goes.

78
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,800
I think the fans would have an uproar if they did some alternate universe BS and saved him,

79
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
right?

80
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,880
I don't know, 40-year-old spoilers, I guess?

81
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
Yeah, actually I think it's near 50, actually.

82
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Near 50-year-old spoilers?

83
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
Maybe.

84
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Dude doesn't do well.

85
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,120
I mean, he does... Well, it ends badly.

86
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
I don't know.

87
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
I like it.

88
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,800
I will say, I loved the first couple episodes of Picard, and then I was just like, this

89
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,680
is very... There's just a lot of nothing happening here.

90
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
There is that.

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,080
So they are right at the point where sometimes New Trek loses me.

92
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
I don't know.

93
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
It was really good.

94
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,440
And I know this episode I haven't seen yet, Shoreleaf, and I just want to hope that they

95
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,640
have those statues on Ryza.

96
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,560
Oh, is that the next episode?

97
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Huh.

98
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Okay, I haven't seen that.

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
Oh, maybe I'm not behind.

100
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
They come out on Thursdays, don't they?

101
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Yeah.

102
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,160
So it'll be the day after this episode comes out.

103
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
So we're recording on Monday.

104
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Today was WWDC 2022.

105
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,720
Yes, we all returned to the mothership.

106
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,200
I am totally discombobulated because I didn't get in until right before the stream starts.

107
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,080
So this is going to be a focus show is what I like to call it.

108
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,360
And I think, you know what you and I need to figure out, which we could have talked

109
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
about earlier.

110
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,920
But we got to figure out when we're going to do a double because you're traveling and

111
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,680
I'm traveling soon.

112
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,320
So I was thinking maybe like the next thing we record is a feedback special.

113
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,240
I was thinking that or or we shouldn't be doing this on the air.

114
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
I don't think.

115
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
But why not?

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Production meeting time.

117
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
I do have that dev one.

118
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,840
Oh, I think we should talk about that today, possibly today.

119
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
First impression.

120
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
All right.

121
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
All right.

122
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Yeah.

123
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
First impressions today.

124
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Yeah.

125
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
But we'll chat more.

126
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
We might actually need to prerecord two episodes.

127
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
I don't know.

128
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
But you and I'll sync up.

129
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
So I don't have much feedback for today's episode.

130
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,160
But I thought we'd start with a couple of WWDC highlights and what kind of just work

131
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,260
through what you and I found interesting.

132
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,840
Apple mentioned right at the top they have thirty four million developers.

133
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
That's a lot.

134
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,600
A hundred dollar a year subscriptions.

135
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,100
I'm sure some of those are free, but thirty four million devs is their biggest number

136
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,680
ever.

137
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,480
They really went all in on Craig Federici this year.

138
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,480
They have like glorious Mission Impossible meets Air Force One.

139
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,720
I actually loved all of them.

140
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,960
They were so on the on the edge of being too much.

141
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,000
But I loved him, especially that one where he super ran like speed and put his hair back.

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,900
I might have a man crush on Craig Federici.

143
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,560
The only problem is when he tries to be earnest and he tries to be earnest about your privacy

144
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
and stuff like that.

145
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
I don't buy it anymore.

146
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,640
I also don't buy his epic basketball shot.

147
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,960
I don't think he made it across town.

148
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
OK.

149
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
That's where they went too far.

150
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,560
Is the the Swift a track suit?

151
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Yeah.

152
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Yeah.

153
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
It was too far.

154
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
It was too much.

155
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,880
I feel like that conference where I watched Craig Federici try to claim that, you know,

156
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,100
any kind of sideloading at all would hurt mom and grandma.

157
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,200
It changed forever how I see that guy now.

158
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,440
Like when I see him get all earnest about safety, I just don't really buy it.

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,680
It seems like he's acting.

160
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,800
I also thought the Tim Cook stuff seemed a little rushed.

161
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,320
It was just boom Tim Cook.

162
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,620
He was kind of going like he needed another couple of takes.

163
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,680
This was like his first or second take of the read and he was rushing through it.

164
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,260
They didn't treat the audio.

165
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,560
So there's because I'm listening on my studio headphones.

166
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,600
There's a crazy echo on Tim's audio.

167
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,040
They did and they've shot in those locations before without that problem.

168
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,840
And Tim Cook just kind of he just he blazes through the beginning and he blazes through

169
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
the end.

170
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,280
They were both clearly shot at the same location at the same exact time of day.

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,760
They got like 20 minutes with Tim this time and they just rushed it.

172
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,120
And I find that wild considering this is their most public thing they do now.

173
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,640
I feel like Craig Federighi is just kind of better at the kind of silly, you know, showman

174
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
stuff.

175
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
Oh, no doubt about it.

176
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Craig's the better showman.

177
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:27,280
But Tim's previous introductions were much more produced like they were the camera shots

178
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
were better.

179
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,760
The audio was better.

180
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,280
Tim's reads were better.

181
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,760
You know, when you're working with somebody who's not familiar with any of that stuff,

182
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,320
they generally need a couple of passes at it before they get a real natural on camera

183
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
read.

184
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,520
I didn't really bother with that with the intro or the outro.

185
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,480
And he didn't show up at all in the rest of the video.

186
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,600
Just an interesting observation, I thought.

187
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,960
Probably fine.

188
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,220
I felt like there was an overall theme to this WWDC.

189
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:57,400
And not to be cliche, but I really felt this WWDC theme was finally like we're finally

190
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,240
getting this stuff.

191
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,820
Some of it it's like I'm kind of angry.

192
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,240
It's only now arriving and some of it's you know, it's great to see it here.

193
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Like they made a big start with the new lock screen.

194
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,600
It looks great.

195
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,480
It reminds me of watch customizations.

196
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
But I can't believe we're 10 years into this thing.

197
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,800
We're finally getting this.

198
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Yes.

199
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,880
And the whole profiles thing, which is directly related to the to the lock screen is I looked

200
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,760
it up was a feature of WebOS way back in the day.

201
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Yeah.

202
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,880
And different Android vendors took cracks at this, too.

203
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Yeah.

204
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,720
Generally, Apple does a better implementation when they do.

205
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,960
And they one thing I liked is right off the top.

206
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,560
They're like API for this API for this.

207
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,600
Like the new lock screen, there's a live activities API, the new focus mode.

208
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,000
There's now a focus filter API that extends into apps.

209
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You know, that kind of stuff.

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Right.

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,080
There's now a new shared with you API for messages so you can reach into their new APIs

212
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,920
for dictation, new APIs for maps.

213
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,520
They just boom, boom, boom, boom.

214
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,460
Every time in the beginning, it didn't keep going like this, but at the very beginning

215
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,980
of the keynote, everything they announced, they said, and there's an API for it.

216
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
That's good to see.

217
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
That feels right.

218
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,440
Like that's how they should be at a developer conference.

219
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,460
And the one thing that I noticed and I'm curious your thoughts on this.

220
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,900
They are really clever with their messages strategy.

221
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,360
And I think most of the chat room that was watching live didn't get it.

222
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,580
Messages has been this steady iteration of improvements.

223
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,060
A lot of times it's like features other stuff have had like marker group thread as unread.

224
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,040
They just got that.

225
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,460
But it works, doesn't it?

226
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,620
Because you don't want to move the gas pedal on the average user.

227
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,920
And this is an average user app.

228
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Yeah.

229
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,300
I mean, we've been schooled by the younger folks that listen or about the whole green

230
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,040
bubble thing, right?

231
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,680
So I mean, I, you know, I'm notorious for typos and it was funny when he did the one

232
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,820
that said, babe and Gabe, I've done something very similar and you just want to change that,

233
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,820
right?

234
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
You just want to like have that not be like something that can come back, you know, 10

235
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
years.

236
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,820
Well, I had an embarrassing type.

237
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,260
One of my dad that was one of those things, you know, I was like, oh my God, sorry dad.

238
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,260
Yeah.

239
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,260
It's good to see that stuff.

240
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,260
I suppose.

241
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,860
I think in general, Apple has pretty good family stuff, but I think they finally address

242
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,560
the shared photo album.

243
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,820
We've gotten questions into the show about this and this isn't too revolutionary, but

244
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,180
the idea is that it looks like it's going to use some like face ID.

245
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Yeah.

246
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:22,060
I mean like identifying the faces in the photo albums, it's going to use location information.

247
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,100
It's going to use your family sharing settings and a feature that I think is clever when

248
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,820
you're in the camera app taking the picture, there'll be a little indication if this is

249
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,740
a photo that's going to your private library or your family library and you can tap to

250
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,660
toggle that.

251
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,120
Nothing really, no developer story here, but I actually really like this from an end user's

252
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,260
perspective because I've got devices I'm taking pictures with, my wife does, now my kids do

253
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,700
and Angela does.

254
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,660
We're all in one family sharing group.

255
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,540
We are constantly trying to figure out best ways to share photos.

256
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,380
And of course, it's all synced to iCloud and backed up.

257
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,980
I mean, for average users, these are table stakes features that again, finally-

258
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,980
Yep.

259
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,220
I mean, I feel the parental control stuff I think was good.

260
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,580
Maybe not super interesting for the show, but it goes into your family sharing thing

261
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,580
right easily.

262
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,100
Oh, you know, every couple of years, kid has to get a new iPad because weirdly enough,

263
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,940
schools use them now, right?

264
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,740
But you want to lock that stuff down if it is not school issued.

265
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Yeah.

266
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,060
And it looks like you're going to be able to set that up up front now, right?

267
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,980
Up front and be able to control it from your device rather than have to be like, give me

268
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
the thing.

269
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
I got to go into settings, blah, blah, blah.

270
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Yeah.

271
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,500
And a little NFC setup too, so you can bring your phone to their iPad and start just setting

272
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
it up automatically.

273
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Yep.

274
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Love it.

275
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,820
I like the kind of just when we jumped over the new shared with you API, depending on

276
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:49,860
how robust that is, that could be really cool when you tie it to shortcuts, right?

277
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,260
Or even just like automation workflows.

278
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,740
You know, oh, get me all the pictures that grandma sent, right?

279
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,460
I'm in a very family oriented boat apparently right now, but you could see how that could

280
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:08,460
really just ease a lot of the like, ah, copy, paste, blah, blah, blah, go back, get another

281
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,460
one, copy, paste.

282
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,460
Yeah.

283
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,100
And it'd be a great way to just make sure you're always grabbing the photos and backing

284
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
them up and you're not accidentally letting them expire and lose them.

285
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,900
And yeah, especially when you pair with automation, I can see that really nice.

286
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,460
There was one that our chat room was like, I think the most universally against one of

287
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,700
the announcements.

288
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:31,620
And this was the full CarPlay takeover, your, all your dash, your whole dashboard, everything.

289
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,620
How often does it, I can tell you from my experience, my phone dies all the time, right?

290
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,020
If I'm running around going from place to place.

291
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,300
And also that seems really distracting to me.

292
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,460
I have no doubt they would build in some sort of can't edit while you're moving feature,

293
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,100
you know, accelerometer detects movement.

294
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,540
They just disable editing.

295
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,540
Ford's going to have to build their own UI.

296
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,020
I guess I have to be like, you don't have your iPhone with you fall back to something

297
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,020
sane.

298
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,060
Oh man, that means this is going to suck, right?

299
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,060
I hadn't.

300
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,060
Of course.

301
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,980
So that was like 20 manufacturers are claiming they're going to support this.

302
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,780
I'll play devil's advocate and just say, you know, I, I agree that CarPlay is a mandatory

303
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:13,420
feature or Android auto if I'm using the Android because ultimately it is a much better experience

304
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,940
than anything that the vendors provide.

305
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,620
And like one of the reasons why I don't really want a Tesla is because I can't do CarPlay

306
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,620
on it.

307
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,900
And I know that sounds crazy and I'd probably get over it, but I love having my podcasts

308
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,620
and my nav and everything can be on my phone.

309
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,900
I can look a route up on my phone.

310
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,380
I can download podcasts on a phone, all that stuff you can do on your phone and then I

311
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,340
can just go plug it into my dash and I have all of it on the screen of my car.

312
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,340
I love that.

313
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,980
Uh, I could see it being a better experience than what any manufacturer is going to make,

314
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,980
but you're right.

315
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
They could never depend on it.

316
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,820
So of course it's going to be like an application that's running on the vendor's platform.

317
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
I don't know.

318
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,660
It does make you think maybe Apple does have some like division internally that's doing

319
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
car stuff.

320
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,700
Even if it's just for these kinds of products and not ever going to result in an actual

321
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,700
car.

322
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,700
Could be.

323
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Yeah.

324
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,620
I personally super excited to see them spend so much time talking about matter up on stage.

325
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:15,420
Matter is a multi-vendor home automation protocol basically, and it includes Amazon and Google

326
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,540
and Microsoft and the Zigbee foundation and a whole bunch of vendors.

327
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,240
And the great thing about it is it requires to be compliant with the matter standard.

328
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,160
Vendors must implement a local control API so you can control devices over your land.

329
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,780
It's a requirement to be compliant with the spec, no cloud services dependencies.

330
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,300
Now you can use cloud services and you can offer additional services, but the minimum

331
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,580
spec requires that you have a local control protocol.

332
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,580
That's a big deal.

333
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,020
And so to see Apple up on stage pushing it when it's been sort of lagging, I felt was

334
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,340
a big moment for the matter protocol.

335
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,380
I think this WWDC just changed the game for matter.

336
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,180
So for us in like the self-hosting community, this is a big deal.

337
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
Yeah.

338
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,900
It would be great if a standard kind of became de facto and we could get.

339
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,220
I don't do a bunch of the home automation stuff, but from what I hear from self-hosted

340
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,140
and just a weird guy I know who complains about it all the time, not Chris, is that

341
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,440
none of this stuff is really compatible.

342
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,620
So like HomeKit's its own little dimension and yeah.

343
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,780
Before we get into like OS and APIs and all that kind of stuff, I just wanted to get your

344
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,440
opinion on the heart stuff they talked about.

345
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,840
They have new tools now to monitor for stroke.

346
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,900
They have AFib history.

347
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,960
They've updated the health app to like display all your AFib information and to export it

348
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,320
as a PDF for your doctor to review.

349
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,740
They seem to have a real focus on heart health.

350
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,740
Yeah.

351
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,740
I think it's all good.

352
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,740
I mean, I use the current stuff.

353
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,060
So when iOS 9 comes out in production mode for Apple Watch, I'll use that too.

354
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,060
I think it's good.

355
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,220
It's a watch is perfectly placed to also get that information.

356
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,540
If you're not wearing it in some weird way, like up your arm.

357
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,540
I like it.

358
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,540
I think they do a good job.

359
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,500
They're pretty accurate if you wear your watch with the proper tightness.

360
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,380
I mean, I kind of like all the fitness stuff as I'm trying to get in better shape.

361
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,860
They seem to, you know, they seem to be really focused on progressing your fitness rather

362
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,200
than just saying hit your steps.

363
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,500
In particular, the heart zone rate monitor is interesting because you could say, I don't

364
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,680
for someone who has a heart problem, you maybe don't want to go above a certain zone, right?

365
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:31,980
Maybe you want to stay, the goal is to stay low, not to go high unless you have to.

366
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,580
Linode.com slash coder.

367
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,100
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go to support this here

368
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
show.

369
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,380
Keep the coder program going by going over to Linode.com slash coder.

370
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,120
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

371
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,420
You got to try it for your next project.

372
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,880
That's how I've deployed everything for the last couple and a half years, but I am so

373
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,060
impressed by the project that we did this last weekend.

374
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:56,260
We set up PeerTube again on Linode, using its object storage as our backend for our

375
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,540
video storage.

376
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:04,340
And during WWDC, we had several hundred people live streaming from our Linode PeerTube instance

377
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,480
and it worked fantastic.

378
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,900
And now those videos are up there available for playback, streamed straight from Linode's

379
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,900
object storage.

380
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,740
And they got 11 data centers around the world.

381
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,180
So if you want to deploy something for yourself, they got something close to you or your customers.

382
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,480
If you want something with extremely high throughput, they have AMD epic processors.

383
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,460
They have MVME storage.

384
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,300
They even have 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors, but the best part, they

385
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,820
are their own ISP.

386
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,700
So they just have fantastic connectivity.

387
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,460
And then you combine that with the best support in the business.

388
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,320
The massive hyperscalers that want to lock you into their esoteric platforms can't afford

389
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,300
to do the level of support that Linode can.

390
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,780
And as far as features go and the UI, well, Linode has been refining that for 19 years,

391
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,060
steadily making it better and better.

392
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,540
And now it's the best place to run an application on Linux.

393
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,500
They recently introduced managed databases as well.

394
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,180
I've told you I love their object storage, their cloud firewalls, their alerts that you

395
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,340
can simply configure, their dashboard that makes it simple to see what your machine is

396
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,760
up to, and of course, the support and the performance.

397
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,780
Go build something, go learn something, try something and support the show.

398
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:22,860
Just go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 and try it out, linode.com slash coder.

399
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:30,160
I think the biggest item that got your attention and my attention is the M2 was announced,

400
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,780
and there's a lot here.

401
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:37,100
50% more memory bandwidth, up to 24 gigabytes of RAM on the base M model, eight core CPU,

402
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,220
that's four high performance, four efficiency cores.

403
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:47,820
They're saying on average it's about 18% faster than the M1, about 1.9X, that's 1.9 times

404
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:53,980
the performance of an Intel chip at the same power level, so nearly twice the performance.

405
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,980
And they have a now 10 core next gen GPU, that's two more cores than the M1.

406
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,660
They're claiming 25% better GPU performance at the same power level as the M1.

407
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,380
They have a new next generation neural processor unit in there, a new next generation secure

408
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,920
enclave in there.

409
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,740
The media encoding engine has been greatly improved, multiple 4K and 8K streams, ProRes

410
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,200
encode and decode, et cetera, et cetera.

411
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,540
The new M2 chip, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say they're lapping Intel again, they're

412
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,280
looping them now, it's a loop.

413
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,840
It's a pretty impressive display.

414
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,700
Did you also notice that they had to compare them to old Intel Macs too, just to?

415
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,580
Yeah, that's where it's brutal.

416
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,580
That was really brutal.

417
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,820
So you see it all come together in the M2 MacBook Air.

418
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:48,180
They touted that the MacBook Air is the world's best selling laptop and it's got a new square

419
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,180
design.

420
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,580
It's 20% thinner, they've popped the screen edge to edge basically, they've brought the

421
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:03,060
ports back, they brought MagSafe back, it's fanless, oh man, it looks like a killer machine.

422
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,220
It looks like a good machine.

423
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,380
It's got the notch, but I think the notch isn't as big a deal as some people would say.

424
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,640
It's a good machine.

425
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,020
It's like the M1, it's interesting too, the pricing's pretty competitive.

426
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,740
The M1 is now 999 and this one is, what, 1099?

427
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,180
Yeah, 1199, yeah, 1200 bucks.

428
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,420
For a laptop, it's pretty well specced at 1200 bucks.

429
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,260
You could buy the base model and use it for six, seven years pretty easily.

430
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,420
Yep, and then there's the 13 inch Pro.

431
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,300
Well, no, I would destroy it in three days, or when the next model comes out.

432
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,220
Right, of course, accidentally.

433
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,220
Accidentally.

434
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,220
But the MacBook Pro, 13 inch, another respectable choice for those of us who sometimes do air

435
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,260
travel and can't open large laptops because we're chunky.

436
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,260
I like it.

437
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,660
I like how they can't say fans though, they have to say active cooling system.

438
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,140
It's like the most Apple thing possible.

439
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,200
Fans are beneath us, so we say active cooling.

440
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,300
We have an active cooling system to sustain performance, but then they're not really clear

441
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,460
like what the difference is between fanless and active cooling, other than just more performance.

442
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,860
So if you want more performance, you gotta get the Pro, but then you're also getting

443
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,860
fans.

444
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,340
Well, you know how, I mean, you know what it is, right?

445
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,900
They use the low energy cores more in the air and blah, blah, blah.

446
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
Yeah, yeah.

447
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,780
No, yeah, they do a good job of managing the fans.

448
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,740
I still have yet to hear the fans in my 16 as far as I can remember.

449
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,380
I think maybe once in the Mac Mini M1, I've heard the fans kick up when I was doing like

450
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,340
a trillion things on it.

451
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:39,540
They're claiming that it's 39% faster in some photo filter work than the M1, 40% faster

452
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,260
in gaming performance, 20 hours of video playback on the MacBook Pro.

453
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:49,380
P3 wide color gamut display, $1,300.

454
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,580
It's expensive, but I would argue that if you were to spec an Intel equivalent at $1,300,

455
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,300
I bet you that MacBook comes out on top.

456
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,420
Probably the thing that, I don't know, I'm going to guess you probably care the most

457
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,180
about, maybe not, is Mac OS Ace Ventura.

458
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:09,100
You know, it kind of blows to be the Alfred app, I guess, because Spotlight's getting

459
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,140
a lot of the features that power users use.

460
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,220
Safari changes, I didn't have time before the show to really read into them.

461
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,860
I'm hoping that Apple is like, although I honestly care more about mobile Safari than

462
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,140
I do Safari.

463
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,860
So let's just like keep embracing standards and not being jerks about things.

464
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,900
No, passkey looks interesting for your password, you know, management needs.

465
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,900
You know, the stuff that I was like, blah, like I never give a crap about mail.

466
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,580
Stage manager, I don't really think that, I use magnet, right?

467
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,300
I like tiled windows, so.

468
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,060
Is this Apple attempting to bring some sort of window management system?

469
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,060
What is this?

470
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,160
So stage manager is this new way to auto arrange windows.

471
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,220
You can group windows together.

472
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,740
It brings one to center focus and slides the other off to like a new kind of dock on the

473
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,740
side.

474
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,380
It remembers window layouts for you.

475
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,300
I'd be interested to see how that works with multi window.

476
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,260
They didn't cover multi window or multi monitor at all with this.

477
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,260
It gathers them together.

478
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,980
Like, so if you have an app that has four or five windows, it'll bundle them all up

479
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,980
for you.

480
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,660
This is not the direction I expected for the Mac.

481
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,800
Um, you know, I think, I think with stage manager, you see Mac and iPad kind of coming

482
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,700
together and I, we have another section about iPad OS.

483
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
But that is it, right?

484
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,500
That's, that's the punchline is now stage managers on iPad OS.

485
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,860
Now that feels like a revolution.

486
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,700
This feels like another mission control on the Mac, but on the iPad it feels like a fundamental

487
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
feature that's been missing.

488
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Yeah.

489
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,220
I mean, I, I guess, you know, I keep wanting them to just like unleash the iPad and they

490
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
did talk.

491
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,300
And this is again where I'm gonna have to look at the dev sessions about new pro app

492
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,300
API.

493
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,180
So I don't know what makes an API a pro API or like a regular API.

494
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,780
Um, so I'm gonna have to look at that.

495
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,820
Things I didn't buy their whole little bragging about gaming.

496
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,500
It's just, no, right.

497
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,300
It's not going to happen on Mac.

498
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,780
Well, wait, before you go onto that, going back to the iPad, they said that apps will

499
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:10,380
get 16 gigabytes of virtual memory that they added a virtual memory manager to iPad OS.

500
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,340
That seems kind of like a big deal.

501
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,340
Yeah.

502
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,340
Good for Photoshop.

503
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,900
It's going to be great for Photoshop.

504
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,680
Also they introduced real grownup display support.

505
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,780
Like you plug in an external display, you get the full resolution and you can drag windows

506
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,580
between the screens.

507
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,580
You know, I, I've been burned by this so many times where I get like get off a WWC or one

508
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,580
of their events.

509
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,580
I'm like, yes, finally I can do those pro tablet app Star Trek style that I want to

510
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,580
do.

511
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,900
And it's like, well actually these are just basically iPhone apps blown up.

512
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,960
Isn't the issue, honestly, that they could do anything to make iPad OS multitasking more

513
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,660
powerful and at the end of the day, if you don't know if your app's going to make it

514
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,100
through the app store, what's the point?

515
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,180
What's the fundamental issue?

516
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,500
They don't even touch on that.

517
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,660
Well, there's, there's, it's really a two step, right?

518
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:01,180
One, does the API exist to do what you want to do?

519
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:08,020
Two, is it somehow skirting or coming close to a perceived edge for maple and you don't

520
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,340
really know what those edges are.

521
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,540
Now I'm still willing to bet now that they've had to do the Epic lawsuit and you know, there's

522
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,580
going to be more of this app store or scrutiny that they're going to be a little less jerk

523
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,700
like about this stuff, but obviously like anything that tries to skirt in app purchase

524
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,460
is always going to, going to be looked down upon, shall we say.

525
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,860
I do wonder about things like why can't we have like a really, really good text editor

526
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,180
that actually can like compile code or like do a debugger on the iPad.

527
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,140
And the answer is because they just don't believe in that.

528
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,940
They want the code that always runs no matter what environment to be downloaded and vetted

529
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:49,680
via the app store, which is a security thing, but it also severely limits some of the cool

530
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,260
things you might be able to do with an iPad app, right?

531
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:00,460
I will double check on this.

532
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:08,100
I hope to be wrong, but I have a feeling these are more impressive demos than, you know,

533
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,500
than actual leaps forward and making the iPad.

534
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,780
You know, when I say a pro app, like I don't know what pro API means.

535
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:20,340
Like I said, when I say a prop, I mean something like charging significant money for, right?

536
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:25,900
Significant in the iOS world, I guess is like 14 cents, but you know, like 50 bucks, right?

537
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,820
A yearly subscription, 50 bucks, a hundred bucks.

538
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,900
I don't know that you can provide that full feature stuff.

539
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,340
Now there are some areas you can write apps for DJs, app for podcasters.

540
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,980
Those are people who, although again, you have Spotify and they're Sherlocking the crap

541
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,980
out of you.

542
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,980
So it's true.

543
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,980
Yeah.

544
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,980
You'll see, I've been burned before.

545
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,460
So maybe I hope I'm wrong.

546
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,380
I also wonder how much of this is limited to the M1 iPads.

547
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,580
Some of this new multitasking, multi-monitor.

548
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,220
A lot of it is.

549
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,300
Yeah.

550
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,980
They finally introduced weather kit for iOS.

551
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,660
They bought dark sky.

552
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,140
I can't even remember how long ago.

553
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,980
And they just finally introduced a weather kit API.

554
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,300
I don't know what that means for developers like carrot weather that, you know, they're

555
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,380
an independent weather app.

556
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,380
I don't know.

557
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,260
I don't know who's going to be able to bang out a weather app.

558
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,260
We'll see how that goes.

559
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,900
They also on the iPads, they announced display scaling.

560
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,300
So you don't necessarily have to run in pixel doubled mode.

561
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,940
You could scale it back and get more screen resolution on your iPad.

562
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:31,400
You combine that with what are they called stage manager and the multi-monitor stuff.

563
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,380
And then maybe you have that $300 magic keyboard with that thing and maybe a hundred dollar

564
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,340
pencil with that thing.

565
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,180
What you have is something that's damn close to a laptop, but it's iOS.

566
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,740
And for some people, I think that actually is a, I don't know.

567
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,580
I still use my 2018 iPad pro and I still like it a lot.

568
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,220
I still find it to be a really good device just for really focused communication.

569
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,580
It's such a big investment that I would only be willing to do it very rarely, you know,

570
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,820
but they're getting there slowly.

571
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,360
Maybe they move so slowly because people upgrade so slowly.

572
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,380
People like you and I, you know, we don't get new iPads that often.

573
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,740
So maybe they just figure they can go at it nice and slow.

574
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,020
Could be something like that.

575
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,380
They also jumping around a bit, talked a little bit more about continuity.

576
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,660
You're going to get FaceTime handoff.

577
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,300
That's actually a pretty good feature.

578
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,700
I think Apple automatically just now has like, if a contact supports FaceTime or something,

579
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,540
when my, anyone in my immediate family calls me now, they're always calling me as a FaceTime

580
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,020
audio call.

581
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,720
So getting FaceTime handoff is nice.

582
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,700
And then in the finally category, iPhone is a webcam available later this year, paired

583
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:44,180
with a MagSafe clip that mounted on the top of your monitor or your laptop.

584
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,540
You attach the MagSafe clip.

585
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,260
You don't even have to wake the screen of the iPhone.

586
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,180
It immediately wirelessly connects to the Mac as a full res camera.

587
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:58,440
And then they spent God knows how much time developing this crazy ass niche feature that

588
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,100
uses the wide angle lens of the iPhone to actually capture your desk, your keyboard

589
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
and your mouse.

590
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,220
So you can show people your workspace if you want without having to change cameras.

591
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,260
That might be cool for like a VR situation, virtual workspaces.

592
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Maybe, maybe.

593
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
Maybe.

594
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,260
I mean, I doubt it.

595
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
But yeah.

596
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
This is a nice little thing though.

597
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,260
You know, cause you've got good optics on that iPhone and it's got a good image signal

598
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,100
processor and it supports center stage using that wide angle.

599
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,100
So I don't know.

600
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,740
I look at that kind of stuff and I put that all in the nice to have category.

601
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,740
But it seemed like some years are like this more than others, but it seemed like this

602
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:39,600
was a year where everything was about the Apple ecosystem with the exception of matter.

603
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,740
Everything requires that you are all in as a developer, you're all in as an end user.

604
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,100
It is nothing really new to bring you into the ecosystem.

605
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,380
There wasn't like a new category or something like that.

606
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,900
It was very, very much a deepening that trench.

607
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,080
You know, and I, what I got out of this, when you look at all of the share stuff, the family

608
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:08,060
integration stuff, the handoff stuff, what I got is Apple is creating an ecosystem out

609
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:12,940
of your friends and family with the iMessage improvements, with the auto share API, they

610
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,940
are creating.

611
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,620
So now they're extending their ecosystem beyond their like before the ecosystem was watch

612
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,900
phone, Apple TV, Mac, HomePod, right?

613
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,700
Now it's all of those things, but now it's all your family and friends are interconnected

614
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,180
with all those things too.

615
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:34,140
And now they all are creating a collective dependence on Apple services and Apple messaging

616
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,140
and et cetera.

617
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,260
And making it a pain in the butt to leave the ecosystem, which is we know is their goal

618
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,380
because one of the emails revealed in the Epic trial was on the hardware side, one of

619
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:51,080
their big concerns is we need a cheap iPhone and we need messages to make sure that parents

620
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,740
don't just give their teeny bopper, you know, a cheap Android device.

621
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,980
This is the WWDC where I think that master strategy becomes kind of obvious on its face.

622
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,380
And now looking back at it, it's clear this is where they were going.

623
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,580
This is why they've always made such great, great family sharing options.

624
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,300
That was always their incentive.

625
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:14,000
But with this WWDC, it really felt like, Hey, look at the stuff we have and look how it

626
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,080
gets even better when you use these new collaboration features.

627
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,120
Like they talked about sending a link over messages to somebody and instantly kicks off

628
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,220
a collaboration session in an app, FaceTime sharing, where you can be on FaceTime and

629
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,100
you can start a collaboration session and start working on something.

630
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,620
Everybody's name who's working on the doc, good features, good stuff.

631
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:38,860
But all of it is to reinforce the ecosystem effect when you're working with multiple people.

632
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,940
I thought that was fascinating.

633
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,780
TailScale.com slash coder, this is a secret weapon of mine, it's not so secret, but I

634
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,780
love tail scale.

635
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,500
I think, Mike, you use tail scale.

636
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,380
I think everybody on the network is using tail scale now.

637
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,380
It's so great.

638
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,520
It's so handy.

639
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,640
You create a super quick VPN.

640
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,700
It is a peer to peer connection from your machine to your other machines, all on a mesh

641
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,700
network.

642
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,220
They have a backplane that handles all of the negotiations and connections.

643
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,320
It works with your single sign on vendor.

644
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,020
So that means if you have like an organization that use a single sign on with two factor,

645
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,020
you can integrate it with that.

646
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,020
It supports magic DNS.

647
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:21,700
So if you put something like a pie hole in your mesh network, then you can start resolving

648
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,980
all of your machines by name.

649
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:28,280
All of it's protected by WireGuard's noise protocol, which I think is the absolute best

650
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,440
VPN encryption out there.

651
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,460
And I think they're a really clever company.

652
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,080
I think if you go read their blog, you'll get some real insights into the long term

653
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,920
thinking that tail scale has about all of this.

654
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,820
So if you go to tail scale dot com slash coder, you can sign up for free for 20 devices.

655
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,300
And it is so quick to get started.

656
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,420
You can get it running on just about any device.

657
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,900
I bet you you could probably do it in one minute per device on my next OS systems in

658
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,020
probably 30 seconds.

659
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,700
I can get tail scale up and running.

660
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,780
Raspberry Pi's same thing on my phone.

661
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
It's in the app store.

662
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,780
You get it installed.

663
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,780
You get connected.

664
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,780
You have the authentication process.

665
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,780
It's so smooth.

666
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
It's so smooth.

667
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,200
I want to put this on blast.

668
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,460
You got to go try it.

669
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,620
It's going to change the way you do networking.

670
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,020
It's going to change the way you do VPN.

671
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
That's so obvious.

672
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,680
But I think I'm just making that connection for the first time.

673
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
That's the power of tail scale.

674
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
Go try it out.

675
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,920
Tail scale dot com slash coder.

676
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,820
So you got yourself one of the new HP dev ones.

677
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,140
I have a review unit in route.

678
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,780
You actually bought one.

679
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:35,400
I bought one and I do apparently have a review unit in route, but you got one anyways.

680
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,600
And you got it quicker that way.

681
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
So perhaps that's good.

682
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
What do you think?

683
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,740
Do you want to do a first impressions on HP's laptop built for developers that ships with

684
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,740
Pop OS?

685
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,740
Yeah.

686
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,740
So just a quick first impression.

687
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,980
It's only been a few days.

688
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,060
So overall, I like it.

689
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:58,260
It's I would say it's on par with most Linux laptops you can buy now.

690
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,900
There's some interesting choices in it.

691
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:05,860
For instance, the glossy screen is super bright, but still glossy.

692
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,080
So I found myself turning up the brightness to fight glare.

693
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,100
Out of the box, the setup experience is great.

694
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,100
It's Pop OS, right?

695
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,060
Which is like Ubuntu under the covers, basically.

696
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:21,540
So if you know how to do your apt glory, you can set up a dual chain pretty quickly.

697
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,540
The remote encryption.

698
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,140
See, it's difficult not to just be reviewing Pop OS, right?

699
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,140
Yeah.

700
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,140
Yeah.

701
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,140
So, you know, I'm just going to focus on the hardware.

702
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,680
We've talked about Pop a lot and I think it's the hardware.

703
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,900
That's kind of the difference here.

704
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
Build quality is pretty good.

705
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,220
It is plastic, which I was slightly disappointed.

706
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,780
I thought it would be metal, but it's a pretty nice, firm plastic, but it doesn't feel flimsy

707
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
at all.

708
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,640
It has actual ports, which is which is nice.

709
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,300
No USB-C charging, though.

710
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,300
Barrel.

711
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,780
It's got a barrel charger.

712
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,780
Yeah.

713
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,980
The webcam is OK.

714
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,100
You know, it's what you get on most laptops.

715
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,140
It's got a nice shield on it where you can close the webcam via hardware.

716
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,140
Speakers I would say of the Linux laptops I've used, these speakers are better.

717
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,940
Ah, OK.

718
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,940
Performance is great.

719
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:13,540
The AMD Ryzen 7 is is doing, you know, doing just fine.

720
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,320
It does come when you buy it with 16 gigs of RAM.

721
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,740
You can configure it after the fact.

722
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,580
I haven't popped it open yet to upgrade RAM.

723
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,940
That's definitely something I think I'm going to do because I work when I'm on the Linux

724
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,940
machines.

725
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,500
I usually have a Windows VM open, too.

726
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,420
But you have to do that after the fact, right?

727
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,300
Because unless I'm missing something here on their order page, I went to go order it

728
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,780
and there's no there's no tweaking of the build.

729
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,880
I found the same thing.

730
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,780
There's no tweaking of the build.

731
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,780
It's you order it.

732
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,780
They ship it.

733
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,780
Huzzah.

734
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,060
Then you upgrade it after the fact if you want or can.

735
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,060
I don't know.

736
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,060
OK.

737
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,600
And they do say you can.

738
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,820
They explicitly say that.

739
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,980
So that's going to be something I'm going to be trying out.

740
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,140
I did not buy the I have a launch keyboard.

741
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:57,100
I don't you know, I didn't buy the HP creator mouse, but I think we're getting one anyway.

742
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,740
So I like that they're offering to include a system 76 launch.

743
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,740
That's pretty neat.

744
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,820
I mean, it's a really interesting deal from a Linux ecosystem perspective, right?

745
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,820
Yeah.

746
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:13,060
I definitely hope that there are future versions of this product because I could see, you know,

747
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:18,220
some some kind of obvious upgrades, like one USB charging.

748
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,220
Right.

749
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,220
What year is it?

750
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,220
Yeah.

751
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
I wonder if maybe somebody could send it in over a booster email.

752
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,160
Is this something about the rising platform?

753
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Is that it?

754
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
Is that the limitation?

755
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,760
Because my son has a rising laptop and it also has a barrel charger.

756
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Maybe that's it.

757
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Yeah.

758
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
Performance rise.

759
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,300
It runs fine out of the box.

760
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,380
Of course, I hit a steam issue because that's what you do when you comment on Linux laptops.

761
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:43,300
And when I had a weird issue where the terminal kept suspending, but then I just blew out

762
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,900
a couple of dependencies and reinstalled them and it was fine.

763
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,900
Hasn't done it in a day.

764
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,300
So I'm not sure.

765
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,420
No biometrics that I saw.

766
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,220
I'm curious about fan noise, you know, with the rising system, how's temperature and performance

767
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,640
and and that stuff.

768
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,500
So I haven't got it to be loud yet.

769
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Okay.

770
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,740
So hopefully my plan for tonight is to install XCOM and see how we do.

771
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:08,300
You know, that is where I'd be really curious to hear your opinion, because like I mentioned,

772
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,260
my kid has a rising laptop and for the most part, I just don't even have him turn on his

773
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,900
NVIDIA GPU.

774
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:20,200
I have him just use the built in rising graphics and it looks pretty damn good.

775
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,940
So the idea that you could have pretty acceptable gaming performance on a laptop with the integrated

776
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:31,220
GPU is a serious seller for me, because if I'm going to blow, you know, eleven hundred

777
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,340
bucks on a laptop or something, a thousand bucks on a laptop, and it's going to be a

778
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:40,140
Linux laptop, I really want to play some games because there's so many great games for Linux

779
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,140
now.

780
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,940
Yeah, well, that's and that's one of the big things Linux has for Mac OS, right?

781
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,700
It's just leaps and bounds above it in gaming.

782
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,500
Real time follow up from the chat room.

783
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,860
They have a Dell with a Ryzen that has a USB charger, so it's probably not something specific

784
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,860
to the Ryzen platform.

785
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:01,100
OK, and I'm sure if we looked deeply that there must be some very similar Windows HP,

786
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
right?

787
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,420
Like SKU could be a next generation thing, too, like if they started working on this

788
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,500
a year ago or something to, you know, QA and everything like that.

789
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,780
The only thing I haven't just real quick tested yet is I want to see how much pressure it

790
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,740
can take without getting super loud.

791
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,900
Yeah, it's so far it hasn't gotten loud at all, but I'm always skeptical of that.

792
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,740
I'm curious about your your first impressions of the keyboard and trackpad quality.

793
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,540
You know, the trackpad, it's a little old fashioned.

794
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,780
First of all, it has a nubbin.

795
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:36,940
The little the little, you know, the old thing pads have like nub in the middle of the keyboard.

796
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,940
The track point.

797
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,940
Thank you.

798
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,940
The track point.

799
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,900
I could not use one in the early aughts and I still can't use them now, so I'm not the

800
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,900
best person to ask about that.

801
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,900
Trackpad's fine.

802
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,500
It's got two dedicated mouse clickers.

803
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,220
You can change that in the settings to do some more gesture stuff.

804
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,620
They do have some interesting gesture stuff enabled.

805
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,020
It's for a Windows trackpad.

806
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
It's not bad.

807
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,020
It's good.

808
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,120
You know, non Mac trackpad.

809
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
It's pretty good.

810
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,020
I would say it's probably on par with I mean, I have an older XPS.

811
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,820
It's pretty much on par with that, right?

812
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,440
That's I'd say an acceptable performance.

813
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,880
It's not stand out, but it's acceptable.

814
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,980
The keyboard is nice.

815
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,260
I actually like it.

816
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:20,260
You know, they cut like a circle, like a half circle, and the keys were the track point.

817
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,260
That's what we said.

818
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:26,820
Where the track point is, which I thought I would find very annoying, but it was fine.

819
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,820
The battery life.

820
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:32,280
Well, I don't think Pop OS tells you the truth about your battery life because it jumps wildly

821
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
all the time.

822
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,920
This is my usage.

823
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,820
It's actually been better than I thought it would be.

824
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,820
Oh, okay.

825
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,180
I'm going to take it on the road and see, you know, a more true test, right?

826
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,060
Getting out of the house, not being plugged in or, you know, what?

827
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,540
What is it really?

828
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,900
What's it like in a realistic usage, right?

829
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,340
Like streaming Spotify and working in VS code with Slack open?

830
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,900
I'd love to hear the results of that test.

831
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,820
Yeah, because this is a machine you need to take with you sometimes.

832
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:03,180
So, okay, at this stage, where you're at, would you buy something like this for a new

833
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,180
hire?

834
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,180
You got it.

835
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,180
Somebody coming on.

836
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,220
I mean, one of the things you got to give these guys is they got this thing to you fast.

837
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,980
Would you buy something like this for a new hire?

838
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,820
If it holds up and I'm doing kind of a month-long test of it, this could be the easy, like,

839
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,060
you know, mad bot or standard issue.

840
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,020
You're a new random Python or Ruby guy.

841
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,020
Here you go.

842
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,820
I mean, we're mostly buying Linux machines now anyway.

843
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:30,860
So another nice thing about this machine is right now we have like a bunch of different

844
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,860
S76 and a few Dells running around.

845
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,380
It would be nice to standardize for kind of like lots of reasons, right?

846
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,700
I could maybe get a better deal on buying RAM chips if I could order just like...

847
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,940
It would be great if I could buy it with more than 16 gigs of RAM and not have to deal with

848
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,940
that problem.

849
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,940
Yeah.

850
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:51,540
But as it stands, you know, the processes I buy the machines, I try to install the dependencies

851
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,700
that I think the person is going to need for the role on them.

852
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,820
I give them the password, blah, blah, blah.

853
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:01,460
And then I send it back out, which is, you know, very inefficient, but it saves usually

854
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,220
like half a day of I can't get my tool chain up.

855
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,060
And I guess if you were going to deploy Pop OS already, it's getting you just that much

856
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,620
further down that process.

857
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,620
Yeah.

858
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,620
It tends a lot easier.

859
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,620
Right.

860
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,820
And then I know that, like, there's someone for me to yell at if somebody's Wi-Fi card

861
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,940
dies.

862
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:23,780
So it's got two USB ports to USB-C and HDMI out and of course, a headphone port and then

863
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,220
the barrel connector.

864
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,100
Not bad on the connectivity side.

865
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,100
No, not it.

866
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:35,300
It's it's I got to say, like for a web dev laptop, I think this is a very viable choice

867
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,300
if you want Linux.

868
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:43,060
I know that's a lot of caveats, but I feel like the Linux machines are somewhat have

869
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:48,140
to be judged both against the Macs and the higher end Windows machines.

870
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,340
And but also, if you're like if you're coming to the table saying, I will only buy a pre

871
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,100
installed Linux machine, that's kind of a different category, right?

872
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,100
Right.

873
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,340
This is a tool to do a job.

874
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,340
Yeah.

875
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,340
I need a Linux development environment.

876
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,340
Yeah.

877
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,340
And the pricing is not bad.

878
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,340
All right.

879
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,580
So, you know, I've got a whole battery of tests I want to throw at it.

880
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,020
But I, of course, want to really kind of dissect it, try different distributions on there,

881
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,900
see how Wayland works on there.

882
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,500
You know, I want to throw it through all of the various paces, but I'm content to wait

883
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,940
because your first look here has has answered some of my questions.

884
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,220
Now to be clear, it looks like a glossy display, but they have notes on here that make it look

885
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,780
like they've tried to make it usable in a bright environment.

886
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,700
Did you try using this thing outside?

887
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,020
I did.

888
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:35,420
So I was able to overcome the glare by turning the brightness all the way up.

889
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,420
Whoa.

890
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,820
That, of course, hammers your battery life.

891
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,820
It gets bright, though.

892
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,820
It gets bright.

893
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,820
I think they said it was like a thousand nits or something crazy like that.

894
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:49,540
You know, as a Linux user, what I love about this laptop is the idea that with a rise in

895
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:56,020
GPU and a rise in CPU, I do nothing beyond just install my distro and I've got full

896
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,500
3D acceleration.

897
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,700
I've got full freaking open source graphics.

898
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,900
To me, that's a very compelling starting place.

899
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:09,860
And it's why I bought my ThinkPad and I went all Intel and the performance has been inadequate.

900
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,700
I have never really been that happy with my ThinkPad.

901
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,740
I still use it.

902
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:21,500
And I feel like I've learned certain optimizations that I can do that have helped with its performance.

903
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:26,500
But I feel like it suffers from having a really good GPU and I kind of just missed the latest

904
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:31,100
gen of Intel CPUs that kind of made up some of this distance.

905
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,860
And I got a generation before that.

906
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,740
And so I've never been really that thrilled.

907
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:44,220
And now with the Apple M2 generation launching, I know this sounds silly, but I'm kind of

908
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,380
disincentive to buy an Intel based machine.

909
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:53,200
And I feel like at least when I get a rise in, I'm getting something that feels modern,

910
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,840
even though I understand it's maybe not equivalent like that.

911
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:04,700
But in my mind, it feels like Intel represents old computing and AMD and Ryzen don't represent

912
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,700
that to me.

913
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,080
I know that's just a pure branding thing.

914
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,780
But when you're trying to decide what you're going to buy, I feel like that stuff kind

915
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,780
of plays a factor.

916
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,840
And then you combine the fact that you get open source graphics stack, I think it kind

917
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,840
of puts it ahead of the pack.

918
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,420
So I am looking forward to getting my review unit.

919
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:24,100
Yeah, I'm very curious as to your thoughts because I'm just never going to care to install

920
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,820
different disk rows on it.

921
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,320
So for me, it's kind of like just first impressions, right?

922
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,780
Is this a viable machine for a Python dev or an Angular dev?

923
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,940
And the answer is yes, right?

924
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,940
Obviously, yes.

925
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,940
There's I do feel that the target customer here, even though the marketing is very like

926
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:45,540
devs, devs, devs, I think it's IT manager or guy who owns dev shop buying for their

927
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,540
devs.

928
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,540
Yeah.

929
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,220
Linux enthusiast that wants a nice out of the box experience.

930
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,220
Linux enthusiasts.

931
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,220
Yep.

932
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,220
Yep.

933
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,220
System 76 is market.

934
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,540
Yeah, which is why I find this to be kind of a surprising.

935
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,820
Not yet, I think, delightful partnership.

936
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,020
Oh, you won't remember my bacon.

937
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,020
Yeah, I do.

938
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,100
I do remember your bacon.

939
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,480
Your tasty, tasty, you know, acquisition bacon.

940
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,480
My M&A bacon.

941
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,480
Yes.

942
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,540
I feel like in six months to a year, I want to sit down with Carl, have a drink and just

943
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,200
ask him like, what are your thoughts on this from like a, you know, 50,000 foot strategic

944
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,260
level the next five years?

945
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,860
Like what are your thoughts here?

946
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,860
Is this a new area of business?

947
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,860
Chris, at Stanford, you can do better than a drink.

948
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,300
Well, there you go.

949
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,580
Thanks for giving us that first impressions.

950
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,940
What do you say we do a couple of boosts and then we get out of here?

951
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,940
Sure.

952
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,940
Boost it out.

953
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,420
Four score and seven boosts to go.

954
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,420
All right.

955
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:42,100
Well, the golden dragon boosted in and he loves giving us the row of ducks.

956
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,100
That's four twos.

957
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,100
You put it in a calculator.

958
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,100
Yeah, I know.

959
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,580
So the golden dragon boosted in.

960
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,580
I'm a duck.

961
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,580
D-U-K duck.

962
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,380
Loaded with talent.

963
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:55,260
He says, not technically sure if this is cloud, but at my job, we log into a remote server

964
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,500
that runs Microsoft Dynamics AX and it's terrible.

965
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,800
I wish that we would go FOSS and get over with it.

966
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,200
The version we use hasn't been supported for a decade, literally, and has connection issues

967
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,580
all the time amongst other remote issues.

968
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,360
We were talking about remote desktops and working environments.

969
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,720
We did get some feedback on that that I think we'll read soon.

970
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:25,300
I actually used to support a Microsoft remote desktop session for Dynamics AX and I can

971
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:30,780
attest that it is an absolute horrible pig.

972
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,860
And when you combine that with limitations of remote sessions and then running multiple

973
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:41,740
copies on one box and the fact that it's not supported, that's remote sessions done the

974
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,500
worst way possible.

975
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,980
So I feel you golden dragon.

976
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:50,020
Vine Hummingbird boosted in with a thousand sats four days ago.

977
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,460
B-O-O-S-T.

978
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,700
You folks beat on Windows all the time.

979
00:46:54,700 --> 00:47:02,740
Meanwhile, the entire financial world runs on it and it employs legions of devs.

980
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:07,180
I think Hummingbird might work for Microsoft.

981
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,860
He's right though, or they are right.

982
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:14,060
One of us once said Windows 11, or I'm sorry, Windows 10 was the best Linux desktop distro.

983
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,860
You did say that, didn't you?

984
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,180
Then I did the WSL and the WSL 2 challenge and I had the Penguin guys when I did the

985
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:25,540
interview show and I did a lot of Windows love, mostly sub Linux love, but come on.

986
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,660
It's because it's been a while.

987
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,660
You know what?

988
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:32,260
We do on average go hard on Windows because we don't like it as a desktop experience,

989
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:38,180
but there has been several times where we've got to come on the show and been like, no,

990
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,180
Microsoft nailed this.

991
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,900
They've done a good job with this.

992
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:47,060
It's just far and few, mostly because I think you're bitter over the whole Metro stuff and

993
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,060
Windows stuff.

994
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:51,060
I shouldn't have said anything.

995
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,340
All right, moving on.

996
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,340
Never forget.

997
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,340
Never forget.

998
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,820
Nix are boosted in five days ago with a row of ducks.

999
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,820
Thank you very much.

1000
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,820
And here's something for your trouble.

1001
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:06,980
He says just giving love for the best podcast for developers out there.

1002
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,980
What do you think of that?

1003
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,980
He must be drunk.

1004
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,980
Fuck on that ATP.

1005
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:14,140
Hey, I know you're right.

1006
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,140
You're right.

1007
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,620
I accept you as you are.

1008
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:21,300
Nixer actually came back in with a double boost boost that I caught the part about the

1009
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,260
cloud work and I wanted to send this in.

1010
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,580
I work for an MSP remotely.

1011
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,900
They actually have a box set up in the office in Texas that I use for support to do remote

1012
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,860
into that box from New York.

1013
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,500
Any tools that we have uses the web and I just have my local browser on my machine.

1014
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,620
Anything else is done on that box in Texas.

1015
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,100
They've mailed me a phone.

1016
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,700
So all my calls come from that office to our customers like I just work out of the office

1017
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,780
in Texas.

1018
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,700
I suppose either way, it works OK, though, until someone takes out your power cord in

1019
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,700
Texas backs.

1020
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,700
Yes.

1021
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,780
So because, you know, as a worker, that's just a that's just a free license to take

1022
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,780
the day off.

1023
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,780
No, no guilt.

1024
00:48:58,780 --> 00:48:59,780
No shame.

1025
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,780
You know, as a boss, it sucks.

1026
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,780
As an owner.

1027
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,780
It's horrible.

1028
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,780
Yeah.

1029
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,780
If it works, I mean, whatever.

1030
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,340
I know you don't like it.

1031
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,420
I know you don't like it.

1032
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,780
You're always and you're always looking at it as a boss.

1033
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,100
We also got some thank you boosts, a double thank you boost from Cospe Land and from Elty

1034
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,100
Guy O5.

1035
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,100
Thank you, everybody.

1036
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,740
If you'd like to send us a boost, you can get a new podcast app over at new podcast

1037
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:24,740
apps dot com and you load up with some stats or if you don't want to switch apps.

1038
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:31,200
You can grab Breeze at B R E E Z dot technology for iOS or Android and then you can boost

1039
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,840
without switching apps.

1040
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,660
Also thank you to our members.

1041
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,020
You get something very special.

1042
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,780
That is a Coderly once a quarter.

1043
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,700
You also get the members feed that has no ads.

1044
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:47,540
I am also working on a live version, which I got to figure out not only some of the tech

1045
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,520
details but like what's going to be in that live feed version.

1046
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,740
But I am formulating that for the members.

1047
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:58,940
I know probably just a lot of cussing, you know, a lot of cussing, lots of cussing.

1048
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,100
Drew cuts it out of the show, but they start the show being like, hey, did you see this

1049
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,100
new Metro UI?

1050
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,100
Oh, my God.

1051
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,100
Mike was logged in.

1052
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,100
Yeah.

1053
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,100
Yeah.

1054
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,100
It's awful.

1055
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,740
It's also just a great way to support the show.

1056
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,740
Keep us independent.

1057
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,740
Working with the sponsors.

1058
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,740
We should be.

1059
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,740
You know, all that kind of stuff.

1060
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,820
Coder QA dot co.

1061
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,380
Thanks to our members over there.

1062
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,100
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send folks this week here on the Coder program?

1063
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,100
Sure.

1064
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,100
You know what?

1065
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:28,620
Go to Alice dot dev and maybe the end of the week I'll have something on the one on Dominic

1066
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,620
M dot com.

1067
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,620
The dev one.

1068
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,620
I mean.

1069
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,620
Oh, further thoughts on the laptop, perhaps.

1070
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,620
Very, very nice.

1071
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,620
I wonder if my next episode I'll have my review unit.

1072
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,620
Wouldn't that be cool?

1073
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,260
I think you probably will.

1074
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,260
It seems like you should.

1075
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,580
I might tweet it out when I get it.

1076
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,640
At Chris Alias.

1077
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,060
The podcast is at Coder Radio Show and the network is at Jupiter Signal.

1078
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,120
There's a whole network of shows.

1079
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,120
You might like Linux action news.

1080
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,540
Perhaps you'd like to try self-hosted or Linux Upload.

1081
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,540
They're all over there.

1082
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:58,620
And of course, the new show Office Hours, where we talk about the back end projects

1083
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,180

1084
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,180
Yep.

It's Office Hours dot here.
