00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,800
This is KOTORadio, episode 395 for January 4th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,040
Hello friends and welcome into KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,980
a pragmatic look at the world of software development and of course technology.

4
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,760
My name is Chris and this episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,880
A cloud guru now includes cloud playgrounds, Azure AWS, Google cloud sound boxes, but it's

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,840
on ACG's credit card, not yours.

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,680
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru.com.

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,800
Joining us at his weather station in Florida, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Hello, Mike.

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,280
What's up, Mr. Fisher?

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,840
Happy 2021 to you, sir.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,440
It's been roughly the same.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
Yeah.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,440
Yeah.

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,440
Yeah.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
As one would expect, really.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
It's like we make a big deal about it.

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,040
Like we actually make a really big deal about it this year, but it's all kind of a construct,

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,040
you know?

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,520
I mean, not to be a downer, but like time is sort of a construct in which we have all

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,120
just begun to participate and there's like not really a new year's.

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,840
There's not, it's not like a real thing.

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,020
It's something we made up.

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,600
So it's kind of like the green lantern, but that moment when he realizes he no longer

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,480
believes in himself, like 5,000 feet in the air and it's like, oh shit, I can't fly anymore.

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Yeah.

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm not, I'm not big on waiting to do resolutions until the new year.

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,560
If there's something I want to do, I just, I just try to kind of do it.

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Yeah.

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,360
I just kind of do whatever the hell I want.

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,240
That's why for Christmas I got myself a deep fryer.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
You're killing me.

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,400
Now don't come at me with your deep fry and hate because you know, you can fry stuff healthy

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
I suppose.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,640
Oh, there's no hate.

36
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,480
So I got this, I got an old fryer from Angela's house, my, my ex-wife's house, and I hadn't,

37
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,640
I hadn't touched it in about seven years and it was in rough shape, Mike.

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,920
It was in real rough shape.

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,760
It was left in a used state.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,920
It was not put away in a clean state.

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,200
And uh, I decided to just go all craftsman on it.

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,600
You ever have one of these things where you're like, you know what, I'm going to do a really

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
damn good job at something.

44
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
No.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,360
I'm going to go all in.

46
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,200
I don't do it often, but I'm like, you know, this is something where like I could just

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,760
go all like immaculate on this thing.

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,280
So I spent like two and a half hours, three hours perfectly cleaning this deep fryer.

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,000
And it looked, it looked brand fricking new.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,520
I mean the metal on like the basket for the fryer shined, the outside was perfect, immaculate.

51
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,360
I mean, I really was proud.

52
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,520
And I, I fried up some onion strings for Christmas dinner for the, uh, green bean casserole and

53
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
it was amazing.

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,320
And I thought, wow, this is so great.

55
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,800
I'm going to fry more often.

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,280
I went out to get the deep fryer the next day and it was broken.

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,800
It had broke that night that some of the plastic latching was just old and brittle and just

58
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,280
started disintegrated inside.

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,280
And I was left devastated because I decided to go all craftsman on this deep fryer.

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,100
And I got like this emotional connection with this deep fryer and I reconnected with how

61
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,480
much I love to fry food and then it broke on me.

62
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,880
And so I just, I couldn't take it.

63
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,000
And I thought about it and I went on, I'm not even kidding about any of this, I went

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,640
on a research bender for a solid two hours on deep fryers.

65
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,880
I looked at commercial deep fryers.

66
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,960
I actually went to a kitchen supply store here in the Pacific Northwest and surveyed

67
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,480
the commercial grade deep fryers.

68
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,600
I really went deep now that I think about this.

69
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,520
This is kind of a tragedy.

70
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,280
This is, I didn't handle it well.

71
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,800
This is like, how could something like this happen to you?

72
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,880
So I don't know, but I ended up just getting a Cuisinart pro consumer style.

73
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
I really like it.

74
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,960
I didn't go all in, but you know, I looked at the various price ranges and I got a deep

75
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,760
fryer and you know, I got to say two days into using it, I don't think I want it anymore.

76
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,920
It makes the whole place really stink like oil.

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,400
It's no good.

78
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,360
The whole studio smells like fried food right now and I just don't know about it.

79
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,240
So you know, it's been a weird New Year's.

80
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:21,720
As the chat room has just pointed out, I recently acquired a MacBook Air M1 again and watched

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,760
50 Shades of Grey.

82
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,800
So I don't know which one of those you'd like to deal with first.

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,400
Well we're going to get to the M1.

84
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,040
That is for sure.

85
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,720
I got a couple of quick emails.

86
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,320
Of course there's a really important one or two that came in about robes this week, but

87
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,440
I'll just focus on a couple of them.

88
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,360
Brian and Zoe wrote in, so Chris and Mike, I'm writing in regards to the robe bros.

89
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,680
My daughter and I listen to the show every week and we get a kick out of it while we

90
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,920
learn more and more.

91
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,200
My daughter was wondering if the robes will come in a kid's size.

92
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,320
So Zoe, I got to say, I'm looking into this right now, but I'm having a challenge even

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,680
getting adult size robes, but that is something I'm taking under advisement for future swag

94
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
development.

95
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,960
Is this robe dream still a thing?

96
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,360
Dude, our top people are working on it right now.

97
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Oh my God.

98
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
They really are.

99
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,880
And we get emails every week about people that are robe bros.

100
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
I know we do.

101
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,080
I see them and I'm just like, do you know how much a custom robe is going to cost per

102
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
unit?

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,320
I said our top people are working on it.

104
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,680
We're seeing if we can't get something made cheap in China.

105
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,680
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Is that, wait, wait.

107
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,880
Is that like top men from Shenzhen?

108
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
Yeah.

109
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
Yeah.

110
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,200
People familiar with the matter are investigating options right now.

111
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,360
Well I know we just got Steve Bannon to fly over there, so we should be in good shape.

112
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,280
I've got somebody better than Bannon, but so Brian's daughter Zoe is eight years old

113
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,400
and would love a Kota Radio robe.

114
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,000
So I think what we're seeing here is clearly this robe idea appeals to people in a wide,

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,300
wide demo.

116
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,560
It's not just people that are in their adult work years.

117
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,520
I can't believe you, man.

118
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,280
It's real.

119
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,440
They really truly wrote in.

120
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:05,240
Anyways, they say thanks for the, well basically they really want to become part of the robe

121
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,280
bros because robe bros also includes ladies.

122
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,760
So they'll be waiting in the wings and they say thanks for the show.

123
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,240
They just started getting into rust about a month ago.

124
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,680
Brian was a C++ and C sharp guy for most of his development career, but after using rust,

125
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,400
I got into one of those rust positions at a tech company in the Seattle area.

126
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,640
Oh, that's cool, Brian.

127
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,560
What a tech company in the Seattle area, you say.

128
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,640
He says very respectively, Brian and Zoe.

129
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,520
I'll let you know, Brian, about those robes.

130
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,880
So wait, would young Zoe, I guess Zoe is baby Zoe, be a robe Padawan?

131
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,320
Because we're getting dangerously close to establishing a Kota Radio Jedi order here.

132
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,560
It probably is Zoe, huh?

133
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,580
We should know for the record, so you guys got to let us know.

134
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,580
We should know.

135
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,800
You have to write back in because we got to know her real name.

136
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,440
Archie, and see this one really got to me.

137
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,760
Archie wrote in and says, I can has robe.

138
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,040
Oh my God, really?

139
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,200
Seriously, I need a superior quality robe.

140
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,920
My current robe isn't even an MVP.

141
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,840
Please robe, Archie, which really, you know, that hit me hard.

142
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,940
I get it.

143
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,940
You're really into this.

144
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,940
All right.

145
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,940
Okay.

146
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,940
Moving on.

147
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,940
Actually, some real feedback.

148
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,800
You touched on time tracking last week, and we got a couple of really, really interesting

149
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,280
emails about that.

150
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,680
David wrote in, he said for time tracking, he uses Harvest.

151
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,760
It's been great for us, it comes with apps on the PC, Mac, phone, integrations with Trello,

152
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,200
and there's no official app for Linux, but the API is decent, and there is a project

153
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,560
out there that he uses, and yes, it is written in Rust.

154
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Yep.

155
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,600
I used to use Harvest until I went to QuickBooks at the insistence of my very grumpy, very

156
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,800
related to me accountant.

157
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,220
Yeah, that's always been what drove me to QuickBooks too, is ultimately the accountants.

158
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,880
I have some real time robe feedback if you'd like it.

159
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
Yes, always.

160
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,920
A very attractive attorney in the Tampa area would also like a robe.

161
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
There you go.

162
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,600
I think attractive attorneys should have robes.

163
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I really do.

164
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,160
I think attractive attorneys should have robes, and this is another lady robe, so...

165
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,880
Oh, okay.

166
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,640
I actually have gotten a fair amount of interest from ladies.

167
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,040
RobeRose absolutely includes the ladies.

168
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,000
Chris, we all know you get a fair amount of interest from the ladies.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
All right.

170
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,880
So next email on time tracking comes in from Carl, and this one is so geeky.

171
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,120
Talking about time tracking tools, he says, fellas, I wonder, have you heard about the

172
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,520
plain text accounting community?

173
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,700
A few enthusiasts, looking back to the early 80s style of computerized ledgers, built tools

174
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,420
focused around plain text, console entered, and queried ledgers.

175
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,400
The community gained some traction with the introduction of Ledger CLI, but has since

176
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,800
diversified into several other tools.

177
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,960
Personally, I use BeanCount because it's a very sleek and well-designed GUI wrapper

178
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,560
that you can self-host, provides a Python module for scripting, and allows you to define

179
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,200
your own currency, including time.

180
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,760
I went and looked at some of this plaintextaccounting.org stuff, and it felt right.

181
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,680
You know when you see something and you look at it and you go, there's something to that.

182
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,280
I don't think I'm going to do it, but when I looked at that, there was a bit of me that

183
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,080
immediately felt, oh man, I wish I could do my books like this, because it just, it sounds

184
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,720
silly at first, but it just looks right.

185
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,240
It reminds me of how my grandpa used to do his accounting on Lotus and stuff on a machine

186
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
that was...

187
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Ah, Lotus, that's a blast from the past.

188
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Yeah.

189
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Yeah.

190
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
It was quite old.

191
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,960
But have you ever heard of this plaintext accounting business?

192
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,400
Kind of.

193
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:38,620
So longtime listeners will know that my old man is a 77-year-old accountant, CPA actually.

194
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,400
He thinks that every version of Excel that is released is a personal attack.

195
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Right.

196
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Yes.

197
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
He did it.

198
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
He did it.

199
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,080
It's like, it's like Satya's sitting there, hey old man, fuck you.

200
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,280
He taught me basic bookkeeping when I was eight.

201
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,160
I don't know if, I mean, older, I don't think they teach this in school anymore, but Chris,

202
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,760
I think you all know what I'm talking about.

203
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,920
Remember those green ledger books?

204
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Oh yes.

205
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Oh yeah, absolutely.

206
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,320
Well, when I was in school, that's how you'd learn book, you had a class called bookkeeping

207
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,520
and I was not doing well and he was an accountant and he was like, no, you're going to, fuck

208
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,520
you.

209
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Hey, I'm an accountant.

210
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
How can you not know this?

211
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,560
By the way, since we changed to the night thing, the show was no longer clean.

212
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Sorry.

213
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,040
I did have a beep somewhere around here.

214
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Somewhere.

215
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
There it is.

216
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,120
He deleted the beep button in exchange for the robe glory button.

217
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,440
He hasn't been able to press it yet, but I need something noble that just rolls out and

218
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
sort of unfolds.

219
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,560
Look, you know what it needs to be, right?

220
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,800
Just for irony's sake, the song they played during order 66, just like the sad, like we're

221
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
all going to die.

222
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,920
No, but like, yes, he, there's nothing more plain text than pencil and green graph paper.

223
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
That's my point.

224
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
But no, I did look at this.

225
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,560
I have to be honest with you.

226
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,240
I hate QuickBooks online because it's hard as hell to use.

227
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,600
I'm sort of thinking maybe I look at this just for like basic, like, you know, like

228
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
when I'm on a trip, right?

229
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Gotta be nice.

230
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,560
You know, when the apocalypse is over, just to like key in some basic info.

231
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,520
Oh, that's actually a really good idea.

232
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
You're right.

233
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,360
You can use it temporarily to keep track of what's going on.

234
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,520
Well, this is maybe to like self-employed sales guy inside baseball here, but you know,

235
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,120
you might know this, uh, the rules on meals and entertainment have changed significantly,

236
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
right?

237
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,040
And what you can expense, but you can't, I don't know if I do know.

238
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,880
I mean, cause I've been out of the game for a little while.

239
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Then there's been no events.

240
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Oh yeah.

241
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,880
In 2019 they changed and it goes, uh, well, I'm not, I'm not an accountant.

242
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,560
I'm not a CPA, so don't take my advice, but, or a lawyer or whatever, but it's, uh, it

243
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,640
used to be, if you had a client with you, you were basically like fallen, right?

244
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Expense everything.

245
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,040
Now, I think it's only the client's meal or something.

246
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,080
And again, ask your accountant, but you need to track like detailed.

247
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,440
It's not just how much did you spend?

248
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:02,480
It's how much of it was you, which is, I have to tell you, I miss ordering $15 martinis.

249
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,120
Well, I, you know, and it's not even necessarily a tax scam, like legitimately some of the

250
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,680
best, did I say scam?

251
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,960
No, I'm, I'm saying like those meals where you're expensing that stuff, real business

252
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
happens there.

253
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,280
Like actual, like maybe not actual, the business itself, but the, the, the, the starting of

254
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,680
a process of business, like it's just, Oh, I could go on and on forever about that.

255
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,160
But the, yeah, I did not know that I will look into it though.

256
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
You never know.

257
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
It could really bite me in the butt.

258
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Yeah.

259
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
It's really weird.

260
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
And I'll just totally straight.

261
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,720
I completely understand what changed, but I know it's there, like unless you are in fact

262
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,320
a pharmaceutical sales rep, they're getting real strict, especially if you're the owner

263
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
of the company.

264
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,980
And like, was that really a business meeting or, you know,

265
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:51,000
It's funny you say that, that industry specifically, because, um, when I was doing it consulting,

266
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,280
I had a handful of doctor's offices and I would try to time the day that I would visit

267
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,560
because I would try to visit them once a week.

268
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,080
I would try to time that for the day that the pharmaceutical rep was in the office giving

269
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,040
the free lunch to the entire staff, because that was a weekly occurrence at these offices

270
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,520
that you can weirdly still do.

271
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
God, it was great.

272
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
It was great.

273
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
I don't think so.

274
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Fuck you guys.

275
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
Work from home, buy your own meals.

276
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
That's it.

277
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Yeah.

278
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,600
Or, um, like there was a, I've seen what some companies are doing now is subscribing their

279
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,280
employees to these like boxes of the month that include like the snacks or that includes,

280
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
yeah.

281
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,240
So you know that, you know, now that now they don't have like the snack area with the free

282
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,480
unlimited snacks, but they're sending you a box of stuff for you.

283
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,760
I have to say since I've gone remote, I did not realize how much I was spending on beer

284
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
and coffee.

285
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Oh man.

286
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
For me, it's definitely the caffeine.

287
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Yeah, definitely.

288
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Yeah.

289
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,240
I mean, I mean for, cause we had like a, like every Friday we had beer and we had like a

290
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,160
whole coffee like, Oh sure.

291
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Yeah.

292
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,760
It was, and I couldn't buy regular coffee.

293
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:58,040
No, I had to buy like, you know, the Sultan's third wife's cousins, whatever.

294
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Yeah.

295
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Can't have Folgers in there.

296
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Oh, fuck Folgers.

297
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
I would still buy Folgers.

298
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,040
It goes against the brand.

299
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,280
Listen, we're the mad botter.

300
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,040
We have tea that may or may not be made from shrooms.

301
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Okay.

302
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Yeah.

303
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,060
So I actually think you're onto it right there though.

304
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,920
Using this thing as a ledger while you're out and about or maybe working for a particular

305
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
project.

306
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Oh yeah.

307
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Actually that's even better.

308
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Yeah.

309
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
I didn't even think of that.

310
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,680
All right, what is your PNL on an individual product, a project rather?

311
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,560
Which reminds me, can I, can I take a diversion here?

312
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Sure.

313
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Sure.

314
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
So Ruby three came out.

315
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Oh, look at them.

316
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
I'm so sad.

317
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,140
What in particular makes you sad about it?

318
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,960
My inability to cleanly upgrade my projects.

319
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,040
Oh yes.

320
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Came out on Christmas too, by the way, which is a cute, right?

321
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Is that their thing?

322
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Do they do that normally?

323
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
A Christmas release?

324
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,840
I say what I deserve for Christmas, I think a bunch of work that no one wants to pay for

325
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,520
and is an incredible pain in the ass.

326
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Well, it's all about performance this release.

327
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
You know?

328
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Okay.

329
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Now you sound like my ex-wife.

330
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,960
Oh, too much, too much, too much.

331
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
That's what they've, that's what they've touted.

332
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Yeah.

333
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Just a ton.

334
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,080
It's all about like, that's why that I think that's what they're trying to say.

335
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,920
The reason to upgrade is because there's this ginormous leap in performance.

336
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,000
Oh kidding aside.

337
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,040
It's actually a lot faster and if you were, I don't know, 15 and just doing toy projects,

338
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
that would be great.

339
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Yeah.

340
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,240
If you had a large code basis that have been around for seven years, it's not so great.

341
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,480
Well especially if the client is not so interested in paying the time required to actually fix

342
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
it.

343
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,560
Well, it's almost like it's hard to, and I will say I have no specific client who doesn't

344
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,160
want to pay for it right now, but it's like I'm writing the pitch for why they should

345
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
pay for it.

346
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm like, I don't know.

347
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
Should you pay for it?

348
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,840
Like RAM is super cheap and you're not having performance issues and this is going to cost

349
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,600
you like $20,000.

350
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,840
So maybe just don't pay for it.

351
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Right.

352
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Although I would love to take, you know what I mean?

353
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,460
I'm like, I would love for you to pay.

354
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,160
It's like, it's a very conflict of interest situation.

355
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Yeah.

356
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,720
I could see it if it's security driven.

357
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,960
Well, so this is where it gets bad because at some point when some of the gems like Devise,

358
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Devise is a big one, right?

359
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,040
For those who don't do Rails, Devise is kind of the user authentication, user identity

360
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,800
management gem that's often used in Rails.

361
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,760
You know, at some point that's going to Ruby 3.

362
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Yeah.

363
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
Right.

364
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,280
And it's going to be hard to maintain like Ruby 2, I don't remember the specific version,

365
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,480
but let's call it like 2.5, 2.6, maybe 2.7.

366
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,960
So then you're like, you're in this situation of, okay, now it's a security issue.

367
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,640
So does that 20K make sense?

368
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,960
I think we got feedback about this last week too, about when to upgrade and when to not.

369
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Well, and like Noble Pain is pointing out in the chat room, it's going to be an easier

370
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,900
upgrade than when 5.0 or 4.0 rolls out.

371
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,080
It's never easy, Wes.

372
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,760
It's never easy.

373
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,800
Ruby is, that's the title.

374
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Ruby is never easy.

375
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,680
Although probably not appropriate for the rest of the episode.

376
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,680
You know what?

377
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,720
I think we should just have stopped at dial-up myself, but-

378
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,280
That'd have been great.

379
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,840
That'd have been great.

380
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,440
I'm actually always astonished what I got away with using dial-up.

381
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,840
It just seems impossible now.

382
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,760
I mean, I'm astonished at what you get away with in general.

383
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,040
One question that Rich has for the audience, he says, I'm intrigued by all the talk about

384
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,160
programmable keyboards, but they seem way too expensive to try out.

385
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,400
Are there any Linux compatible ones in the $20 to $50 range that I could try out without

386
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
breaking the bank?

387
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
No.

388
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,440
I don't know of any, but I thought maybe somebody out there in the audience does.

389
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,560
So I did some Googling that I could find.

390
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,840
Now there's some guys saying, I have an Arduino board and I built a keyboard.

391
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,680
But if you factor in the materials and the time, no, not for-

392
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,840
Yeah, it may just come down to cost of materials to build something like that.

393
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
They're high quality.

394
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,600
They have to take a lot of long-term use and never really probably didn't care.

395
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,560
Well just good switches aren't that cheap either, right?

396
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
True.

397
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Yeah.

398
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
Quality switches matter.

399
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,720
So feedback's a big part of our show.

400
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
It keeps us connected with our audience.

401
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,920
So we wanted to ask you guys, what type of work are you doing?

402
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,240
Send us in a brief rundown of the stack you're working in.

403
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,880
Why not include the machine, some brief specs in OS, that'd be interesting too.

404
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,640
So we can kind of get an idea.

405
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,720
We like to kind of just kind of have these conversations from time to time.

406
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,240
So if you're doing development day-to-day, tell us a bit about what you're doing or maybe

407
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,480
you're running a business or maybe you're going to school.

408
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,920
I just kind of like to get an idea.

409
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,840
And even if you haven't started working on a project yet, you may have something in mind.

410
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,840
I'd like to get an idea of what that is.

411
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,800
Try to keep it as brief as you can, just so we can get several of them on air.

412
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,360
And then, you know, share with us as much or as little as you would like.

413
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,080
We kind of keep it first names only, if you've probably noticed, fairly vague.

414
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,820
We may say the country you've written in from if you add that to your signature.

415
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,480
But head over to coder.show.com and tell me about your current work and your stack and

416
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,280
a little bit about your specs.

417
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:04,200
That's coder.show.com or email us coder at jupiterbroadcasting.com directly.

418
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,320
It's just kind of a great way for us to keep the feedback fresh and get an idea of what

419
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
everybody out there is doing.

420
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,480
You got any special requests for those emails?

421
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,540
Anything that you want them to include?

422
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,120
Maybe like a secret message?

423
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Not today.

424
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
No.

425
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
No, not today.

426
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:26,000
Although Ed, although Ed, if you're, you know, just Ed and Egon, I want to make sure you

427
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
guys are okay.

428
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah.

429
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah.

430
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'd like to hear from Egon.

431
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah.

432
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Egon, if you're out there in particular.

433
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I know.

434
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I know.

435
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I know.

436
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I know.

437
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He's a big fan.

438
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's what they tell me, him and Ed.

439
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,560
They're big fans.

440
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,060
linode.com slash coder.

441
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,200
Receive a $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

442
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Yep.

443
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Yep.

444
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
I said a $100.

445
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Yeah.

446
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,320
Linode is the largest independent cloud and now you can get a $100 credit to try out some

447
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,480
of their infrastructure or some of their object storage or some of their node balancing.

448
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,520
We use Linode to host all of our infrastructure here at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

449
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:10,480
When we decided to build JB 3.0 going independent again, it was kind of obvious to go on Linode.

450
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,580
Not only do they have 11 data centers around the world, so I can position stuff regionally

451
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,680
for the audience, which is great, but they have native SSD storage on their machines.

452
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,740
They're very fast, 40 gigabit connections into those machines, and then they have a

453
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,480
really nice dashboard, and they've done something really clever.

454
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,640
You gotta try this.

455
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,520
So go to linode.com slash coder to see what I'm talking about, but they really walk that

456
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:41,680
line between super easy to use and just one or two clicks away from, oh, you really know

457
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,200
what you're doing, here's the exact command line now to mount this new object storage

458
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,380
or block storage right onto your Linux box and format it as extended for.

459
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,500
And then you just click, click, boom, boom, you can do all that, or here's the instructions,

460
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
do the rest yourself.

461
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,300
Like they just really walk that line super well, but on top of all of that, they have

462
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,840
a killer API, and you can use that API directly with your code or take advantage of their

463
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,160
command line application.

464
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,620
This is something I'll do when I'm working on a project, is I'll put the Linode command

465
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,840
line application in my awake terminal, my drop-down terminal on Plasma.

466
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,360
So I hit F12 or tilde depending on my machine, and I've got my Linode access right there.

467
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,960
So I can upload and flip stuff public and generate the URL and copy it to my clipboard

468
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,520
and just like instantaneous, so I can be in my working directory in my awake terminal

469
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,640
and I'll generate a file and then I'll just hit, I'll hit that, I'll hit that Linode CLI

470
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,360
app, I'll throw that file up on object storage, I'll flip it to public, I'll generate the

471
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,960
URL and boom, I've shared it with somebody in just seconds.

472
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,200
And it's up on their super fast object storage.

473
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,400
And Linode is independently owned and they're founded on a love for Linux.

474
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,180
I really liked that about them, but I get how they got there.

475
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,080
They started before AWS because they saw where this stuff was going deep inside the Linux

476
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
stack.

477
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,800
And then they built a company around that, which later turned out to be cloud computing.

478
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,440
And now Linode is the largest independent cloud for developers and they're dedicated

479
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,480
to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

480
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,080
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

481
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,800
So go to linode.com slash coder and get a $100 60 day credit towards your new account

482
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,660
and you support the show by supporting their sponsors like going to linode.com slash coder.

483
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,040
You make it possible for independent media to give their shows away for free.

484
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,080
So thanks to Linode for their support and thanks for supporting our sponsors, linode.com

485
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
slash coder.

486
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
Okay.

487
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:41,000
So you got an M1 again, you had an M1, you sent it back, you thought about it and you

488
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
got one again.

489
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,720
And this is how I figured it out too, cause you didn't tell me like, you know, usually

490
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,120
you'll tell me, but this time, nope, mom's the mic.

491
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,880
I just see this tweet, you're like, hmm, interesting, looks like JetBrains is already on the M1

492
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
train.

493
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,280
Hmm, that's good for me.

494
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,680
Which was my first indication that you had gotten yourself a MacBook Air again.

495
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,720
So all right, you know, the audience wants to know what's going on here and so do I.

496
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,100
So sometimes we in life make mistakes.

497
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,840
We do regrettable things and then we learn from them.

498
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,480
I had the thinnest of client requests that triggered me to rebuy an M1.

499
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Love it.

500
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,200
But I needed the fig leaf of a justification because I had learned that the issues I was

501
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,680
having could be mitigated by a release that came out like two days after I got my, cause

502
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,480
remember I got one of the early ones.

503
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:42,800
I want to apologize to the luscious, the deeply sexually attractive Fred Federighi.

504
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,520
And for those of you who did not see the Apple announcement where he had his shirt basically

505
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,040
half open with wind blowing through his hair, it'll change your life in maybe ways you don't

506
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,720
want it to.

507
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,220
This thing is absolutely incredible.

508
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,800
No fan, no noise.

509
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,800
It makes the iMac Pro that I have look like dog shit for the kind of work that I do.

510
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,800
The only hassle I have, and I tweeted about this as well, is that you have to be careful

511
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,560
when you open terminal that you have to duplicate terminal and create a version that always

512
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:21,840
runs in Rosetta, which is a compatibility layer for AMD 64, i.e. Intel, right?

513
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,240
Or else you get crazy packages that don't work with each other.

514
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:31,240
So essentially in Mac OS, it's possible to get info about an application and you can

515
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,600
check a box that says always run this application under Rosetta.

516
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Right.

517
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,280
And if you do that for the terminal, then any application that the terminal executes

518
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,600
is done with X86 Rosetta compatibility.

519
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,820
Have you noticed like any kind of performance penalty for that?

520
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,600
I mean, nothing significant enough for me to care about.

521
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,680
Nothing that's really like noticeable, in other words.

522
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
No, not compare.

523
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,280
And I had a I had my lemur and I had my other MacBook right next to it, which is an Intel

524
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,840
MacBook and it's like the M1 is faster.

525
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Also no fan.

526
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,840
Yeah.

527
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Yeah, that's really nice.

528
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,160
And the battery is just like out of control.

529
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,560
So yeah.

530
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,640
I will say like it, OK, my one pet peeve, although people have sent me weird hacks on

531
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,240
Twitter of how to fix this, like what I thought I could do was like set one color theming

532
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,040
for Rosetta terminal and for ARM terminal, right?

533
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
And one terminal.

534
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Should that be clever?

535
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
You can't seem to do that without it affecting both.

536
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,400
And I don't know why.

537
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,440
Have you thought about maybe using terminal for like either X86 or ARM and then using

538
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
something like that?

539
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
That's what people have been saying.

540
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,920
Use I term or alacrity.

541
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
Right.

542
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,640
Just like since I'm realistically for the foreseeable future going to be working in

543
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,720
Rosetta mode on this, just like basically make alacrity or I term or whatever the ARM

544
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,360
terminal and make terminal or vice versa.

545
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,360
It doesn't really matter what you do.

546
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
Right.

547
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,960
But I kind of like terminal app.

548
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Have you messed around?

549
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Can you do Docker yet?

550
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,280
Can is that stuff functional?

551
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,760
The Docker is still pretty busted.

552
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,640
OK, performance wise, it's not great, but that's one of those things that I got to tell

553
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,920
you if the Docker team isn't scrambling to fix that.

554
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,720
I don't know what the hell they're doing.

555
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,400
This is a computer I could take when the apocalypse is over on trips and literally no longer have

556
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,200
to like politely say, oh, I'm sorry, sir, can I just like creepily crawl under your

557
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,320
chair to get the power outlet?

558
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,320
Right.

559
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
I, I love it.

560
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,520
I don't know what to say.

561
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,200
It's it's a little like I have pet peeves, but my biggest one being Docker, but that's

562
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,080
just going to fix itself.

563
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Right.

564
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
Matter of time on that stuff.

565
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,960
And the other thing for me is that, you know, I live in PyCharm, Ruby mine and VS code.

566
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,720
Now, VS code does not have an M1 version yet, which ironically is kind of forced me back

567
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,880
into PyCharm because JetBrains, to their credit, has made M1 versions of all their tools.

568
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
Hmm.

569
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,040
Do you notice a difference?

570
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,520
They are faster than the root, like, like they're it's pretty noticeable.

571
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
Cool.

572
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,240
But when they try to run terminal commands that run them on the M arm terminal.

573
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Ah, yeah.

574
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,280
Unless you run the whole damn thing under Rosetta.

575
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Right.

576
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,760
Ah, that stinks.

577
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,960
Now there may be a way to change that.

578
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,760
I haven't looked into it deeply because I tend to run my terminal commands actually

579
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,800
on a, on a regular ZSH terminal.

580
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Right.

581
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,720
Like on a Linux box, you'd say, this is the default terminal.

582
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,360
So you could just like switch the default terminal to the right.

583
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,200
I, I, someone I saw in one forum that someone was like, actually, if you open them from

584
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,600
the command line and do these like flags, it'll tell it to run the application in our

585
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:41,200
mode, but run the terminal to route to the Rosetta terminal, whatever.

586
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,560
I mean, I got to be honest with you, at least for the Ruby community, you know they're porting

587
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,440
everything to M1, right?

588
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Yeah.

589
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,940
They just are.

590
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,920
But the TensorFlow performance.

591
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
Yeah.

592
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Holy crap.

593
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Interesting.

594
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Beats the shit out of my iMac pro.

595
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Really?

596
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Oh man.

597
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,080
That's brutal because that iMac pro is like a $4,000, $5,000 machine.

598
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,960
And then it's not, it's not like a $5,000 machine.

599
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,640
It's a 5,000 plus tax machine that I just bought.

600
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
Yeah.

601
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,400
Who's my nice expensive doorstop?

602
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
Who is a good doorstop?

603
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,960
Isn't that something that a fanless computer can, can beat it like that?

604
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,000
It's 5,000 somethings as far as I'm concerned.

605
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But yes.

606
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,520
In the short it's got to be because the iMac, Apple didn't even really put a great GPU in

607
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,760
there when they made the iMac pro.

608
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,800
So it's got, it's got a pretty old GPU where this has, you know, Apple's best attempt at

609
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
a GPU yet.

610
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Right.

611
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,640
It's their like dark magic sorcery GPU, right?

612
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,200
Like it's like Apple's cred Federighi's wind swept hair graphics processing.

613
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,500
I don't know what to say.

614
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,000
And it's really still, it's an area where they're not as competitive.

615
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,960
If you put them up against AMD or Nvidia GPU of a decent quality, they'll still, the Nvidia

616
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,680
and AMD GPU will still win.

617
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,160
So this is, and then I'm going to just drop it right, but this is going to be my pitch

618
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,440
for the M1.

619
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,120
It is not the most powerful machine.

620
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:09,720
It's maybe not even like the best value cause you know, Apple, but if you are looking for

621
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,720
a decent laptop that has good battery life, good performance, a good screen, decent speakers,

622
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,400
an okay camera, although it's better than other cameras and you could just like take

623
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,960
a zoom call and not have to worry about headphones and stuff.

624
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,160
It does the job and it does are kind of better than most of what I've seen.

625
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,960
I don't disagree with that, especially if you're not unplugging and replugging in sound

626
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,000
interfaces, that thing's going to work on a video call every single time.

627
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah.

628
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,840
And that is something that people write in about a lot is I just want to have a set up

629
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,960
that works for video calls.

630
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,180
Because on a, on a traditional laptop, you know, you're unplugging and plugging stuff

631
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:53,720
in all the time, your interfaces are changing it, it can be a little shitty.

655
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,440
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio and a big thank you to Datadog for sponsoring the Coder Radio

656
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
program.

657
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,440
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

658
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,800
Well this is interesting.

659
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:41,040
I talked about this last week is I have Dell's XPS 13 developer edition in-house.

660
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,400
And I think what we have here are the two apex predators for portable developer machines.

661
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,920
And there is an X86 pathway and there is an ARM path.

662
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,880
And I think it's interesting to look at it from that angle.

663
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,840
And so I'm curious to know what the price differences is because the XPS I'm going to

664
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,160
talk about is $1,400 as configured.

665
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
You get a lot for that.

666
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
All right.

667
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,160
So I got the 13-inch MacBook Air Silver because I just feel the 13-inch one should be silver.

668
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,160
I don't know.

669
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Call me Marco Wormut.

670
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,440
16 gigs of RAM, seven-core GPU.

671
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,480
I did not up the GPU.

672
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,280
The second time around, I did my research and it's actually the same, I'm sorry, CPU,

673
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
not GPU.

674
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,600
It's the same CPU, but like the seven-core one just didn't pass the quality, whatever,

675
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
whatever.

676
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,960
So I didn't want to spend the extra money for the potential extra core, right?

677
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Yeah.

678
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:42,440
I did bump the RAM to 16 because I mean, honestly, if I could have, I would have done 24 or 32.

679
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,600
That's not an option.

680
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:50,840
And it should be Apple, you guys are nuts, 256 RAM and no one cares about the bullshit

681
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
stuff they put here.

682
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
So that was-

683
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
256 gigs of storage.

684
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Storage.

685
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,920
No, 256 RAM, Chris, I hooked it right up to a data center and I was just like-

686
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,200
Give me the Tim Cook model.

687
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,440
Tim Cook uses an iPad very famously.

688
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
Yeah.

689
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,480
Although, I wonder, really, really?

690
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,720
You know who doesn't use an iPad?

691
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
His assistant.

692
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
Exactly.

693
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,080
His assistant sitting there with an iMac Pro like, why the fuck can't this guy just get

694
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
a keyboard?

695
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,560
Why don't I get an M1 iMac?

696
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,800
They got to make those somewhere, right?

697
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
They have those.

698
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
I'm Tim Cook's assistant.

699
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,560
He's like, this letter is too long for me to type on my iPad.

700
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:31,320
And here she's like, you know, you own a company that makes computers, right, bro?

701
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,760
Just go downstairs and be like, I want a computer.

702
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
One day.

703
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,600
One day there'll be one probably that takes that much RAM.

704
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,400
One day the CEO of one of the largest computer companies in the world will actually decide

705
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
he likes computers.

706
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,120
A boy can dream.

707
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
They're still getting you to buy them.

708
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
Oh.

709
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,520
I thought we had agreed there'd be no more hate speech.

710
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,640
So the price tag on this baby, $1,199.

711
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Okay.

712
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,720
So it's coming in cheaper than the XPS 13 at that price.

713
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,280
And I spilled coffee today and did not spill it on it.

714
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,280
So you know.

715
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
All right.

716
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,960
Well, so here's the competition on the X86 side of stuff.

717
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,240
I think Dell sent this into me for review.

718
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,240
Yeah.

719
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,140
And the easiest way to see these is just go to Dell.com slash Linux.

720
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:19,320
They have like all of them there, but I will have a link to the very specific build in

721
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
the show notes.

722
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,380
And this is using the latest Tiger Lake 11th Gen CPU from Intel.

723
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,440
This is a CPU they probably should have shipped a year ago, but I'll get more to that later.

724
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,020
This thing can burst up to 4.2 gigahertz depending on the CPU.

725
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,600
You can get it in I7 and I5 variants.

726
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,000
The one that I got ships with Ubuntu 2004.

727
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,240
And because it's the 11th Gen CPU, it has the Intel Iris Xe graphics.

728
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,080
And we're going to talk more about that in a moment.

729
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,880
This build had 16 gigs of RAM of low power DDR4, which is the stuff that lets you sleep

730
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,400
for a long time and not take a bunch of battery power.

731
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,800
It has a maximum possible config of 32 gigs of RAM.

732
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,680
I got the 512 M.2 PCI MVME solid state disk in this one.

733
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,020
It has a maximum possible of two terabytes.

734
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:12,000
This also came equipped with the 1080p touchscreen, the edge to edge infinity display.

735
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,400
It's a 1080p version instead of the 4K version.

736
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,620
It is still touch and it's still beautiful, beautiful colors, super, super dense pixels.

737
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,720
It's just really a gorgeous screen still.

738
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,920
As configured from Dell with Linux preloaded $1,399.

739
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:38,920
It is, I think, a premium prebuilt works out of the box at a reasonable price at that point.

740
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,660
It really has a lot to kind of offer.

741
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,760
To Dell's credit, they really jumped on that 11th Gen CPU when Intel finally got their

742
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,280
act together and they've really developed something pretty nice here.

743
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,040
They sent this one in the white housing to me.

744
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,960
Ooh, that white housing is great.

745
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
It's nice.

746
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Yeah.

747
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
I don't know if I would have chosen it.

748
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,720
If I was buying it for myself, I think I would have played it safe and just gone with boring

749
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,920
old silver, but I'm really glad they sent me the white one.

750
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,920
It's a matte white and then it's wrapped in that chamfered aluminum bottom that they have.

751
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,620
And then the palm rest area for the Arctic white one, they call it a woven glass fiber

752
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,200
palm rest.

753
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,480
So I don't know if that's some sort of fiber plastic.

754
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,920
I don't know what that is, but it feels good.

755
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
It feels fine.

756
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,800
The keyboard itself remains really good.

757
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:32,680
It feels oversized for what it is because it's edge to edge on this XPS and it's plenty

758
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,360
nice to type on.

759
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,480
They have one of the better fingerprint readers on laptops.

760
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,320
They got a nice pad that also acts as the power button and that, of course, fingerprint

761
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,280
reader works under Ubuntu.

762
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,800
And then the keyboard itself, because it's a white sort of chiclet style, but like an

763
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:54,600
evolved more modern laptop chiclet style with a white backlight that kind of has a kind

764
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:00,240
of a cool white glow look to it in the dark that impresses people when you show them the

765
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
laptop.

766
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
They go, oh, interesting.

767
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,520
And the screen itself is wrapped in Gorilla Glass.

768
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,920
I could still break it.

769
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,920
Yeah.

770
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,080
It's, you know, it's a little more durable than your average screen.

771
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,240
They put a lot of engineering into the cooling, too.

772
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,080
It's something that Dell really, really has worked on on their larger laptops, but they've

773
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,400
brought some of that down to the XPS 13.

774
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:26,520
It's got two kind of large for a laptop moving fans in this 13 inch housing, but because

775
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,120
they're always moving slowly and the way they've routed the heat, you really never hear them

776
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
kick in.

777
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:38,440
I had this thing running machine learning benchmarks for nine hours straight and I could

778
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,460
kind of hear the fans in my dead quiet office.

779
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,000
So they do they do a really good job.

780
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,520
It's got two USB-C ports.

781
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,320
I think they're both Thunderbolt, although I only confirmed that on one of them.

782
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,400
But you can charge with either one of them.

783
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,960
And if your workload is Linux and you want to stick with X86 for a while, I think you

784
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:04,840
need to understand what a game changer the 11th gen Intel Iris Xe graphics is.

785
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,640
I screwed up, guys.

786
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,920
I have buyer's remorse just a little bit with my X1 Carbon because it's a 10th gen CPU.

787
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:21,240
And I put this XPS 13, which is an i5 up against my X1, which is an i7 in the machine learning

788
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,720
benchmarks from OpenBenchmark.org, which is an entire suite of benchmarks.

789
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,920
It, like I said, runs for nine hours and really pushes the machine in nearly every single

790
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,840
way a machine learning workload could possibly push a machine.

791
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,280
And these results, by the way, are public and will be in the show notes.

792
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,960
And also, by the way, you can compare them directly to your machine.

793
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,000
This is something that the Ferronix benchmark suite makes super easy.

794
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,760
You don't even have to know how to use the tool.

795
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,760
You just get it installed and then he'll tell you the command to run to compare it directly

796
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,400
against the XPS 13.

797
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,560
I put clean XPS 13 benchmarks up there and you can compare it apples to apples with your

798
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,200
own machine to see what kind of upgrade you would get.

799
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,980
And this thing shredded my X1.

800
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:12,400
This i5 XPS 13 shredded my i7 ThinkPad in an embarrassingly every single category except

801
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,320
for one insignificant category.

802
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,920
This XPS 13 destroyed my brand new X1 Carbon.

803
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:27,320
And then to make things even more insulting, you can actually play video games with this

804
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,760
Intel's built in GPU.

805
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,760
I'm not kidding you.

806
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,760
I know they're not perfect.

807
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,680
You know, they're medium quality, but I was able to play Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb

808
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
Raider.

809
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,560
I played CSGO and Hot Shot Racing, all games I'm currently playing on my ThinkPad that

810
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,360
require the eGPU.

811
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,040
I can play directly on the XPS 13.

812
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,120
Now is that an Ubuntu Fedora difference?

813
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:56,440
No, no, it's just that the 11th Gen like they Intel invested significantly like a bit in

814
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,760
a big way.

815
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,100
If you go Google search, I'll put some links in the show notes or go on YouTube.

816
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:08,660
And if you look at the Intel Xe GPU, the whole like GPU nerd community is really excited

817
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,820
about this thing.

818
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,640
And then I guess in early 2021 Intel is actually going to launch a dedicated no, they're not

819
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
discrete graphics.

820
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
I know.

821
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,920
That's no fucking chance.

822
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,840
They claim it's happening this time, but I'll tell you what, what they've put, which is

823
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,200
the lower end version, the low power version, the Xe LP is what they call it.

824
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,320
They've put that in this laptop and I absolutely wish I would have held out for it because

825
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:39,120
it means the games I'm currently playing right now with my kids that require the eGPU, I

826
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,560
could play on the Intel.

827
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,320
I didn't want to step all the way up to an embedded like Nvidia GPU.

828
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,480
I didn't want that heat.

829
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,540
And I'm just, if you're in the Intel market right now and you need a lean, mean, portable

830
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:57,760
machine, this XPS 13 with an i5 build, you could crank this thing up a lot more than

831
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
it is right now.

832
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,640
And it's still destroying the last generation machine.

833
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:07,120
And if nothing else, I think if you're going to buy on the Intel ecosystem in a laptop,

834
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,400
you've got to get something 11th gen.

835
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,960
The battery life is great.

836
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,440
This is, like I'm saying, this is the CPU that Intel needed to release a year ago, minimum.

837
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,840
It's really a shame.

838
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:24,360
I'm not trying to claim it's the M1, but I could easily recommend this machine to anyone

839
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:29,120
who wants a Linux box and feel very confident about that recommendation.

840
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,860
It's an easy to recommend machine.

841
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,800
And the fact that you can get this good of a machine with an i5 build so you can spend

842
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,400
under $1,500 to get a premium Linux laptop, I think that's great.

843
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:47,600
And it makes me wonder, because I think I recall the System76 Galago Pro being an 11th

844
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,120
gen, it makes me wonder what the performance story is over there, too.

845
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:57,560
I couldn't appreciate the improvement that the 11th gen Intel Tiger Lake CPUs brought

846
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,040
until I tested one.

847
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,840
And it's like Intel's finally making a decent stand here.

848
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,840
And I could see in another year, this is going to be even better.

849
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,240
But I don't know.

850
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,800
For a lot of folks, it's probably too late.

851
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,800
Because here you are.

852
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
You're looking at that MacBook Air.

853
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
That's cheaper.

854
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,440
So I can understand.

855
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,660
It's a difficult tug of war.

856
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:22,000
But this is now the situation I think vendors like Dell find themselves in, right?

857
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,520
Because they're going up against the MacBook Air.

858
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,000
So for our little nerd community, we care about things like, can we game on it?

859
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,560
Can we whatever, you know, TensorFlow, right?

860
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
Right.

861
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,600
So, minimally, you're going to be able to play a lot more actual games on this laptop

862
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,940
than you would a MacBook Air.

863
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,040
Because you could also dual-boot Windows on this.

864
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,760
I used to work in the games industry.

865
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,360
And when you're in the games industry, and you look at a Mac, then you begin to cry.

866
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,360
Yeah.

867
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,560
And then you go back to Windows, which is where you belong.

868
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
Yeah.

869
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,700
And Steam with Proton plays a ton more games than are available for Macs.

870
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,080
So this is a portable game.

871
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,760
This is a portable work machine that also can play some games.

872
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Age of Empires.

873
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,400
And you're not going to have to listen to the fans while you're doing it.

874
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,920
And they've done a pretty good job on the speakers with this one, too.

875
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,960
They're not MacBook quality, but they're really pretty good.

876
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,260
I kind of don't, I mean, I don't regret my purchase because ultimately what drove my

877
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:19,840
purchase of the X1 Carbon was I wanted a 1440p screen.

878
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,360
And this comes in either 1080p or 4K.

879
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,720
If you could go back, then let's just say, you know, they're roughly the same price,

880
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
right?

881
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,200
Would you still pick the Carbon?

882
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,360
I don't think so.

883
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:38,360
You know, being able to play those games with my kids means the world to me.

884
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,360
I get that completely.

885
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,360
Yeah.

886
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,360
Yeah.

887
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,880
And this XPS 13 can do it without a huge eGPU attached to it.

888
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,720
So that means anywhere we could do it.

889
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,240
eGPU stuff is still kind of, you know.

890
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
Yeah.

891
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,880
I mean, I use it in the context of a dock mostly.

892
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,080
And so it's a dock with a GPU, but it also means, hey, if we're going to game, we have

893
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,560
to do it right here, right?

894
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,000
With this XPS 13, we could literally do it anywhere.

895
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,600
And that's without having to have a big, loud, hot, power hungry Nvidia GPU in there.

896
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:16,080
And it also means, as for a Linux user, all that stuff, all of the driver code is open

897
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,640
source and baked in to every single Linux distribution.

898
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
It's true.

899
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,640
Yeah.

900
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,640
It's Intel.

901
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,640
Yeah.

902
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,640
Yeah.

903
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,560
So it's a pretty reasonable, like again, like I put Tomb Raider on like medium settings

904
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,600
and I noticed some graphical glitches that I don't see when I'm playing on a nicer AMD

905
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,360
card or Nvidia card.

906
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,440
And Hot Shot Racing and CSGO, they're not the most demanding games, but they're what

907
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,120
I'm playing.

908
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,560
And it worked.

909
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,560
I was blown away.

910
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,240
And it's an i5 and it just shredded the performance.

911
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,800
In fact, so much so that I'm going to spend some time looking into my install and seeing

912
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,600
if there's things I need to tune for my ThinkPad.

913
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,600
For your carbon.

914
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,600
Yeah.

915
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,600
Yeah.

916
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:02,520
It sounds like if we were to take the state of the world right now, and you're a developer

917
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:08,400
looking for a premium laptop, so you're not going to Best Buy, because you're looking

918
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,760
at the XPS 13, do they still call it Sputnik or no?

919
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,360
I think they just refer to it as the developer edition now.

920
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:21,000
Well, the XPS 13 developer edition, or I mean, I got to be honest with you, I don't understand

921
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:28,280
why you would go with the MacBook Pro M1 at this point, because the Air, it's fine.

922
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,080
It's probably one of the better laptops I've ever used.

923
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,080
Yeah.

924
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:37,280
And that no fan thing is not only nice right now, but in three or four years, there's no

925
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,800
fan to get clogged up and get louder.

926
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,000
I'm trying to be soft.

927
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,680
It is, in fact, the best laptop I've ever used, now that I figured out how to fix my

928
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,560
whole Ruby and Python tool chains didn't work for me thing.

929
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,720
That seems like the only two real choices to me right now.

930
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:56,800
I haven't used every Linux laptop out there, but this seems like one of the very best.

931
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,760
And new stuff is coming out, right?

932
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,160
System 76 has an AMD machine that's not out yet.

933
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,440
That could be really interesting.

934
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,800
I think the elementary guys have some kind of partnerships now, don't they?

935
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,880
Yeah, and so is Kubuntu, but those are all kind of different.

936
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,080
These are, what we're talking about here, and I have not tried the new Galgo Pro, because

937
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,400
I think it has 11th gen.

938
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,720
I have the, mine is too old for the 11th gen, so I couldn't tell you, yeah.

939
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,400
What Dell really has here that seems like the unbeatable combo is the extremely high-end

940
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,280
chassis that makes this thing feel kind of like a luxury product, and then that edge-to-edge

941
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,040
Infinity display is just unmatched.

942
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,480
They have one of the best displays out there, and then they have that edge-to-edge keyboard,

943
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,880
which is kind of like their own custom-designed keyboard that I think is superior to the most

944
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,400
of the other keyboards that are out there, other than ThinkPad keyboards and the new

945
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,880
MacBook Pro Magic Keyboard.

946
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,720
When you consider that, the premium build, the premium chassis, the premium screen, the

947
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:01,520
premium keyboard, and the dual Thunderbolt interfaces, that's where the XPS 13 is kind

948
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,520
of in a league of its own.

949
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,240
I mean, my X1 Carbon has a lot of that, but it doesn't quite have the same build quality.

950
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,960
It doesn't quite match it there.

951
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,840
It doesn't have quite as nice of a screen, although I prefer my 2K resolution, my 1440

952
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,360
1080p resolution.

953
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,600
This is going to be one of the hardest review laptops I've ever sent back, definitely.

954
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,960
Like I thought about, like, oh, bummer, I wish I would have stretched this out a little

955
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,960
bit.

956
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,200
So here's the plan.

957
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,200
Here's the plan.

958
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,200
What?

959
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,600
Crack open a beer while you're working on the Carbon.

960
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,600
Oops!

961
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:36,720
Then have four or five more, and then all of a sudden, you need to keep the XPS, right?

962
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,720
Right, right.

963
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,280
I bet you if this thing had shipped with the 4K screen, I would not be able to play any

964
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,280
of those games.

965
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,800
You know, part of it was that it was a 1080p game load.

966
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,800
1080p.

967
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,800
Right.

968
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,160
Well, that's the dirty little secret, you know.

969
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,160
Yeah.

970
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,040
And when I'm using the X1 Carbon for day-to-day, just like office task style work from home,

971
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,640
I prefer the higher screen resolution, and I'm not really pushing the, I'm not even pushing

972
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,000
that machine.

973
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,240
So it's not a huge issue, but.

974
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,860
And then when I go eGPU, I dramatically outperform the XPS 13.

975
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,180
So it is funny, though.

976
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,700
It's like the Intel stuff is kind of starting to get a little more serious.

977
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:17,480
When you combine the Xe graphics with the fact that they're all open source and baked

978
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:23,640
into Linux, so it makes the Linux workstation very smooth, it's like, oh, now you get interesting.

979
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,560
Oh, fine, finally.

980
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,120
But if you're a developer out there right now, and you're at a fork in the road, it's

981
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:34,080
really hard to choose which direction to go, other than you got to just, I suppose, base

982
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,080
it on your workload.

983
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:41,120
And if it's a Linux workload, and primarily x86, and you need something lean, mean and

984
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,520
mobile that could maybe even crank out a video game every now and then when you're on the

985
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,020
go, if you can live with middle of the road settings, this is it.

986
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,020
This is it.

987
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,820
And that describes me to a T. And then you have the size factor.

988
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:59,060
It's heavier than, I think, the X1 Carbon or other laptops because it's got that metal

989
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:04,720
bottom and whatnot, but it's still super portable because it's so small.

990
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,960
These damn laptops, sick of them.

991
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:14,540
So I like how we've reset to our natural positions of, I'm on a Mac, and you're on Ubuntu.

992
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,960
In a way, we're starting the year off in a traditional pattern.

993
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,740
In a traditional pattern, yeah.

994
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,520
But this is my current Linux recommend.

995
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,120
If somebody's out there that's got a budget of $1,400, go to Dell.com slash Linux.

996
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,680
There's no promos, no ad, this is a unit they sent me to review, and I got to give it to

997
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,680
them.

998
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,680
They nailed the developer workstation.

999
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,440
You know, the other thing to consider is if you are in a corporate environment, sometimes

1000
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,600
they have agreements with Dell, and so you're not getting a MacBook anyways.

1001
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,600
That's a great way to go.

1002
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:52,840
Well, Mr. Dominic, I kind of have to go pour one out to say goodbye to this laptop.

1003
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,360
So we should probably wrap this thing up pretty soon.

1004
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,880
I think that's enough laptops for a few-

1005
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,960
I think it's enough laptops.

1006
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,520
I think just to wrap it up, we should always say, as we do at least once a month, quickly

1007
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,840
pour one out for sun.

1008
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,640
And see you all next week.

1009
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,440
I'm datdominucu on Twitter.

1010
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,440
There you go.

1011
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,400
Thank you, everybody, for tuning in to this week's episode.

1012
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,520
I'm at Chris Last.

1013
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,220
The podcast network is at Jupiter Signal.

1014
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,240
The show is at Coder Radio Show.

1015
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,800
Thank you to our Coder QA team.

1016
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,480

1017
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,680
You can get that at coderqa.co if you're not already a member.

1018
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:32,240
Links to what we talked about today, while those are over at coder.show slash 395.

1019
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,240
You can also find our contact form there.

1020
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,240
That's a big part of our show.

1021
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,800
Tell us a little bit about your workload and the stack that you're doing it on.

1022
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,040
You'll also find our RSS feed and all of that over there.

1023
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,120
And then last but not least, oh my goodness, how could I almost forget?

1024
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,880
You've got to join us live.

1025
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,880
It's so much fun.

1026
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,880
It's the Coder Happy Hour.

1027
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,720
Starts out 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern at jblive.tv, and then it rolls right into the

1028
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,720
show.

1029
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,720
Tux and Rolls.

1030
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:05,720
We'll be back here next week.
