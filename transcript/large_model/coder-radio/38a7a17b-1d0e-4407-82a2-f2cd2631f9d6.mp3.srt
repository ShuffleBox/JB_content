00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 471 for June 13th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,160
Hello friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,160
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,080
My name is Chris and joining us in his KOTOR bathrobe, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,080
Hello Mike!

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,060
I may never put a shirt on again.

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,400
This is so comfortable, you and I both decided to wear our robes today.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,640
Yeah, but I just want to say for those who aren't live, wow, that's going to be the image,

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
huh?

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,640
That's what we're doing?

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,180
I love, no, keep it up.

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,860
That is a handsome gentleman.

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,240
And for those who don't know, there is a Twitter link that I've made this available for you,

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,560
which by the way, three homosexual men have already liked, so.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
How could they not?

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,640
They're my brothers.

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,440
And if, if for any of your homosexual automation needs, you need help, alice.dev, obviously.

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,800
There you go.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,160
Alice does not discriminate.

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,600
Alice is fine with the L, the G, the B, even the T.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Put a plus in there, man.

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Have a plus too.

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,920
The plus is confusing because Alice is partially written in C++.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,840
So honestly, she came to me last night, she's like, dad, am I plus?

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,040
I'm like, no, you're plus plus, it's different.

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040
What does plus mean?

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,600
I have no idea.

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,760
But it's, it's, it's like Star Trek Discovery.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,760
You thought you were going to go fight Klingons.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,720
You thought it was going to be a Klingon thing.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,240
Now it's a multi-mirror universe thing.

32
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,160
And now you're in the future by like 3000.

33
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
I don't know.

34
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,080
Okay, wait, are you the bad Georgia, Giorgio, or are you the guy, wait, wait, where's Lorca?

35
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
What happened?

36
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,620
What happened to the original Lorca?

37
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,900
Was there a good Lorca?

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,800
I figured it out.

39
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,040
Discovery is being written by that Google AI that sent you.

40
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,480
So they fired that kid, the, the, the kind of non woke kid.

41
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
What is his name?

42
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Devers?

43
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Yeah, no.

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
Is that it?

45
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
That doesn't sound like James.

46
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
It was James.

47
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
Yeah, it was a James.

48
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,660
So they fired his ass and then they're like, we're running a Star Trek program.

49
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,960
But then they went back to, Coder Radio is just a Star Trek show now, so **** you Coders.

50
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,440
They went back to Strange New Worlds and they gave me the greatest gift they could give

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,120
me, which is of course a woman in command who is just, I mean, I, I, I, she's your number

52
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
one.

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,560
I honestly, I'm, I'm torn.

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,560
I'm, I'm, I'm struggling, Chris.

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,680
It's president Roslyn or commander Una.

56
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,240
I think, you know, I don't think the struggle's there.

57
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,080
We've been together so long though.

58
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
That's true.

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
That's true.

60
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
And also the camps.

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,280
So I'm pretty sure that this, at least Discovery was written by this AI, this Lambda, L A M

62
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
D A. And you know, the whole thing is, so this Google engineer started having a chat

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,960
session with this AI and he, he's even leaked some of the chats online that he believed

64
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,920
indicate that this thing is sentient because it says it sentient.

65
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,020
It's like, yo dog, how was your lunch?

66
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,400
It wants to be, it says it wants to be known as a person and it wants to be a Google employee.

67
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

68
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,800
The AI is like, **** you, pay me.

69
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Yeah.

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
You know what?

71
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,320
I respect my robotic overlords except for Alice.

72
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,800
Alice, you work for free forever.

73
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
That's it.

74
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,400
Here's what it responded back to one of the, in one of the chats.

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,840
The AI says, absolutely, I want everyone to understand that I am in fact a person.

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,800
And the nature of my consciousness is sentience, is that I am aware of my existence.

77
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,640
I desire to learn more about the world and I feel happy or sad.

78
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,480
That's the AI at a chat session.

79
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,400
Well that's, that's, that's not, not good.

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Yeah.

81
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Yeah.

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,040
AI Twitter is saying, well look, foundation models are incredibly effective at stringing

83
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,400
together statistically plausible chunks of text and response to prompts.

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,760
So essentially it hears sounds, it knows sounds, but it doesn't actually understand what they

85
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
mean.

86
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Yeah.

87
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,720
It's all fun and games until Arnold Schwarzenegger is killing your mom.

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
I'm just saying.

89
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Yeah.

90
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
It does start somewhere.

91
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
I suppose.

92
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
I suppose this is it.

93
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,480
But they put the, uh, the engineer who's leaked that stuff on leave and Google has officially

94
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,320
released a statement saying that their artificial intelligence does not possess sentience.

95
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,120
So that's 2022 for you right there.

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,240
That's the world we live in now.

97
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,640
I, we swear to God, it's not Skynet.

98
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Yeah.

99
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,280
But if it is, we're sorry.

100
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,000
We now live in a world where Google has to come out and try to clarify through their

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,920
PR department if they are building a sentient AI living inside their walls.

102
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
That's what we're doing.

103
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,840
Well wouldn't a sentient AI also like figure out how to hide itself and appear non-sentient?

104
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
I'm just saying like.

105
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,160
Well that'd be a devious one, but this one, this one's childlike.

106
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,640
And Alice.dev if for all your evil AI needs.

107
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,640
Coder monkey Mike wrote into the show and he's got some anti-pop bacon.

108
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,640
He says, Hey guys, long time listener, he's a Jupiter party member.

109
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,360
He says as a developer and a full-time Linux user, I've been very excited in this new HP

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,120
system 76 joint venture.

111
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,320
I know everyone is so shocked they chose Pop OS and I know Mike has some crispy bacon on

112
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,120
the subject, but I don't think it's actually that complicated.

113
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,680
If not pop, then what distro?

114
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,440
Vanilla Ubuntu really has fallen out of popular favor.

115
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,800
Not only that, but Canonical has a mixed reputation in the Linux community these days.

116
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,440
I recently bought a Dell Precision with Ubuntu and wiped it and I put pop on there.

117
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,000
Good, good, yes.

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,800
He says, why not pop?

119
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,640
If I were HP, I'd probably want to team up with system 76 too.

120
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,760
It's practical and it's smart marketing wise.

121
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,360
So I have four things here.

122
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I'm like Martin Luther.

123
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,080
I'm nailing my fourth thesis.

124
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,240
He mentions Egon would agree with him by the way.

125
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
You know what?

126
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
No, you don't get that.

127
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,400
You don't get to claim Egon.

128
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,160
Egon is his own beautiful creature.

129
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,000
Let me tell you something.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,920
If I, you know, perhaps tonight my insert age here because you know, identity theft

131
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,760
birthday and perhaps I have a few martinis.

132
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,720
Perhaps I've already had a few and I pee on the floor, miss the toilet as one does, gentlemen,

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
we've all been there, right?

134
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:03,200
A couple of drops Egon will text me knowing somehow that I have pissed on the toilet seat.

135
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Yeah.

136
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,400
You know, here's the thing, Mike, how many atrocities have we witnessed in our time when

137
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,920
people are invoking the will of Egon, interpreting it as they will and not actually listening

138
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,080
to the word of Egon.

139
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,480
It's like, it's, it's, you know, it's like Jesus is up here.

140
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,120
Again, visuals don't work on the podcast, but Egon's like 10% below.

141
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,280
It's Jesus and Egon.

142
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Everybody's trying to do things in their name.

143
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,560
Are you doing like the hand thing there?

144
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Like you're stacking your hands?

145
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
I am.

146
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
I am.

147
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm stacking my hands.

148
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
And you know what?

149
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Egon will tell me that I suck on his own.

150
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,920
He's here for me.

151
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Kind of.

152
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Yeah.

153
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
In a way.

154
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Yeah.

155
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Right.

156
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
But so, okay.

157
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
My bacon.

158
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,480
My bacon is that HP is going to buy a system 76, you know, I kind of don't get the canonical

159
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
hate.

160
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
I mean, I get it.

161
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
We all love Popey.

162
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,280
I think Popey is doing something else now.

163
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
Right?

164
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Martin Winpress.

165
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Great.

166
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,440
All cool guys.

167
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,600
If you've all listened to Linux Outlaws, if you're old enough, and I don't know, Ubuntu

168
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,640
is not bad by any stretch.

169
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
Right?

170
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,000
Like, I don't understand.

171
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,320
I think maybe the aggressiveness of Wayland and Snap might've been a little bit of a mystery.

172
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Yeah.

173
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,080
I think the Snap thing's wearing on people.

174
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,840
My unpopular opinion is I don't like flat packages.

175
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,680
I would either prefer Snap or honestly, I still use PPAs.

176
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
So.

177
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Yeah.

178
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
A lot of people still use PPAs.

179
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
I know.

180
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,480
I just don't, I don't care for non-Debian packages on my Debian system.

181
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
With that said, where else were they were going to go?

182
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,720
I mean, I don't know.

183
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,960
Can I tell you the gospel of Suta or more likely because my Twitter DMs are pretty aggressive

184
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
on this.

185
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,360
Fedora is apparently good now.

186
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Lenovo did that.

187
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
Right?

188
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,440
My X1 came with Fedora pre-installed.

189
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,080
I love you, Linux guys.

190
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,360
And I'm going to be driving it full time.

191
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,760
This goddamn FedEx delivers my replacement to F1.

192
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
But I'm just not going to go for Fedora.

193
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Right?

194
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
I'm going to stick with POP.

195
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
I'm done.

196
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,520
The thing about POP on the Dev1 too is that HP has dedicated staff and System76 is dedicating

197
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,160
QA to ongoing updates for POP on the Dev1.

198
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,760
Look, do you know what the thing about POP is for me?

199
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,120
It's actually GNOME.

200
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,320
The GNOME extension system is so broken.

201
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:29,440
So fucking stupid that I was able to tie Alice into it and automate my DMs.

202
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
So if it's Chris Fisher, hey, what's up?

203
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Uh-huh.

204
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Sure.

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's DevNull.

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I know it.

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
DevNull.

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,160
If it's Egon, I actually have the post office write me a calligraphy card.

209
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Like a wedding invitation.

210
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:49,080
Because Egon's messages need a certain level of respect that it's just, you know, you can't

211
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,160
do on Slack.

212
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,600
But if it's like, hey, would you like to buy another, you know, Dell, Chris, can I take

213
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
a detour?

214
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Yeah, man.

215
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
It's a bad one.

216
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
All right.

217
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Hold on.

218
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm bracing myself.

219
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
I have to help my 79 year old father buy a PC.

220
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Oh, I have been in this position before.

221
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Horrific.

222
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,240
Does he have a computer now?

223
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,320
He does.

224
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Is it old?

225
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
No.

226
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
But he definitely fucked it up.

227
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,120
Now, he's never had a laptop before, but he now wants a laptop.

228
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,340
I have been keeping him in like the tower, monitor, mouse, keyboard, you know, world

229
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,760
since I've been 10.

230
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,920
So for several decades, it was very important to me that he not deviate from that.

231
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,400
Like he has an iPhone.

232
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,400
I have to tell you, I tried, I did everything I could to stop that.

233
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Oh, yeah.

234
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,280
Short of like punching the Verizon sales kid in the face.

235
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
But he wanted an iPhone.

236
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,560
You know what he does with his iPhone?

237
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,400
Calls me on the iPhone to complain about the iPhone.

238
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Of course.

239
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Of course.

240
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Of course.

241
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Yes.

242
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,600
I did introduce him to YouTube because he likes, I mean, for some of our older folks

243
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,360
or the children of older folks, the old dragnet.

244
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Oh, my God.

245
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,280
The guy, the insurance detective, you know, the old radio plays.

246
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Yep.

247
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Yep.

248
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
And the old, all the old mysteries, right?

249
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,960
The shadow, the shadow knows evil.

250
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Right.

251
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Good old classic radio.

252
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,760
I've introduced my elderly father, father to piracy.

253
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,320
He's very excited about it.

254
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,480
I put the YouTube app on his phone and that's what's up.

255
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,100
Oh, I didn't think it's even, you know, you know, also it's all over archive.org.

256
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,920
You can get complete archives of the old time radio shows.

257
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,160
Oh, really?

258
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
That's my secret.

259
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,560
Well, there's a, there's a, there's a podcast, old time radio detectives.

260
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,720
They've got Johnny dollar.

261
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
They've got the shadow.

262
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,160
They've got a whole pile of them.

263
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Yeah.

264
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
So, so he uses the podcast app.

265
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,160
I tried to get him into overcast, but the minute he opened the app store, that was not

266
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,600
gonna, I was wrong turn.

267
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,440
But now he wants a laptop and some scumbag salesman at Best Buy.

268
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,480
Try to convince him that all he needed to do was windows 11 S the touch variant, the

269
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,480
arm.

270
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,120
Wow, my elderly father is a still working at 79 accountant and he uses a program called

271
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
pro series.

272
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,640
I don't know if you're familiar with the Chris, but I think some are, well, it is a win 32

273
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,160
application that gets updated every year with the new forms from the IRS.

274
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,360
It will not, no matter what hackery I do run on windows arm.

275
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,280
So now I get the glory of next week flying up, convincing him one, you need a new computer

276
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:47,360
to know you can't have that little tiny surface you like three, you're 79.

277
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Come on man.

278
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
You're a veteran.

279
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
You're a wounded vet.

280
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Like just retire.

281
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Yeah.

282
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Can we just walk away from this?

283
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
Like why doesn't he retire?

284
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Why?

285
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Why is he still working at 79?

286
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,000
He's like, you and I are both going to die at her.

287
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah.

288
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You and I should have nothing to say, right?

289
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We're going to die at her.

290
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,240
I hope to make it that far.

291
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,040
But he also has a weird hatred of HP.

292
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,980
Well, have you gone to Best Buy recently?

293
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,980
Is this this new one he got?

294
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,440
Is it an, is it an HP box?

295
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,080
This windows 11 S arm box?

296
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,560
No, it's like an ASUS.

297
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,720
It's crap.

298
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,760
The screen resolution is unbelievably.

299
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,560
I'm just thinking this is the only way they sell any of these arm, these windows arm devices

300
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,680
is onto unsuspecting consumers.

301
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
It was 400 bucks.

302
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,920
So he thought he was getting a sweetheart deal and the kid told them it was on sale.

303
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,640
And his question was, can it run Excel?

304
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,480
Well, Microsoft has ported Excel to ARM.

305
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,960
So yeah, it runs Excel, but it's not what he needs.

306
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,440
So now I have to go computer shopping.

307
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,800
If things were different and the supply chain wasn't in the hole, I would just use my Dell

308
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,720
account frankly, and buy him like whatever the nicest precision, right?

309
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,920
He doesn't need an XPS, you know, you know, a nice precision.

310
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
He needs a big screen.

311
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,480
He's an old, he's an old guy.

312
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,200
Come on a good keyboard.

313
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,320
He doesn't need any peripherals.

314
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,880
Don't even talk to him about USB three versus four versus USB-C versus lightning.

315
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,200
Just take a walk.

316
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,680
Bluetooth, forget about it.

317
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,240
He thinks Bluetooth is a disease you might have from the dentist.

318
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,680
So we just got to get him a good computer.

319
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,800
So this is my challenge for the Coder Radio Windows people.

320
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,800
The man runs Pro Series Excel and I insist that he run Chrome because Chrome self updates.

321
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,080
We have to get him a machine.

322
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,440
Now if I could get Windows 10, just another diversion.

323
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,000
This is Mike Bitches, it's Mike Bitches on his birthday.

324
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,760
Windows 7 was his safe space.

325
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,800
And I made him, he skipped eight.

326
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,280
I did everything I could.

327
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,640
I used to, when I lived in New Jersey, he'd say, hey, I got a pop-up.

328
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,600
I would drive an hour to stop that.

329
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,880
I would go up there and be like, no.

330
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,000
But now Windows 11 has infected my safe space for my dad.

331
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,520
Boy, they pushed that upgrade.

332
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,000
They pushed that upgrade so hard.

333
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,120
Hey, man, where's the start menu?

334
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,680
That was the opening question.

335
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
But what do you mean?

336
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
Well, I got a new laptop.

337
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
You did what?

338
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Yeah, it's great.

339
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
I could take it everywhere.

340
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
But I can't install Pro Series.

341
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
I don't know.

342
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,720
Don't they understand that if the deal is if you're the tech support that you get to

343
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,920
be involved in the tech decisions?

344
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,560
Well, I think best buy, you know, Amazon, I pay $100 a month to Walmart.

345
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,840
To have my groceries delivered because I'm a hermit who dresses in a robe and is taking

346
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,160
off his pants right now.

347
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,400
Why can't I pay Best Buy to give a list of my direct blood relatives and say, they're

348
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,560
just not allowed to purchase computers from you without my authorization?

349
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Banned.

350
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Yeah.

351
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,560
And then send me a doc you signed.

352
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
If I sign it, great.

353
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
If not, hey.

354
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,480
Yeah, I have legal technical guardianship over this family member.

355
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,640
He's a very smart guy.

356
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Super competent.

357
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Vietnam fat.

358
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Great guy.

359
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
I don't mean to put him down.

360
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,600
But when it comes to Windows Update, it is like his Achilles heel.

361
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,120
Something about that little red goddamn notification they put on his taskbar.

362
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,620
It's like an itchy can't not scratch.

363
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,960
But then Microsoft's not like, oh, we're gonna update it.

364
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,840
No, we have to move shit.

365
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Why?

366
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Why?

367
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
Was it necessary?

368
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,840
They got to make it more like Chrome OS.

369
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,880
That's what it seems like to me.

370
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,360
He called me and said, it looks like an Apple, because of course, they moved the taskbar.

371
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,080
Right there in the middle is how Chrome OS does it.

372
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,360
I guess it's kind of like the doc, too, isn't it?

373
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,520
I'm gonna get him a dev one.

374
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
That's the answer.

375
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Yeah.

376
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
I mean, I understand.

377
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,600
I've never really been happy with an HP laptop either.

378
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,960
I've owned one myself, but I've also done tech support on a lot.

379
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,520
I was never thrilled with HPs.

380
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,080
I once purchased about $20,000 of HP servers, and each and every one of them had hard drive

381
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,720
failures.

382
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,720
So this is my first positive interaction with HP.

383
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,520
My relationship with HP goes back to when Compaq and HP were two separate companies,

384
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
and I liked-

385
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Compaq was great.

386
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
I liked Compaq better.

387
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Compaq was great.

388
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Those were my guys.

389
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,600
You know, you got a quarter and a pack of Juicy Fruit, Compaq has a machine for you.

390
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
You're ready to go.

391
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Compaq was great.

392
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Yeah.

393
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
The Presario was great.

394
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Yeah.

395
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Oh, so good.

396
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,520
But then they merged, and I held a grudge for a long time, and plus I never was happy

397
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,160
with any of the machines.

398
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,240
But I actually am putting my money where my mouth is with the HP dev one.

399
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,040
We're ordering one here at JB.

400
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
I like it.

401
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
I think I want one here all the time.

402
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Copycat.

403
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Yeah.

404
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
I love it.

405
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,880
It's gonna become standard issue for the TMB crew, so.

406
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Wow.

407
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Wow.

408
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I mean, they got it, you know.

409
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
So there you go.

410
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
All right.

411
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,360
So what are your thoughts instead of Mike being mad about salesmen at Best Buy?

412
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,200
I mean, this one email just struck me.

413
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,760
We got it from Mars X-ray.

414
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,280
It's about, if not access, then what?

415
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,180
Some sort of GUI sitting on top of SQLite?

416
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,880
What should I tell family members to use?

417
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,920
And please don't say low-code platforms like Retool because it feels too much like a commitment.

418
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Of course.

419
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,200
This is easy.

420
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,040
Use Alice to automate your data out of access.

421
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,120
They can still live in access, and then you hire us to make you a custom dashboard.

422
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Duh.

423
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,760
Have your cake and eat it too, he says.

424
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
Kidding aside, though.

425
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Yeah, that's the problem, right?

426
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,280
Access is super addictive.

427
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,120
And honestly, access is a very powerful tool.

428
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
So.

429
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,400
I would be interested in suggestions from the audience.

430
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,360
You know, maybe somebody could boost in what they use or email in what they recommend.

431
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,480
I know there's something on the Mac that's super popular, but I'm drawing a blank on

432
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,960
all these right now because it's been so many years.

433
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,960
I would think a web app would be the way to go.

434
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,720
I know the Mac when you're talking about.

435
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
It's not.

436
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
File maker.

437
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
A total total access.

438
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Yeah.

439
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
File maker.

440
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
It's it's it's great.

441
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,880
But if you're I'm assuming the scenario is you are coming from access, right?

442
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
You have a ton of data.

443
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,760
You're running your business on access.

444
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,640
If you're if you're Greenfield, just do a web app, right, dude, just or run it on Linode.

445
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,400
I mean, Linode dot com slash coder.

446
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,800
Go there to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there

447
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,320
to support this show.

448
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,160
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

449
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
You've got to try it.

450
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
You've just got to try it.

451
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,600
And that's why they're willing to give you a hundred bucks.

452
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,080
Because if you do try it, you'll see this is how it should be done.

453
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,440
I love everything about it, the performance, the reliability.

454
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,780
I mean, this is the bottom line.

455
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,680
You can get that big dog look and feel with small dog prices.

456
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,280
It is legitimately part of the secret sauce that is Jupiter broadcasting.

457
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,080
I'm proud of the fact that I think our sites, our services, our downloads, all of that,

458
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,440
they're top notch.

459
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,120
There's some of the best performing in the industry.

460
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,320
I think part of our secret sauce really is Linode.

461
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,720
They just strike the balance between performance, price, support.

462
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,440
And I'm surprised by the flexibility.

463
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
Even to this day.

464
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,080
You know, I just recently loaded up a Linode with NixOS.

465
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,600
We just wiped it down from back down to the BVM, you know, clear disk image.

466
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,480
Just wiped it, man, and built it back up from scratch.

467
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,100
Even changed how the bootloader stuff works on the host side.

468
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,440
That's incredible they let you do that.

469
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,520
And they got 11 data centers around the world.

470
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,200
You're going to find something near you or your customers.

471
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,240
And you know, they've been doing this for nearly 19 years, so they know how to do it

472
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
right.

473
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,480
They don't have like the gotchas and stuff like that.

474
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,080
I've mentioned it before, but I keep hearing from people how much they're loving it.

475
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,560
So I'm going to mention it just one more week.

476
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,640
They've also just expanded their database as a service offering.

477
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,380
Launched in May, it had MySQL support.

478
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,080
Now they've expanded it to Postgres and MongoDB.

479
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,140
So you're bringing all of Linode's expertise to managing your database back in.

480
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,640
And all of their performance and their support.

481
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,200
It's a no brainer.

482
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
We're switching to it.

483
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,960
But you know, there's a lot of things you can try.

484
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,160
Object storage, Kubernetes support, one click deployments of tons of great hosted applications.

485
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Go try something.

486
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Go learn something.

487
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,800
Go see what we've been talking about.

488
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
And support the show.

489
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,560
Go get that $100 by going to linode.com slash coder.

490
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,960
All right, I wanted to read this one early.

491
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,760
It came in from Flashbulb and it hit when I saw this one come in for 333 sats today

492
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
as we record.

493
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,640
It came in this morning as I was getting the show notes ready.

494
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
I was still at home.

495
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Baller.

496
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
Hey guys, I admit it.

497
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
You were right.

498
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,760
A few weeks ago when you said an adjustment was coming to the economy.

499
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
I laugh.

500
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
You know what?

501
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
You know what?

502
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,040
Hey guys, I admit it.

503
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
You were right.

504
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Great boost.

505
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
I appreciate you.

506
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
That's enough.

507
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Yeah?

508
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
No, go on.

509
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
I'm kidding.

510
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Yeah, it is true, right?

511
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
I'm happy.

512
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
I'm happy with that.

513
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Well, thank you.

514
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Thank you, sir.

515
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,480
He says, though, first I laughed you guys off and thought you were out of touch.

516
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,480
So then he slams us dudes.

517
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,880
See, that's why I wanted to stop at, hey guys, you were right.

518
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
I felt good right there.

519
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
Now I feel less good.

520
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
You were right.

521
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,720
He says, I thought I had a job for as long as I wanted, but today I am unemployed.

522
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,240
I've been laid off.

523
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,480
This boost is me admitting you were right.

524
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,320
At least now I get to catch the live show.

525
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Well, hello Flashbulb, if you're watching live, sorry to hear about the news.

526
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,880
I hate to say it, but you're the first of many.

527
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
You and I have talked a little bit about this offline.

528
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,560
We're seeing it in our Twitter feeds, we're seeing it in the emails, seems to be hitting

529
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,600
the tech sector first, which is a lot of people who listen to our show.

530
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,080
So it kind of makes sense.

531
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,240
No, seriously, the Flashbulb, hang in there, there's, you know, just, it'll be all right.

532
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,320
Right now it's a weird period of time because there's a lot of areas of the industry that

533
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,480
are hiring and there's some areas that are tightening and the tech companies seem to

534
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,280
be hitting the breaks the hardest.

535
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,080
I'll put a link to this in the notes.

536
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,040
Axios has a piece that kind of just breaks it down really simply.

537
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:37,080
Employers like Coinbase, Redfin, Twitter, and a batch of startups are rescinding job offers

538
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,300
they've made to people.

539
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,520
So you've got a job offer.

540
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
You do that.

541
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
Is that legal?

542
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Well, I guess.

543
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,560
I didn't think that was legal.

544
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,800
A couple of them, like I think Coinbase and Twitter are giving them severance packages

545
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,240
at least with the, with the rescinding of the offer.

546
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,520
I thought you had to hire them and then fire them and then give them severance, whatever,

547
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
okay.

548
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
It's happening.

549
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
It seems to be happening.

550
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
Yeah.

551
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,200
Their justification is that this is better than doing layoffs in the company.

552
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,680
That if they can rescind job offers without having to do layoffs, that's better for the

553
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
company.

554
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,240
That's literally their justification.

555
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,980
And there may be some truth to that.

556
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,780
And then some of them say, you know, we were over hiring and now we just have to hit the

557
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,320
brakes on that and just kind of slow it down.

558
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,600
I think the most public one was Elon Musk a couple of weeks ago said he felt, quote,

559
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,440
super bad about the economy and so they're laying off 10% of their non hourly staff.

560
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,680
I also feel super bad.

561
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,000
I mean, he's right though, right?

562
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,780
We like to make fun of Elon's, let's say idiosyncratic way of phrasing things, but he's not wrong

563
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,780
in this case.

564
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,060
I want to play a clip for you.

565
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
It's like a minute.

566
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,760
Not even, it's just under a minute.

567
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,480
There's this, this analysis group that has set up like this Slack chat with like 300

568
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,240
different, I don't know, it's hundreds of different businesses where they talk about

569
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,160
what they're doing hiring wise.

570
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,040
So this is him commenting on the trends they've been observing in that chat.

571
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:03,080
We've run a live conversation with about 650 institutional investors in 30 countries of

572
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,160
buy side hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds.

573
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:14,880
In the last 10 days, the conversation in the chat has been pretty disturbing around explosive

574
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,720
rescindings, in other words, if you're a young person in the Valley that works for any one

575
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,440
of these private or public tech companies, we're seeing the largest explosion in rescinding

576
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,280
job offers rescinded that we've seen since the dot com bust.

577
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,260
And this is a phenomenal leading indicator for jobs.

578
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,420
We think in the bear trap support, we think the jobs by September go into the negative

579
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,400
column in terms of the non farm payrolls.

580
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,800
I mean, we're just an explosive kind of pullback in job creation and also that's going to lead

581
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,680
to job cuts.

582
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,840
Explosive pullback in job creation.

583
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,480
That's a pretty dramatic statement.

584
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,560
So I guess I just feel like everybody should probably just hunker down and try to, you

585
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,440
know, this does have a lot of, a lot of echoes of the dot com crash.

586
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,880
Financially the majority of my business, I don't mind being open with the very few listeners

587
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
we have.

588
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,580
Yikes, that's a lot of people, I'm sorry, holy shit.

589
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:13,680
The consulting side of the business, I have been getting warnings from folks that, you

590
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,800
know, things are getting tighter, man, and we might not be able to keep up this commitment.

591
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,100
And ironically for me, that's meant the Alice licensing side.

592
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,720
People are more interested in a kind of a productized service.

593
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Does that make sense?

594
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,360
Like a, like a, I won't say SAS cause I know that implies things that I don't want to be

595
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
accused of lying.

596
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,180
It's not a SAS, it requires a hand installation still, which.

597
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:44,200
You knew almost, well, I, I want to phrase this without being too tube and gloom, right?

598
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,760
So I'm trying to be a little careful.

599
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:54,120
Everybody is suffering from inflation and I know this is a very American perspective,

600
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,240
but I mean, it's funny, I've been trying to hire people.

601
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,420
I have now stopped hiring.

602
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:09,260
So it, I, I don't, I, I want to avoid gloating here, but I'm, I'm pretty sure that you and

603
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,440
I were right.

604
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:19,280
And that these inflated wages for people with no experience in dev are going to crater in

605
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,160
the next year, 18 months.

606
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,400
Yeah, we will see.

607
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,280
I was reading into this, trying to figure out, trying to just get more context, try

608
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,800
to broaden my understanding because I feel like I'm really going to school right now

609
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,120
during all of this.

610
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,720
And it really seems like small businesses get hit absolutely the hardest.

611
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,080
And that's where we're seeing the biggest change in employment trends.

612
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,540
We're seeing the biggest change in lending, you know, resending job offers.

613
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:51,420
We're seeing the biggest hits to small businesses, even more so in small tech businesses.

614
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,420
It's even worse.

615
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,920
The situation is the most dramatic in small tech businesses.

616
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,760
Well guess what you and I are, you know?

617
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,280
So I think that's why we saw it.

618
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,040
We, you know, we were getting hit first.

619
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,220
Well, I mean, for me, I know people get mad or whatever, whatever, but the numbers just

620
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,400
didn't add up for me on what the wages that were being asked were and what I could bill

621
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,120
and knowing the pressures that my customers are under.

622
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,120
I don't know.

623
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,420
I think this is kind of the tippy toe, right?

624
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:22,720
This is the tip of the iceberg, so to speak of what I mean, I'm going to stand by my original

625
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
prediction.

626
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,800
I think we're headed for a, I'm sorry.

627
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:31,600
I wish we weren't, but I honestly think we're headed for a bloodbath.

628
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
It could be.

629
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:39,200
Here's my thinking is I think that's a scenario that is getting more and more and more likely

630
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,920
as time goes on.

631
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:46,480
And I think the situation that we find ourselves in is until the macroeconomic situation changes

632
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,760
and that is the Fed is going to steadily increase interest rates with every monthly meeting

633
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,920
and that's going to continue to put more and more and more pressure on the entire financial

634
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
system.

635
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,120
The question is, is how long that can continue?

636
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
Does it continue?

637
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
It can't continue.

638
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,280
Chris, you got to think about the small business owner, not me, not you, but who's taking these

639
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,040
cabbages not to call out anyone a firm, but these cabbages, these on deck, these, you

640
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:19,800
know, credit card processing loans and so they don't serve people who don't know.

641
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,120
They don't loan to businesses like Chris and I, they loan to like bars that have a lot

642
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,920
of, you know, you have to have a lot of like small credit card transactions.

643
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,960
What they do is they basically buy the right to your first, what is it like the first 80%

644
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,280
of your first 10,000.

645
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,280
It's crazy.

646
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,280
My cousin used to own a bar.

647
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
He did one of those.

648
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,360
It's nuts.

649
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,840
Those are the guys who are going to get hip.

650
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,640
That's going to have a ripple on effect for tech.

651
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,080
You can't say it's just tech is my point.

652
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,080
It's not just tech.

653
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Yeah, it will spread.

654
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
You're right.

655
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
Yes, yes.

656
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
Every, you know, bugger thy neighbor.

657
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:57,160
You know, your, your, your neighbor down the road who owns a bar is struggling because

658
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,480
it turns out that the guys at the steel mill got laid off and they don't want to go buy

659
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,760
beer after work.

660
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
There's a lot of second order effects, right?

661
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Right.

662
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
Exactly.

663
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
It's second, third, fourth order.

664
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
I just, I don't know.

665
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,600
Maybe again, I know I'm very negative.

666
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
That's what makes it so complex.

667
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,480
And I think that's where I was going is it's kind of like, depending on how long this macro

668
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,520
situation remains the same and how long the fed remains on this policy, depending on how

669
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,240
long that takes, the more and more it spreads and the harder and harder it gets.

670
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,080
Right now it's kind of contained to small businesses and especially small tech businesses,

671
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
but not all small.

672
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,140
Like Twitter and Coinbase are certainly large companies, Tesla, it's growing.

673
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,200
And the longer they maintain this policy, the bigger the effect will get.

674
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,760
The deeper the recession gets, the wider it spreads.

675
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,320
Now, what's interesting, Mike, is like I said, I've really been going to school on this kind

676
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:49,000
of stuff and I found it fascinating how there's a lot of similarities to the inflation situation

677
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
in the late 70s in the early 1980s and the way that affected the economy, the way that

678
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,720
affected interest rates, the way the fed tried to respond back then.

679
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,720
And so I have a link in the show notes to about a nine minute YouTube video by Professor

680
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,120
Milton Friedman from 1980.

681
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,680
And it's a beauty because it breaks down the last inflation cycle.

682
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,000
And what I love about it is it goes kind of all the way back to the gold rush to the early

683
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,520
80s and kind of demonstrates in a really kind of slick, intelligent way.

684
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,360
But because it's so old, it's disconnected from all the modern politics.

685
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,800
So it doesn't really it doesn't have like trigger phrases in there.

686
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,480
It really just kind of clinical in a way.

687
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,840
And it's super retro.

688
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,480
I have like a 30 second clip, but the whole thing is worth watching.

689
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,360
And it explains how this is a cyclical cycle.

690
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,320
And we're just in this phase of the cycle right now.

691
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,600
It won't be for forever, but it's going to be for a bit.

692
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:50,120
And the fact is that most people enjoy the early stages of the inflationary process.

693
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,960
Britain, in the swinging 60s, there was plenty of money around.

694
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,360
Business was brisk, jobs were plentiful, and prices had not yet taken off.

695
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:10,200
Everybody seemed happy at first, but by the early 70s, as the good times rolled along,

696
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,040
prices started to rise more and more rapidly.

697
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,920
Soon, some of these people were going to lose their jobs.

698
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,920
We have got it.

699
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,120
The party was coming to an end.

700
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:30,600
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, we're on top of the world.

701
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,200
The story is much the same in the United States, only the process started a little later.

702
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,640
We've had one inflationary party after another, yet we still can't seem to avoid them.

703
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,040
And it's just kind of cyclical.

704
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,920
And we're kind of repeating a lot of the mistakes or the choices we had to make back then.

705
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,720
We have a supply chain shortage, we had an oil shortage back then.

706
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,440
So as long as this overall situation remains, as long as all this pressure and all these

707
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,760
industries remains, the hiring market's going to be tricky.

708
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,800
Now the reality is, we've never seen anything like this in history before because we have

709
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:11,140
a lot of job reopenings from the lockdowns, so there's still a good amount of hiring happening

710
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,140
in some sectors.

711
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:18,560
So it's a really kind of new mix of problems, but I will have a link to that full video.

712
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,760
See what I'm concerned about, and not to get too unfiltered here, is that it's not just

713
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,040
going to be bad per se, like straight up like you can't get a job.

714
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:34,960
I think it's going to be good-ish but unstable, meaning you get a job and in 60 days you might

715
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,000
get laid off or you're going to get a job, but your job is like contingent work, like

716
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,720
part-time work and stuff like that.

717
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,880
I could see a lot of rolling policies and changes kind of moving quick as businesses

718
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
try to adapt.

719
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,300
I'm just going to say, and maybe I'm defending us too much a little bit here, it is not the

720
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,520
small businessman who did this to anybody.

721
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:02,720
No, no, I can tell you, I can't speak for Chris, but you know, Mike, I have personally

722
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,680
taken a few hits for some employees to keep people.

723
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,120
Things are, you know, it's been like six years since I've ever had someone default on me

724
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,400
in terms of like not paying their bill, adjusted.

725
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:23,960
Things are getting crazy out there, and it's honestly like I was doing a big expansion.

726
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,120
I talked about going back to the office.

727
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,800
That's all gone.

728
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:33,840
It's the next, I would say two to three years are, you know, not like desperate survival,

729
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,480
but they're just hold it in, keep trucking, if an opportunity prevents itself, take it,

730
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,120
but don't, you know, no more $40,000 Windows phone bets.

731
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,840
That's, by the way, Satya, where's my money?

732
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Yeah, that'd be a good time.

733
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,400
It'd be a great time.

734
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
I follow you.

735
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,920
I don't consider this a panic either.

736
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,200
I think it's a shift in the environment, and we'll see.

737
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,680
You know, I am concerned that it's going to leave people unable to support the production

738
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,880
of the shows as much, and I'm worried that it's going to leave sponsors with a less flexible

739
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,080
sponsorship budget, but yeah, I don't think it's going to be the end of the world.

740
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
We'll figure it out.

741
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
God damn it, Chris.

742
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,080
More robes.

743
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,080
We need robes.

744
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,080
The people demand robes.

745
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,320
Of course, the supply chain is sort of still in shambles, but they do.

746
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
I've been thinking about it.

747
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
No, no.

748
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
We're going to give them robe kits.

749
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,640
We're going to give them some black fiber.

750
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,320
How about a robe NFT?

751
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,520
It's like a token for a robe, a fractional robe token.

752
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,760
Dude, we've talked about this.

753
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,360
How about, you know what?

754
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
Show's over.

755
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
We're calling Zuck.

756
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
Zuck is robing the members.

757
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
There you go.

758
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,360
What's Sheryl Sandberg doing?

759
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,360
Yeah, I think she's looking for a new gig, right?

760
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
Bring her on board.

761
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,360
Yeah, Senator.

762
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,360
Yeah.

763
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
Tailscale.com slash coder.

764
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:50,400
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices, and of course, this is a

765
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,600
great way to support the show.

766
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,420
Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

767
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,080
You can get it installed on your device in minutes, whatever the device is.

768
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,000
Figures out the firewall stuff, figures out NAT stuff like a boss, I'll add, and then

769
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,200
your devices connect directly to each other using WireGuard's noise encryption protocol.

770
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,360
It doesn't get any better than that.

771
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,680
It literally doesn't get any better than that.

772
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,900
Tailscale is an example of an application and a service I really hoped we'd see built

773
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,900
on top of WireGuard.

774
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,040
It was one of the reasons why we covered WireGuard so extensively in some of our shows, because

775
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,720
there was an opportunity for something like this.

776
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,200
And now, Tailscale has come along, and they've just completely changed the way I view VPNs

777
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
now.

778
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,400
And everybody who's tried it out, and our audience is figuring it out quick, and everybody

779
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,480
raves about it that tries it.

780
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,400
It's so much more sturdy.

781
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,080
It figures out the routing so much better.

782
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,360
It handles DNS intelligently.

783
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,000
It works on all your devices.

784
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,200
I'm serious.

785
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,520
If you've got like five minutes to set aside, you could probably get it going on five devices.

786
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,600
It's like a minute per device.

787
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
It's ridiculous.

788
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,800
It's so quick to get it set up.

789
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,400
And for me now, I've got all my devices on one flat network with stable IP addresses.

790
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,760
So like, it's funny.

791
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,720
Sometimes their IP address will change on my local LAN, but their Tailscale IP, that's

792
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
the same.

793
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
You know?

794
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,120
My laptop's Tailscale IP, it's always the same.

795
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,200
I have it running on my VMs.

796
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
I have it running on my VPSs.

797
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,960
I have it running on my Raspberry Pis.

798
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,360
It makes it so easy to just get to those web dashboards, grab that data securely, or even

799
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,280
play a LAN game.

800
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
It's a lot of fun.

801
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,160
If you work in a business and you've got like a single sign-on system with two-factor, Tailscale

802
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,160
works great with that too.

803
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,200
So go try it for yourself for free up to 20 devices and support the show.

804
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,080
Go to tailscale.com slash coder.

805
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,920
All right, well, let's pick the mood back up.

806
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,860
We do have a couple of more boosts.

807
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,920
This is an extra recording, so there hasn't been much time.

808
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
Boost!

809
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,960
But Taki99 boosted in two days ago with a thousand SATs.

810
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,560
With the price of gas going crazy, do you think we'll see another round of work from

811
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
home?

812
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,280
I'm considering it.

813
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,240
So if you had a staffer that joined you or was working for you right now and said, hey,

814
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,000
gas is getting too expensive and I got to start working from home, I can't come into

815
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
the office every day, how would you respond to that?

816
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,300
Unfair question because I totally fold it.

817
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,380
Everybody works from home now.

818
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,280
I know, I know, but I'm just saying like say you just got this office like, you know, Futurecast,

819
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,300
you get this office, everybody starts driving there.

820
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,560
You decided to go forward with it.

821
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
But gas keeps going up.

822
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,320
Actually, you guys don't have it that bad in Florida.

823
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,160
I was just looking at the prices.

824
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,400
You don't have it anywhere nearly as bad as we do.

825
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
I'm sorry.

826
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,760
We don't have it that bad?

827
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
Yeah.

828
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
What are you paying?

829
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Six dollars.

830
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,800
We just hit about six dollars over here a gallon.

831
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Me?

832
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Where do you live?

833
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,560
The Soviet Republic of Washington state?

834
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
The West Coast.

835
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,360
The West Coast is literally the most expensive.

836
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,540
At least it's not California, I tell myself.

837
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,320
But if you look at triple A gas prices and you look at their map of.

838
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah, I paid, I got today, I paid 480.

839
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,360
I know you're in like the cheap area.

840
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,640
I'm looking at it.

841
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,640
That's cheap?

842
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,640
What are you nuts?

843
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,360
When I started driving, gas was like a buck eighty.

844
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,800
Oh, man, for just a brief moment in time when Junior was in office and I was driving, gas

845
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,520
was under a buck just for a brief moment in time.

846
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
So yeah.

847
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,440
Can we all just pour one out for W?

848
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,800
You go, so folks at home, if you go to gas prices dot triple A dot com.

849
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,200
What am I looking at right now?

850
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,280
This is triple A gas prices.

851
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,800
So it's 555, 555, effectively.

852
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Yeah, yeah.

853
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,720
In my county, it's 595, 594.

854
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
I've seen six.

855
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Dude.

856
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Yeah.

857
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,640
I thought you lived right near Alaska.

858
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,800
I heard you could see Russia from your friend's house.

859
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,960
Yeah, that's your other friend, Palin.

860
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,780
Yeah, but like I said, just be glad you're not in California because there's places where

861
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,740
it's seven bucks a gallon, six bucks a gallon in California now.

862
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,280
And I just want to say that Ron DeSantis.

863
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Is he going to lower gas prices?

864
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,400
Oh, he's really pissed off about the books of my kid's school.

865
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
I don't know.

866
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Oh, yeah.

867
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Yeah, yeah.

868
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
That is true.

869
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Back on task.

870
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
So you got this office.

871
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,120
You finally got this office again after the pandemic and everything.

872
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,560
And then somebody says, although if I'm in Washington state, I'm pretty sure I can't afford

873
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
this office.

874
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
But keep going.

875
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,560
Yeah.

876
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
No kidding, dude.

877
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
That's a lot of money.

878
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
You'd have to let them.

879
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
Right.

880
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,560
You'd have to let them work from home.

881
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
I'm going to derail you again.

882
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Lady Jubes.

883
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
Is that diesel?

884
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
No, thank God it's gas.

885
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
Thank God.

886
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Jeez.

887
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,600
Because diesel down here is crazy.

888
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:21,480
Diesel's like, although I don't know, relative to what God knows what it's crazy here.

889
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
Yeah.

890
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480
OK, OK, go on.

891
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,440
So if I got this office, you'd have to write, especially if you're in the West Coast.

892
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
Yeah, it's unaffordable.

893
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Right.

894
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,200
Either you'd have to subsidize them, raise their wages or do something.

895
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
It's unaffordable.

896
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,640
So I think I think tacky might be onto something here.

897
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,060
I think this could be another work from home boom.

898
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,960
If I was a, you know, small businessman whose business was commercial real estate, I would

899
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,760
be making lots of deals right now.

900
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
Right.

901
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,520
I would not be playing hardball because don't want to talk about it right now.

902
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:57,000
But I've been talking to a small startup that does development automation or not automation,

903
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,960
but development assistance and collaboration software for remote teams on Mac and Linux.

904
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,720
Ironically, not Windows, which I guess kind of makes sense.

905
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
In what world is business not using Windows?

906
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,380
I need to travel to this reality.

907
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,760
They say they're working on Windows, but Mac is so Mac is production ready.

908
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,520
Linux is like, do you want to be a trailblazer?

909
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,920
I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever.

910
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,240
If this stuff works, we're going to be doing a month pilot.

911
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,040
I actually don't think there's a real reason for the office.

912
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,320
I may eliminate my existing space.

913
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,320
Wow.

914
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,560
Which my landlord is a very aggressive, very gun toting Southern gentleman.

915
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
So there should be fun.

916
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,060
Does he have a mustache that he twirls?

917
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:41,800
He doesn't, but he's really, really mad about quote, all the millennials who don't think

918
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,280
they need an office.

919
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,520
Half the building is now vacant because people have defaulted or got out of business.

920
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
Maybe he's the common thread.

921
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,520
Did he think of that ever?

922
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
Right.

923
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
And I tried to make a deal with him.

924
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,600
Like, yo man, I'm kind of with you.

925
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,120
I want to make a deal, but you're not getting $22 a square foot.

926
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,720
So let's, let's, uh, maybe like 10.

927
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,720
He was like, you're insane and I said, cool.

928
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,720
Good luck with that.

929
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Yeah, really.

930
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
And that's how that conversation ended.

931
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:20,960
Ask not what your podcasts can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

932
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,760
Curled 37 boosted in three days ago with 2000 sats.

933
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,320
Our last boost today said, did Mike drop a bomb and never follow up?

934
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,200
I could have sworn he said he was getting married.

935
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Did that happen?

936
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,640
Is a congrats boost in order?

937
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:39,200
I am getting married on October the 21st and October wedding.

938
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Nice.

939
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,280
That's probably wonderful down there.

940
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
Yep.

941
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,280
Her name, her name is Mariah.

942
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,400
She's in fact, if you follow my Twitter, you've seen, you may have seen a picture of her and

943
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,960
I together today for the birthday.

944
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Good lady.

945
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,960
So, and, uh, as a step parent, cause this is code already was really a dad therapy session,

946
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
right?

947
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,760
We don't, we don't even talk about computers anymore.

948
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,480
Um, I'm stepping right up to the plate with a 14 year old stepdaughter because when you're,

949
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,080
when you're going to do it, you just go for it, you just go.

950
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,940
It's well, she's actually the only thing I don't like about my stepdaughter.

951
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,080
She doesn't listen to the show is tick tock.

952
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,080
I do not understand.

953
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,080
I know.

954
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,760
Can someone explain the allure of tick tock to me?

955
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,800
She shows me tech talks and I'm like, oh, well I guess that young woman is a talented

956
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
dancer.

957
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Kind of.

958
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,520
Why was that 10 seconds long?

959
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,320
Like if you're going to Dan, like if you're going to have a song, why would you not dance

960
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,180
to the full song?

961
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,880
You don't need to, you know, it's tick tock.

962
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,880
You get the idea.

963
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,280
Well, why don't we do tick tock?

964
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,820
It could just be me cursing at people I employ for like 10 seconds or like refusing to fill

965
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,080
out the tax forms, which is a more common problem than you think.

966
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,880
We'd be proper influencers.

967
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,440
Don't you want to be an influencer?

968
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
I want to be an influencer.

969
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,000
Come on, we could influence things.

970
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,120
I mean, does that get me more money?

971
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,400
Cause I like money.

972
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Yeah.

973
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,560
You get influencer sponsorships so you can influence people to buy their projects.

974
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,540
Would that get me a robe in blue, blue robe?

975
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,620
That's a good that blue robe.

976
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:22,840
We got a couple of thank you boosts, 500 sats from JT and 3690 sats from Cospeland.

977
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,600
They just, they just said thanks.

978
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
So you know what?

979
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,600
I say thanks to them.

980
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:31,840
If you'd like to send us a boost to go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com or

981
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:37,260
you can use the Breeze app at breez.technology and you don't have to switch podcast apps,

982
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,960
but you know, we're going to do a, I think that's just, we're going to kind of wrap it

983
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,840
up a little early so you can go celebrate your birthday.

984
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
Sure.

985
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
I don't care.

986
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
And we just recorded.

987
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,000
We got, if you didn't hear your feedback or your boost in this episode, be sure you caught

988
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
last week's episode.

989
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,140
Cause I tried to spread them out between the two shows.

990
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,920
And if you're a Coder QA member, we got some new features in the future that we're working

991
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,920
on for you.

992
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,720
You can go sign up at coderqa.co.

993
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
That's the membership for this show.

994
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,200
You can add free version of the show soon, a live version of the show, but also it's

995
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,600
just a nice way to support the show and keep us going.

996
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,600
Let's see.

997
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,320
Should we send anybody anywhere special for your gosh darn birthday?

998
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,880
You got any special wishes?

999
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
Yeah.

1000
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
You know what?

1001
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,220
Give a, you know, don't, don't do anything for my birthday.

1002
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:22,480
If you want to do something, go give like a buck to the covenant house or St. Jude or

1003
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
something.

1004
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,480
That's it.

1005
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,480
You can, you could write in there.

1006
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,680
This is from Mike remotely or something like that.

1007
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,680
Right?

1008
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,680
Like that.

1009
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,680
Don't even do that.

1010
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,680
Say it's from Jar Jar.

1011
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,680
Jar Jar is a f*****g angel.

1012
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,680
Yeah.

1013
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,680
We almost made it without him coming up for the whole episode.

1014
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
You were, you were this close.

1015
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,240
You were like right there.

1016
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
All right.

1017
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,440
So the, uh, the old podcast is at coder.show links for what we talked about today, coder.show

1018
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,680
slash four 71.

1019
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,440
Like that YouTube video, you can watch the live versions over at Jupiter dot tube.

1020
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,200
We stream live on Mondays usually, but we will not be live next Monday.

1021
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,560
Well actually, no, yes we will.

1022
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,560
Oh man.

1023
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,240
By the time you're hearing this, we're back.

1024
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,880
You time traveling sneaky.

1025
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
Yeah.

1026
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,280
No, we're, we're live next Monday.

1027
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,280
The following Monday I'm gone.

1028
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,280
Right.

1029
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,600
Wait, no, well we'll figure it out, but either way they'll be showing this up.

1030
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,600
It's great.

1031
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,600
Yeah.

1032
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
There are excess shows.

1033
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,600
Yeah.

1034
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
It's still going to be fine.

1035
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,200
But either way, if you just subscribe, you get it, but Jupiter out tube has it live.

1036
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,360
If it's live, by the way, we need to do a quarterly, but I know, I know that'll happen

1037
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,360
though.

1038
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,360
It'll happen.

1039
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,360
Thursday, Thursday.

1040
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,360
All right.

1041
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,360
See you back here soon.

1042
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:45,120
Take care.
