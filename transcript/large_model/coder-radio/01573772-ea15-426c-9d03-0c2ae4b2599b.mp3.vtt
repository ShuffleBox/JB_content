00:00.000 --> 00:15.800
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 455 for February 28, 2022.

00:15.800 --> 00:20.080
Hello there and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.080 --> 00:24.940
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.940 --> 00:28.980
My name is Chris and joining us every single month right there next to his microphone it's

00:28.980 --> 00:30.520
our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:30.520 --> 00:31.520
Hello Mike.

00:31.520 --> 00:32.520
What's up?

00:32.520 --> 00:34.000
Let's launch into KOTOR Radio.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Woo!

00:35.000 --> 00:37.420
Right, you and I are both here with our launch keyboards.

00:37.420 --> 00:38.420
That's right.

00:38.420 --> 00:41.920
I could hear you typing away to the chat room before we started.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.600
They do make a certain racket, don't they?

00:45.600 --> 00:46.600
I love it though.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.960
I love me the clacky keyboards, tell you what.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.720
Well, we got quite a bit of feedback.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.200
We touch on these topics sometimes that seem to resonate with people.

00:57.200 --> 01:02.160
Some of them make sense, like burnout, career decisions, and then every now and then we

01:02.160 --> 01:09.800
talk about things like blue and green message bubbles or cold hands, and then we just get

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
all the feedback.

01:10.800 --> 01:14.200
So I just thought I'd just super quickly get through some of that.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.360
Staying warm at your desk, we got a few suggestions.

01:16.360 --> 01:21.360
A few people recommended heat lamps, like the ones for food, but for your hands.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.360
I love it.

01:22.360 --> 01:23.360
Or heated gloves.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.080
It seems smart.

01:25.080 --> 01:28.480
The bearded tech said concerning cold hands, one thing that isn't talked about enough

01:28.480 --> 01:31.840
is sometimes cold hands can be a symptom of carpal tunnel syndrome.

01:31.840 --> 01:37.200
My fiance had surgery on both her hands and now she feels cold and hot, completely different

01:37.200 --> 01:39.400
than before.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.700
And then Tyler wrote in and mentioned that cold therapy also works, a little more difficult

01:43.700 --> 01:45.920
than gloves though.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.240
But the one that got the people stirred up last week was when you and I talked about

01:49.240 --> 01:56.320
Windows 11 accounts requiring a transition with yet another tier of Windows, now with

01:56.320 --> 02:01.240
Windows Pro, requiring everyone sign up with an online Microsoft account.

02:01.240 --> 02:04.640
Used to be just like home, but now they're expanding that and you and I had thoughts

02:04.640 --> 02:05.640
on that.

02:05.640 --> 02:12.740
Well, listener Mike R wrote in and he has written out a comprehensive workaround guide

02:12.740 --> 02:18.360
on GitHub and I skimmed through it and it essentially involves tricking the installer

02:18.360 --> 02:23.840
by not connecting to any networking, so don't join a Wi-Fi network, unplug it from Ethernet

02:23.840 --> 02:27.320
and then when you get to a certain point in the installer, you can invoke a console and

02:27.320 --> 02:32.400
then following his guide, in about five, 10 seconds bypass the whole online account required

02:32.400 --> 02:33.400
thing.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.680
Assuming Microsoft leaves that little workaround open, but he's got a great guide.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.560
So there you go, problem solved, Mike.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.560
I love it.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.560
Yeah.

02:41.560 --> 02:42.560
I'm sure you'll be doing this from now on.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.560
I mean, you may have to.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.040
I may have to actually.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.800
I'll put a link in the show notes.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.920
Apparently listener Mike knows how to write up a guide because he has put together a hell

02:50.920 --> 02:53.280
of a guide for people getting the deck.

02:53.280 --> 02:57.320
He himself is a game dev, he's heading down to the game developers conference and he wanted

02:57.320 --> 03:01.360
to put together a guide for other developers who might want to target the platform, so

03:01.360 --> 03:03.300
we have that in the show notes too.

03:03.300 --> 03:08.000
If you're just kind of interested in the Steam Deck though, it's worth checking out.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.560
Like I said, Mike R knows how to write a guide.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.840
I was to say, have you gotten your hands on a deck?

03:12.840 --> 03:16.560
No, I guess I must have been like an hour late.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.200
I ordered pretty soon after the news was live, but I was out and about.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.520
So I think I'm going to probably be in the next batch or so, which I'm fine with.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.040
Yeah, I'm in like batch 17, so I'm screwed.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.060
I don't really, I'm not in a rush.

03:28.060 --> 03:35.160
I figure, you know, if it's going to be out to developers now, then by the time I get

03:35.160 --> 03:37.720
it, there'll probably be some bug fixes and stuff.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.000
Things will have been polished.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
True.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.440
I'm pretty happy with the Oculus right now anyways, so I don't really need a new toy.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.440
Oh, we'll get there.

03:44.440 --> 03:45.440
Oh, we'll get there.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.200
Speaking of clearing the deck, how about this?

03:48.200 --> 03:49.760
Brace yourself.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.000
Listener Egon wrote in.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.600
Like Voldemort, he's back.

03:52.600 --> 03:57.760
He's back and he said, recently you talked about listener Casey from Austria who has

03:57.760 --> 03:58.760
an issue.

03:58.760 --> 04:03.080
He says, I suggest that he teams up with me, a fellow Austrian freelancer that is specializing

04:03.080 --> 04:07.560
in service and hosting solutions, and he thinks maybe doing some networking would be great.

04:07.560 --> 04:11.840
So if listener Casey is interested in talking to listener Egon, email me, I'll make a little

04:11.840 --> 04:13.300
magic happen.

04:13.300 --> 04:17.880
This is a special occurrence, and this is why actually Egon's email made it on air.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.840
You see, when Egon writes into the show, it's a special occasion.

04:21.840 --> 04:30.280
Our first email from Egon came in Dakota radio on Wednesday, September 22nd, 2012.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.280
Can you believe that?

04:31.280 --> 04:32.280
It was glorious.

04:32.280 --> 04:39.400
I mean, that's a while ago, September 26th, it was like our 12th episode or something

04:39.400 --> 04:40.400
like that.

04:40.400 --> 04:45.800
But my absolute favorite email from listener Egon so far, I mean, other than the times

04:45.800 --> 04:52.720
we got in trouble, has to be when he wrote in on September 22nd, 2014, obviously responding

04:52.720 --> 04:56.400
to something you said, although I've completely forgotten the context, and he writes, Dear

04:56.400 --> 05:00.320
Mike and Chris, Mike has falsely proclaimed the end of private nudes.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.720
I have come to the rescue of that achievement of civilization for the 20th century.

05:04.720 --> 05:08.000
This is how one can still accomplish private nudes.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.880
Step one, buy a device that can take pictures but is not attached to a phone or any network.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.220
We used to call these digital cameras.

05:15.220 --> 05:18.460
Step two, take the nudes as you prefer them.

05:18.460 --> 05:23.520
Step three, save the data on non cloud storage, maybe a USB thumb drive.

05:23.520 --> 05:29.680
And step four, if you prefer to send the nudes to someone, put the storage card in an envelope.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.960
Love the show, Egon.

05:32.960 --> 05:37.360
That never made it on air, but that is some solid advice right there.

05:37.360 --> 05:42.480
Still applicable, you know, from 2014, still works in 2022.

05:42.480 --> 05:46.920
It does, depending on the level of malware the recipient's computer has on it that's

05:46.920 --> 05:51.160
going to copy that drive and upload it to wherever.

05:51.160 --> 05:55.840
But yes, coins to Egon, that is a lot of effort.

05:55.840 --> 05:56.840
That's true.

05:56.840 --> 05:57.840
Yeah.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.280
You know, the problem is, is you don't know what they're going to do on the other end

06:00.280 --> 06:03.520
that you're right, because it's more and more likely that they would just throw it into

06:03.520 --> 06:06.480
some sort of photo program that auto clouds them.

06:06.480 --> 06:10.740
Or like they'll open it and not realize they have like Dropbox running that just syncs

06:10.740 --> 06:12.960
everything right or Google Drive or something crazy like that.

06:12.960 --> 06:17.920
I just appreciate A, that Egon's been writing in for so long and B, that he clearly had

06:17.920 --> 06:20.000
given thought to that process.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.880
I don't know why I could make some assumptions.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.440
And then C felt like he was comfortable enough sharing it with us.

06:25.440 --> 06:29.800
And then it sits in our inbox since 2014.

06:29.800 --> 06:30.800
For eight years.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.800
Yes.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.800
Isn't that amazing?

06:32.800 --> 06:35.080
I mean, there's just something special about that.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.920
That's the Coder Radio Miracle, so if you'd like to have your email sit in our inbox for

06:37.920 --> 06:40.320
a while, we do eventually get to them.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.160
Coder dot show slash contact.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.920
We love getting your emails.

06:43.920 --> 06:50.040
Also something I've been meaning to do more is people are sending us boostagrams.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.720
And I know that you probably don't know what I'm talking about, do you?

06:52.720 --> 06:54.100
No idea.

06:54.100 --> 06:59.640
So there is a kind of a new generation of podcast apps, new podcast apps dot com.

06:59.640 --> 07:04.380
There's a movement, I should back up, there is a movement out there to keep podcasting

07:04.380 --> 07:08.840
decentralized and define a whole new set of features that's done in an open standard kind

07:08.840 --> 07:09.840
of way.

07:09.840 --> 07:16.140
And one of the great features of this new system is listeners while listening to a podcast

07:16.140 --> 07:20.960
can send a boost, which is kind of like equivalent to a YouTube super chat, but there's no middleman.

07:20.960 --> 07:24.860
There's no like PayPal that takes a cut or can stop a payment.

07:24.860 --> 07:25.860
It's really great.

07:25.860 --> 07:30.200
And people listening to this show while they're listening will say something and they'll send

07:30.200 --> 07:31.200
us a boost.

07:31.200 --> 07:38.280
Dave Jones sent us 500 sats and he said the only way to fully learn rust is a brainstem

07:38.280 --> 07:41.520
tap that can just put the information directly into your brain.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.800
He says that's the only way to learn all of rust and we must have said something about

07:44.800 --> 07:47.680
rust and so Dave sent that into the show while we were talking about it.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.160
I also happen to know that Dave works on a backend rust application.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.960
I love it.

07:52.960 --> 07:53.960
Yeah.

07:53.960 --> 07:54.960
Yeah.

07:54.960 --> 07:59.200
Also, he had to note that we talked about cumulative updates on last week's episode

07:59.200 --> 08:02.800
and he said that they are the bane of a sysadmin's existence.

08:02.800 --> 08:08.040
He writes, I prefer periodic monolithic updates that bring things current so there's a recent

08:08.040 --> 08:09.040
baseline.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.040
There you go.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.040
So there you go.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.960
So if you want to send us a boost, you can get a new podcast app and it's all in there

08:13.960 --> 08:15.000
and send them into the show.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
They come in live too.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.420
That's the other cool thing is as people are listening to them, they come into the show.

08:20.420 --> 08:26.780
So I have this front end that Dave Jones has written that sits and connects back to his

08:26.780 --> 08:31.960
rust backend and it pulls in the boost as people send them so I can see when people

08:31.960 --> 08:35.720
are listening because it includes the episode that they're listening to, their name if they

08:35.720 --> 08:39.620
choose to include it and a brief message if they choose to include it and it comes in

08:39.620 --> 08:42.120
right there on that dashboard in real time.

08:42.120 --> 08:46.580
So it's pretty rad and we've talked a little bit more about it in Linux Unplugged if people

08:46.580 --> 08:52.280
are totally lost but just go to newpodcastapps.com and figure it out.

08:52.280 --> 08:57.840
Linode.com slash coder, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and go there

08:57.840 --> 09:01.600
to use the hosting and cloud provider that we use for everything we've built in the last

09:01.600 --> 09:02.960
two and a half years.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.440
And I just noticed some new rigs that we deployed recently have MVME storage.

09:07.440 --> 09:13.520
This is brand new game changing PCI fast storage that Linode has been rolling out.

09:13.520 --> 09:17.480
If you've got a project you want to test, something you want to learn or something you

09:17.480 --> 09:22.260
want to put in production for a couple of people or millions of people, Linode has a

09:22.260 --> 09:24.600
the right solution for you.

09:24.600 --> 09:28.720
Their systems are screaming fast and they have 11 data centers around the world.

09:28.720 --> 09:35.000
They are their own ISP and recently they're now with Akamai and taking things to the next

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
level.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.560
And I think you're going to love the interface.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.160
Nobody quite does it like Linode.

09:40.160 --> 09:44.000
It seems like at some point all of the cloud providers decided to make these really kind

09:44.000 --> 09:49.640
of esoteric unique dashboards that were part of their brand instead of just building something

09:49.640 --> 09:54.480
that is clean, elegant and functional, which then would be a reflection of the brand, right?

09:54.480 --> 09:57.040
Which is exactly they're at Linode with.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.520
That's the kind of experience they have though.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.120
They know how to do this kind of stuff.

10:00.120 --> 10:04.360
Their command line client is extremely handy and their website, when you log in, it gives

10:04.360 --> 10:09.240
you, you click on your Linode, it gives you the information you need right away to immediately

10:09.240 --> 10:11.880
start assessing the state of your system.

10:11.880 --> 10:16.000
Just brilliantly done, nice and simple.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Gives you what you need.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.080
You get in, you get action.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.120
It's great.

10:19.120 --> 10:22.160
Every time I spin up a Linode, I make sure I attach my SSH keys.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.840
I make sure it's part of the backup program.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.200
I can do all of that stuff in seconds.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.320
It makes provisioning infrastructure for us.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.260
Well, it's a foregone conclusion.

10:30.260 --> 10:31.920
That's how we're going to provision it.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.960
You know, it's just so great, so reliable.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.040
I look at what's out there.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.280
Nothing competes.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.880
Go try it out and really see for yourself.

10:39.880 --> 10:43.080
I mean, with a hundred dollars, you can really form a solid opinion.

10:43.080 --> 10:46.440
I think that says something about Linode's confidence and how much you're going to like

10:46.440 --> 10:47.440
it.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.400
Go to linode.com slash coder.

10:49.400 --> 10:54.440
Get that $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the show.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.040
Linode.com slash coder.

10:57.040 --> 11:01.920
Here's a bit of a spicy take for you.

11:01.920 --> 11:06.500
Everybody should just shut up and accept the fact that Win32 is the actual stable Linux

11:06.500 --> 11:10.320
user land ABI and deal with the consequences.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.320
Wow.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.320
Okay.

11:12.320 --> 11:18.000
This is a post that was inspired by a developer after the Steam Deck came out.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Okay.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.600
Their argument is that Valve is pushing everyone to use Proton as a runtime.

11:24.600 --> 11:28.880
Even games that have Linux compatibility, Valve has pushed them that direction.

11:28.880 --> 11:33.680
And when you look at all of the distribution fragmentation, all of the toolkit fragmentation,

11:33.680 --> 11:38.040
the kernel fragmentation, the fact that the LSB really doesn't solve the problem, free

11:38.040 --> 11:43.520
desktop doesn't cover enough, you look at what it would take to ship a large scale commercial

11:43.520 --> 11:45.680
application on Linux.

11:45.680 --> 11:49.400
And their argument is just release your Windows app on Proton.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.680
So like any sentence that begins with just do whatever, right, is-

11:52.680 --> 11:53.680
Come on, man.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.680
Just do it.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.680
Yeah.

11:55.680 --> 12:02.840
I will definitely say if you had just said games, I might be more like, yeah, of course,

12:02.840 --> 12:05.440
because I play lots of Windows games on Linux.

12:05.440 --> 12:11.960
I recently acquired Rogue Legacy 2, great sequel to the already great Rogue Legacy,

12:11.960 --> 12:17.480
and it is a Windows game, not even Mac support, and I play it on my POP machine.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.480
It's great.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.440
Via Proton, obviously.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.560
So that's cool, right?

12:22.560 --> 12:23.560
That's good.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.120
See, the problem with desktops is you're going to have to have controls and they're probably

12:27.120 --> 12:32.480
going to look like crap on the system in terms of desktop apps, right?

12:32.480 --> 12:35.220
Not just games, desktop programs.

12:35.220 --> 12:39.720
And while I'm sure it's possible to run your line of business application on this, I feel

12:39.720 --> 12:48.440
like the answer for this in most line of business senses exists, and that answer is called Electron.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.200
And it's fine.

12:50.200 --> 12:56.360
I mean, we're doing this whole podcast on a web-based application, which could easily

12:56.360 --> 13:01.900
be wrapped in an Electron wrapper and distributed as a dock icon app.

13:01.900 --> 13:11.080
So I don't know that it would make a lot of sense for anybody to take any non-game application,

13:11.080 --> 13:13.600
specifically target Linux via Proton with it.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.680
That just seems kind of weird to me.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.640
I'll take the other side of this one then.

13:17.640 --> 13:21.360
I mean, as a Linux user, I kind of would hate to see this.

13:21.360 --> 13:26.200
I prefer desktop apps that look like they belong on my desktop.

13:26.200 --> 13:32.400
However, I also have to acknowledge that 20 years into this thing, Linux has failed as

13:32.400 --> 13:38.180
a quote-unquote collective to deliver essentially a stable desktop ABI that developers could

13:38.180 --> 13:45.780
be targeting in terms of toolkit and language and APIs and all of it.

13:45.780 --> 13:48.120
Not just the kernel ABI, but all of it.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.080
It just really hasn't materialized yet, despite some of the better efforts out there that

13:51.080 --> 13:52.320
come and go.

13:52.320 --> 14:00.940
And when I look at something like, say, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere and Photoshop,

14:00.940 --> 14:05.840
or something of that complicated nature, I could see where it makes a lot of sense.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.760
I agree with your take.

14:07.760 --> 14:11.480
If it's a new app that's being created, if it's something that already exists as a web

14:11.480 --> 14:14.780
app, it just doesn't make sense to ship the Windows version when you could just ship the

14:14.780 --> 14:16.160
Electron version.

14:16.160 --> 14:20.500
But if it's something that's pre-existing, a large enterprise application or something

14:20.500 --> 14:24.760
like one of the Adobe Suite applications, I kind of think it makes a lot of sense because

14:24.760 --> 14:28.720
Valve is very dedicated to keeping that thing alive.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.160
They've hired developers.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.480
Is Valve going to chase incompatibilities with updates to Photoshop?

14:33.480 --> 14:35.680
No, but that's the beautiful thing.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.000
You just do what Valve did.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
You hire a developer.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.920
I mean, Valve hired a handful of really skilled developers to turn this thing into something

14:42.920 --> 14:44.640
they can ship a product on.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.740
Adobe could do the same.

14:45.740 --> 14:49.980
It's all open source, and they would build on top of what Valve has graded for them.

14:49.980 --> 14:51.020
Adobe's not going to do that.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.360
You see where their investment already is.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.360
It's in web apps, right?

14:54.360 --> 14:57.280
Yeah, there's just no reason for them to do it, right?

14:57.280 --> 15:01.280
The only reason they would do it is if they had enough Creative Cloud users who were demanding

15:01.280 --> 15:04.440
it, but they don't even have a Creative Cloud client for Linux as far as I know.

15:04.440 --> 15:09.560
And even then, they just hire a few more TypeScript developers and go to town in the web version.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.560
Maybe.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.560
Maybe.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.680
I mean, there's no good business case for this because if you have a legacy Windows

15:13.680 --> 15:20.480
application, unless it's a real easy, you know, pop it over to Proton and it's fine,

15:20.480 --> 15:24.120
it's probably not going to be something you're really invested in doing.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.860
And the other side of that is, okay, then once you release it, you have to support it.

15:27.860 --> 15:32.960
And shops that have Win32 apps, first of all, the world of Win32 apps, we're talking a lot

15:32.960 --> 15:36.840
of Battleship Gray line of business applications here.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.840
These folks are not like moving to Linux.

15:39.840 --> 15:44.080
And frankly, if they are, they just bought like VMware Workstation and run them on there,

15:44.080 --> 15:47.280
just like their users who use Mac run parallels or something.

15:47.280 --> 15:52.760
This is like a problem that's on the legacy and being solved by VMs or people just simply

15:52.760 --> 15:54.400
running Windows.

15:54.400 --> 16:03.200
And in the future, I mean, Electron, man, it's such a small percentage of non-game users

16:03.200 --> 16:07.360
that are needing Linux applications, especially if we're talking about stuff that's still

16:07.360 --> 16:08.360
Win32.

16:08.360 --> 16:16.760
You're automatically talking basically older, more mature applications in a business environment.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.040
So I don't know.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.040
Is that possible?

16:20.040 --> 16:21.040
Sure.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.040
Right.

16:22.040 --> 16:28.120
It makes sense if there was a user demand, and I think that's the core of your argument

16:28.120 --> 16:32.280
is there's really no, there's no business case, there's no user demand for this.

16:32.280 --> 16:35.120
And for new applications being developed, you just wouldn't go this route where you're

16:35.120 --> 16:39.160
going to create a user base or you maybe have a service, a web based service or software

16:39.160 --> 16:40.160
as a service.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.160
It just does.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.160
This doesn't make sense.

16:42.160 --> 16:47.840
While I could see maybe a handful of applications over the next 10 years take advantage of this

16:47.840 --> 16:53.720
really great wine stack that has been created here and the wine project is better, is healthier

16:53.720 --> 16:55.080
and better than ever.

16:55.080 --> 17:00.160
I could see some people doing that, but not at scale, not, not, not like Adobe, not anything

17:00.160 --> 17:01.520
massive like that.

17:01.520 --> 17:07.000
I think it is just a little bodacious, maybe windbaggy to come out and say, ah, just forget

17:07.000 --> 17:11.760
everything else and just go with the windows ABI and then use it on top of Linux.

17:11.760 --> 17:15.880
Because the reality is that over time, the Linux desktop is getting more and more attractive.

17:15.880 --> 17:19.240
I know this is an old tune, but you know what?

17:19.240 --> 17:24.000
I look at what the GNOME desktop guys are doing and cows and I look at GTK four and,

17:24.000 --> 17:29.120
and, and the stack that they're creating there and it's starting to make a lot of sense to

17:29.120 --> 17:30.120
me.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.120
I can see what they're trying to build.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.120
Yeah, for sure.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.480
I mean, there are different customers for different things, right?

17:34.480 --> 17:36.480
And that's ultimately what it's going to come down to.

17:36.480 --> 17:41.040
Like your, your line of business, you know, small to mid tier company that's just doing

17:41.040 --> 17:45.600
LOB apps is probably almost all doing web apps now if they're doing new development.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.600
Yeah.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.480
Unless there's like some weird case where they're like tablet kiosks and there are like

17:49.480 --> 17:52.680
cases where it doesn't make sense or they have to integrate with some like machine or

17:52.680 --> 17:54.280
piece of hardware.

17:54.280 --> 17:58.880
But certainly using some of the new sexy stuff, particularly in KDE or some of the new GNOME

17:58.880 --> 18:03.920
stuff, you could have, I could see like someone trying to become the rogue Amoeba or panic

18:03.920 --> 18:05.720
of the Linux world.

18:05.720 --> 18:08.960
It's just, that's a tough road to hoe, but it's also tough on Mac these days anyway.

18:08.960 --> 18:09.960
So I don't know.

18:09.960 --> 18:10.960
Yeah.

18:10.960 --> 18:11.960
Yeah.

18:11.960 --> 18:12.960
I suppose so.

18:12.960 --> 18:17.680
This is my life as a Linux user is things get pretty good and then I make some move

18:17.680 --> 18:20.480
where I'm out on the fringe all over again.

18:20.480 --> 18:24.480
And I can definitely feel that happening with ARM and Linux.

18:24.480 --> 18:27.000
I have a lot more ARM Linux systems now.

18:27.000 --> 18:36.640
I have way too many raspberry pies and on my M1 MacBook Max, I have two or three VMs,

18:36.640 --> 18:45.120
really two VMs that I use on the regular that are Linux, that are ARM Linux and that I love.

18:45.120 --> 18:50.720
It's exceptionally good, but it has even less application compatibility.

18:50.720 --> 18:58.380
And it is, I mean, I think there are actually ways to run 64 bit wine apps on ARM Linux,

18:58.380 --> 19:01.120
but it's a hell of a journey and it's brutally slow.

19:01.120 --> 19:07.720
And it's funny just because I see today that a ThinkPad X13 was announced with a snap dragon

19:07.720 --> 19:10.800
CPU in it and 165 Hertz screen.

19:10.800 --> 19:17.320
And they're saying 25 hour battery life, they're saying 60% better performance to energy efficiency

19:17.320 --> 19:20.040
when compiling software than on X86, right?

19:20.040 --> 19:27.200
They're like making some really attractive claims, 2.3 pounds, kind of a new look too.

19:27.200 --> 19:32.440
They say battery life so long you can leave the charger at home, but the software experience

19:32.440 --> 19:34.840
is just not going to be great.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.760
It's not going to be good.

19:36.760 --> 19:43.380
And I mean, what do you figure, Mike, at best, this thing, which doesn't even ship till May,

19:43.380 --> 19:47.920
is probably going to clock somewhere between the MacBook Air M1 that shipped last year

19:47.920 --> 19:50.120
and the new MacBooks, right?

19:50.120 --> 19:54.760
It's going to be, it's not even going to be like, it may not even be as fast as an M1

19:54.760 --> 19:56.480
released a year ago.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.920
And I think there are going to be so many caveats and edge cases where things you actually

19:59.920 --> 20:03.720
want to do as a Windows user are going to be a challenge.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.400
It's a whole different ecosystem, right?

20:05.400 --> 20:09.980
Microsoft has so many different ways to develop applications for their stuff that I'm not

20:09.980 --> 20:12.600
totally convinced that they could pull off a Rosetta 2.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.100
And I don't think they're saying they can.

20:15.100 --> 20:18.260
There is 64-bit compatibility, but it's just nowhere as fast.

20:18.260 --> 20:23.080
How do you define performance on a fair benchmark where it's a native binary for the platform?

20:23.080 --> 20:24.080
Who cares?

20:24.080 --> 20:27.160
Because even on the Mac side of things, almost nobody is running ARM applications.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.760
Well, you really can't tell for the most case.

20:29.760 --> 20:33.640
Yeah, you can't tell until you lean your arm on the arrow key.

20:33.640 --> 20:34.640
It makes arrow noises.

20:34.640 --> 20:35.640
Yeah, we'll see.

20:35.640 --> 20:39.920
I mean, and for me, I actually think the situation is better on the Linux desktop than it is

20:39.920 --> 20:42.840
on Windows, although I do not have a lot of comparison experience.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.120
So that's a full acknowledgement.

20:44.120 --> 20:50.640
But I am very impressed with there are multiple distros now where I can just download an ISO

20:50.640 --> 20:52.640
image like you would for any PC.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.280
And it's just the ARM ISO image.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.640
You install it, you really have no idea you're on ARM.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.560
There's lots of applications in the repo.

20:59.560 --> 21:02.800
Anything that's really free software and open source is available to install.

21:02.800 --> 21:07.440
It's you get to the proprietary apps, those places where maybe they offer an RPM or a

21:07.440 --> 21:10.880
deb for download, you know, for their weird app.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.960
None of them, for the most part, have ARM builds.

21:13.960 --> 21:14.960
So that gets pretty bad.

21:14.960 --> 21:15.960
Pretty sketch quick.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.760
It's going to be a hard row the toe.

21:18.760 --> 21:19.760
Is that it?

21:19.760 --> 21:20.760
It's hard total.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.120
Is it a is a rowing that's happening?

21:22.120 --> 21:23.120
That's hard.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.600
I never actually understood that analogy.

21:24.600 --> 21:30.000
Probably should have gone with something else.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.040
Datadog.com slash coder radio.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.040
Yeah, that's right.

21:33.040 --> 21:38.240
Datadog.com slash coder radio is where you go to get a free trial for two weeks and a

21:38.240 --> 21:39.560
data dog t shirt.

21:39.560 --> 21:45.320
Now, Datadog is a software as a service monitoring and security platform that enables full stack

21:45.320 --> 21:50.740
observability for developers, IT ops, security professionals, business teams, really anyone

21:50.740 --> 21:52.960
that's working in the cloud age now.

21:52.960 --> 21:57.800
Now along with Datadog's five hundred plus vendor backed integrations, you can correlate

21:57.800 --> 22:03.500
your metrics, your application logs, traces, security signals, anything from your infrastructure,

22:03.500 --> 22:08.360
your third party services, and you bring it all into a single pane of beautiful glass.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.840
And what I'm talking about is the dashboard.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.080
It's great.

22:12.080 --> 22:16.280
And these capabilities combined with their drag and drop dashboard, it's like next level

22:16.280 --> 22:17.280
stuff.

22:17.280 --> 22:21.640
And Datadog also on top of that offers machine learning based alerts to help teams troubleshoot

22:21.640 --> 22:23.520
and collaborate more effectively.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.160
Well, that's going to prevent downtime.

22:25.160 --> 22:29.520
It's going to enhance performance, reliability and communication.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.760
This is serious stuff.

22:30.760 --> 22:31.920
It's really going to make an impact.

22:31.920 --> 22:34.760
So we've got an exclusive offer for Coder Radio listeners.

22:34.760 --> 22:39.240
Go sign up for a free two week trial at Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.500
It's Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

22:41.500 --> 22:47.920
When you go there, you get the two week free trial and a Datadog t-shirt at Datadog.com

22:47.920 --> 22:51.720
slash Coder Radio.

22:51.720 --> 22:53.960
I don't think we got to talk about this a lot because I can tell what you want to talk

22:53.960 --> 22:55.000
about is your Oculus.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
I can tell.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
I know.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Feel it.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Yeah, I can feel it.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.280
But, you know, when you and I get something right, every noun that I'm compelled to just

23:02.280 --> 23:08.000
point it out a little bit because I think we nailed that, that whole Activision, Blizzard,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.600
Microsoft acquisition, the whole Vulture circling situation.

23:11.600 --> 23:18.120
So it looks like that, in my opinion, controversial CEO Bobby Cocktick or whatever his name was,

23:18.120 --> 23:19.120
Cocktick.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.120
I think it's Codick.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.120
OK, sure.

23:21.120 --> 23:26.480
He is going to get a nice big fat 15 million dollar golden parachute payout.

23:26.480 --> 23:32.400
It looks like he just had like had some benchmarks to achieve for like improving culture.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.400
And this is all coming from some SEC filings from Microsoft.

23:35.400 --> 23:39.800
It reveals in there that they figured out, you know, if he reaches these benchmarks,

23:39.800 --> 23:43.120
the Activision board agrees, he gets more of a payout.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.240
In fact, it's not just him.

23:45.240 --> 23:52.800
All the top execs are getting a larger payout as a result of the cleaning up of the culture.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.720
OK, short translation.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.220
This is a payout.

23:57.220 --> 24:02.840
So the CEO and the other top execs didn't dig their hooves in to stop the acquisition.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.760
They had to put that there was some metric to make it, you know, kosher.

24:05.760 --> 24:10.440
But that's, yeah, Bobby, Bobby Codick wasn't leaving without a golden parachute.

24:10.440 --> 24:15.320
And, you know, it's, you know, the Wall Street Journal story came out three days later.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.280
Phil Spencer's like, hey, man, what's up?

24:17.280 --> 24:19.320
It's so obvious what happened here.

24:19.320 --> 24:24.160
It's almost like, yeah, you want the guy to give up his company that he wants a significant

24:24.160 --> 24:30.040
stake in and, you know, if he really throws a fit, he could probably not be forced out

24:30.040 --> 24:31.480
or at least maybe legally he could.

24:31.480 --> 24:37.200
But, you know, these these boards of directors and CEOs are always usually fairly friendly.

24:37.200 --> 24:40.780
So I don't know, unless you can get like a Bill Atkins in there to cause trouble.

24:40.780 --> 24:44.560
But even then, he'd be one board member and he'd have to like do a Bill Atkins, a hedge

24:44.560 --> 24:48.000
fund guy who likes to go on crusades.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.640
But sometimes he does, sometimes he's the guy who tried to put a Herbalife out of business.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.480
But this is like, I don't know, this dude was always going to get a lot of money from

24:55.480 --> 24:59.320
Microsoft and Microsoft is still going to make a ton of money just by buying them.

24:59.320 --> 25:01.760
So everybody wins except for the employees.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.320
I got numbers on that here in a second.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.280
But I also thought this was interesting.

25:05.280 --> 25:10.680
The chief creative officer of King that they brought over when Activision Blizzard acquired

25:10.680 --> 25:15.640
Candy Crush, he's quietly leaving along with the president they brought over.

25:15.640 --> 25:19.040
Their reasons, both of them, they gave for their departure is to spend more time with

25:19.040 --> 25:20.040
family.

25:20.040 --> 25:24.160
Oh, yes, because all the people who make it to that level in their career want to spend

25:24.160 --> 25:25.160
more time with their family.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.160
Gotcha.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.600
There's also an interesting little thing in this SEC filing.

25:28.600 --> 25:31.300
No more details other than this.

25:31.300 --> 25:40.800
An unnamed individual made a big play to acquire Blizzard and the board gave it some thought,

25:40.800 --> 25:45.600
but they slow walked the whole process hoping Microsoft would finish up because their quote

25:45.600 --> 25:52.760
prior dealings and quote with that individual raised concerns about them leaking.

25:52.760 --> 25:57.000
No idea who this could be, but it sounds like there was somebody else bidding at the same

25:57.000 --> 25:59.720
time, but they they didn't trust them.

25:59.720 --> 26:05.040
So they they intentionally quote slow walked the process to give Microsoft time to get

26:05.040 --> 26:06.520
their bureaucratic act together.

26:06.520 --> 26:07.520
Yeah.

26:07.520 --> 26:12.280
And also, this is a pretty sweet deal for for the shareholders of Activision, granted

26:12.280 --> 26:16.080
what was very likely to be a huge problem for them, right?

26:16.080 --> 26:20.480
And you know, it's funny, like a Kotaku, like those kind of gaming sites are still covering

26:20.480 --> 26:23.040
some of the crap that went on over there.

26:23.040 --> 26:30.040
But I feel like the glow of the wonderfulness that is Satya Nadella and just like the Microsoft's

26:30.040 --> 26:35.120
like very good reputation on all this culture stuff has it's kind of worked.

26:35.120 --> 26:38.400
Don't you don't you feel that it's kind of like washed a lot of sins away, at least in

26:38.400 --> 26:41.200
terms of like they're not getting attacked.

26:41.200 --> 26:45.840
Like I think if they didn't get bought by Microsoft, they would still be getting savaged

26:45.840 --> 26:46.840
in the press.

26:46.840 --> 26:51.980
Yeah, I think the two CEO transition from Gates to Balmer to Satya has helped with some

26:51.980 --> 26:52.980
of that, too.

26:52.980 --> 26:53.980
Right.

26:53.980 --> 26:54.980
And right.

26:54.980 --> 26:57.560
And to be clear, they deserve all the crap they were getting for sure.

26:57.560 --> 27:01.240
There's no there's no like this isn't, you know, Mike being anti woke.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.240
This is.

27:02.240 --> 27:06.560
In fact, it's a little sick that this dude is getting so much money, but there was no

27:06.560 --> 27:08.120
way you had to pay him off.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.160
There was no way that all these they would pay them just to keep them quiet.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.640
Quiet and just help smooth this thing over.

27:13.640 --> 27:17.280
OK, so the transition they can leave in six months and still get their money.

27:17.280 --> 27:21.880
That never happens that short.

27:21.880 --> 27:26.300
Talk to the poor Instagram guys who suffered at Facebook for, you know, it's as far as

27:26.300 --> 27:27.300
I know.

27:27.300 --> 27:30.320
I have very limited experience, but as far as I know, based on what I've been told by

27:30.320 --> 27:33.480
lawyers and from what we've just observed, it's usually two years.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.480
It can be a year.

27:34.480 --> 27:40.880
Sometimes it's usually at least a full year from the completion of the acquisition.

27:40.880 --> 27:46.440
But if the let's say if you if you're the acquirer and you think the personality perhaps

27:46.440 --> 27:51.200
or the behavior of the founders was and Bobby Kodak's kind of a founder because he like

27:51.200 --> 27:55.840
bought it out of bankruptcy is the problem, then you might, you know, I don't know.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.280
I feel like this was the worst kept secret in the whole industry.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.280
Isn't it funny?

28:00.280 --> 28:04.600
OK, so according to the same filing with the SEC, long term revenue estimates prepared

28:04.600 --> 28:11.460
in November indicate that Activision Blizzard expects a dramatic nearly two point five billion

28:11.460 --> 28:15.320
dollar revenue increase in 2013.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.880
So Microsoft bought at the right time.

28:16.880 --> 28:23.440
Yeah, well, Diablo four overwatch two and there is an unnamed Warcraft property, isn't

28:23.440 --> 28:24.440
there?

28:24.440 --> 28:25.440
Oh, of course.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.440
Yeah.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.680
So this is a very savvy move by Microsoft.

28:28.680 --> 28:32.720
I stand by my original assessment that this is really going to create the Disney of video

28:32.720 --> 28:33.720
games because they're not done.

28:33.720 --> 28:35.800
They're not going to just stop.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.920
They're not just like, OK, we got enough games now.

28:39.920 --> 28:45.080
I sort of feel like like as people are like drooling over like the 15 million that Kodak's

28:45.080 --> 28:46.080
getting ice.

28:46.080 --> 28:49.760
I kind of think Microsoft got a really sweet deal here.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.080
Long term, no doubt about it.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.480
No doubt about it.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.880
It's not just owning the properties.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.720
It's been able to license the streaming and all of that.

28:56.720 --> 28:57.720
This is going to pay.

28:57.720 --> 29:03.280
It's funny because now, you know, I have a PS5 and I have an Xbox S. That's the little

29:03.280 --> 29:04.280
one.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.280
I think it's.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.280
Yeah.

29:06.280 --> 29:07.280
You know, the graphical difference is pretty significant.

29:07.280 --> 29:10.120
It's not huge, but like I'm certain games can definitely tell.

29:10.120 --> 29:16.400
And I'm like, well, although with the Xbox as I don't really buy games anymore because

29:16.400 --> 29:22.760
I have a game pass and I will just wait until the game inevitably becomes a Microsoft property.

29:22.760 --> 29:27.700
I mean, yeah, it's like with Google, you wait till they kill a product with Microsoft.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.160
You just wait till they buy that product.

29:29.160 --> 29:32.280
Oh, is it time to mention Google Google Wave again?

29:32.280 --> 29:33.280
There it is.

29:33.280 --> 29:34.840
There it is.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.000
Nicely done.

29:36.000 --> 29:42.400
I am not as inclined anymore to want to play like on my switch because I had a really good

29:42.400 --> 29:44.640
gaming experience with the Oculus Quest.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.040
I'd never really gotten to the gaming.

29:46.040 --> 29:50.080
I was working on like the whole like virtual office angle.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.640
And then you're like, you got to go get this Vader game after you got your quest.

29:53.640 --> 29:55.200
It kicked my ass.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.200
Yeah.

29:56.200 --> 30:01.120
I got to tell you, man, it's a totally different experience playing a first person shooter

30:01.120 --> 30:03.520
like that in VR.

30:03.520 --> 30:08.560
When Vader walked up to me for the first time, I legit felt like a little bit of intimidation.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.900
Like this guy's big.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.220
He's standing over me.

30:11.220 --> 30:13.200
His whole suit was very intimidating.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.200
He's not playing.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.260
He's not screwing around here.

30:15.260 --> 30:17.420
He's not playing at all.

30:17.420 --> 30:19.120
And I've never had that experience.

30:19.120 --> 30:23.600
Also putting my ship into hyperdrive and then walking into the back to like configure some

30:23.600 --> 30:25.480
of the ship's systems.

30:25.480 --> 30:26.480
That's just a lot of fun.

30:26.480 --> 30:27.480
All right.

30:27.480 --> 30:28.480
Ready?

30:28.480 --> 30:29.480
Knights of the Old Republic, Oculus Edition.

30:29.480 --> 30:30.480
Okay.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.480
That's a good version.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.480
Can you imagine it?

30:32.480 --> 30:34.400
I think it's better than you expected, huh?

30:34.400 --> 30:35.400
I'm blown away.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.400
I love it.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.400
Really?

30:37.400 --> 30:40.720
And it's funny because every member of my house except for the five year old because

30:40.720 --> 30:43.100
five has tried it.

30:43.100 --> 30:44.880
And we've all latched on to other things.

30:44.880 --> 30:50.360
For instance, I've been getting my ass handed to me by BDSM Anakin Skywalker.

30:50.360 --> 30:54.520
And the teenager discovered Beat Saber.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.600
And my house has been full of Lady Gaga.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.600
Yeah.

30:57.600 --> 30:58.600
Yep.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.600
Supernatural.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.600
Do you have a fitness one?

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
Oh, yeah, I think so.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
Yeah.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
There's a couple of workout ones I want to try.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.600
Yeah.

31:04.600 --> 31:05.600
The missus to be has been playing that.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.080
And I just started building my office.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.080
Okay.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.080
Tell me.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.800
I'm trying to go for as goth as possible.

31:10.800 --> 31:14.400
But like but like not goth as in like black nail polish.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.400
Okay.

31:15.400 --> 31:20.800
Actual old school gothic like I want my screen and then, you know, just to look like I'm

31:20.800 --> 31:21.800
in an old castle.

31:21.800 --> 31:22.800
Cool.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.600
Like like Batman, the movie from like 89 or whatever.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.600
Yeah.

31:26.600 --> 31:27.600
I want the Michael Keaton Batman.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.720
Yeah, that's perfect.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.720
That's a cool aesthetic.

31:29.720 --> 31:30.720
Huh?

31:30.720 --> 31:35.920
You know, okay, this this, I have to say is a little bit of like, we have to eat some

31:35.920 --> 31:41.080
humble pie on this because I on all of this initially, because it just seemed like, I

31:41.080 --> 31:47.080
think I went it's attached to Facebook, therefore, I will never take it seriously.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.080
Right.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.560
And I just kind of collapsed it down to that single variable.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.800
Did you struggle with the whole meta thing connection to Facebook?

31:53.800 --> 31:56.640
I didn't like that you have to log in your Facebook account.

31:56.640 --> 32:00.620
That feels creepy in ways that I'm not sure that I completely understand yet.

32:00.620 --> 32:04.320
But then I immediately handed Facebook like $150 in apps I bought.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.320
Yeah, I know.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.120
Yeah, you get used to it pretty quick.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.580
You don't have it's not like you interface with it a lot.

32:09.580 --> 32:11.400
It's not like in your face about it.

32:11.400 --> 32:15.320
I also, I can't believe I'm gonna say this.

32:15.320 --> 32:20.680
And it was actually my wife who pointed it out to me, ironically, she's like, you know,

32:20.680 --> 32:22.080
where an NFT would make sense.

32:22.080 --> 32:25.480
Like, if you have that virtual office and you start decorating, it wouldn't be nice

32:25.480 --> 32:28.280
if you could take that stuff to a different environment.

32:28.280 --> 32:33.240
And she's like, I because she was looking at it from like having a meditation zone.

32:33.240 --> 32:37.080
She's like, I would like to be able to decorate it with art.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.560
Okay, I got the Oculus.

32:38.560 --> 32:42.040
I'm also reading a book called the reality plus, which everybody who is going to show

32:42.040 --> 32:47.960
that reads should read because I think my whole mind has just changed on this VR thing.

32:47.960 --> 32:48.960
Oh, really?

32:48.960 --> 32:53.920
Yeah, I think between this academic writing this book, me reading it and experiencing

32:53.920 --> 32:55.440
it for myself.

32:55.440 --> 33:01.440
You know, I have done more exercise by getting the kicked out of me by Anakin, true.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.720
And trying that supernatural boxing thing.

33:04.720 --> 33:08.680
Then I think I've like ever done since I was a kid doing martial arts.

33:08.680 --> 33:12.680
Yeah, I worked up a sweat doing the practice lightsaber thing where you fight those little

33:12.680 --> 33:15.200
bots from the Star Wars movie that those cheap bastards.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.760
Yeah, they're all over the place.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.240
We're like, we're fast.

33:18.240 --> 33:21.040
Yeah, yeah, I worked up a sweat.

33:21.040 --> 33:24.520
They got to set your your guard area or whatever they call it.

33:24.520 --> 33:25.520
Yeah, yeah.

33:25.520 --> 33:29.920
The Guardian Zone or whatever, because sometimes you might hit a wall and that can be painful.

33:29.920 --> 33:30.920
It's a compelling idea.

33:30.920 --> 33:34.960
And you know, recently, a crowd funder launched called the Simula VR.

33:34.960 --> 33:40.920
This is a Linux box, a like 11th Gen Intel x86 Linux box in the headset.

33:40.920 --> 33:46.360
And they're writing a Wayland based desktop environment where you can bring up all the

33:46.360 --> 33:47.360
screens.

33:47.360 --> 33:52.640
And their primary focus is really crisp, high resolution text, because I think that is an

33:52.640 --> 33:59.040
area where the Oculus Quest two right now suffers is I have to make my screens really

33:59.040 --> 34:02.560
big because the text is fuzzy.

34:02.560 --> 34:05.640
So I compensate by having huge screens, I happen to love huge screens.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.440
So it's not a huge compromise.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.720
And you can have unlimited huge screens.

34:09.720 --> 34:14.520
But I could really see the advantage of the entire computer being in that headset.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.840
Because then you just wherever you're at, you pop that thing on and you have your entire

34:17.840 --> 34:19.540
private workspace.

34:19.540 --> 34:21.340
And no one can see your screen.

34:21.340 --> 34:24.160
It really is confidential.

34:24.160 --> 34:32.000
And you have state, right, because that virtual state remains all your screens, all your windows,

34:32.000 --> 34:36.700
where you had all your notes, your chat windows, everything laid out exactly the same wherever

34:36.700 --> 34:38.880
you're at anywhere in the world.

34:38.880 --> 34:39.900
That's pretty powerful.

34:39.900 --> 34:42.000
So should we even talk about the developer story?

34:42.000 --> 34:44.440
Because I've been definitely looking at it.

34:44.440 --> 34:47.000
Yeah, you know, we got an email in from a listener.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.240
I think he was asking kind of the same thing.

34:49.240 --> 34:54.460
A listener Casey says, thanks for answering my question about maintenance contracts recently.

34:54.460 --> 34:59.360
I have a question about what your thoughts are on the coding possibilities in VR.

34:59.360 --> 35:03.680
I picked up the Valve Index over Christmas, and I'm really enjoying VR games.

35:03.680 --> 35:06.360
But I haven't tried virtual workspaces yet.

35:06.360 --> 35:09.680
I find the text a bit blurry and difficult to read in VR.

35:09.680 --> 35:14.320
But I find the advantages of having huge and multiple monitors very intriguing.

35:14.320 --> 35:18.980
Did you see yourself coding or working in a terminal in VR?

35:18.980 --> 35:24.420
So yes, which I'm very shocked that it's actually what I think.

35:24.420 --> 35:28.180
But I feel like this is my concern.

35:28.180 --> 35:30.920
You know how it's like some old ladies make those fairy gardens?

35:30.920 --> 35:34.280
Yes, I used to live next to one.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.280
Well, so do I.

35:35.280 --> 35:36.980
That's what the ladies and they're beautiful.

35:36.980 --> 35:40.400
The problem is every time it like rains, she has to redo it.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.320
But because she keeps it outside.

35:42.320 --> 35:48.320
I worry that like the level of effort in making the perfect, like I'm bad enough with my desk,

35:48.320 --> 35:49.320
right?

35:49.320 --> 35:53.300
I tweet photos of when I changed the most minuscule crap on my desk.

35:53.300 --> 35:58.360
Would that not be the same in the VR and what I start buying NFTs, right?

35:58.360 --> 35:59.360
Is this a rabbit hole?

35:59.360 --> 36:01.320
And what if I'm in a different kind of mood?

36:01.320 --> 36:05.560
Maybe today I want to work in like a koi, you know, like a Buddhist monk temple with

36:05.560 --> 36:11.120
a koi pond, which is like my, my, you know, VS code window floating in the air.

36:11.120 --> 36:14.620
But maybe sometimes I feel like I'm Batman, you know, it's 1989.

36:14.620 --> 36:18.160
Sometimes I want the log cabin, but I just recently decided to switch to the space station.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.160
Are you really doing the space station?

36:20.160 --> 36:21.360
I kind of like it now.

36:21.360 --> 36:25.040
You know, it just feels like, it feels like a high level because you've got that big window

36:25.040 --> 36:26.600
where you can see earth.

36:26.600 --> 36:29.760
It just seems like, you know, this is where I could go to think big about stuff.

36:29.760 --> 36:33.440
Maybe this feels like it could become like some very unhealthy.

36:33.440 --> 36:34.920
We mentioned them every week now.

36:34.920 --> 36:40.920
William Gibson style stuff, you know, I don't know, we'll trade NFTs, you know, we can have

36:40.920 --> 36:45.200
Koda radio NFT swag for your virtual desk.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.240
Instead of Clippy, you have a VR jar jar.

36:47.240 --> 36:51.240
We just have entire economies that are, that are propped up selling virtual goods.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.240
What could go wrong?

36:52.240 --> 36:53.240
Nothing.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.240
Nothing.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.240
This feels healthy.

36:55.240 --> 36:56.240
No, I mean, we don't, I just don't take it there.

36:56.240 --> 37:00.120
You know, I feel like if you just take it for what it is now, it's just a new way to

37:00.120 --> 37:04.220
work that still feels like it's, it's not a hundred percent there yet.

37:04.220 --> 37:05.220
It's more casual.

37:05.220 --> 37:06.460
It's more consumption.

37:06.460 --> 37:09.360
It's more iPad than it is laptop at this point.

37:09.360 --> 37:14.680
But I could really see one, just literally one generation difference.

37:14.680 --> 37:18.160
Or if Apple comes out with something or the Simula VR headset.

37:18.160 --> 37:21.120
And then listen, I'm going to tell you, I was very skeptical on Apple coming out with

37:21.120 --> 37:25.160
something Tim, there's 30% here for you.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.380
You could get it.

37:26.380 --> 37:31.240
This is my thought is it actually really works well with the app store model.

37:31.240 --> 37:35.300
It's it's kind of a perfect.

37:35.300 --> 37:39.160
And people are charging a premium for VR content because it does take more work.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.800
Only thing is Apple is so into the AR idea right now.

37:41.800 --> 37:45.800
Yeah, but there is overly, by the way, a little pro tip, you can turn it on in your settings

37:45.800 --> 37:50.280
and then you can just double tap the side of your Oculus and it will turn on the AR

37:50.280 --> 37:53.800
cameras so you can see around your room, which is really neat like in the, when the kids

37:53.800 --> 37:54.800
come running in.

37:54.800 --> 37:58.620
So I recommend that's in the settings for guardian.

37:58.620 --> 38:01.840
And then it's just a, like, it's just a sensor they have in there.

38:01.840 --> 38:05.760
So you just tap it hard enough for the sensor to read it and then it flips on the AR cameras.

38:05.760 --> 38:09.240
And I think that's where Apple could really do a lot better job than Oculus because those

38:09.240 --> 38:10.240
cameras kind of suck.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.240
Yeah, they do.

38:11.240 --> 38:17.360
Where you could really see how Apple could put in just iPhone quality cameras with LIDAR

38:17.360 --> 38:19.680
and the Apple AR stuff that they already exist.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.280
You could you could bring them together.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.480
It doesn't have to be just one or the other.

38:23.480 --> 38:27.200
You know what I just like literally popped in my head all the fitness plus stuff that

38:27.200 --> 38:30.640
Apple is doing and the fact that the watch is getting better and better heart readings

38:30.640 --> 38:32.480
and oxygen readings.

38:32.480 --> 38:36.200
I could see that being particularly for me, someone with a heart condition, like my ultimate

38:36.200 --> 38:40.760
fitness setup is an Apple VR where instead of boxing and supernatural, which is now I

38:40.760 --> 38:45.200
think of going to be a Facebook property or already is, you know, whatever their version,

38:45.200 --> 38:46.200
right?

38:46.200 --> 38:50.400
Or some, in fact, some developer could make like, you know, boxing class.

38:50.400 --> 38:51.400
Wow.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.400
Peloton is screwed.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.660
I know that is a way better to work out.

38:54.660 --> 38:55.660
It's way better.

38:55.660 --> 39:00.640
It's so much more fun to like blow stuff up and fight stuff for your workout.

39:00.640 --> 39:06.840
And just as an aside, Mark Zuckerberg was recently on the Lex Friedman podcast.

39:06.840 --> 39:13.800
And in there, Zuck talks about some of their ideas for software development in VR.

39:13.800 --> 39:19.760
And also about how they'll casually be able to create VR environments for just regulars,

39:19.760 --> 39:22.400
you know, just sort of block building kind of stuff.

39:22.400 --> 39:27.800
He is of the opinion, it sounds like to me that within a few years, he expects this is

39:27.800 --> 39:33.320
probably going to make the developers at Meta about 5% more effective on average for their

39:33.320 --> 39:34.640
daily job.

39:34.640 --> 39:40.500
But he feels like if you take that 5% and you multiply it across all of Meta's developers,

39:40.500 --> 39:41.600
that's a huge return.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.760
And that immediately pays for the headset itself.

39:44.760 --> 39:47.320
And so he thinks it's, that's the direction these things are going.

39:47.320 --> 39:53.640
And they have mandated that staff now use all these virtual workspace apps for their

39:53.640 --> 39:56.640
collaborative meetings, like Horizon workplaces and whatnot.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.600
So they're dogfooding everything they're putting out.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.520
That's part of their mandate now.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.400
So how does it make you more productive?

40:03.400 --> 40:08.440
I think the number one thing is the interaction in meetings is way more natural.

40:08.440 --> 40:12.080
So you know, you never really make eye contact in a video call.

40:12.080 --> 40:15.440
When you're in a Zoom call, you're either looking at their face, but the person on the

40:15.440 --> 40:18.000
other side then sees you looking down.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.560
Or you look in the camera, so you're looking in their eyes on the other side, but then

40:22.560 --> 40:24.880
you're looking at the camera and you can't see them.

40:24.880 --> 40:30.120
In VR, the headset can detect the position of your head and figure out when you're looking

40:30.120 --> 40:32.920
at somebody and it creates an eye contact.

40:32.920 --> 40:37.280
Additionally, the positional audio means that you can hear someone on your left and your

40:37.280 --> 40:40.280
right and you hear where they're at in the room with you.

40:40.280 --> 40:44.960
And it also means you could even lean over and say, Hey, you know, this guy is just going

40:44.960 --> 40:45.960
on forever.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.440
We should wrap this up.

40:47.440 --> 40:50.840
Like you can in a real meeting and the person on the other end of the room can't necessarily

40:50.840 --> 40:51.840
hear you.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.000
So there's that kind of stuff.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.160
Plus, you also see like right now as I'm talking to you, I'm actually expressing quite a bit

40:57.160 --> 41:01.480
of this conversation with my hands, even though I'm sitting in a studio by myself.

41:01.480 --> 41:03.120
And all of that comes through as well.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.120
Sure.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.480
Also, it's lower latency.

41:05.480 --> 41:10.160
So there's that factor as well, because you're not sending an H.264 video stream and an AAC

41:10.160 --> 41:11.160
audio.

41:11.160 --> 41:16.240
You're just sending vector information and then it's being rendered locally on your machine.

41:16.240 --> 41:19.880
And then there's just the, you know, audio to go along with that.

41:19.880 --> 41:25.360
But you don't actually have to perfectly nail that audio timing so you can actually be a

41:25.360 --> 41:27.560
little more creative with that.

41:27.560 --> 41:31.080
And so it actually produces a lower latency experience.

41:31.080 --> 41:33.040
So it makes the meetings more natural.

41:33.040 --> 41:37.500
You don't have that issue that you have on VoIP calls or Zoom calls now where people

41:37.500 --> 41:41.520
can't quite tell if you're done talking or just pausing because the latency makes it

41:41.520 --> 41:45.080
hard to guess the gap when you should jump in or not.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.080
That kind of stuff goes away.

41:46.080 --> 41:47.080
Damn.

41:47.080 --> 41:48.080
I could totally see that.

41:48.080 --> 41:52.720
I know a lot of people listening probably think we're crazy, but you know, here we were

41:52.720 --> 41:59.820
two cynical skeptics like just two, three weeks ago, you know, and I admit my big blocker

41:59.820 --> 42:01.360
was the Facebook connection.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.840
I just didn't take it seriously.

42:03.840 --> 42:08.640
But now that like you, now that I've tried this, I'm 90% sure Apple's going to release

42:08.640 --> 42:10.360
a device like this.

42:10.360 --> 42:13.920
And I could see Apple doing some crazy stuff where they like call Adobe and make a deal

42:13.920 --> 42:20.360
that like the Mac OS, iOS, and like Apple VR OS, whatever it's going to be, you know,

42:20.360 --> 42:26.760
you can be working on your InDesign file or hell, we might see like a flourishing of CAD

42:26.760 --> 42:31.240
software on Mac because then, okay, you can go into the Apple VR and like do a meeting

42:31.240 --> 42:35.360
with it and have the actual like item you're building right there.

42:35.360 --> 42:36.680
I am so torn.

42:36.680 --> 42:41.680
I've been talking to Wes about it since like Saturday or Friday.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.120
I am so torn on the Simula V1.

42:44.120 --> 42:51.480
So the base price to pre-order and you can do 50% upfront or you can do it all upfront,

42:51.480 --> 42:59.280
but the base price for this Simula VR Linux computer is $2,700 and their limited availability

42:59.280 --> 43:02.920
one is five grand.

43:02.920 --> 43:05.240
I know, I know.

43:05.240 --> 43:09.440
Says the guy sitting in front of a $5,000 iMac Pro that will be obsolete in two months.

43:09.440 --> 43:10.440
But yeah.

43:10.440 --> 43:11.440
It is an entire computer, right?

43:11.440 --> 43:12.440
It's not just a VR headset.

43:12.440 --> 43:18.360
It is an entire modern 11th Gen Intel Linux compatible computer and the computer component

43:18.360 --> 43:21.720
is actually detachable from the headset.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.480
So there's that element of it.

43:23.480 --> 43:27.440
So it's not like it's a crazy, crazy investment and they're really upfront about the cost.

43:27.440 --> 43:30.920
They explain, you know, the screen and the stuff that's causing the price.

43:30.920 --> 43:36.960
And I feel like a Linux enthusiast who's now starting to become a VR enthusiast, this feels

43:36.960 --> 43:44.160
like the perfect crossover, but I worry having experienced the Oculus, that my gut tells

43:44.160 --> 43:49.800
me the VR headset is more like a phone than it is like a computer.

43:49.800 --> 43:54.800
And so it means you need an app store and you need an ecosystem and you need developers

43:54.800 --> 43:57.320
that are pushing to get their content on here.

43:57.320 --> 43:59.400
And this isn't going to have any of that.

43:59.400 --> 44:02.940
It's just going to have a really good working environment and it's going to be able to bring

44:02.940 --> 44:10.600
in some floating screens, which is going to be awesome, but it feels like only a third

44:10.600 --> 44:13.380
of what the VR headset should do.

44:13.380 --> 44:17.840
And so when you're, when you're looking at nearly $2,700, I don't know, that's really

44:17.840 --> 44:18.840
tricky.

44:18.840 --> 44:22.740
I would be, and I know people are going to like burn us in the comments on this, but

44:22.740 --> 44:24.640
I would be Sue.

44:24.640 --> 44:28.200
Like now is probably not the time to start a big new VR project, especially if you're

44:28.200 --> 44:29.400
an independent developer.

44:29.400 --> 44:32.680
One is something I want to mentioned.

44:32.680 --> 44:34.800
MacBook is doing a good job with the SDKs.

44:34.800 --> 44:38.440
There's like the native ant, there's the native SDK, there's, they have great, it looks like

44:38.440 --> 44:40.440
really good unity support.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.340
Maybe that's unity doing a good job.

44:42.340 --> 44:46.960
And they have unreal engine support and web RX, which I don't know much about.

44:46.960 --> 44:52.860
If Apple's really going to release something in the next, let's say 10 months, I just feel

44:52.860 --> 44:56.520
like that will be an automatic win unless Apple stupidly makes it like for grant.

44:56.520 --> 44:58.280
Oh, they'll make it expensive.

44:58.280 --> 45:02.240
But now that I've seen this thing sitting at 2,700, it's going to seem like a deal because

45:02.240 --> 45:07.240
it probably will be two grand, like a Gurman or whoever said it was going to be.

45:07.240 --> 45:10.640
This is going to be another thing that's also going to leave a bunch of people behind.

45:10.640 --> 45:11.640
How do you mean leave them behind?

45:11.640 --> 45:12.640
It's just too expensive?

45:12.640 --> 45:13.640
Well, there is that.

45:13.640 --> 45:15.120
Although I would imagine the price will come down, right?

45:15.120 --> 45:19.440
You can get a, you can find an Oculus for 300, $350 used.

45:19.440 --> 45:23.240
So I imagine the prices will come down over time and they'll hold, they'll have probably

45:23.240 --> 45:29.160
multiple additions where they keep one that they've released years ago and they do like

45:29.160 --> 45:30.760
they do with the phones.

45:30.760 --> 45:36.600
So I think the pricing thing will solve itself after the initial kind of ecosystem gets established.

45:36.600 --> 45:42.440
But I just mean there's a lot of technology coming that people are just not getting on

45:42.440 --> 45:44.120
board with anymore.

45:44.120 --> 45:46.760
My dad never bothered with social media.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.400
I say good move, right?

45:48.400 --> 45:52.580
Never has created any account on any social media platform ever.

45:52.580 --> 45:55.000
Never has checked a social media platform.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
And that's fine.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.440
Actually, I used to work with a guy who didn't get a cell phone.

45:59.440 --> 46:00.440
You know what I'm saying?

46:00.440 --> 46:03.460
In each major wave, there's people who just decide not to jump on.

46:03.460 --> 46:06.640
It feels like cryptocurrency is definitely one of those, at least Bitcoin.

46:06.640 --> 46:09.160
And it seems like VR is one of those things.

46:09.160 --> 46:12.440
It's like there's just going to be some people that are just going to nope out like, ah,

46:12.440 --> 46:15.840
this is a scam or this isn't going anywhere.

46:15.840 --> 46:16.840
It's weird.

46:16.840 --> 46:19.120
It feels like there's more and more resistance than ever these days.

46:19.120 --> 46:23.520
Yeah, but you know, once something really new comes out, I think it's going to, there's

46:23.520 --> 46:25.000
going to be another cycle of hotness.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.280
Now granted pricing is going to be a thing and I think that's why Facebook's the new

46:28.280 --> 46:29.280
okay.

46:29.280 --> 46:31.280
It's going to be a hundred bucks, right?

46:31.280 --> 46:34.960
So if Apple, Apple will as always have their high end, like you're, like you were saying,

46:34.960 --> 46:39.120
German saying, but I don't know, I could see it.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.120
Poor HoloLens.

46:40.120 --> 46:43.960
You know, it's funny is now what Apple is going to start doing is they're going to start

46:43.960 --> 46:48.560
slowly ratcheting up the price of apps.

46:48.560 --> 46:52.320
If they release a headset, apps are going to be $24.99.

46:52.320 --> 46:56.560
I mean, even mobile apps, good mobile apps are expensive to develop these days because

46:56.560 --> 47:02.000
the consumer expectation is so high, but just the level of graphical assets you need for

47:02.000 --> 47:05.520
even any like relatively simple VR experience.

47:05.520 --> 47:09.080
And you probably are going to want some sort of way to bring in folks as NFT products.

47:09.080 --> 47:16.640
I can't believe I'm on board with NFTs now, but these are big undertakings.

47:16.640 --> 47:20.760
These are bet the company moves for, I think most smallish indie developers.

47:20.760 --> 47:25.600
Unless, you know, unless you're doing some like trivial, not trivial, but like you're

47:25.600 --> 47:26.600
not, you know what I mean?

47:26.600 --> 47:33.400
You're doing something that's not that complicated, but to have a really good virtual experience,

47:33.400 --> 47:39.200
I can't even imagine just the graphical assets alone, what the cost is going to look like.

47:39.200 --> 47:44.720
There could be whole design firms opened up, if you're a very skilled 3D designer, you

47:44.720 --> 47:51.480
might consider design consultancy, just supplying developers and other companies effectively

47:51.480 --> 47:52.520
NFTs, right?

47:52.520 --> 47:53.520
Just the assets for the NFTs.

47:53.520 --> 48:00.480
Well, and if these things took off, if this became a legitimate ecosystem in a decade,

48:00.480 --> 48:05.760
would we start looking at companies like Unreal as one of the premier IDE developers, perhaps?

48:05.760 --> 48:08.520
Because you could see how that could be their wheelhouse.

48:08.520 --> 48:12.040
I think this is the best thing that's happened to Unity since iOS.

48:12.040 --> 48:17.400
Yeah, you know, Unity is having a resurgence.

48:17.400 --> 48:18.400
Wild.

48:18.400 --> 48:20.120
What a trip we just both had with this thing.

48:20.120 --> 48:24.080
I think, you know, my advice would be, unless you like to tinker with stuff early days,

48:24.080 --> 48:25.080
you could hold off.

48:25.080 --> 48:29.600
This isn't necessarily an endorsement to go out and buy one, unless you want to just play

48:29.600 --> 48:34.160
with this stuff and kind of see what we're talking about and experience it at the ground

48:34.160 --> 48:35.160
level.

48:35.160 --> 48:38.080
I think one revision away, and it's time to buy.

48:38.080 --> 48:45.040
Well, I got to tell you, if you're young, like I was when iOS came out and you can shoot

48:45.040 --> 48:51.000
your shot and you don't have a lot to lose, I would probably say to hell with mobile and

48:51.000 --> 48:53.080
take a look at this stuff.

48:53.080 --> 48:56.040
Start small, but you'll be early.

48:56.040 --> 48:58.040
It's got that hungry consumer thing going.

48:58.040 --> 49:00.760
People have their new hot device and they want to grab apps for it.

49:00.760 --> 49:04.280
I'm spending money on the Oculus apps like a drunk sailor, right?

49:04.280 --> 49:05.280
I know it sucks.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.560
It sucks.

49:06.560 --> 49:07.560
And the apps are pricey.

49:07.560 --> 49:12.560
Yeah, I wasn't really, I didn't really budget that in, but it's, I'm slowing down now.

49:12.560 --> 49:14.440
But yeah, I definitely, I went shopping.

49:14.440 --> 49:18.320
You know, you get this device, you got to load it up with apps and you know, hey, they're

49:18.320 --> 49:19.840
cheaper than a Switch game.

49:19.840 --> 49:22.040
I bought Resident Evil 4 for the fourth time.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.480
All right, eighth time.

49:23.480 --> 49:24.480
But yeah.

49:24.480 --> 49:27.680
Well, I've got to go fight Darth Vader, so we should probably wrap it up there.

49:27.680 --> 49:29.480
Is there anywhere you'd like to send folks?

49:29.480 --> 49:32.440
Go to alice.dev and help fund my VR habit.

49:32.440 --> 49:33.640
Right, right, right.

49:33.640 --> 49:35.680
Why not join us on Matrix?

49:35.680 --> 49:39.920
There's a Koda Radio feedback room and a Koda Radio general chat on matrix.org.

49:39.920 --> 49:47.320
And of course our server is colony.jupitabroadcasting.com, colony.jupitabroadcasting.com.

49:47.320 --> 49:48.400
We love your feedback.

49:48.400 --> 49:51.520
That's at Koder.show slash contact.

49:51.520 --> 49:53.000
Gives us lots to talk about.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.080
It's a big part of the show, so we love hearing from you.

49:55.080 --> 49:58.080
You can also find links to what we talked about today over there.

49:58.080 --> 50:01.160
That's at Koder.show slash four five five.

50:01.160 --> 50:04.440
And last but not least, you're welcome to join us on a Monday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m.

50:04.440 --> 50:05.440
Eastern.

Thanks so much for joining us.

50:06.440 --> 50:15.800
We'll be right back here next week.
