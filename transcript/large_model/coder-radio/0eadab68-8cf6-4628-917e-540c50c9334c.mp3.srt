00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,520
This is Kota Radio, episode 413 for May 10th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,440
Hello friend, and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,360
at the art in the business of software development and the whole damn world of technology.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,440
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,040
My name is Chris and our hostess with the mostest who's going to help me fight the banks

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,040
is Mr. Dominic.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,040
Hello Mike.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,880
Hello, and this episode is brought to you by Goldman Sachs.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh crap, we're not supposed to open with that.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh no, man.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,440
I need your help to fight the establishment.

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,280
Although if we can get paid, that's just as good really, let's be honest.

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,200
Maybe that'll be our exit strategy from this whole podcasting thing, going big with the

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
banks.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, how's it going over there?

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,360
I have several things I want to check in on.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:15,000
First and foremost, we are now weeks into Mike's X1 Carbon 11th, what is it, no, 9th

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
gen.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,540
How is the X1 Carbon lifestyle treating you?

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,540
It's good.

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,200
Unfortunately, because of the tyranny that is iCloud Keychain, I could not get into either

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,920
Squadcast or IRC without getting busting out the Mac.

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,480
I think you mean the ecosystem.

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,360
Oh, it's a feature, right?

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,480
Yeah, it's the ecosystem, dude.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,200
I'm told this is the benefit.

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,960
It's kind of a pain in the ass because I was putting the kid down, I was running late,

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,360
and I'm like, oh, God.

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,480
We should say Mike probably knows about Bitwarden and LastPass.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,280
Mike does know about Bitwarden and LastPass.

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,720
I also know about some of the problems, particularly one of those, but let's not pick on anybody

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
in particular.

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,920
But yeah, can I tell you, I'm about four months into my, oh, I might be even longer into my

37
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,760
X1 now, maybe six months into my X1 Carbon.

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,920
And I checked the battery health this weekend, and I've been pretty good.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,360
I'm pretty good about my batteries.

40
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,520
I at least, I at least am very mindful of not overcharging or leave my batteries dead.

41
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,280
And this thing's about maybe between four and five months old, and the battery health

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,880
is already at 94%.

43
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,240
And I can tell.

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,840
That seems quick.

45
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
It's very quick.

46
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm not happy about it.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I am not pleased.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,920
I'm taking proactive measures, but...

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,880
Are you running that Linux operating system?

50
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Yeah, oh, yeah.

51
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,080
Yeah, it came with that on there.

52
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,040
So you're suggesting it's damaging the machine.

53
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,240
Well, I'm using the tools in that GNU slash Linux to preserve the battery for as long

54
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,400
as possible now.

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,720
I am deploying a series of tools in which will enable me to try to eek the most out

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,560
of it that I can, but I shouldn't have to.

57
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,960
I just shouldn't have to.

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,040
I don't know, man.

59
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,320
I try so hard, and then these things get away from me, and then I come back to them a few

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,200
months later, and I realize more damage has been done.

61
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,960
And then I build up this guilt that I'm a bad laptop daddy, and that I don't take proper

62
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
care of my laptops.

63
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
It's just...

64
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
It's a bad cycle.

65
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Yeah.

66
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,840
Because you really don't want to charge it all the time, right?

67
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,400
That's the big secret.

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Yeah.

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Well, I'm pretty sure everybody who listens to this knows, but...

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Yeah, I am.

71
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,160
And I pay attention to all my batteries.

72
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,280
It's more aggressive than I'd like to see.

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
You know?

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
I've...

75
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,320
I mean, unless the other tools are lying to me, I've got machines that are older than

76
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,720
that that have better batteries at this point.

77
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,280
I just don't really get it.

78
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,200
I suppose it's different for every machine and every battery, and the life cycle of each

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,840
battery is going to be different, too.

80
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,400
But I did it again, Mike.

81
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
You know?

82
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,720
I am a dumb man who can't think in long-term or short-term windows, mostly.

83
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
You know what I'm saying?

84
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,520
I could think for the next three days, and I can think for the next five years, but I

85
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,280
couldn't tell you for the next two weeks to three months.

86
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,440
I'm just a total mess at planning.

87
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,880
Do you suffer from this at all?

88
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,000
Would things especially get busy?

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah.

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I would say long-time horizons feel more possible.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,160
Short-time horizons feel...

92
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
It's like panic mode.

93
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Do what you can.

94
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Yeah.

95
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
Put out the fire.

96
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Yeah.

97
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
Medium-time horizons get a little fuzzy.

98
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Yeah.

99
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
Yeah.

100
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
But in what frame are you talking about here?

101
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,360
Well, you think about how Jupiter Broadcasting operates as a business, and our revenue stream,

102
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,000
a good portion of it comes from sponsors, right?

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,120
And sponsors work on this contract where you say, okay, we commit to doing this many episodes

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,560
for this long, or we'll do them in this order, or whatever.

105
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,840
There's all these details in these agreements.

106
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,760
And I've yet, and I've been doing this for a while, I've been doing sponsored content

107
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:47,160
for like 11 years, and I still have yet to properly schedule things like known family

108
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,400
trips or holidays into these contracts.

109
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,080
And so I find myself where I'm up against some travel, which for me is happening at

110
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,480
the end of May, and I haven't really accommodated for anything.

111
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't really have any planning.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,800
I just don't have the bandwidth to zoom way out and have this master scheduler who's aware

113
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,040
of when tech events are, and when news events are happening, and when big releases are,

114
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,040
and when trips are happening, and when schedules for sponsors, and when co-hosts want time

115
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,760
off, and all of this matrix of information that it's all floating around out there, I've

116
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,220
never been good at bringing it all together and coming out with a master JB timeline.

117
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,720
Like a master control program, if you wanted to say that, yeah.

118
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,360
And so instead I just end up scrambling constantly, and it creates more fires, and it makes going

119
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,200
on a trip, I need to prerecord seven shows.

120
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,080
It's just, that's not possible, not in a week, I can't do that.

121
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,000
Are we doing a special next week again?

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,240
I don't think so, I mean, I'll think about it, I'll talk to you, I don't know.

123
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
You can do it.

124
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,060
I mean, I don't mind doing some of it from the road too, because sometimes it's kind

125
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,920
of fun, you know, do Coder from the Road or something.

126
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,200
I just want to say, I think we have a WSL special on us.

127
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
We could.

128
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
We definitely could.

129
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,600
Yeah, I was thinking, it's funny you say that.

130
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,160
I was thinking just last night, it's like, you know, I spent a whole weekend in Windows

131
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,400
10 and screwing around with WSL, and I really don't feel like I relayed a lot of the experience.

132
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,320
I relayed like the highlights of the experience, but I don't know, I feel like I could have

133
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,720
done a better job communicating what that experience was like, because it's kind of

134
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,600
a pivotal thing that's happened, because I still see people chewing on it in various

135
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,280
community discussion areas.

136
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,120
Yeah, I'm super down with WSL.

137
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
I mean, let's not talk about it today, but I'm...

138
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
All right.

139
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Yeah.

140
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
Yeah, we'll save it for the future.

141
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,000
Josh writes in, and he says, I have a question and a comment on Mike's obsession with.NET.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,680
I want to know your thoughts on PowerShell as a viable contender with.NET, you know,

143
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,960
maybe in conjunction with it, because you're able to systematically call C-sharp methods

144
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,720
if you don't want to get dirty with pipes, and you can even integrate it with XAML to

145
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
make pretty GUIs.

146
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,960
I just wanted to mention it because it's been an obsession of mine, and Mike might find

147
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,840
it quite useful.

148
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,320
Keep continuing with the great show.

149
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,200
Josh, have you ever, now that you're, you know, smoking the Windows pipe over there,

150
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,440
have you thought about looking at PowerShell?

151
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,440
You know, when I'm in a public restroom, heating the Windows crack on a spoon, it's...

152
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,560
Yeah, that's exactly what's going on.

153
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,360
And this shows you my knowledge of drugs, so I'm pretty sure you don't do that with

154
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
crack that...

155
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
I think, whatever.

156
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:25,120
But yes, in fact, the long-defunct Mike Dominic show, we had the PowerShell for Linux dudes

157
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,000
on who were, well, that's their thing, right?

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah.

159
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Right.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Right.

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Good callback.

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So, good callback.

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That was maybe a year and a half ago.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Maybe a little less.

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,880
But I don't use PowerShell for a very boring reason, and the reason is I've been using

166
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,720
Bash for 4,000 years.

167
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,760
Well, and they've put so much work into making it possible to run Bash now.

168
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
That's where I was going to go with this.

169
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,440
I know if I were going to be a Windows-only admin and developer, sure, it'd be worth the

170
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,320
investment of PowerShell, and we absolutely have talked to people that feel it is that.

171
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,040
But when you're more mixed multi-platform, and you've got the option to just run Bash

172
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,400
on Windows, why wouldn't you?

173
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Right.

174
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,520
And before anybody writes in, of course, I know when I'm on Mac, it's ZShell, right?

175
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
Screw that.

176
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
Get rid of that.

177
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Put fish.

178
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,880
No, I'm just saying the Bash-esque, right?

179
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,240
The more Unix-y shells.

180
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,120
And also, with WSL and Linux, I kind of...

181
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
All right.

182
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,600
Today, I was working in Python and.NET and Ruby, because sleep is for people who like

183
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,120
to preserve their sanity.

184
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,480
Two of those things were in WSL.

185
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,580
You could probably guess the two.

186
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,160
And one of them was in Visual Studio.

187
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,000
But yet, all of the command line stuff was being done in WSL.

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,280
I actually prefer Penguin.

189
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,360
I know it's a paid distribution.

190
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,120
But again, another callback to the old MacDominic show.

191
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,620
What is it about Penguin you're liking?

192
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,620
Is it Debian-based?

193
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,620
It is Debian.

194
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,360
So you get apt.

195
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
You get apt.

196
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,720
They also have a bunch of easy setup commands for common development toolchains.

197
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,760
And they kind of smooth over some of the weirdness with crossing the file system boundary in

198
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,680
WSL, too.

199
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,240
Which when I say the file system boundary, I mean, if you go from, you know, like, slash

200
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,720
mount, blah, blah, blah, to slash mount slash win home, you're now in Windows World.

201
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,760
And that can get a little hinky.

202
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,220
They have a bunch of like, it's literally a command Penguin setup.

203
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,380
And you set up just like, what are you doing?

204
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,320
Like I'm doing Ruby, I'm doing Python, I'm doing dotnet.

205
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:35,620
But I'm doing dotnet on Docker and Linux, but I want to use Visual Studio as my IDE.

206
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,000
So set it up that way.

207
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And slick.

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,240
It's the same apt commands that you were familiar with if you used Debian or Ubuntu, or pop.

209
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,360
But they basically have a script that, you know, it's a batch script, right?

210
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,480
It sequentially runs the commands and you have to consent to the, you know, it's the

211
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
same thing you've seen a million times, right?

212
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,720
You have to say, yes, I'm willing to allow you to install this blah, blah, blah, blah.

213
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,440
So this is a little embarrassing for me after 400 and however many episodes.

214
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,800
I don't know how to use databases on Windows.

215
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,160
So I use them all in WSL.

216
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
I think 490 million.

217
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
I love it.

218
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,320
Let's be honest, that's a better way to go.

219
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,280
Well, and that's what the servers look like anyway, right?

220
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Yes.

221
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
Yeah, that's a good point.

222
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,280
I mean, ultimately that's where it's going to be running.

223
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,960
My ability to know a PSQL commands.

224
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Super great.

225
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,500
My ability to run whatever the GUI client from Windows is, whose name I don't remember,

226
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,940
but someone will correct us in the comments for Postgres is zero.

227
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,120
I can do it on the command line.

228
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,720
I just don't know how to use that application.

229
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,040
So let's talk about Dart and Flutter because Grape writes in with a question about using

230
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,760
Dart and Flutter for their project.

231
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,480
Grape says, I can't seem to find a moderate take on this.

232
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,600
Everybody's either on the very, very positive side of using Dart and Flutter or on the very,

233
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,480
very negative side of using Dart and Flutter, and I'm not really expecting other people

234
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,440
to help me for my opinion, but I would like to know your thoughts on using something like

235
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Dart and Flutter for a project that I'm working on to make a single code base for mobile and

236
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,120
desktop apps and potentially a progressive web app in the future.

237
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Kind regards.

238
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Thank you so much.

239
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Grape.

240
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,200
Now, Flutter and Dart are Google technologies.

241
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,920
And I know you know that, Mike, but I'm just reminding the audience that that is traditionally

242
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,480
just been like the elephant in the room when it comes to using these technologies is they're

243
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,200
tied to Google.

244
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,600
And this week, I saw a piece that was released that specifically argued that's all the reason

245
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,600
you need to completely avoid Dart and Flutter is its dependence on Google.

246
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,160
Ergo, you would be dependent on Google and you must avoid that at all costs.

247
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,280
And I think that's some of the strongest criticism about using Dart and Flutter.

248
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,200
And I'm curious to know your thoughts on that particular like very hard line.

249
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,560
I mean, well, doesn't Google for Dart and Flutter have a deal with Canonical or did

250
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
I dream that up?

251
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,080
Yeah, well, it's I don't know if I don't know if how much of it's on paper, but Canonical

252
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,280
is committed that their future applications for Linux will be written in Flutter.

253
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,760
And they've also rewritten or begun rewriting their installer using Flutter for the Ubuntu

254
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
desktop.

255
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,080
Yeah, I mean, I found this question a little confusing when it came in, because is the

256
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,320
question, should you consider Flutter as a development toolkit?

257
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
And the answer is obviously yes.

258
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,640
But is it based on the technical merits, right?

259
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,280
And it depending on what you're trying, you know, the old use the best tool for the job,

260
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,800
or is this because it's from Google?

261
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Should you not use it?

262
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Was that?

263
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,520
Yeah, really, what they're trying to say is, do the people with the extreme opinion that

264
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,680
because it's Google, or do they have a point?

265
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,160
Is there a real risk of that of attaching yourself and your project, and maybe an income

266
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,080
stream, let's say to something that's a Google project?

267
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,040
I mean, the only one thing I would say is I usually don't like these arguments.

268
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,800
But Google has a nasty habit of killing development platforms.

269
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,040
And basically, every other product they've ever launched other than search and whatever

270
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,640
they used to murder Yelp.

271
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,680
So I personally have no problems with Flutter.

272
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,160
I have played with it a few times.

273
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,440
I've done it for the show, right?

274
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
We've talked about Flutter.

275
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,280
I keep plugging the show that in my show that no longer exists, but I had a Flutter guy

276
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,160
from Google on the M Dominic show rare Mike Dominic show, right?

277
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,760
Like it's, I have no animosity towards Flutter.

278
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,920
It's just I don't know, I have like 1000s of lines or more than that written in ionic.

279
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,800
And right now I'm doing a lot of stuff with dotnet Maui, but don't tell anybody.

280
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,020
And I kind of don't believe in Dart for reasons that are sort of lame.

281
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,960
If we want to go into that we can, like for me, it's not Flutter, it's Dart.

282
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
That's kind of the problem.

283
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,920
I tend to agree just because darts desktop Linux support is not super modern.

284
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,320
And that turns me off.

285
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,640
My major turn off on it is how do you do the math on the risk of Google eventually abandoning

286
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
this?

287
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,080
I don't think it's very likely because it's also tied to their fuchsia OS project, as

288
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,840
well as some of their internal application development.

289
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,640
So it seems like it, as far as a Google project goes, something like Dart and Flutter have

290
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,720
a pretty good long future.

291
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,960
And you've got at least 10 years, you could probably, I would imagine a runway.

292
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Maybe maybe it's not.

293
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,240
Yeah, see, that's just it, though.

294
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,840
That is just it is I actually am not confident when I say that I start to question, I go

295
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,960
out maybe five, you know, maybe maybe in three years, they announced they're done.

296
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,080
And then they only announced, you know, support for another couple of years after that, like

297
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,120
who knows with Google?

298
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,620
That's the problem is who knows with Google.

299
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,620
Now that's it.

300
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,620
So that's my position.

301
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,040
And I specifically wanted to create a desktop application, multi platform desktop application.

302
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,320
And I wanted to potentially create something that could go on the web as well as a progressive

303
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,000
web app.

304
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,240
And I wanted something that felt like it was easy to get started in and very modern.

305
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,040
I'd be drawn to Flutter.

306
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,920
I did try it really briefly, and I am no expert by any means.

307
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,320
I mean, we're saying I'm talking just a test project.

308
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,440
But I myself was able to build a test project and get it running on desktop Linux.

309
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,720
And that did strike me.

310
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,800
And the other thing I loved about it is that you can do with, you know, a lot of things

311
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,200
now, but it's that ability to make changes and see a real time update as you're going

312
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,440
that is so appealing once you start building that way.

313
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,440
And Flutter enables that.

314
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,420
So I actually I kind of want to say what's the worst that could happen?

315
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,040
Because you're going to get at least a few years of runway out of this thing either way.

316
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,120
But it does make me uncomfortable saying it.

317
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,840
I don't think you're wrong.

318
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:30,160
I just think given the choice between like, Flutter and Angular, I would probably go with

319
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,360
the Angular because I mean, I'm not going to do the falsetto, I'll try business.

320
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,280
But like, Angular is a thing if your independent application doesn't work out, you can definitely

321
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,560
contract out for right in the enterprise, where Flutter I know there is a Flutter community

322
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,840
and they're very mad and they yell at me on Twitter, but it's just not as big.

323
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,640
I might have Google Reader PTSD, that might be a problem.

324
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
It's not just Reader anymore.

325
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,720
I mean, there's a lot of projects that are fading.

326
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
There was Google.

327
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,080
Oh, my God, what was the one years ago?

328
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,000
I spent time like trying to develop something, WAVE.

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That was the one.

330
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Me too.

331
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,120
And like, Google has a bad habit of saying they're going to open source great toolkits

332
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,720
to like revolutionize the way you work.

333
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,200
And then just killing them because it's Thursday and they had too much to drink, right?

334
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,040
There you go, trolls, I gave it to you.

335
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,440
But I mean, there's nothing wrong with Flutter.

336
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,920
A friend of mine, Hank, who's a very experienced developer, is doing a lot of stuff in Flutter

337
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,440
and he loves it.

338
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,200
I, for reasons that make a lot of sense to me, but we'll talk about on a different show

339
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,880
and back to doing just a crap ton of.NET and C++, and they're weirdly intermingled

340
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,000
in ways that architecturally makes sense, but with.NET 6 and Maui coming out.

341
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,280
And frankly, I would probably still pick Angular over Flutter just because I've been doing

342
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,780
it for N years.

343
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,120
And that's really the question the writer needs to ask himself, and I apologize for

344
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,200
forgetting the name.

345
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,760
If you're coming in, you know, virginal here, fine, pick whatever you fancy.

346
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,800
But if you're already an experienced developer in Angular or React or Vue or whatever, why

347
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,440
not leverage your skills to ship faster?

348
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Yeah.

349
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,680
And you pointed out the community aspect, and that's something that I don't have a real

350
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,200
good grasp on, but I can guarantee you Flutter doesn't have the larger community.

351
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,400
So I think you make a good point there as well.

352
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,000
No, but I will say, just in defense before people say I'm talking, Flutter, like I've

353
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,880
also done it every year as like a, just like Mike is playing because he's bored and his

354
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,280
son decided it was time to watch PAW Patrol.

355
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,960
And you can get very productive very quickly in Flutter.

356
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Like there is nothing technically wrong with Flutter as far as I can see, compared to the

357
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,040
other cross-platform, you know, Webby stuff.

358
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
That's a great benchmark.

359
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,120
Like, what can dad get done while a couple of episodes of something on Netflix are getting

360
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
watched?

361
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,560
Listen, while an entire city of adults who have to leave all their emergency services,

362
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,480
including the fire and police departments, up to a 10-year-old boy and a bunch of puppy

363
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,280
dogs, yes, what can dad get done while that is happening?

364
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Yes.

365
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,000
And if you're not a parent, you don't know what PAW Patrol is, don't ever look.

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,160
No, you don't want to go down that hole.

367
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,920
Trust me, you're better off.

368
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,840
Lino.com slash coder.

369
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,400
Go there to support the show and go there to get $100 in 60-day credit towards a new

370
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,240
account and try all of the things I'm about to tell you about.

371
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,240
I mean, it really is the best way to spin up something in the cloud.

372
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,200
It's 30 to 50% cheaper than the other cloud providers out there, and they've been around

373
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,240
since 2003, so they really know what they're doing.

374
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,280
And they have hundreds of guides and tutorials to help you get started.

375
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,600
There's lots of good things in there.

376
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,320
And the nice thing about that is you can read a guide and make sure you've done something

377
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,720
right and that you've put it in production.

378
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,820
But you know what I always say, it's like it really kind of matters how good the support

379
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,440
is when you are in an emergency situation.

380
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,480
And that's a bar Linode meets over and over again.

381
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,880
I hear that from the audience who've tried out Linode, and they're blown away.

382
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,960
I've heard from people who have a $5 Linode, and I've also heard from people who are running

383
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,840
a lot of different systems on there, support's really good by phone or ticket, and that matters

384
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,680
when you put something into production.

385
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,800
They have S3 compatible object storage, and we use that for all kinds of innovative things.

386
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,560
Just recently, the Clonezilla project added built-in S3 backup, so you could image a system

387
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,460
right to object storage.

388
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,640
How great is that?

389
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,320
But the question I get from people who haven't tried Linode yet, and they know that I've

390
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,900
been using it for a couple of years now, so I've got some experience, is what's the big

391
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,280
differentiator between one of the other cloud providers?

392
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,880
Well, there's a lot you could choose from out there, but none of them are quite like

393
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Linode.

394
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,960
None of them have all of the components together, the super fast networking, the extremely fast

395
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,640
rigs that just beat everybody else in performance, 11 data centers to choose from, really, really

396
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,960
high-end CPU systems with AMD EPYC processors if that's what you need, or extremely reasonably

397
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,160
priced systems for hosting a blog or a game server.

398
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,080
One click application deployments and all of that is just right there in their very

399
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,240
easy-to-use dashboard.

400
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,480
There's a lot to look at.

401
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
There's a lot to try.

402
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
So that's why I say you should really just go check it out for yourself and support the

403
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,200
show at the same time, because you're going to get $100 60-day credit.

404
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,280
So why not try it out and see what we've been saying?

405
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,480
See why it's what I've chosen now for a couple of years straight.

406
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,720
So go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

407
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,080
It's a great way to get going.

408
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,720
There's all kinds of great project management applications you can self-host to if you want

409
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,920
to help organize your team.

410
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,760
That's how I started using one of them.

411
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:45,080
And then pretty soon, I put a real-time markdown collaboration tool called HedgeDock on there.

412
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,360
And then pretty soon after that, we had NextCloud.

413
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,280
And then pretty soon after that, we had just system after system, really, matrix emails

414
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
on there.

415
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,520
Our encoding systems are on there.

416
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,040
I mean, it's really been great because each system we can kind of customize just to the

417
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
way we need it.

418
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,880
And there's lots of distributions to choose from.

419
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
So go try it out right now.

420
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,000
See what I've been saying at linode.com slash coder.

421
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
All right.

422
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,120
This is just a mess.

423
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,600
This was sent into the show and I really feel for them.

424
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,920
A hacker accessed their AWS account and rang up a massive bill.

425
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Did you see this?

426
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Did I?

427
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
50k.

428
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
50k.

429
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
And they haven't heard back from Amazon.

430
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
I'm sorry.

431
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
I took a small heart attack there.

432
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
What did you say?

433
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
Yeah.

434
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
I know.

435
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
It's a lot of money.

436
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
It is.

437
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
And you know what else the guy said?

438
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,960
His bill is usually like around $1,000 a month.

439
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,560
So he was pretty shocked.

440
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,040
He was pretty shocked when he saw a $26,000 charge from AWS.

441
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,520
How could you imagine?

442
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,800
He opened up a support case immediately and somehow the case got posted twice.

443
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,920
Because of that, the support team marked both cases as duplicates.

444
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,420
Then he had to reopen and then it was resolved again as a duplicate.

445
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,000
And now he's just trying desperately to get a hold of someone at Amazon.

446
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,880
He's emailed people directly.

447
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
He doesn't know what to do.

448
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,360
Wait, the Python script wasn't super helpful.

449
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
I know, right?

450
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,680
You know, this reminds me of the time, one time when my employer gave me the login to

451
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,840
their AWS account so I could go learn.

452
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,960
And I didn't know anything about AWS at the time.

453
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
It was brand new, really.

454
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,800
So not a lot of people did.

455
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:25,000
And I rang up $2,000 and just idling, just left a machine idling on their account.

456
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,240
$2,000 bill for a machine doing nothing.

457
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,000
We remember years ago, I had this story with Azure and they were like, although I will

458
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,920
give Microsoft one thing, if you have a rep, like, hey man, I really don't want to pay

459
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
this $10,000 bill.

460
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
They're like, yeah, we don't care.

461
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
It's fine.

462
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Yeah, that's good.

463
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Although AWS, I will say, if it's an accident and you only do it once, in my experience,

464
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,440
they do usually cut you some sort of break.

465
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,560
Yeah, as long as you can get a hold of somebody.

466
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
That's his problem, right?

467
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Hopefully.

468
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Now he's tweeting about it.

469
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
He's posting it on Hacker News.

470
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,120
You know, sending it into podcasts.

471
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,840
It's going everywhere.

472
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
Get me Deckard.

473
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
I know.

474
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,840
You got to tell a story.

475
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
All right.

476
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
Here you go.

477
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Stay a while and listen.

478
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,680
Children, we don't use platforms that we don't own until we have a developer, evangelist,

479
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,240
or rep that we have the direct contact to.

480
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,600
And not that he follows you on Twitter, but you can't DM him or her.

481
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,240
No, I want the man's or lady's email address.

482
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,640
You want to be able to call her if possible, but you don't want to be too pesky with that.

483
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,520
The email, DMs, private message, have an account, be assigned to a rep.

484
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,680
Because reps have magical admin consoles where they can make this crap go away.

485
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,480
Man, that is such a great, great point.

486
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,000
If you're going to bet the farm on somebody's platform, you better at least get a rep, right?

487
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,560
I think you just gave everyone their moment of value right there for the show, you know,

488
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,800
passing some sage wisdom.

489
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,320
So I want to run the story past you.

490
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,520
You and I have talked about Docker since the early days, like we have mentioned before.

491
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,040
I've been dying to talk about this, go ahead.

492
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:00,760
And you have commented early on, on questioning how they were going to earn real money long

493
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
term.

494
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,200
And then we've seen clearly this narrative build in the market analysis people, you know,

495
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,360
that class talk about how Docker is struggling to find a path to revenue, Docker can't figure

496
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,160
out how to monetize, etc, etc.

497
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,200
And we've seen all kinds of crazy trajectories where in quote unquote, enterprise software

498
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,440
companies will create large annual support contracts that you have to pay for.

499
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,040
And if you miss anything, you have to pay your missed time before you can get a new

500
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,160
support contract and all that kind of thing.

501
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,640
And Docker hasn't done that, even though they are very much an enterprise development tool.

502
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,160
But they do seem to have identified new pain points that their customers experience in

503
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,760
the Docker desktop for Mac and Windows, and specifically a lot of the feedback around

504
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,840
the Docker desktop application has been around how inconvenient the Docker update processes

505
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,360
and how problematic it has been for developers that are on constrained and metered connections.

506
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,840
And they've also heard a lot of complaints about how the Docker update process works.

507
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,700
And so what Docker has done is they've taken all of that feedback and figured out every

508
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,500
single pain point that they can monetize and now they have implemented a system that encourages

509
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,400
developers to skip updates by pain.

510
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:21,740
If you don't want to upgrade your Docker desktop today, you can pay to skip an update by becoming

511
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,500
a pro user.

512
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,880
Or if you're part of a team and or you have to just either update or continue to hit dismiss

513
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,100
every single day.

514
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,480
If you're part of a team that pays, a magical bit gets flipped and an option comes on in

515
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,880
the settings that allows you to suppress these notifications.

516
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,680
So it's time for another New Jersey story.

517
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Okay.

518
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
Very good.

519
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,440
And by popular demand on Twitter, which tells you how many of our more Egon, this one's

520
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
for you.

521
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
Oh, Egon.

522
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
I don't know, man.

523
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
I don't know if he's out there anymore.

524
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
I'm starting to doubt it.

525
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,400
I'm pretty sure he's in IRC right now, actually.

526
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Get a hobby.

527
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
That's right, Egon.

528
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Get a hobby.

529
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,960
So gather around, children.

530
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,480
It seems an awful lot like, and Chris, we love Docker, right?

531
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,000
We had them on when they were still cloud nine.

532
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Something like that.

533
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
Using lots of our infrastructures and containers these days.

534
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Lots lots of containers.

535
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,580
A lot of mine is still too.

536
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,920
But it seems like that's a very stable setup you've got there.

537
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,860
Be a shame if there was an update and something happened to it.

538
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,620
Why don't you pay us for support?

539
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,280
Are you in the middle of a project and don't want to change your environment?

540
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,040
Pay for support and we won't upgrade everything on you.

541
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,600
This feels gross.

542
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,880
And this is where the audience is going to hate me.

543
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,040
You have to have a way to make money from your work going in.

544
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,200
The problem that they have is Docker...

545
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,720
We won't do the Deckard Cain thing again, but we really, really, really should.

546
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,660
They were a VPN hosting company, children.

547
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:57,560
And they were just trying to sell you VPNs and Docker was an easy way to deploy any development

548
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
stack.

549
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,020
They had never heard of Heroku.

550
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,720
And then Dooku came, built on Docker, screwing them over completely, because Linode will

551
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,040
give you a server for like five bucks.

552
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,940
I mean, it really does seem to like underscore that whole they can't figure out how to monetize

553
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,880
this thing and they're just pulling every little possible straw they can.

554
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,160
I mean, traditionally, you have paid to receive updates, not to avoid updates.

555
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,840
That's the core shift here.

556
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,480
But the thing that I think that is kind of inexcusable, because I can kind of understand

557
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,720
some kind of system like this, although 24 hour nagging is a bit much.

558
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,760
But they don't use the native OS notification API.

559
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,200
So you can't just like D&D your box and then avoid these annoying messages.

560
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,360
You know, I don't think that's better.

561
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:49,080
They are taking a problem they have because of some questionable monetization choices.

562
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,220
The way it happened was Docker being the product ended up being an accident for them.

563
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,080
They thought it was like a value add their secret sauce to their hosting thing.

564
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,160
Their directory, their tools around it.

565
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,520
Well, they had a bunch of crap, right?

566
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,520
They had a bunch of stuff they were trying to sell you.

567
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,200
And I'm not saying it was crap in terms of bad, but they I mean, ultimately, I bet if

568
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,400
they could have gone back, they wish Docker had been more proprietary.

569
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,940
Like maybe with this weird open source version that was gimped, but ultimately commercial,

570
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,600
because what they're effectively doing is, as you say, they're inverting the enterprise

571
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,680
software licensing model, instead of saying, All right, well, you know what, it's open

572
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,800
source up until this point, and now we're closed sourcing it and blah, blah, blah.

573
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,880
They're saying it is open source forever.

574
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,040
But if you don't want to get hammered by updates that destabilize your infrastructure, you

575
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,600
need to pay us, which I mean, sleaziness, right?

576
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Yeah.

577
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Or is it just me?

578
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,160
Where it crosses the line to kind of gross for me is when I read the blog, and they kind

579
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,920
of point by point, break down how they, quote, heard from our community about these problems.

580
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,200
And they kind of identified clay, they clearly, you can kind of see how the whole thing worked.

581
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,160
The team sat down and identified all of the complaints from user surveys and feedback,

582
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,780
and went line by line on the whiteboard and figured out how to turn each one of those

583
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,040
complaints into money.

584
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,720
And that's the part I really don't like.

585
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,800
And it doesn't really affect me because Docker desktop is Mac and Windows only.

586
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,480
But for this story, I gave it a go.

587
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
And it's, it's pretty good.

588
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
You know, it's pretty nice.

589
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,160
It's, it's not bad.

590
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
It's not great.

591
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,920
You know, I don't necessarily feel like I'm missing much by not having it.

592
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:31,160
But I could totally understand how developers who don't come from a Linux first background,

593
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,440
but want to take advantage of containers on their desktop of choice, would use a tool

594
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
like this.

595
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,400
And, you know, I'd be forced to go pro if I was in the middle of a project.

596
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,280
Like you say, I'm not gonna sit there and upgrade.

597
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,320
I just, I don't even do it now on Linux.

598
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,920
I don't upgrade Docker in the middle of some like review or something like that, unless

599
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
it's part of it.

600
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,400
But I am running OS two, like my grandfather before me.

601
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
That's how you should.

602
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:01,640
It's good OS, you know, it's OS two warp speed, if we all remember, the, the time OS two completely

603
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,120
blew my mind is I didn't realize this is how IBM did it with their mainframes.

604
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,540
But you take like the system 390 mainframes, they're some of their big boxes.

605
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,840
And in the front of the mainframe, or somewhere in the mainframe is an entirely separate 486

606
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,000
or at the time, that's what it was, it was probably something different PC, there's like

607
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,960
an entirely second PC inside the mainframe, a PC within the, well, the mainframe is not

608
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
a PC.

609
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
But you know what I'm saying?

610
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,760
And that machine, that old 486 that's inside the mainframe runs OS two.

611
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,040
And so when you connect to the mainframe, you do it through a terminal emulator on OS

612
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
two.

613
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,680
So when you turn on the screen that's on the front of the mainframe, which is kind of like

614
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,520
this big console area, that's this awesome, like sitting area that looks like a Batman

615
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,080
Batcave computer.

616
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,720
The screen is actually OS two and the keyboards connected to an OS two box with a terminal

617
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,040
that connects to the mainframe operating system.

618
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
It's pretty awesome.

619
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,360
That was my, that was my experience with OS two.

620
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:02,240
But I just think it's wild to see Docker doing this and I, I disagree with you on the notification

621
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
thing.

622
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,340
It's like fine, you want to nag me every 24 hours to update.

623
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,480
That's one thing.

624
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,000
But if you, if you integrate it with the OS, my desktop notification system, I can turn

625
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,880
those off while I'm working.

626
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,320
I can't turn this off while I'm working.

627
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,000
And that, that drives me nuts when applications implement their own notification system.

628
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,640
Just oh, not having it.

629
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,960
And you know, this was sent in to us via Twitter and, and the, the listener that sent it into

630
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,360
us was exactly in that situation.

631
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,720
He's like, I am in the middle of a project and you're telling me I have to pay not to

632
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,880
update right now?

633
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,240
I just restarted my computer.

634
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,240
That's all I did.

635
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,560
You know, I just rebooted it.

636
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,040
No, I restarted Docker desktop and I'm getting this prompt to upgrade or pay.

637
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Give me a break.

638
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
I just want to say this.

639
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:53,280
If you run an enterprise software company, devs are moody folks, maybe annoying them

640
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,320
while they're in the middle of a project.

641
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,280
I think there's a non-zero chance they just don't like use your product again.

642
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,280
Yeah, that's definitely, actually, you know what, it's funny you say that because I'd

643
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,960
say one of the top responses I saw in comment sections was, well, hey, have you heard of

644
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Podman?

645
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,640
Podman is this, you know, alternative.

646
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,440
Like I saw that a lot.

647
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,180
So people do start looking for another option and people start are very, people are so happy

648
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,080
in the comments to recommend the underdog alternative.

649
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,160
They'll just, you can always find it out there.

650
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,840
Datadog.com slash coder radio.

651
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,760
Analyze code level performance across your environment and troubleshoot issues faster

652
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,040
with Datadog.

653
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,960
Save time with Datadog and communicate.

654
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,440
Datadog's continuous profiler automatically collects profiles from your production servers

655
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,760
all the time so you can analyze any of your data quickly with minimal overhead.

656
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,040
You get a unified picture of your environment by correlating your code performance with

Free t-shirt?

670
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Free shirts?

671
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Okay.

672
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,360
I don't, I haven't gotten a free shirt in years.

673
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,560
Been like too seriously, almost feels like 120 years actually.

674
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,960
I could use a t-shirt Datadog.

675
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Datadog.

676
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
Go get one for me.

677
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,300
Datadog.com slash coder radio.

678
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,080
So I don't know if you're following, let's just cover this briefly just so we have captured

679
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
it.

680
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,480
I'm just showing some of the highlights that are coming out of the Apple versus Epic trial.

681
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,520
It's already underway.

682
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,040
I can't believe the speed that this thing's moving at.

683
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:18,320
And basically Epic's lawyers are arguing that iOS should just be more like macOS.

684
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,880
Still have strong security and privacy standards, but allow a gatekeeper type system where third

685
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,540
party applications can be run with some work.

686
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:30,440
They even suggest that Apple should make it kind of hard so that way you can't just roll

687
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:36,120
up on a third party app and install it, but that you have to go through a bit of a rigamarole.

688
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,400
That's what they want and that's going to be their core argument going through this

689
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
entire thing.

690
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,480
And then they're going to lay out all these examples of Apple not managing the app store

691
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,640
properly and argue that that's the reason that you should allow third party sideloading

692
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
on the iPhone.

693
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,160
You think they're going to be able to pull it off?

694
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
No.

695
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Probably not, huh?

696
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,600
They have gotten some juicy, juicy deets out there though.

697
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,480
I like the hater raid for iMessage on Android.

698
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,860
That was unrelated to the actual question, but every time we feel like, well, why would

699
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,000
Apple be like that?

700
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
They're like that.

701
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,920
It also revealed a conversation where Apple was aware of some bogus versions of Xcode

702
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,080
getting some systems compromised and information compromised and Apple just couldn't really

703
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,420
be bothered to go through the problem of contacting all the individually affected people in their

704
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,240
own native languages, so they just kind of forgot about that.

705
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,160
I feel like we've been covering the story in a way for years, but it's been Mike's Conspiracy

706
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,960
Theory tinfoil hat hour, but Apple is the big company that we've always said they are

707
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,440
and things that don't make financial sense for them, they don't do.

708
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,520
You look at it though and I think they are going to face a reckoning and what happens

709
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,240
here will lay the ground for the next battle.

710
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,600
Just look at podcast subscriptions.

711
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,400
Apple doesn't have to pay a 30% tax when you subscribe.

712
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,700
Apple doesn't have to pay that fee, right?

713
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,800
For Apple, they're paying cost.

714
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,280
But if Spotify wanted to enable subscriptions to podcasts through the Spotify app on iOS,

715
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,680
they would have to give 30% of that subscription to Apple and then Spotify would have to take

716
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,240
their cut and then whatever's left would go to the podcaster and it's literally not tenable.

717
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,440
But because Apple owns the platform and Apple owns the payment process and Apple has the

718
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,520
customer by the balls, they can offer a competing service at a lower cost than anyone else on

719
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,880
the platform can.

720
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,960
And ultimately, I think that kind of combination of an issue is going to be problematic at

721
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
least for them.

722
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Right.

723
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,220
But asking Apple not to use their insane platform control in a monopolistic way is like asking

724
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,120
my dog if I drop a steak on the floor not to eat it.

725
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
Yeah.

726
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,680
I mean, they built the platform, they built the app store and they built the payment information

727
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,120
and they got the customer to put their payment information into that platform.

728
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
Right.

729
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:52,400
Or it's like if you and I are in Colorado and we're at System76 and I'm drinking, asking

730
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,000
me not to buy five or six Thalios, it's going to happen, right?

731
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,440
So fighting me is only going to create a scene and that's what Epic's doing.

732
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
They're fighting Apple.

733
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,120
Apple's like, until someone stops us, until the farmer gets a rifle out and puts barbed

734
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,960
wire around the chicken coop, we're wolves, man.

735
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
We're eating all the chickens.

736
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,720
I don't know what to tell you.

737
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,160
Epic seems to be going for a bit of an emotional appeal, sort of like look at what's happening

738
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,360
here and Apple's kind of going for more of a just the facts kind of approach.

739
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
I'm sorry to gender.

740
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
I'm sorry for this.

741
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,160
But Chris, you and I were both boys in high school once.

742
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,520
Yeah, as far as I know.

743
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:35,360
Is it not true that the bigger, stronger boys tend to push around, dare I say, use their

744
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,680
better position against the weaker, nerdier boys?

745
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,720
I think you could even take the analogy even further.

746
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,900
Apple isn't a high school student.

747
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,660
Apple is the high school.

748
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,880
Apple is the administrative staff of a high school.

749
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
Oh, yeah.

750
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,120
And if the high school wants to sell cookies in the cafeteria, they're going to have a

751
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,280
monopoly on the cookie market in the cafeteria.

752
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,080
Yeah, it's why a Coca Cola in my high school cost weirdly like 350.

753
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Yeah.

754
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,240
And why we have like these ginormous chocolate chip cookies that were clearly unhealthy for

755
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,280
teenagers to be eating the size of my face.

756
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,320
Why are you selling me soda at a 300% markup?

757
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,280
Oh, you need money.

758
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Got it.

759
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Yeah.

760
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
I wonder.

761
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,280
We'll see.

762
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,160
There's been a lot of little juicy things here and there coming up.

763
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,700
But ultimately, I love that apparently the epics lawyers epics lawyers are listening

764
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,480
to the Coderadio program because it was about six months ago that I suggested that Apple

765
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,100
should just do a gatekeeper style third party loading where you plug the phone in, it mounts

766
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
under finder.

767
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
Never gonna happen.

768
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
I know.

769
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Never, ever gonna happen.

770
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
That's all it would take, though.

771
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,100
That's all it would take.

772
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,120
Best case scenario, you can use a different payment form in your apps.

773
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,120
That would be good, too.

774
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,360
That really that really would that would really be good.

775
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,080
And then Apple's going to trot out every horror story of some some group getting ripped off

776
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,840
and you know, they're going to do it.

777
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,720
Before we go, I wanted to just chat really quickly about remote work because it's just

778
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,680
been an ongoing topic for us.

779
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,800
And there was an article about the 10 best practices for remote software engineering.

780
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,640
You know, one of these standard, you know, things that we'll see from time to time.

781
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,380
And it's like, number one, work on things you care about.

782
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,680
Number two, define goals for yourself, that kind of stuff.

783
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
Right.

784
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,140
And what I found fascinating, we'll have a link to this in the show notes, is the hacker

785
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:23,120
news comments that if you read these from the perspective of a boss or manager should

786
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,300
scare you shitless from ever employing remote workers.

787
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,520
Like here's an example from someone from 14 days ago said, I stopped being able to get

788
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,480
work done at all when they transitioned to work from home.

789
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,760
It gradually tipped me into a low self esteem death spiral.

790
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,840
I tried lots of different approaches to fix it.

791
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:48,520
More accountability with my manager, new medication, more regular exercise, therapy, a bit of disability

792
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
leave.

793
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,640
I even moved to a bigger apartment where I could have my own office, but nothing got

794
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,280
me past my block.

795
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,440
I quit my job.

796
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,160
I spent six months studying and interviewing aggressively and got hired at a higher level

797
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,520
position at a different company.

798
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,880
Somebody responds, I'm in the same boat right now and goes on and on about how they just

799
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,080
can't get any work done.

800
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
More people.

801
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,720
In fact, hundreds of people in this hacker news thread, a lot of them complain about

802
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,320
ADHD, official diagnosis, my kids have it.

803
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,200
If something's interesting, I can focus, but when I work from home, remote work is the

804
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,560
worst for me.

805
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,400
Staying on task is a nightmare, this person says.

806
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
I've tried medication.

807
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,320
I was on Adderall for a while, but it just doesn't work for me.

808
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,400
When I get blocked, things are boring and it's painful.

809
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,960
I can't even function.

810
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,440
I've tried to stimulate myself.

811
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:42,520
I've tried to change my focus, but I get so sleepy and my work is absolute crap.

812
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,400
These are all people and I mean, Mike, you can see the link in the show notes.

813
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,000
This thing's full of hundreds of comments, 200 comments from people talking about how

814
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,660
they just can't function at home, about how they're struggling to get anything done.

815
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:02,640
Some of them are in very dark places and I feel like there is this dirty side to work

816
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:09,840
from home and homework and remote workers where it truly does not work for some individuals.

817
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:14,920
This last year and change, people that maybe didn't work so well for were forced into doing

818
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,760
and now we're starting to see more of those accounts because it's not people that were

819
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,760
electing to work from home necessarily, but had to now.

820
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,600
What I am seeing here is a clear sign to me that remote workers could be a huge risk and

821
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:34,360
that you have to pick very carefully for the right personality type to work in isolation

822
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,320
like that because this thread is full of misery.

823
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:44,200
So definitely working from home has been more challenging than it used to be for sure.

824
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,600
To the point of I've had to actually hire some childcare to get some crap in order.

825
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,400
When you sent me the link, let's just go through my mental state here.

826
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,480
I thought I was just going to dunk on a bunch of babies whining, but I kind of felt there

827
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
were pain.

828
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:07,640
I don't have any of those diagnosed ADHD and God bless people who do, but I also have a

829
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,880
very recent five-year-old, he just turned five actually a couple of weeks ago.

830
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,840
He sees Visual Studio, he sees Ruby Mine and PyCharm and what he sees is pretty colors

831
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,240
and why can't I do some?

832
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,240
Yeah, sure.

833
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,440
So that's tough.

834
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,680
I find myself working a lot of odd hours.

835
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,880
I find myself now that I have childcare kind of working from home in the mornings when

836
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:38,580
he's at school, but more and more, it's just easier to take the X1 or the MacBook, whichever

837
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:44,080
I'm working on that day or even the Lemur if I'm working on that to like not Starbucks,

838
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,640
but we have a local coffee shop that no one would care about if they didn't live in Lithia.

839
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,600
But it's tough.

840
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,520
I think part of it is the lack of childcare options and I know this is going to become

841
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:00,920
dad or radio if we don't stop soon, but that has been for me personally, tremendously disruptive

842
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,720
because all aftercare was canceled and I also went through a major life change in this last

843
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,960
period that made my home-bound childcare option did not work anymore.

844
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,200
Yeah, our kids were out of school for a huge chunk of time and there was a lot of juggling.

845
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,560
I totally also was going to dunk on all these people and then as I started reading, I understand

846
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,220
because it's even sometimes harder when you're self-employed because you got to kind of wake

847
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:32,040
up in the morning and you got to get stuff done, but nobody's making you do it.

848
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,820
And if you lose track of something, nobody's going to make sure that you didn't drop the

849
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,440
ball on something.

850
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:44,380
And so it makes tracking the details of what you're doing necessary and it makes self-motivation

851
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:49,500
necessary, which can be very hard things that are in short supply when you're stressed out

852
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,080
and stretched too thin.

853
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,080
And that's why I was complaining about my scheduling snafu earlier in the show because

854
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,320
it's like, I've just totally put myself in this situation now.

855
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,040
It's just a total EMP goes off in my schedule and I completely understand and I think what

856
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:11,800
people have to do is, this sounds so cliche, but they have to come up with a system.

857
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,400
They have to hold themselves accountable to come up with a system and a structure that

858
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,060
works for themselves because nobody else is going to create it.

859
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:24,040
And it's sink or swim sometimes and there's so many benefits to be able to work from home,

860
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:28,080
but I have absolutely found that there is some work that is just simply better done

861
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,080
in the office.

862
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,080
Absolutely.

863
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,220
Design, database design, I find anything where you need a chalkboard or a whiteboard.

864
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,120
And I will say, what was interesting to me about this article when you put it in our

865
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:44,000
Slack was I viewed this from a total like dad radio perspective, right?

866
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,140
Healthcare practicalities stresses you out over time, really tough.

867
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:57,280
But these folks with ADD and ADHD and there was a bunch of people with other kind of troubles.

868
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,480
I think there's a larger set of people than you or I have ever thought about, I can't

869
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,680
speak for you, but I have ever thought about that have a larger set of complications with

870
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,680
remote work.

871
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,680
I'm going to say problems, right?

872
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,520
They're not really problems there, they make it harder.

873
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,520
I don't know.

874
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,920
I'm hoping with the vaccine and everything, many of these go away, but you saw the thing

875
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,920
about Facebook, right?

876
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,580
They just said anybody who wants to work remotely may do so if they fill out a form and apply.

877
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:33,080
So I think this change, we've been talking about it for years, but I think the change,

878
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,960
this is the year of the Linux, I'm sorry, no, not that this is the year of the remote

879
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,960
work.

880
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,960
Yes, it is.

881
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Absolutely.

882
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,880
There are places like Facebook that embrace it and then we'll see if they kind of pull

883
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,520
back like we've seen some shops do in the past or if they'll find a balance.

884
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,200
And I know for myself, one of the hardest things about getting motivated when I was

885
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,640
working from home for a company was that white space between meetings was just such a killer

886
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,280
because I couldn't start anything because I had a meeting in an hour and I just got

887
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,520
out of a meeting or something like that, a half hour, whatever it might be, or two hours

888
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,520
even.

889
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,080
It's just you really don't want to get in the groove of something if you're going to

890
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,120
have to stop in an hour and 45 minutes if it takes you a half hour to 15 minutes or

891
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,400
whatever to get in the groove.

892
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
And that killed me.

893
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,360
And the way I kind of overcame that, and it's not all that surprising, is I just started

894
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,760
blocking out more time and started rejecting a few meetings.

895
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,560
And I was surprised how far I could take that, but that is not good advice necessarily.

896
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,960
But sometimes your own mental health is worth it and that's just something to consider.

897
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,120
And I'd love to know your tips and tricks for managing and mitigating this kind of

898
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,360
stuff out there if you've kind of tackled this and come out on the other end of this

899
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,960
and have some wisdom to share or have any comments or questions on anything we've talked
