00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
This is Koda Radio, episode 461 for April 11th, 2022.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.360
Hello good looking and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:19.360 --> 00:25.200
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.240
I'm sitting here in a toasty, rawly North Carolina.

00:28.240 --> 00:33.440
My name is Chris and joining us from a swampy Florida, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:33.440 --> 00:34.440
Hello, Mike.

00:34.440 --> 00:35.440
Hello, Chris.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.440
Hello, sir.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.440
Hello.

00:37.440 --> 00:38.440
Hello.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.320
And we should say welcome back to the show, Mr. Payne.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.320
Hello, Wes.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.320
Oh, hey, boys.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.920
If I only knew the words to welcome back Cotter.

00:45.920 --> 00:51.560
We're glad to have you here, Wes, and it worked out perfect too, because we were all gathered

00:51.560 --> 00:55.840
together here in Alex's bed and breakfast, also known as house, and you were floating

00:55.840 --> 00:58.160
through and I said, come on, sit down, let's do a show.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.520
Let's do a little Cotter, because the audience has been wanting to hear from you.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.800
And it's been too long since I got to talk to Mike.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.800
Yeah.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.040
So we're gathered here together today.

01:08.040 --> 01:11.800
Although it looks like I was looking over the Twitter, as you know, I stalk Mike.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.840
And it looks like you were having some car troubles this week.

01:14.840 --> 01:15.900
Ah, yes.

01:15.900 --> 01:21.440
Once again, technology destroys a perfectly good mechanical device.

01:21.440 --> 01:25.440
Apparently the computer in my car has decided that there shall be no fuel injected into

01:25.440 --> 01:26.440
my engine.

01:26.440 --> 01:27.720
Oh, no.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.760
And it decided this while I was in the car.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.020
Oh, yes.

01:31.020 --> 01:33.520
So that was a double toe job.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.400
And I'm still waiting to double toe job.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.920
Now that sounds like we're going to explicit rating.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.920
And yes, I will.

01:38.920 --> 01:43.400
I will update the audience whenever GM decides to do something about it.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.900
Man, oh, man, that sucks.

01:45.900 --> 01:48.680
That's just one of those wrenches in your life you never expect.

01:48.680 --> 01:51.100
And it's just not easy to deal with.

01:51.100 --> 01:54.540
You know, Optimus Gray in the chat room points out, this might be one of the few times we

01:54.540 --> 02:00.120
do this here Koder radio program when we're in the same time zone.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.120
That's weird.

02:01.120 --> 02:05.640
And you know, you have Koder is like an after lunch thing for you.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.640
Yeah.

02:06.640 --> 02:07.640
Right.

02:07.640 --> 02:09.440
And for me, it's like a pre-lunch thing.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.820
I'm in a totally different time space than you normally.

02:12.820 --> 02:14.720
So maybe this episode is going to be a little weird.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.720
I don't know.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.040
Or you'll be in more in sync than ever.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.040
Maybe.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.040
Well, we're going to find out.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.040
We're going to find out.

02:21.040 --> 02:25.440
Either way, I think everybody is taking a breath of fresh air, a sigh of relief.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.040
Elon's not going to be on the board.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.560
I know you're looking forward to it, Mike.

02:28.560 --> 02:29.560
I really was, actually.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.600
Yeah, actually, I agree.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.760
I was so down for that.

02:32.760 --> 02:33.760
Yeah.

02:33.760 --> 02:36.680
Today, they announced, oh, he's not going to be on the board as we record today.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.460
And there's all kinds of theories this morning as to why.

02:39.460 --> 02:43.600
Do you guys have personal pet theories as to why Elon decided not to go on the board

02:43.600 --> 02:44.600
of Twitter?

02:44.600 --> 02:47.680
Tesla AI told him not to.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.520
It steered him right away from the board meeting.

02:50.520 --> 02:51.520
I like Wes's better.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.520
Mine is dumb.

02:52.520 --> 02:57.360
I think he just realized the SEC was probably not going to put up with his shenanigans forever.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.360
I could see that.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.360
I could see that.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.760
Because he screwed up the filing, too, right?

03:00.760 --> 03:02.560
I think, too, they had a little talking.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.880
Because if you read through this really strange announcement, there's two things that stick

03:05.880 --> 03:06.880
out.

03:06.880 --> 03:07.880
So weird.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.880
First of all, they mentioned a background check.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.400
Why do you even say that?

03:12.400 --> 03:16.500
And then the other thing they mention in here is that he has a fiduciary responsibility

03:16.500 --> 03:20.080
to limit what he says, essentially, is what they say about the company.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.600
You have to kind of agree to only talk about certain things when you're a member of the

03:23.600 --> 03:24.600
board.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.640
It limits what you can say about Twitter.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.000
And I think that was it.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I think he's like, no way.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.760
I wonder why he hasn't done this before.

03:31.760 --> 03:36.160
Why don't Bezos and Musk and Buffet, why don't they buy all these companies up?

03:36.160 --> 03:37.160
You know what?

03:37.160 --> 03:38.160
Just-

03:38.160 --> 03:39.160
I guess Bezos does it sometimes, right?

03:39.160 --> 03:40.160
Washington Post at least.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.160
True.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.160
True.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.160
Monsters.

03:43.160 --> 03:44.160
That's a good point.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.160
All right.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.160
Well, let's move on.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.160
Boostergram.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.960
Boostergram came in from Freak three days ago, 6,000 sats, too.

03:50.960 --> 03:55.060
So he just recently switched all over from Android to iOS.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.340
Rest in peace, Freak.

03:56.340 --> 04:00.080
And he says the one thing that's driving him crazy is he wants to slap his iDevice when

04:00.080 --> 04:04.080
it autocorrects the last word after he presses send.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.340
Android never did that, he said.

04:06.340 --> 04:08.660
That is probably the most annoying thing about iOS.

04:08.660 --> 04:12.960
I can't tell you how many times the F word has been replaced with duck after I hit the

04:12.960 --> 04:13.960
send button.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.500
Like, what the duck, you know?

04:16.500 --> 04:17.880
I did not realize this was the thing.

04:17.880 --> 04:22.040
Now it's been, I don't know, six years since I regularly had an iPhone, but is that a new

04:22.040 --> 04:23.040
development?

04:23.040 --> 04:24.040
No, it's been-

04:24.040 --> 04:27.880
I mean, they've been trying to machine learn how to autocorrect for a while, so maybe it's

04:27.880 --> 04:28.880
gotten worse.

04:28.880 --> 04:29.880
I don't know.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.440
But yeah, it's been like that for a bit.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.440
Yeah.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.440
Yeah, that does stink.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.440
You poor devils.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.440
I know.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.440
I don't know how we do it.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.440
I don't.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.960
We got another boost from Cospeland.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.360
He says, okay, guys, what are your thoughts on iCloud versus NextCloud?

04:43.360 --> 04:44.360
What would be the point?

04:44.360 --> 04:45.360
And thanks for the show.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.080
It feels like two separate solutions.

04:47.080 --> 04:51.680
I don't know, you'd use NextCloud if you don't want to be on somebody else's cloud.

04:51.680 --> 04:52.680
That's it.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.080
I can also see maybe you want, you know, you use bits and pieces, like you might need iCloud

04:56.080 --> 04:59.840
for some of the iOS specific backup kind of things, right?

04:59.840 --> 05:01.760
But you don't have to do it for everything.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.560
You could self host some of the pieces you wanted in your NextCloud.

05:04.560 --> 05:08.080
I can see the appeal, like maybe Mike would want to set one up for like his team at some

05:08.080 --> 05:09.080
point.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.080
I don't know.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.640
But most people are not using iCloud for the same stuff.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.400
Yeah, I don't see iCloud in like a work environment.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.400
I know Apple is supposedly coming out with something like that, some kind of like small

05:19.400 --> 05:20.400
business program.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.400
But I don't know.

05:21.400 --> 05:25.720
When I think iCloud, I still have scars from core data iCloud having to implement it and

05:25.720 --> 05:27.840
just the massive sync bugs.

05:27.840 --> 05:34.080
We had several people that boosted in, boost, asking if they could boost us from the member

05:34.080 --> 05:35.840
feed, which we have not set up.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.080
It's amazing they'd like to do that, but not right now.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.920
But it has us talking internally about how we could do that.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.520
We all shows feed did just get the possibility to boost.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.000
I just added that before we left.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Nicely done, sir.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Pure, pure, pure.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
All right.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
So it looks like something's going on with tea, which is a package manager that is an

05:53.000 --> 05:54.960
alternative to brew.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.680
Harold wrote in and I said, I thought maybe you guys would want to take a closer look

05:58.680 --> 05:59.780
at this.

05:59.780 --> 06:06.000
Did you notice that they pitched themselves as brew two for web three brew two for, yeah,

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
web.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Sorry.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Oh, little nauseous.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
So there's something blockchain.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.320
I'm just curious, did we ever get to the bottom of what is blockchain about this new package

06:13.320 --> 06:14.320
manager?

06:14.320 --> 06:16.040
You know, I haven't had a chance to actually try tea.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.080
I'm not sure.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.360
Let's find out though.

06:18.360 --> 06:22.040
I'm looking at it and I don't get it.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.720
I don't, I don't get it.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.040
How much money did they raise exactly?

06:25.040 --> 06:26.040
Oh yeah.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.040
Did they raise money?

06:27.040 --> 06:28.040
They raised money.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.600
This is not, so I think this is my mistake.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.680
I thought this was just like a, you know, a successor from brew, like by the creator

06:34.680 --> 06:36.680
of well brew.

06:36.680 --> 06:40.940
It also seems to have like slightly wider ambitions, maybe wherever you develop, wherever

06:40.940 --> 06:47.600
your CICD runs, however you deploy your app, tea is there, which is, you know, with their

06:47.600 --> 06:48.600
$8 million.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.600
Oh.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.600
Oh.

06:50.600 --> 06:56.280
So this is, this is not, this is a somewhat commercial, which is this my open core dreams

06:56.280 --> 06:57.760
coming true?

06:57.760 --> 07:01.240
Maybe, but now with a web three name.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.240
Of course.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.000
Well, you have to get the VC to open your email somehow.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Hmm.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
So this is probably going to warrant further investigation.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
$8 million.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Look at this.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.640
To create a new open source software on the blockchain.

07:13.640 --> 07:14.640
Yeah.

07:14.640 --> 07:18.200
It's like, you know, for a while we were seeing everybody bacon machine learning and AI into

07:18.200 --> 07:19.200
their product description.

07:19.200 --> 07:24.160
And it's like blockchain was a fad before that and then AI took over and now blockchain's

07:24.160 --> 07:25.160
back again.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.160
Blockchain's back baby.

07:26.160 --> 07:32.160
And you know, I gotta say just for the record, like I don't think there's a lot of strong

07:32.160 --> 07:37.400
use cases for blockchain outside a distributed ledger for a currency.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.400
Like it's really good at that.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.440
But a lot of times when you see what they're using a blockchain for you go, well that could

07:42.440 --> 07:43.920
just also be a database.

07:43.920 --> 07:44.920
Hmm.

07:44.920 --> 07:45.920
Yeah.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.120
And it's like they're using blockchain because it's like cool and stuff, but you know, blockchains

07:49.120 --> 07:53.080
are in order to be secure, they're generally not very fast and if they're not very fast

07:53.080 --> 07:56.400
and they don't seem to scale what like would you would in theory want for something like

07:56.400 --> 07:57.400
a package manager?

07:57.400 --> 07:58.400
Yeah.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.160
You know, they mentioned being decentralized, but exactly how?

08:01.160 --> 08:02.160
Hmm.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.160
Yeah.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.680
Don't you want your package manager to in fact be centralized somewhat so that you can

08:05.680 --> 08:06.680
trust?

08:06.680 --> 08:07.680
I think so.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.960
I mean, I think maybe you want both, but.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.560
Well, so we've just reinvented PPAs.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.560
Congratulations.

08:13.560 --> 08:19.120
A couple of weeks ago we read an email from listener Brandon who has a big old raspberry

08:19.120 --> 08:20.760
pie cluster going on.

08:20.760 --> 08:21.760
Hooey.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.760
Hooey.

08:22.760 --> 08:27.800
So he's got three pies and a single pie four and all three are powered with power over

08:27.800 --> 08:29.200
Ethernet, which is awesome.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.640
So he's got a little switch to do that.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.860
They run Ubuntu with Ubuntu's Kubernetes K3 solution.

08:35.860 --> 08:40.140
He's got terabyte hard drives connected to them and then he makes all of the K pods available

08:40.140 --> 08:42.780
via NFS.

08:42.780 --> 08:43.780
This is so cool.

08:43.780 --> 08:49.060
He said, I had a job requirement for me to learn Kubernetes very quickly in order to

08:49.060 --> 08:53.400
lead a team building and deploy and that was deploying the K workload.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.720
So he sets up this big old cluster here.

08:55.720 --> 08:59.280
He's like, it's not really a big deal, but you know, it's kind of a fun project and if

08:59.280 --> 09:04.440
any listeners have a few raspberry pies laying around, it's definitely worth a go.

09:04.440 --> 09:07.280
Also it's been astounding to watch the show's 180 on blockchain and web 3 tech.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.640
I left the initial episode from last year feeling pretty unhappy about the general sentiment

09:10.640 --> 09:14.040
on the show, so it's been good to see a more nuanced take on the tech.

09:14.040 --> 09:18.800
The state of the tech in the politics is intersecting and it's actually been pretty piss poor lately.

09:18.800 --> 09:22.040
So it's nice to see some people with big ideas trying to create a better future, regardless

09:22.040 --> 09:25.000
of how it goes or if it's likely planned to go.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.160
Anyways, thanks for the show, Brandon.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.720
Well, there you go.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.260
We got a lot of shit for talking about blockchain stuff.

09:32.260 --> 09:34.160
We got a lot of shit for that.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.200
We had some good positive feedback too.

09:36.200 --> 09:41.080
You know, I also like in that feedback that you hear a lot kind of just the blasé statement

09:41.080 --> 09:45.560
that yeah, raspberry pies are great to learn on and all this, but it's just neat to see

09:45.560 --> 09:49.320
you really can use like some just cheapo devices you have at home to set up a cluster that

09:49.320 --> 09:51.320
actually helps you in a work environment.

09:51.320 --> 09:55.080
Yeah, it's not exactly the same, but you learn a lot of really useful skills.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.080
You can put SUSE on there.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.080
You can put SUSE on there.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.080
You can put open SUSE on there.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.080
Or NixOS maybe.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.080
Yeah.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.080
Yeah.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.080
Or Ubuntu.

10:02.080 --> 10:05.800
All right, last email that comes in.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.880
Now, here's the thing.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.920
This is a thing we're gonna have to deal with as a show, but we're gonna get through this

10:11.920 --> 10:13.400
together, okay?

10:13.400 --> 10:15.280
We're gonna get through this together.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.680
Five is leading a manhunt.

10:17.680 --> 10:24.560
So at the meetup this week, Mike was unable to attend, and there began a contingent that

10:24.560 --> 10:31.520
broke off that sort of has created this conspiracy bacon that's completely ridiculous that Mike

10:31.520 --> 10:35.840
and I are the same person, and Mike is just a voice that I'm doing.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.680
So I mean, that's absolutely crazy, but Five writes in.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.560
He says, you know, I flew all the way from Minneapolis to talk to Mike about the only

10:42.560 --> 10:47.720
real macOS that I would ever think of compiling Objective-C on, Next Step.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.480
That's a bold, bold statement, sir.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.480
Bold.

10:50.480 --> 10:54.520
But he said, you know what, Chris got to find out I'm not a jerk in real life, just a digital

10:54.520 --> 10:55.520
space.

10:55.520 --> 11:00.300
Also, he pointed out that the super spreader tent was great, but wasn't the same without

11:00.300 --> 11:02.440
our famous Floridian.

11:02.440 --> 11:06.320
So one of the things Alex did is he brought a tent where we put like name tags and a book.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.920
Where is that damn book?

11:07.920 --> 11:09.680
That is a very good question.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.000
We had over a hundred people, around a hundred people show up.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.360
And a good turnout of Coder fans, that's for sure.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.360
Definitely.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.360
Definitely.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.840
I think there's plotting to go down to Florida now.

11:18.840 --> 11:23.480
I mean, I didn't tell them to go for it, but like I said, this group just sort of broke

11:23.480 --> 11:24.480
off on their own.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.480
We tried to control them.

11:25.480 --> 11:30.000
Well, you know, you can always like hire an actor when you're doing this voice, right?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.320
So that's true.

11:32.320 --> 11:36.760
I think it worked out for the best though, because, you know, I was a little, I was like

11:36.760 --> 11:39.160
thinking, do I need to like wear a mask?

11:39.160 --> 11:43.000
Like how do I make sure that we don't meet at this meetup because I don't want to mess

11:43.000 --> 11:44.160
with the show.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.320
And so we've punted that problem one more time.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.320
You know, I was going to go.

11:47.320 --> 11:51.800
I was going to come dressed in a robe, but with just, you know, a space ball style Vader

11:51.800 --> 11:52.800
helmet on.

11:52.800 --> 11:53.800
Yeah.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.800
That's a good idea.

11:54.800 --> 11:55.800
It's funny you say that.

11:55.800 --> 12:00.200
A Vader helmet was recommended to me by someone else, but I was worried about it getting real

12:00.200 --> 12:01.880
hot in that Vader helmet.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.320
You know, and you got to really commit to that.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.320
Yeah.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.320
I'm in Florida.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.320
We define hot slightly differently.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.320
True.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.320
True.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.320
It's a little sticky already.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.320
It won't change anything.

12:10.320 --> 12:14.400
You know, I got an email mentioning next steps, so, you know, it's a little sticky already.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.400
Right.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.400
It's already a little sticky.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.680
We had, of course, some local folks show up.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.080
We had from Virginia.

12:20.080 --> 12:25.360
We had from Pennsylvania, New York, DC, Florida, Canada.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.360
People came from all around.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.360
It was really great.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.800
I think we're going to do it again.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.840
Here's an obvious statement in retrospect.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.640
There's actually a lot of tech business in Raleigh.

12:32.640 --> 12:33.640
Oh yeah, dude.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.640
Oh yeah.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.640
I didn't realize it.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.640
I knew Red Hat was here.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.200
I'm kind of a sleeper, you know, you don't hear about it all the way out on the West

12:39.200 --> 12:40.720
Coast necessarily.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.840
You northern westerners, whatever you are, you got to come down Dixie.

12:44.840 --> 12:48.120
We're blinded by San Francisco and the glittering lights of New York City.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.120
And Seattle.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.120
Is Seattle closer to you?

12:50.120 --> 12:51.120
Yeah.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.120
Oh yeah.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.120
Oh yeah.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.240
We have to stare at the Amazon and Microsoft folks all the time.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.240
Oh.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.240
Speaking of Darth Vader.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.240
Darth Balmer.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.840
And I guess Apple's opening up an office here now.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.680
So there's going to be an Apple Raleigh office.

13:03.680 --> 13:07.240
And then because we're near Virginia, we got, you know.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.240
The government crowd.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.160
We got some government people coming down too.

13:11.160 --> 13:12.160
But that's great.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.200
We accept all types.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.200
So I think we're going to do it again.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.640
I think I don't know when, but we'll do it again at some point in the future.

13:16.640 --> 13:20.120
So if you didn't make it out, don't worry.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.120
We'll do it again.

13:21.120 --> 13:24.440
You're just going to roll the dice one more time, Mike's got another chance to see your

13:24.440 --> 13:25.600
smiling face.

13:25.600 --> 13:34.280
To redeem myself and handout, I am ordering DVDs of Snow Leopard for everybody.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.840
Linode.com slash coder.

13:35.840 --> 13:40.000
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
show.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.840
Linode is fast and reliable cloud hosting.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.320
You got to try it for your next project, for the next thing you deploy.

13:45.320 --> 13:48.680
It's what I use for everything I've built in the last two and a half years.

13:48.680 --> 13:51.760
Especially now that Linode has been rolling out these MVME PCI drives.

13:51.760 --> 13:55.360
I didn't realize it, but like one of my boxes, I can just click a button and upgrade it.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.360
It kind of depends on my location.

13:57.360 --> 14:00.360
And another one of my boxes I've already upgraded.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.160
I love it when things get faster.

14:02.160 --> 14:05.860
I've recently been using Linode's tools to help troubleshoot and manage our super in

14:05.860 --> 14:08.800
demand matrix server for our community right now.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.880
And it's so, so slick to have these dashboards they give you.

14:11.880 --> 14:15.480
They're not like overly complicated and they have really sensible thresholds you can set

14:15.480 --> 14:16.480
for alerting.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.040
So I know when something's going on.

14:18.040 --> 14:21.160
And you know, for this trip, I went in there and I just boosted that system up.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.280
I made it a monster.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.200
I have a 48 core Linode box right now.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.320
And if you're a performance hound, you're going to love Linode.

14:27.320 --> 14:31.640
But if you need it for something simple, like a portfolio, maybe a simple GitLab, I don't

14:31.640 --> 14:36.140
know, maybe a photo gallery, they have like $5 Linodes that are rock solid and still come

14:36.140 --> 14:39.520
with the same great support that the 48 core rigs have.

14:39.520 --> 14:45.040
That's what Linode is known for is fantastic support, fantastic performance, and really

14:45.040 --> 14:48.480
sticking to the core product and just making it better and better and better.

14:48.480 --> 14:52.060
And with 11 data centers around the world, you're going to find something near you or

14:52.060 --> 14:53.140
your customers.

14:53.140 --> 14:57.400
And since they've been doing this for 19 years, I can guarantee you they're just really in

14:57.400 --> 14:58.680
a groove.

14:58.680 --> 15:02.400
They're not trying these crazy VC backed ideas and things like that.

15:02.400 --> 15:07.560
They're iterating on a product that works and has millions of customers around the world.

15:07.560 --> 15:10.880
And they have great features like built in cloud firewall.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.560
Their object storage is super useful.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.880
They have VLAN support.

15:14.880 --> 15:20.640
Of course, they have advanced DNS support, really powerful Kubernetes and Terraform support,

15:20.640 --> 15:24.760
super fast networking, bare metal servers, if that's the way you want to go, and a new

15:24.760 --> 15:27.760
database as a service, I guess.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.880
That seems like it has a lot of potential.

15:29.880 --> 15:33.280
And of course, they wrap it all up with an easy to use powerful cloud dashboard.

15:33.280 --> 15:38.320
Man, there's so many reasons we use Linode, but I think you'll find something that fits

15:38.320 --> 15:39.320
for you.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.320
You'll see why.

15:40.320 --> 15:44.160
And with pricing 30 to 50% cheaper, I think you're going to be happy to stick around.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.260
So go get that $100 and try it out.

15:46.260 --> 15:47.640
See what we've been talking about.

15:47.640 --> 15:52.320
See why we stuck with it for so long, and we love promoting them on our shows, linode.com

15:52.320 --> 15:53.320
slash coder.

15:53.320 --> 16:01.280
Go get that $100 and enjoy it and let us know what you think, linode.com slash coder.

16:01.280 --> 16:06.440
So we were just kind of casually talking about the warp terminal a few episodes ago.

16:06.440 --> 16:11.980
And we're seeing, I think, a wave of quote unquote developer focused tools get a ton

16:11.980 --> 16:17.000
of funding and warp has raised $23 million.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
He's up.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Million.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Did you see this coming?

16:20.000 --> 16:22.360
I mean, $23 million for a terminal?

16:22.360 --> 16:24.320
Yeah, kind of, right?

16:24.320 --> 16:25.320
I knew it was going to be a lot.

16:25.320 --> 16:29.560
If you look at the way they've been recruiting, and Zach Lloyd, kind of his background, I

16:29.560 --> 16:32.840
think he was like head of development or head of product at Google Drive.

16:32.840 --> 16:36.280
Or I'm sorry, Google Docs, although isn't that Google Drive now?

16:36.280 --> 16:37.560
I have no idea.

16:37.560 --> 16:38.560
Yeah, nobody does.

16:38.560 --> 16:43.520
Well, I'm on the Google work plan, and they just keep renaming stuff on me just to screw

16:43.520 --> 16:44.520
with me, I think.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.240
Hey, would you like them to include a little chat in there, too?

16:47.240 --> 16:48.240
That would be great.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.240
A separate new one.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.240
Yeah.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.240
That doesn't connect.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.240
No, I don't need another chat.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.240
God damn it.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.360
G chat was fine.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.360
It really was.

16:55.360 --> 16:56.360
It was totally fine.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.360
It was nice.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.600
Like, oh, Slack is doing the same stuff, by the way.

16:59.600 --> 17:03.280
Let's add every feature we can think of, slow the thing down to the point where you get

17:03.280 --> 17:08.600
notifications on all your devices because we can't synchronize anymore.

17:08.600 --> 17:09.600
What were we talking about?

17:09.600 --> 17:10.600
Sorry.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.520
Well, we were talking a little bit about Zach Lloyd.

17:12.520 --> 17:16.760
You know, he's been grinding away at stuff like this for 20 years, so maybe it's kind

17:16.760 --> 17:18.320
of nice that he finally got a big break.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.880
I mean, I don't know how he's done previous to this, but...

17:20.880 --> 17:21.880
Very well.

17:21.880 --> 17:22.880
He was a monkey-muck at Google.

17:22.880 --> 17:23.880
Oh, yeah.

17:23.880 --> 17:24.880
Fair enough.

17:24.880 --> 17:25.880
Fair enough.

17:25.880 --> 17:29.480
It's interesting because they've been doing a lot of the rounds, Warp in particular.

17:29.480 --> 17:36.440
They keep suggesting that one day the terminal could be open sourced, Warp Terminal.

17:36.440 --> 17:39.080
And I've been using it day to day, and I've been getting the updates.

17:39.080 --> 17:42.760
It definitely looks like they're...I'm sure they would phrase it differently, but they're

17:42.760 --> 17:46.760
looking to go towards a cloud-first development environment.

17:46.760 --> 17:51.760
I would not be shocked if there was just a terminal.warp.com, enter your username, and

17:51.760 --> 17:52.760
that's your terminal.

17:52.760 --> 17:53.760
Mm-hmm.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.680
Because the whole thing is...it is Rust native.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.240
Is it Rust or Go?

17:58.240 --> 17:59.240
I think it's Rust, right?

17:59.240 --> 18:00.600
Yeah, I believe it is Rust.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.960
It is Rust.

18:01.960 --> 18:06.840
But it's also partially built using stuff from Alacrity, which is interesting.

18:06.840 --> 18:11.480
Their kind of value add is, one, they treat the terminal, the graphics, a little differently,

18:11.480 --> 18:16.280
so you can do kind of the GUI copy-paste stuff easier than you might in, let's say, Mac

18:16.280 --> 18:19.160
Terminal or G Terminal.

18:19.160 --> 18:22.800
But they're pushing pretty aggressively on this.

18:22.800 --> 18:27.560
You can synchronize your SSH session with a homie, and that's how you can do onboarding

18:27.560 --> 18:28.560
for people, right?

18:28.560 --> 18:29.920
Setting up tool chain with them.

18:29.920 --> 18:35.000
A lot of cloud-first kind of...your settings can live in the cloud.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.880
For instance, you have to log in with GitHub, which I know, when this TechCrunch article

18:39.880 --> 18:44.280
came out, kind of the first time they've gotten a real lot of attention, the good old boys

18:44.280 --> 18:49.360
at Hacker News were not super thrilled to get the login prompt, which I completely understand.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.160
Login to my terminal?

18:51.160 --> 18:55.960
Yeah, you know, legit, it's the GitHub...it's literally a GitHub OAuth prompt.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.160
I don't like that either.

18:57.160 --> 19:00.880
So for my freedom-loving hippies, except you have to be on Mac because for some reason

19:00.880 --> 19:06.520
everybody's doing this all on Mac first, there's FIG, fig.io.

19:06.520 --> 19:14.240
And all FIG is, is context-aware auto-completion of your particular tooling.

19:14.240 --> 19:19.420
Now they have some they support like NPM, Kubernetes, stuff like that, but I can tell

19:19.420 --> 19:24.460
you that I cannot spell the minute I type in NPM because I hate it.

19:24.460 --> 19:30.200
And I am actually going to try this on...well, it works with HyperTerminal, the Mac Terminal,

19:30.200 --> 19:32.920
obviously, Alacrity, and a few others.

19:32.920 --> 19:33.920
Take a look.

19:33.920 --> 19:39.200
This is one...theoretically this works on Linux if you're using Alacrity.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.600
I wouldn't be shocked if there's a Google Terminal available.

19:42.600 --> 19:47.120
They also have a way to just add it directly into ZShell, Phish, or Bash if you don't like

19:47.120 --> 19:50.480
have one of the fancy pants terminals that they support.

19:50.480 --> 19:54.920
Additionally, it works in the VS Code terminal and the JetBrains terminals if you live in

19:54.920 --> 19:55.920
those IDEs.

19:55.920 --> 19:56.920
Wow.

19:56.920 --> 19:57.920
That's really cool.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.680
So this is like...so it's fig.io.

20:00.680 --> 20:01.680
I'm kind of impressed.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.680
Mike seems to know more.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.520
I've actually been using this a little bit at work in my day-to-day playing with it,

20:05.520 --> 20:06.640
but I haven't gone that deep.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.160
I didn't realize they had fancy terminal integration.

20:09.160 --> 20:13.160
I've just been using it like a plain old regular person in iTerm.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.720
Oh, so Super Bowl, how are you finding it?

20:15.720 --> 20:17.440
I like it a lot.

20:17.440 --> 20:23.560
I haven't written any of my own completions or gone super deep into it, but for just running

20:23.560 --> 20:28.000
around in the terminal, doing regular Git operations, that kind of stuff, yeah, it's

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
pretty handy.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.600
And it's not...I have not found it intrusive at all.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.880
There's never been any of those times I wanted it to just disappear.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.840
It's just kind of an optional extra.

20:35.840 --> 20:36.840
All right.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.340
That's a nice one.

20:38.340 --> 20:39.920
And is it open source?

20:39.920 --> 20:42.160
Is it commercial?

20:42.160 --> 20:43.800
It's MIT licensed, it looks like.

20:43.800 --> 20:49.960
Yeah, but there are some...there is like some investment, I believe that Y Combinator backed

20:49.960 --> 20:50.960
it.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.560
I think they have $2.4 million in funding, maybe.

20:53.560 --> 20:54.560
There you go.

20:54.560 --> 20:55.560
Oh, I'm the one who wrote the note.

20:55.560 --> 20:56.560
That's why.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.560
I don't even remember.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.560
Yeah.

20:58.560 --> 21:01.520
But so this is kind of...we've been talking about these tooling things, and I've been

21:01.520 --> 21:06.480
like bitching that people are mean to me because I want to do something open core.

21:06.480 --> 21:10.440
And I feel like somehow, under the radar, a bunch of people have gotten together and

21:10.440 --> 21:14.240
like, we're going to do terminal stuff, and we're going to basically make it open core.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.760
And are they just not saying open core?

21:15.760 --> 21:17.560
No, they're just not using the word, right?

21:17.560 --> 21:20.680
They're saying free for individuals, which is the same damn thing.

21:20.680 --> 21:21.680
Interesting.

21:21.680 --> 21:26.720
Also, it's kind of nice to see stuff focused on the terminal, like IDEs have been such

21:26.720 --> 21:28.720
a dominant...which is fine, but...

21:28.720 --> 21:29.720
Text editors.

21:29.720 --> 21:30.720
Mm-hmm.

21:30.720 --> 21:31.720
You know?

21:31.720 --> 21:34.240
And I think they both kind of give you access to different things.

21:34.240 --> 21:37.800
IDEs, you get this big smorgasbord of all kinds of options, and it really does like

21:37.800 --> 21:40.200
the epitome of a big gooey app.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.400
But there are times where the terminal style of workflow is better.

21:43.400 --> 21:48.100
So if you can get some of the kind of like static analysis, semantic stuff, aware of

21:48.100 --> 21:53.360
your environment stuff you've come to expect from an IDE in the terminal, heck yes.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.360
Win-win.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.880
Plus, there's devs that grew up with like fancy IDEs that, you know, they might kind

21:57.880 --> 22:02.160
of...a terminal might seem old if we don't sort of backport some of that stuff over there.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.160
Yes.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.160
That's a good point.

22:04.160 --> 22:07.400
It's definitely the season for developer tooling to make money.

22:07.400 --> 22:13.480
March 31, Docker announced they raised a Series C of $105 million.

22:13.480 --> 22:16.420
And when you go through it, of course, it's bang capital ventures.

22:16.420 --> 22:17.420
Of course.

22:17.420 --> 22:22.720
They don't even really get very specific why they did it.

22:22.720 --> 22:27.000
Their whole reasoning seems to be, well, we think the developer ecosystem is going to

22:27.000 --> 22:28.840
continue to grow like crazy.

22:28.840 --> 22:33.640
We expect that this particular market, the Docker address is going to forex over the

22:33.640 --> 22:34.800
next year.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.240
And so we're going to put money into Docker, even though they don't seem to really have

22:38.240 --> 22:41.560
a solid plan, or we're not really sure how these returns are going to work.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.800
But this market's growing.

22:43.800 --> 22:47.160
$105 million is nothing to sneeze at.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.160
Not at all.

22:48.160 --> 22:52.040
I'll jump the gun on you, but you know what I've been using in production, and I didn't

22:52.040 --> 22:55.080
even know they were sponsoring the show until last week?

22:55.080 --> 22:56.080
Tailscale.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.080
That's right.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.960
Tailscale is awesome, isn't it?

22:58.960 --> 22:59.960
It's beautiful.

22:59.960 --> 23:04.600
You can have a bunch of very precariously tied to something Raspberry Pis that have

23:04.600 --> 23:08.000
a 5G connection, and you can make sure they're still alive.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Yeah.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.240
And they're all in that flat network.

23:10.240 --> 23:11.240
That's right.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.320
I mean, yeah, no doubt about it.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.280
Right now, the machine I'm sitting at is connected back to the studio with Tailscale.

23:16.280 --> 23:17.680
That's so freaking great.

23:17.680 --> 23:20.680
But this is a real, this is a genuine endorsement right there.

23:20.680 --> 23:26.760
In fact, why don't we talk about Tailscale?

23:26.760 --> 23:28.640
Tailscale.com slash coder.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.900
Oh, let's go outside and enjoy the day in the sun.

23:31.900 --> 23:32.900
Come on, doggy.

23:32.900 --> 23:38.000
I got Archie with me here, and we're in Raleigh, North Carolina, and I'm preparing the show

23:38.000 --> 23:39.540
out here in the sunshine.

23:39.540 --> 23:40.540
How nice is that?

23:40.540 --> 23:41.540
And I'm using Tailscale to do it.

23:41.540 --> 23:45.520
I thought, what a great opportunity to talk about how useful Tailscale is.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.120
It's super quick to get started.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.680
Just a couple of minutes, you'll install it on any OS.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.080
I have it on my mobile devices.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.600
I have it on my Linux boxes, ARM and x86.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.080
I have it on my VPS servers.

23:56.080 --> 24:00.480
And really before the trip, one of the things I did to prepare was I got Tailscale set up

24:00.480 --> 24:03.540
on the last couple of devices that I didn't have it on.

24:03.540 --> 24:08.220
Now I'm going to sit out here in the sunshine, and thanks to Tailscale, I'm going to enjoy

24:08.220 --> 24:10.440
some vitamin D while I prepare the show.

24:10.440 --> 24:14.520
So this is a little bit of out of time ad read, I suppose, but it just seemed like what

24:14.520 --> 24:18.760
a great opportunity to really demonstrate the power of Tailscale.

24:18.760 --> 24:22.960
Because say I need to get to the booths or I need to get to our notes system, you need

24:22.960 --> 24:24.520
the kind of like web dashboards.

24:24.520 --> 24:25.520
You know what I'm talking about.

24:25.520 --> 24:28.640
You got tons of these things behind firewalls, and I got some apps on Linode.

24:28.640 --> 24:29.920
I got some apps on my LAN.

24:29.920 --> 24:34.920
I got some apps on a VM sitting on my box back at the studio.

24:34.920 --> 24:39.960
Tailscale brings it all together in one flat VPN, and they use WireGuard's noise protocol

24:39.960 --> 24:42.080
to make sure it's super secure.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.160
And they support any single sign on system you might already have, which means if you

24:45.160 --> 24:48.400
want to use two factor, that's going to work too.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.260
And personally, I use it to help with my friends and family.

24:51.260 --> 24:55.080
Like for example, I have it on my son's computer.

24:55.080 --> 24:58.880
If he has any problems while I'm out here, I just SSH into his machine and take care

24:58.880 --> 25:05.800
of it because all of my systems have a static IP address on a flat WireGuard protected network

25:05.800 --> 25:08.640
that I set up on each machine in like two minutes.

25:08.640 --> 25:11.440
It's really nice to have that peace of mind while I'm traveling and just pull that stuff

25:11.440 --> 25:14.960
up like I'm sitting on the LAN, regardless of where that machine's at.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.000
And I know it's safe with Tailscale.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.100
So go support the show and try it up to 20 devices for free.

25:20.100 --> 25:23.760
Get started by going to tailscale.com slash coder.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.240
Wouldn't you like to work out in the sunshine?

25:26.240 --> 25:28.600
Tailscale can help make that possible.

25:28.600 --> 25:33.400
Tailscale.com slash coder.

25:33.400 --> 25:39.020
So you got an email this week from Apple saying that reader apps can now add links for account

25:39.020 --> 25:40.700
signups outside the app store.

25:40.700 --> 25:46.560
So like, for example, Netflix can provide a link that goes directly to the Netflix website

25:46.560 --> 25:52.120
for account signups, which means you could sign up using Netflix's payment system, not

25:52.120 --> 25:53.920
Apple's payment system.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.640
What the hell is going on?

25:55.640 --> 25:59.200
Is it actually that you can process the payment without Apple getting the cut, though?

25:59.200 --> 26:00.660
I didn't think that was right.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.360
How can they stop you?

26:02.360 --> 26:04.840
Oh, I think you're required to report it.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.200
Oh, OK.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.480
I could see that.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.480
I could see that.

26:08.480 --> 26:11.720
But they have limits on what you're allowed to do, and they would probably check it in

26:11.720 --> 26:13.680
app review, wouldn't they?

26:13.680 --> 26:22.360
Yeah, I think it's that you can have the signup form be on your website, but you can't actually

26:22.360 --> 26:23.360
not pay them.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.560
OK, I just found the language.

26:25.560 --> 26:31.280
So the external link account entitlement must provide the reader content, must not offer

26:31.280 --> 26:36.280
in app purchases, and must not offer real time person to person services.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.760
Yeah, OK.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.360
I see.

26:39.360 --> 26:42.400
So they no wonder why they're letting this happen.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.120
So basically, they're letting you link out to your website to read about it and manage

26:45.120 --> 26:47.640
your account, maybe, but not pay for things.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.440
Yeah, maybe like account.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.440
I don't know.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.240
Well, no, it says specifically says sign up.

26:52.240 --> 26:56.240
So it's not even like, hey, there's something wrong with my account and real time service.

26:56.240 --> 26:59.840
Wouldn't that include like something weird is going on with my Netflix account?

26:59.840 --> 27:01.480
So you can't even do the chat stuff, right?

27:01.480 --> 27:06.740
You can't even do like the help me, Howard, right, like, wow, just literally just filling

27:06.740 --> 27:07.840
up a sign up form.

27:07.840 --> 27:12.360
What a fun loophole, you know, or like a set of hoops you just have to jump through.

27:12.360 --> 27:16.760
It's weird to me how this got covered because it was in bold, like most of the tech sites,

27:16.760 --> 27:17.760
but it's nothing.

27:17.760 --> 27:19.300
Yeah, it really is nothing.

27:19.300 --> 27:20.360
It's a big nothing burger.

27:20.360 --> 27:21.800
I think we should just move on.

27:21.800 --> 27:22.800
All right.

27:22.800 --> 27:27.700
There's also this story that I just wanted to kind of clarify on a little bit here.

27:27.700 --> 27:33.280
This is a situation, but it seems Apple, as well as a few other companies, were essentially

27:33.280 --> 27:38.200
socially engineered into providing private customer data.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.920
Meta was also targeted in this.

27:40.920 --> 27:48.720
And the reason that they were all got is because the cybercrime group used legitimate law enforcement

27:48.720 --> 27:54.920
mail addresses, they compromised legitimate mail accounts, and then sent emails from those

27:54.920 --> 27:59.980
legitimate accounts asking for the information, domain was legitimate, you know.

27:59.980 --> 28:03.280
And if you've only interacted with these, you know, it's a request that comes from the

28:03.280 --> 28:04.280
email, right?

28:04.280 --> 28:08.760
There's really no way to avoid this kind of stuff unless we get more serious about identity

28:08.760 --> 28:13.900
verification with email, or we get more serious about these companies not holding this data.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.400
There's just no other way around it.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.960
Yeah, at the kind of scale that we have, right?

28:17.960 --> 28:20.520
It's just these events keep happening.

28:20.520 --> 28:22.520
And they're not interested in having this data.

28:22.520 --> 28:23.980
No, of course not.

28:23.980 --> 28:27.120
That doesn't behoove them as a services company.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.920
And I'm sure if they don't comply quickly enough, they're open all kinds of liability

28:30.920 --> 28:32.600
from the government.

28:32.600 --> 28:36.080
So Wes, you are 100% remote work?

28:36.080 --> 28:37.080
Yes, I am.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.560
And is that staying that way?

28:38.560 --> 28:39.560
It is, yeah.

28:39.560 --> 28:42.240
Well, Eric Schmidt thinks you're an idiot.

28:42.240 --> 28:45.960
He says you don't build a great management team virtually.

28:45.960 --> 28:50.960
So you're never going to be management material with your work from home shenanigans.

28:50.960 --> 28:54.240
He says, this is a quote from the former CEO of Googs.

28:54.240 --> 29:00.160
He says, quote, it's important that these people be at the office, in my view.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.160
It may be true.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.160
I'm a traditionalist.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.160
He adds.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
Yeah, maybe.

29:04.160 --> 29:07.960
But I think he may be right.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.600
I almost kind of think he might be right.

29:09.600 --> 29:14.920
Like, how do you build a strong team, a leadership team when you're all remote?

29:14.920 --> 29:21.220
In fact, isn't the fact that we're all sitting here in this house right now together kind

29:21.220 --> 29:25.560
of indicative of that, even though we're all remote, we find it necessary to come together?

29:25.560 --> 29:30.320
Well, I think it might just be sort of a spectrum of how often and what that means, right?

29:30.320 --> 29:34.240
I mean, his thought, his end of the spectrum is butt in your seat every day.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.240
That's his spectrum.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.520
Yeah, so it seems like yes, right?

29:37.520 --> 29:41.360
Probably especially for highly coordinating individuals who need to have a lot of dense

29:41.360 --> 29:46.880
networks across the organization, that kind of face time is important.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.800
But there's a lot of different roles in management.

29:49.800 --> 29:53.780
And so you may be doing cross department teams, but a lot of your management may just be,

29:53.780 --> 29:57.800
you need to be available on those Zoom calls to help the teams that you're helping out.

29:57.800 --> 30:03.500
Mike, Schmidt says it's not just the practicals about working together in person, but sometimes

30:03.500 --> 30:06.240
it's about instilling professionalism in your team.

30:06.240 --> 30:10.560
Schmidt says that when he started at Google, for example, he, quote, had an awful lot of

30:10.560 --> 30:14.460
college students who were behaving as though the workplace was like a college.

30:14.460 --> 30:19.680
He goes on to say, quote, and I used to say to them, this is not a college.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.080
This is a professional thing.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.280
You can't do that.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.080
And or it might be illegal.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.560
So please stop now.

30:25.560 --> 30:30.560
And he says, this is particularly important for your employees that are in the ages of

30:30.560 --> 30:32.380
twenty five to thirty five.

30:32.380 --> 30:35.800
They just can't be trusted to work from home and not do dumb things.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.280
I don't know.

30:38.280 --> 30:39.400
I have mixed feelings on this.

30:39.400 --> 30:46.840
I am much less bullish on full remote work than I used to be, but I don't know.

30:46.840 --> 30:51.320
It seems like one of those things that's nice if you're Google, right, and you have like

30:51.320 --> 30:53.400
the awesome offices, lots of money.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.920
You pay people super well, way above average.

30:56.920 --> 31:04.280
And I feel like it's almost not a relevant debate for like small businesses because this

31:04.280 --> 31:08.440
is an argument that this this is just done right.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.540
This is a race that's been run.

31:10.540 --> 31:18.160
You basically have to offer remote work now, specifically hiring developers.

31:18.160 --> 31:22.540
If you're in anywhere competitive, right, because you know what, it's it's just a super

31:22.540 --> 31:24.240
hard hiring market right now.

31:24.240 --> 31:27.760
I think we maybe also, you know, as you're saying that, like the size of the business,

31:27.760 --> 31:30.920
what you're doing, the type of team you have all seems like it matters.

31:30.920 --> 31:31.920
You know, I agree.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.880
There are times like right now at the sprint, right?

31:33.880 --> 31:34.880
Like we can get a lot done.

31:34.880 --> 31:39.840
We have a lot of high bandwidth, but working with the J.B. crew is like they're some of

31:39.840 --> 31:42.760
the best people they've ever done like professional work with.

31:42.760 --> 31:43.760
We knit really well.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.280
We all have similar temperaments.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.280
We get along great, right?

31:47.280 --> 31:50.760
That is not what I think the normal average experience, right?

31:50.760 --> 31:54.320
Like you meet a lot of people in the office, they're fine people, you're not against them,

31:54.320 --> 31:55.760
but they're not, they're not your friends.

31:55.760 --> 31:58.440
You might not even like have a good vibe with them.

31:58.440 --> 32:02.320
And is that like, that's not the same, the magic synergies that all these execs keep

32:02.320 --> 32:03.320
talking about.

32:03.320 --> 32:07.960
I just don't think like maybe one out of a hundred interactions is like that less.

32:07.960 --> 32:13.800
So Schmidt says it's not a big business versus small business thing, which Schmidt says,

32:13.800 --> 32:15.760
he says it is science.

32:15.760 --> 32:21.400
It is 30 to 40 years of workplace experience that has shown us that humans are inherently

32:21.400 --> 32:26.240
social and he goes on to say that the current virtual tools are not the same as informal

32:26.240 --> 32:29.560
networks that occur within a corporation or a business.

32:29.560 --> 32:33.400
And so if you can't be in person together, you're just not going to be as competitive.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.400
Doesn't matter on your size.

32:34.400 --> 32:39.720
It doesn't matter if you have 25 employees or 35,000 employees is what he says.

32:39.720 --> 32:40.720
It's an interesting theory.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.240
I suppose the market's going to validate one way or another, right?

32:43.240 --> 32:46.280
Like if you can be more competitive just by having an office.

32:46.280 --> 32:50.040
I feel like what Mike is kind of saying in a way, it's like Schmidt sitting in an awful

32:50.040 --> 32:52.520
position of privilege, right?

32:52.520 --> 32:57.240
Like easy for Schmidt to say he is, you know, they have the ability to fly people in and

32:57.240 --> 33:00.440
move them if they don't work in the area, that kind of stuff.

33:00.440 --> 33:05.160
But yeah, for many folks probably they might have, you know, and folks in our audience,

33:05.160 --> 33:08.880
they might already have nicer home working setups than they're going to get in an office.

33:08.880 --> 33:12.720
I think if you're going to realistically have an office for, you know, highly talented tech

33:12.720 --> 33:17.400
people, you're going to have to push towards that, like make the office awesome for lack

33:17.400 --> 33:18.560
of a better term.

33:18.560 --> 33:21.000
The whole cafeteria thing, the laundry on site.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.360
I'm going to need a hammock desk.

33:23.360 --> 33:27.120
Hammock desk, you know, Sousa memorabilia everywhere.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.760
It's the stuff you need.

33:28.760 --> 33:35.040
When I was at Dell's Austin office, they had several huge cafeterias with great food, but

33:35.040 --> 33:38.160
they also had an onsite doctor.

33:38.160 --> 33:42.280
So if you wanted to go see a doctor about something, you could go down into the cafeteria

33:42.280 --> 33:47.520
area in one of the main buildings there in the main building and see the doctor right

33:47.520 --> 33:48.520
there at work.

33:48.520 --> 33:52.520
And you know, for a small business guy who doesn't even have medical insurance, that

33:52.520 --> 33:56.840
was like such a trip to think like I could go to the, I could go to work and not only

33:56.840 --> 34:01.280
can I do my laundry and do my, get my eating done and you know, eat my three meals or a

34:01.280 --> 34:05.600
day or whatever, but I can also see the doctor all on the same campus.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.600
It's mind blowing.

34:06.600 --> 34:11.940
It's both crazy convenient and also like a weird, you know, it's, it's almost close to

34:11.940 --> 34:15.120
being back paid the sort of, you know, company money again.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.320
Anyways, we'll wrap it up in there.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.200
I'm going to leave a link in the show notes because this is something that I care a lot

34:20.200 --> 34:23.140
about, but it's not relevant to the show in any way.

34:23.140 --> 34:25.000
Maybe somebody out there cares though.

34:25.000 --> 34:31.520
There is some research that has been published on the 12th and it's, it says that loud road

34:31.520 --> 34:35.060
and air traffic has been linked to greater risk of high blood pressure, heart attacks

34:35.060 --> 34:40.480
and strokes and scientists are uncovering new details about how, what you are hearing

34:40.480 --> 34:42.680
and how it can stress your cardiovascular system.

34:42.680 --> 34:43.680
How about that?

34:43.680 --> 34:46.840
So I'm going to leave it on the show notes because that's probably kind of spooky, but

34:46.840 --> 34:51.960
I'm a big proponent of thinking about noise pollution when you're building an office or

34:51.960 --> 34:53.120
home or something like that.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.040
Oh, you don't say professional podcaster.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.040
Right.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.040
I know.

34:57.040 --> 34:58.040
I know.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.040
And I feel like it's something people just ignore.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.600
So I'm advocating for it.

35:00.600 --> 35:01.600
Anyways.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.600
I think that's it.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.920
Anything else we want to cover gentlemen, before we wrap it up today, Mr. Dominic, is

35:04.920 --> 35:06.400
there anything else you want to talk about?

35:06.400 --> 35:07.400
No.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.680
Good to hear from you again, Wes.

35:08.680 --> 35:09.680
Enjoy the work from home.

35:09.680 --> 35:10.680
That's a big change.

35:10.680 --> 35:11.680
Nice.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.680
Indeed.

35:12.680 --> 35:13.680
Thank you, sir.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.720
And yeah, nice to hear your wonderful voice.

35:15.720 --> 35:18.640
Wes and I get on the plane tomorrow and fly back to Seattle.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.120
Back to the sky in our fart tube.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.120
Yep.

35:21.120 --> 35:24.840
Hopefully it's nice and pleasant, although today it's going to be like 80 degrees here.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.680
It's a beautiful day here in Raleigh.

35:26.680 --> 35:29.960
And then what do we, we maybe talked about doing a LAN the morning after we get back

35:29.960 --> 35:31.920
because we're just that crazy.

35:31.920 --> 35:32.920
No rest for us.

35:32.920 --> 35:36.440
I also have a meeting scheduled for that morning, but it'll be over pretty quick.

35:36.440 --> 35:39.280
It's going to be a busy getting back kind of a thing.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.760
There's a lot of stuff I got to follow up on.

35:41.760 --> 35:45.080
This is one of those trips where I'm coming back with a big list.

35:45.080 --> 35:46.320
You hit pause on your life.

35:46.320 --> 35:51.000
You go do, you know, to go take care of some things and then, oh yeah, it all got worse.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.480
It's waiting for you to get back.

35:53.480 --> 35:56.440
Also thank you to our members, CoderQA.co.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.980
At Tumanuku on Twitter.

36:16.980 --> 36:19.040
He may also be broken down on the side of the road.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.040
So look out Floridians.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.040
Yes.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.040
Yes.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.040
Yes.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.040
Yeah.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.040
That's more likely than not these days.

36:25.040 --> 36:29.240
Keep an eye out for Mike's broken down car and say hi, maybe give him a beverage or something

36:29.240 --> 36:30.240
like that.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.240
What about you Wes?

36:31.240 --> 36:32.440
Is there anywhere you want people to find you?

36:32.440 --> 36:33.440
Well, yeah.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.360
Hey, look out for a new Linux action news in your feed sometime soon.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.360
