This is KOTORadio, episode 336 for December 17th, 2018.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.400
Hello everyone and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:35.400 --> 00:41.040
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and its related technologies.

00:41.040 --> 00:46.360
I'm here in the Pacific Northwest and our host every single week is joining us live

00:46.360 --> 00:53.200
from the beautiful shores of Florida, no doubt, in a nice 75 degrees, no rain, no traffic,

00:53.200 --> 00:55.200
it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.720
Hello Mike.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.000
There's a gator in my pants.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.800
Okay, alright, come on, did you really, have you ever seen a gator since you've been down

01:03.800 --> 01:04.800
there?

01:04.800 --> 01:05.800
Once.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.800
Really?

01:06.800 --> 01:07.800
But it was underwater, yeah.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.160
Was he looking at you kind of weird, like I'd like to eat you?

01:10.160 --> 01:13.960
No, they kind of like standard water and poke their eyes up.

01:13.960 --> 01:14.960
Yeah.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.120
It was on a golf course.

01:16.120 --> 01:19.600
So if you ever go golfing in Florida and there are water holes, you're almost certainly going

01:19.600 --> 01:20.600
to see a gator.

01:20.600 --> 01:25.280
So you are technically our Florida man, as Pixel Pimp points out in our live chat.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.240
You are the Florida man on the Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

01:28.240 --> 01:32.120
I'm not sure that that's a mantle, I'm not particularly equality.

01:32.120 --> 01:35.280
But I don't think you get a choice because you are in Florida.

01:35.280 --> 01:38.920
Well, but I'm drinking Heineken, not Miller Lite.

01:38.920 --> 01:40.560
Yeah I chilled Heineken at that too.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.560
So those are the most tasty.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.560
It was in the freezer.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.560
Yes, that's right.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.740
You know, in some parts of the world, they don't drink cold beer because it stuns the

01:46.740 --> 01:50.560
taste buds and you can't fully appreciate the entire flavor profile.

01:50.560 --> 01:55.640
But if you drink cold beer, you can drink more and then you can become a Supreme Court

01:55.640 --> 01:56.640
justice.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.360
Can I, oh, can I be honest with you?

01:59.360 --> 02:00.360
No lie.

02:00.360 --> 02:04.280
I just, I just discovered like double distilled or double filtered or whatever it is gin where

02:04.280 --> 02:06.480
it tastes like 25% less Christmas tree.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.480
Have you, have you seen this?

02:07.480 --> 02:13.060
It's, it's a slightly different color, but it's gin, but it, it doesn't taste exactly

02:13.060 --> 02:14.060
like a Christmas tree.

02:14.060 --> 02:15.200
It tastes a little bit less.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.200
That's what I discovered this week.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.200
Had a good week.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.200
Went over to system 76.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.200
Had a good week.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.200
You know what?

02:20.200 --> 02:22.920
I am so jealous of you.

02:22.920 --> 02:30.040
I also got invited and yet, you know, I, I, I, I spawned into the process and let me tell

02:30.040 --> 02:33.480
you the last like two and a half years, this process has been taking up a lot of RAM.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.480
Yeah.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.480
It's a memory leak.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.160
I'll tell you the thing there is, this is, I'm going to get, I'm going to get real honest

02:38.160 --> 02:39.160
with you for a moment.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.160
Break it down for me.

02:40.160 --> 02:44.040
The best time to have children is when you're young, you know, the, the age that you and

02:44.040 --> 02:50.960
I are, you know, relatively young, but it is also your best time to travel, to have

02:50.960 --> 02:55.040
good health, to have the most energy you're ever going to have, to feel the best physically

02:55.040 --> 02:56.320
you're ever going to feel.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.320
It's when you have the most physical leverage.

02:58.320 --> 03:02.840
It's when you can afford to burn the candle at both ends the most.

03:02.840 --> 03:03.920
It's when you bounce back.

03:03.920 --> 03:08.480
I healed two and a half, three weeks faster than the doctors thought I would heal because

03:08.480 --> 03:12.560
I'm a healthy mid thirties male that hasn't, you know, lived.

03:12.560 --> 03:17.520
I'm not 60 years old having my, my spleen and all, or my appendix, I mean, rupture.

03:17.520 --> 03:24.940
And yet the harsh reality is it's also your best time to establish a family and create

03:24.940 --> 03:30.760
a life for yourself and have a home and have children, which ties you down and restricts

03:30.760 --> 03:32.560
your flexibility.

03:32.560 --> 03:37.760
And I, the only reason I mentioned this is because it was, I feel like my, the, the,

03:37.760 --> 03:43.080
the 10 years that, well, 13 years I've been doing Jupiter broadcasting, it has been the,

03:43.080 --> 03:49.080
the number one balancing act that I've had the, the, the, the most time with the hardest,

03:49.080 --> 03:53.640
the hardest time, the hardest time with, and the most time I've spent agonizing over.

03:53.640 --> 03:54.640
You know what I mean?

03:54.640 --> 03:59.900
Like you joke, but in a way you miss out on an opportunity, but you also have an opportunity

03:59.900 --> 04:02.800
to spend time with the kid.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.300
It's like it both are good and both also are not good.

04:07.300 --> 04:11.640
It's a, it's very hard for somebody like me because I'm always beating up on myself.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.400
Well there's so much more to that too.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.320
It's not just like that, but your appetite for risk dramatically goes down.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.320
Yeah.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.320
Yes.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.320
Right?

04:20.320 --> 04:21.540
Like when you're like, oh, this way more on the line, right?

04:21.540 --> 04:25.840
This kid needs like food and diapers and health insurance and you know, all these things

04:25.840 --> 04:32.280
that cost a tremendous amount of money as I'm, as you know, of course.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.600
This is old, old dad's wine radio.

04:34.600 --> 04:40.320
Well, I think, I don't know, you know, it was a variable that I couldn't fully appreciate

04:40.320 --> 04:43.280
when I was younger and so I go into this with a full head of steam.

04:43.280 --> 04:47.000
And then I think, do you know that I almost went anyway though I almost brought the kid

04:47.000 --> 04:51.160
with me that, you know, I, I think that actually would have been okay.

04:51.160 --> 04:55.560
You know, a certain a pink queen at system 76 Emma offered to babysit.

04:55.560 --> 05:00.160
Like I was this, I was this close just like buying it cause he's still young enough that

05:00.160 --> 05:01.160
he doesn't need a seat.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.160
Yeah.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.160
He could be a lap child.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.160
Yeah.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.160
I'm like, can I do it?

05:05.160 --> 05:06.160
And I thought, you know what?

05:06.160 --> 05:07.720
No, I, who knows what will happen.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.140
It depends what you wanted to get out of it.

05:09.140 --> 05:14.240
Did you want a nice father son kind of like experience or did you want so young though?

05:14.240 --> 05:15.240
Right.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.240
He won't remember it.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.240
He won't remember.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.240
Yeah.

05:18.240 --> 05:21.680
And then you also, you're, you're not focused on sort of the business side of why you're

05:21.680 --> 05:22.680
there.

05:22.680 --> 05:23.680
Right.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.680
So tell me about it.

05:24.680 --> 05:29.720
How, how, uh, now how many, uh, system 76 Thelios or Thelios as they say, uh, it is

05:29.720 --> 05:30.720
now.

05:30.720 --> 05:31.720
Yep.

05:31.720 --> 05:32.720
Yeah.

05:32.720 --> 05:33.720
It is Thelio.

05:33.720 --> 05:34.720
I was corrected.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.720
And then I double checked.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.560
How many did you smuggle in your carry on?

05:37.560 --> 05:40.960
Well, so first of all, uh, okay, where to start with this?

05:40.960 --> 05:46.800
Um, I think if we're going to just put all our cards on the table here, um, assuming

05:46.800 --> 05:50.600
they're listening to this, but also our audience has been listening now for a while.

05:50.600 --> 05:56.600
Uh, you have been pretty, pretty like, um, open to the idea of Papa West.

05:56.600 --> 06:00.480
You've been open to the idea of them launching their own manufacturing plant.

06:00.480 --> 06:04.360
Um, and you've even put your money where your mouth is and you've bought system 76 machines

06:04.360 --> 06:05.360
since this change.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.360
Yeah.

06:06.360 --> 06:10.960
So at least just, just for the, for the record here, I've bought, let's see, a Ray tell two

06:10.960 --> 06:15.240
Gallagos and Oryx, who was that four machines?

06:15.240 --> 06:16.240
Yeah.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.240
You, you maniac.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.240
Yeah.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.240
I've definitely put my money where my mouth is.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.320
I, on the other hand, went a different direction.

06:24.320 --> 06:32.520
I, I sort of, I sort of went, Oh shit, this could be the beginning of the end for system

06:32.520 --> 06:34.040
76.

06:34.040 --> 06:40.360
And I think, I think it's funny because I think normally you and I would have been reversed

06:40.360 --> 06:44.200
in our opinions because to me, I looked at this and I went, these are a bunch of Linux

06:44.200 --> 06:49.800
geeks that work out of a pretty nice office in downtown Denver.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.920
And what the hell do they know about building a factory?

06:53.920 --> 06:59.520
What the hell do they even know about buying a building, let alone putting it with laser

06:59.520 --> 07:07.440
cutters, acid dippers, powder coat machines, huge ovens, assembly lines, managing inventory.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.840
What do these guys know?

07:08.840 --> 07:09.840
What do they know?

07:09.840 --> 07:10.840
Right?

07:10.840 --> 07:11.840
They've been, they've been managed.

07:11.840 --> 07:12.840
They've been working out of an office.

07:12.840 --> 07:13.840
They build PCs to order.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.520
They work with upstream OEMs to customize laptops.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.120
What do, what do these guys know about building?

07:18.120 --> 07:26.120
Like that could sink a company, the, just the rent, just the rent on this place could

07:26.120 --> 07:27.440
sink a company.

07:27.440 --> 07:31.920
As a small business owner, and I had this conversation with Carl, as a small business

07:31.920 --> 07:36.040
owner, I just, the risk just overwhelmed me.

07:36.040 --> 07:43.760
Like it was an, it was, it is, it is, it is moving an entire company into a domain they

07:43.760 --> 07:46.240
have no knowledge of.

07:46.240 --> 07:50.000
It is something that entire corp companies exist to manage.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.440
That's why Apple doesn't even build their own machines.

07:56.440 --> 08:01.000
What's a company out of Denver going to do to pull this off out of Denver?

08:01.000 --> 08:04.480
Like they're not, they're not, they're not offshoring the build.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.460
They're not cutting costs that way.

08:06.460 --> 08:10.360
They're hiring people in Denver, Colorado, which is not one of the cheapest places in

08:10.360 --> 08:15.960
the nation, and they're buying or renting real estate and setting up a factory.

08:15.960 --> 08:22.400
So to say, and, and then, because that's not enough, they're launching an operating system

08:22.400 --> 08:25.440
and they're also going to become an OS vendor.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.920
I just thought, I just thought it was too much.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.800
And I thought a company that I had been a customer for, for 10 years was going to go

08:32.800 --> 08:34.220
under.

08:34.220 --> 08:37.360
And so I just sort of pulled back and I just thought, well, I'll go into await and see

08:37.360 --> 08:38.360
mode.

08:38.360 --> 08:42.160
I do know that the people that are very talented, maybe they can pull this off.

08:42.160 --> 08:47.580
Maybe they can make this work, but the odds are way against them.

08:47.580 --> 08:50.220
But maybe, maybe, maybe.

08:50.220 --> 08:53.360
So it's, it's been, you know, an interesting 2018 watching them.

08:53.360 --> 08:57.400
So coming, that is, that is the, that is the mindset that I went in with though.

08:57.400 --> 09:01.320
So before you, before you dive in, I just want to say for our end of the year show,

09:01.320 --> 09:04.680
I have a lot about that because what that sounds to me, and I don't want to put words

09:04.680 --> 09:05.680
in your mouth.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.240
You were asking about Ken, a little company like this scale.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.700
Yeah, but it's not just like scale.

09:11.700 --> 09:16.560
It's scale where the, where there's a global economy at play and manufacturing is particularly

09:16.560 --> 09:17.560
there.

09:17.560 --> 09:18.560
Yeah.

09:18.560 --> 09:22.180
I mean, I'm not, scale is maybe the wrong word, but can they compete in a, in a big

09:22.180 --> 09:26.960
world, can a little, can, well, we had an episode, remember they're selling to a niche

09:26.960 --> 09:27.960
too, right?

09:27.960 --> 09:29.520
It's not, they're not making it up in the margins.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.480
No, they're not.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.040
So what did you see?

09:33.040 --> 09:39.920
So when I got down there, I, there's a couple of things that were kind of obvious to me.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.760
First of all, it's been a very hard three months or so for them.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.320
The last three months have been pretty tough.

09:45.320 --> 09:50.740
They launched Thelio pre-orders or Thelio pre-orders at the beginning of November.

09:50.740 --> 09:56.960
It is now as we record, you know, mid-ish December and people are starting to get a

09:56.960 --> 09:57.960
little antsy.

09:57.960 --> 10:02.240
They haven't gotten their shipments yet.

10:02.240 --> 10:09.720
So when I got in there, what I saw was a company who had just, and I mean just like by the

10:09.720 --> 10:14.500
hour cleared the biggest hurdle they've ever faced.

10:14.500 --> 10:20.200
What they had, they had timed this event so that the factory floor was online.

10:20.200 --> 10:24.420
There were a stack of Thelio systems ready to ship out to customers.

10:24.420 --> 10:29.100
They set up this beer garden area where we could sit and watch presentations and enjoy

10:29.100 --> 10:31.560
a drink and all of that in the factory.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.640
And that seemed really fresh.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.360
Like the, like the tables had just been built.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.000
They were just assembled.

10:37.000 --> 10:45.280
It was really, really fresh, but there was a, a wall size stack of Thelio workstations

10:45.280 --> 10:46.280
ready to go.

10:46.280 --> 10:52.120
And the first batch of machines went out the door that day, were you able to demo one?

10:52.120 --> 10:53.120
Oh yeah.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.120
Several of them were ready to go.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.120
Yeah.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.120
Did you happen to try a rising thread ripper configuration?

10:57.120 --> 11:01.640
I think that was one of the ones they showed us where they were showing the cooling system

11:01.640 --> 11:06.240
and they maxed it out at a hundred percent load and then blew smoke through it with an

11:06.240 --> 11:09.280
acrylic side so we could see how it cools itself.

11:09.280 --> 11:13.040
And it was so quiet that I'm pretty positive it hasn't showed up.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.520
The sound of the machine did not show up on the recording.

11:16.520 --> 11:17.520
Okay.

11:17.520 --> 11:18.520
Yeah.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.320
And they went through a lot of their thought process.

11:20.320 --> 11:26.280
They were working on building the system for three years and this is going to be a decade

11:26.280 --> 11:29.400
long platform for them.

11:29.400 --> 11:33.400
This is going to be their desktops for the next 10 years.

11:33.400 --> 11:36.580
And they have a Thel, they have Thelio and then they have Thelio.

11:36.580 --> 11:40.160
They're going to have a Thelio minor, which is like the size of a NUC.

11:40.160 --> 11:43.200
They're going to build a Thelio like a NUC.

11:43.200 --> 11:48.360
And then they'll have a Thelio major and ones in between that are huge, massive desktops

11:48.360 --> 11:53.600
with multiple Xeon processors and tons of disk and all of that.

11:53.600 --> 12:00.000
But the standard Thelio workstation is really small.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.500
It's almost the size of a mini ITX.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.680
I'm showing pictures on the live stream if people are watching live right now.

12:05.680 --> 12:09.760
And that was probably the biggest surprise when I got there is how small this thing was

12:09.760 --> 12:17.800
and how much thought was put into little tiny details that even Johnny I would be impressed

12:17.800 --> 12:20.320
that they sweated over.

12:20.320 --> 12:25.680
So they've been transitioning this company.

12:25.680 --> 12:32.040
They've been moving this company to a place that figures out how to cut this stuff.

12:32.040 --> 12:35.860
A place that figures out how to paint this stuff.

12:35.860 --> 12:39.360
They had to figure out how to make the screw holes smooth enough that it was a pleasant

12:39.360 --> 12:42.200
experience to screw the individual thumb screws in.

12:42.200 --> 12:45.600
It has been a massive learning process.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.640
And they demoed different acrylic systems that they built as a training exercise.

12:49.640 --> 12:53.480
They build systems out of acrylic before they go to metal.

12:53.480 --> 12:59.520
And they're using 3D printers to fashion temporary parts or sometimes really nice parts that

12:59.520 --> 13:02.240
just make it safer to ship.

13:02.240 --> 13:08.920
And they've designed a daughter board that controls thermals in a somewhat intelligent

13:08.920 --> 13:11.160
way that PCs don't normally do.

13:11.160 --> 13:15.800
It manages the power but it also controls the thermals because it uses the sensors from

13:15.800 --> 13:20.800
the motherboard and it uses data from the operating system.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.880
And that's handy because the motherboard doesn't actually know what the temperature of the

13:23.880 --> 13:25.040
GPU is.

13:25.040 --> 13:29.640
And the motherboard doesn't know when the GPU is at 100% load.

13:29.640 --> 13:34.560
Their daughter board design has been one of the more interesting schematics they've released.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.640
The hardware being open source.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.360
I won't say it's brand new because it's frankly not.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.360
Other people have done things like this.

13:40.360 --> 13:41.360
Well, that's something the Mac does.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.360
The Mac does.

13:42.360 --> 13:43.360
That's what the SMC controller.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.360
Yeah.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.360
The Mac OS does this.

13:45.360 --> 13:52.360
But I think the way they're doing it for a Linux manufacturer is pretty, I won't say

13:52.360 --> 13:55.040
novel, but pretty impressive.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.040
But go ahead.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.040
Yeah.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.040
That's really it.

13:58.040 --> 14:02.320
It is able to combine data from the motherboard, data from the operating system, and then it

14:02.320 --> 14:08.320
makes intelligent cooling decisions, aggregating all those different data points together.

14:08.320 --> 14:13.760
And you combine that with like 140 millimeter fan on the bottom and 120 millimeter exhaust

14:13.760 --> 14:16.100
fan and the damn thing's just silent.

14:16.100 --> 14:20.640
And then the board also is sort of a SATA pass-through backplane, so it does SASP essentially.

14:20.640 --> 14:21.640
Yeah.

14:21.640 --> 14:22.640
I don't know.

14:22.640 --> 14:27.500
I guess in a way, I kind of want to talk to you more about like this massive transition

14:27.500 --> 14:29.100
that they've made as a company.

14:29.100 --> 14:35.960
They've gone from sort of management of PC manufacturing to hands-on cutting the individual

14:35.960 --> 14:40.760
ports out, acid dripping the systems, running them through a baker, and then assembling

14:40.760 --> 14:41.760
and testing them.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.920
Like it's just, it's a whole other scale.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.140
Like it's a different business now.

14:47.140 --> 14:51.520
One of my disappointments in not going, and not that I mind spending time with my son,

14:51.520 --> 14:54.440
of course, I don't want anybody to write in saying, oh, you're a bad dad.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.440
That's not the case.

14:55.440 --> 14:59.120
Be, you know, whatever, happy to be home.

14:59.120 --> 15:04.920
And for those who didn't listen last week, the kid was sick is why I stayed home.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.520
I have been through a similar process that I'm hoping on our end of the year episode

15:08.520 --> 15:12.760
to go over of like attempting to, I'm calling it scaling, but I think you're right.

15:12.760 --> 15:17.200
It's actually like gaining breadth and depth and all those kinds of things.

15:17.200 --> 15:22.120
And it has been difficult to say the least.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.600
And one of the things I did wonder when I got the invitation, Chris, a few weeks ago

15:25.600 --> 15:30.280
was, this seems kind of cray cray.

15:30.280 --> 15:35.680
I mean, you know, like the, I'm sorry, but the YouTube commenters and Reddit commenters

15:35.680 --> 15:39.180
rightly say that I have a soft spot for system 76, right?

15:39.180 --> 15:40.840
Like I like what they're doing.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.840
I like their hardware.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.360
You know, I'm 50% in Mac OS and 50% in Linux.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.780
And when I'm on Linux, it's usually my Galago, right?

15:48.780 --> 15:52.440
And frankly, I broke my Galago, was able to go buy parts and fix it.

15:52.440 --> 15:58.760
Now, granted it's not as like nice, cause you know, my craftsmanship isn't frankly where

15:58.760 --> 16:02.360
their overseas workers were for the Galago.

16:02.360 --> 16:07.980
But if I had to buy another desktop, I would certainly consider Athelio or Thaleo.

16:07.980 --> 16:12.640
Is that Thaleo?

16:12.640 --> 16:19.640
Having said all of that, like all the nice stuff, this seems like a big, big, big jump

16:19.640 --> 16:21.320
for me.

16:21.320 --> 16:27.400
Like you are, like first I thought, you know, I think it's fair to say the Linux community

16:27.400 --> 16:31.680
was a little raised eyebrows on Pop OS, like you guys are going to take on writing your

16:31.680 --> 16:32.680
own OS.

16:32.680 --> 16:37.680
And you know, Pop, I like Pop, I run Pop.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.560
Pop is a skin on Ubuntu, right?

16:39.560 --> 16:41.080
Right now that's what it is.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.200
It's a good skin.

16:42.200 --> 16:50.400
It suits my needs, but then to go into full bore manufacturing and in the United States,

16:50.400 --> 16:58.780
I mean, listen, I'll slap on a MAGA hat if I have to, but I've had some failed endeavors

16:58.780 --> 17:03.520
in some, and we'll talk about it in our end of the year episode, some IoT chip manufacturing

17:03.520 --> 17:06.240
down here in Florida.

17:06.240 --> 17:11.540
And if Carl knows how to do this, then Carl, please buy us and I'll just retire.

17:11.540 --> 17:21.280
Like buy me out because that seems incredibly challenging from a cost per unit perspective.

17:21.280 --> 17:27.000
And you know, we don't, so my understanding, Chris, is that none of the failures have actually

17:27.000 --> 17:28.920
shipped into customers' hands.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.240
Maybe they've shipped, but no customer has.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.440
They did the night we were there.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.440
They shipped out.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.160
But no customer has one yet.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.880
They are probably getting them today, tomorrow.

17:38.880 --> 17:43.520
So one thing when you're manufacturing hardware is, and then I kind of learned this the hard

17:43.520 --> 17:47.760
way, failure rate, right?

17:47.760 --> 17:51.760
It just is the case when you're manufacturing your own boards that a certain percentage

17:51.760 --> 17:52.760
will fail.

17:52.760 --> 17:53.760
Yeah.

17:53.760 --> 17:57.440
And I think they have a bigger problem with the casing and things like that because they

17:57.440 --> 18:00.060
are shipping inside Thaleo.

18:00.060 --> 18:01.500
It is a gigabyte motherboard.

18:01.500 --> 18:05.660
It is a part that they've sourced and they can test outside of the Thaleo casing and

18:05.660 --> 18:08.360
all of that before they build the system.

18:08.360 --> 18:14.920
But I would say a significant, significant amount of the underappreciated engineering

18:14.920 --> 18:20.060
that will go into Thaleo is how many things they have custom built to make sure the damn

18:20.060 --> 18:21.600
thing survives shipping.

18:21.600 --> 18:28.000
Like they have a 3D printer that custom builds brackets to hold like GPUs and cables in place

18:28.000 --> 18:37.840
and all of these things that they have learned over the 12 years they've been shipping systems.

18:37.840 --> 18:42.600
They put those lessons into Thaleo to get it through.

18:42.600 --> 18:47.160
It's funny because I asked twice just to clarify, I'm like, just so I understand, what you consider

18:47.160 --> 18:52.960
as a company as the most traumatic, difficult, most deadly period of life for the entire

18:52.960 --> 18:57.240
lifespan of your systems is the shipping period to customers?

18:57.240 --> 19:02.880
And they said, yeah, getting these systems to survive shipping is the number one challenge.

19:02.880 --> 19:07.520
And so they're able to build certain things now that their previous system didn't have.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.480
I completely get that actually.

19:09.480 --> 19:15.920
Like have you ever dealt with UPS on a company to company scale?

19:15.920 --> 19:16.920
Yeah.

19:16.920 --> 19:17.920
Yeah.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.440
It's not yet.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.080
Like shit just disappears, right?

19:22.080 --> 19:25.480
We've lost, we've lost entire gear shipping it for conferences.

19:25.480 --> 19:26.480
Just gone.

19:26.480 --> 19:31.520
Just gone into the void, really like, and then you have this awkward choice.

19:31.520 --> 19:35.960
Do you call your insurance company or not?

19:35.960 --> 19:37.800
Or did you buy insurance with the thing?

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
Will they cover it?

19:38.800 --> 19:39.800
Or did you buy UPS insurance?

19:39.800 --> 19:40.800
Which I never did.

19:40.800 --> 19:41.800
So I just ate the losses.

19:41.800 --> 19:42.800
Yeah.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.880
A $3,000 backbook into the void.

19:45.880 --> 19:46.880
Seriously.

19:46.880 --> 19:47.880
Nice.

19:47.880 --> 19:48.880
Yeah.

19:48.880 --> 19:49.880
Encrypted hard drive.

19:49.880 --> 19:50.880
Okay.

19:50.880 --> 19:51.880
I keep interrupting.

19:51.880 --> 19:52.880
I'm sorry, Chris.

19:52.880 --> 19:53.880
No.

19:53.880 --> 19:54.880
So what else did you see?

19:54.880 --> 19:55.880
See, I'm jealous.

19:55.880 --> 19:59.100
And first of all, this picture, if you're not listening live, by the way, you are missing

19:59.100 --> 20:01.080
the full code radio experience.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.080
Carl's beard.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.080
Yeah, I know.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.080
Can we just stop for a minute?

20:04.080 --> 20:05.080
Yeah.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.080
I saw him a couple, what is it?

20:06.080 --> 20:07.600
A year ago, two years ago.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.760
It was all brown.

20:08.760 --> 20:13.560
It was like, you know, it was a respectable beard, but now it's got a little bit of salt

20:13.560 --> 20:14.560
in there.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.560
It's got some gray.

20:15.560 --> 20:16.560
Yeah.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.740
I tell you, this guy looks like he's ready for the Linux community.

20:18.740 --> 20:21.920
So Carl is a really interesting CEO.

20:21.920 --> 20:26.120
I think he's one of the more interesting CEOs that I've met because-

20:26.120 --> 20:29.180
I'm personally insulted, but keep going.

20:29.180 --> 20:36.640
He's got a, System76 has a very strong, very unique culture and it starts with Carl.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.760
It absolutely does start with Carl.

20:38.760 --> 20:45.120
And Carl is one of those CEOs that he can be in the middle of a big speech and one of

20:45.120 --> 20:50.440
his employees can interrupt him and he'll stop and he'll listen.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.940
And he doesn't even, doesn't even faze him.

20:52.940 --> 20:59.720
He's one of those people that once he enters the room, everyone listens and Carl is very

20:59.720 --> 21:06.840
soft spoken and the room goes silent so that everyone can hear Carl.

21:06.840 --> 21:14.240
And he is, he's one of those individuals that operates at a higher plane than the rest of

21:14.240 --> 21:17.080
us that are doing day-to-day stuff operate.

21:17.080 --> 21:25.400
He lives at the big picture and yet he is maybe the one that is the most anal about

21:25.400 --> 21:27.440
the details.

21:27.440 --> 21:31.280
Every first hundred Thaleo systems or so that have been built, he's personally gone hands

21:31.280 --> 21:37.240
on, made sure like the wood lines up correctly, that the screw holes, I'm not joking when

21:37.240 --> 21:42.700
I say that they've developed a process to make sure that the screw holes are the correct

21:42.700 --> 21:46.640
smoothness so that way the feel of when you tighten the screws feels right.

21:46.640 --> 21:50.400
I mean this is the level of detail they're going down to now.

21:50.400 --> 21:54.120
Carl is the one showing people how to put some of these things together and in fact

21:54.120 --> 21:58.600
he took a good chunk of time away from the tour when we stopped and we had a break and

21:58.600 --> 22:00.320
we were just kind of going around chatting with the employees.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.800
We got full access to everybody.

22:01.800 --> 22:06.720
There was no restrictions and what he did with that time is he went through the production

22:06.720 --> 22:11.080
line and checked on every system at every stage of production to make sure every single

22:11.080 --> 22:13.720
detail had been seen to.

22:13.720 --> 22:21.080
And he's trying to get his staff to absorb these principles and I think he's dialing

22:21.080 --> 22:24.160
down as they increase production.

22:24.160 --> 22:29.080
But Carl is maybe the most fascinating thing about System 76.

22:29.080 --> 22:34.520
Also the other thing that I've noticed about the company is their retention is very high.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.740
A lot of people that are working there, some of them have been working there since about

22:38.740 --> 22:41.880
the beginning of the company still and they're still there.

22:41.880 --> 22:45.720
The people we mentioned on the show have been working there forever now.

22:45.720 --> 22:49.680
The people that have started working there since I've been following them still work

22:49.680 --> 22:50.680
there.

22:50.680 --> 22:51.680
There's been some churn.

22:51.680 --> 22:55.800
There's been some people that have poured one out for Ryan Sipes but there's been some

22:55.800 --> 22:56.800
churn.

22:56.800 --> 23:02.920
Ryan Sipes is great and frankly no one wears a cape and a top hat like he does.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.760
Let's keep going.

23:04.760 --> 23:08.400
But that says something about the culture of the company too.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.520
They're friends there.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.640
It's a cultural unit.

23:10.640 --> 23:15.040
In fact, this is a weird thing about them.

23:15.040 --> 23:20.000
A lot of them, like the support department, the software development, a lot of them have

23:20.000 --> 23:24.520
the opportunity to just work from home and yet they still choose to come into the office

23:24.520 --> 23:26.240
so they can hang out with everybody.

23:26.240 --> 23:32.760
See, oh damn, okay, first of all, do you understand I'm going to have you sent to federal prison

23:32.760 --> 23:35.600
because you keep wiretapping my home and office.

23:35.600 --> 23:40.200
I just had this conversation this morning about one of the weaknesses at TMB is that

23:40.200 --> 23:45.800
we haven't built a great internal corporate culture because you know what, most everybody

23:45.800 --> 23:51.760
basically works from home and it's kind of a very mercenary situation.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.080
We just don't have that like...

23:53.080 --> 23:56.220
I was thinking about this this morning too.

23:56.220 --> 24:01.140
In fact, I'm thinking I'm going to do a quarterly department meeting at the Linux Academy building

24:01.140 --> 24:07.240
so everybody has to come in, everybody flies in so it's like a shared experience and do

24:07.240 --> 24:11.980
a quarterly team building thing because we just had that company holiday party and everybody

24:11.980 --> 24:14.840
walked away from that feeling super fired up.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.440
Everybody was like, man, this is a great company.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.440
The people here are great.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.120
This is going to be an amazing year.

24:19.120 --> 24:23.340
I get just energized everybody and I'm like, well, they spent hundreds of thousands of

24:23.340 --> 24:27.640
dollars to pull that off but if we could do that at a department level, yeah, and the

24:27.640 --> 24:29.120
same with your company.

24:29.120 --> 24:32.000
It's like the same thing with a small business is it...

24:32.000 --> 24:33.280
It's a much more scale, right?

24:33.280 --> 24:41.160
So flying people from the few people from New Jersey to Florida is not a big deal, seriously.

24:41.160 --> 24:45.360
It's just a question of...

24:45.360 --> 24:48.040
One of the things we've had is we've been doing this a long time and there's one person

24:48.040 --> 24:53.960
who stuck with me through frankly before the show started and remember when the show started,

24:53.960 --> 24:54.960
when Zeus and...

24:54.960 --> 24:55.960
No.

24:55.960 --> 24:59.960
Yeah, no one does.

24:59.960 --> 25:05.320
There's only one person left from that era and there's all these in jokes he and I have

25:05.320 --> 25:06.600
that mean nothing to anybody.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.600
Do you know what I mean?

25:07.600 --> 25:08.600
They mean nothing.

25:08.600 --> 25:09.600
Yeah.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.600
So, yeah.

25:10.600 --> 25:11.600
Carl, I'm very jealous.

25:11.600 --> 25:12.600
Yeah.

25:12.600 --> 25:21.920
He's done a good job but they are not out of the woods yet in terms of this huge transition

25:21.920 --> 25:25.320
or the other way to put it is they're not out of the learning curve yet.

25:25.320 --> 25:29.760
They're still in the learning curve but if they're not a year ahead, then I thought,

25:29.760 --> 25:33.240
like they're on the upper end of that hockey puck.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.560
They're on the upper end of that hockey puck.

25:34.560 --> 25:39.400
I thought they would be like, you know, way down before even it starts to curve up.

25:39.400 --> 25:43.600
I thought it would take at least a year at least to even get this far and they're farther

25:43.600 --> 25:45.400
than I expected.

25:45.400 --> 25:51.560
So I wouldn't be surprised and I would say after going there, everybody should probably

25:51.560 --> 25:59.280
set their expectations a little lower.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.440
I take it back.

26:00.440 --> 26:01.440
That's your favorite.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.440
It is.

26:02.440 --> 26:03.440
You're right.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.440
You know what?

26:04.440 --> 26:05.440
That's mine too.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.440
I play it for my customers.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.840
I just want to make this certainly clear.

26:08.840 --> 26:11.720
The ship dates a little fuzzy.

26:11.720 --> 26:15.440
I would say lower your expectations on when the laptops are going to come.

26:15.440 --> 26:19.160
It could be a year and a half, two year process to learn how to do that.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.160
Laptops?

26:21.160 --> 26:22.160
Oh yeah.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.160
Slow your roll buddy boy.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.160
Yeah.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.160
That's the ultimate goal.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.160
They sell more laptops.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.160
So I asked him about this.

26:27.160 --> 26:31.440
I said, Hey Carl, you sell more desktops or you sell more laptops?

26:31.440 --> 26:32.440
Thinking he'd say laptops.

26:32.440 --> 26:34.280
He said, yeah, we sell more laptops.

26:34.280 --> 26:39.780
But he says, this is what he says, this is what he says, Mike, he says, the desktop sales

26:39.780 --> 26:42.360
have paid for this warehouse transition.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.480
I think the desktop's got to be higher margin.

26:44.480 --> 26:45.480
Yeah.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.480
Right?

26:46.480 --> 26:47.480
Yeah.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.160
So now they're going to look at how to pull off laptops, but that's after they figure

26:50.160 --> 26:52.160
out really how to do this part.

26:52.160 --> 26:54.040
And you know, there's a lot to this.

26:54.040 --> 27:00.120
There's the, there's the, it's hard to explain really, like they, they have analyzed all

27:00.120 --> 27:04.760
of the parts and they, they figure out what they can mass manufacture.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.200
So they can do this in batches, right?

27:06.200 --> 27:10.860
They can, they can build the Thaleo casing and assemble all of that before they've ever

27:10.860 --> 27:12.000
put a single part into it.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.720
So there's parts where they can optimize and they're learning all of that now.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.360
And then they can apply it to laptops.

27:18.360 --> 27:22.700
And they're, you know, they're experimenting with that Thaleo custom IO board with some

27:22.700 --> 27:26.720
of their own custom boards, but maybe that goes a little further down the road.

27:26.720 --> 27:27.720
Who knows?

27:27.720 --> 27:28.720
Okay.

27:28.720 --> 27:29.720
Yeah.

27:29.720 --> 27:30.720
All right.

27:30.720 --> 27:31.720
It was an interesting trip.

27:31.720 --> 27:34.800
I, I walked away wanting one of these machines pretty badly.

27:34.800 --> 27:38.960
I'd say I, if I bought one of these, I think it'd be probably the best desktop I ever owned.

27:38.960 --> 27:42.800
Well, first of all, as a big shot corporate vice president, doesn't your assistant buy

27:42.800 --> 27:43.800
it for you?

27:43.800 --> 27:46.000
I mean, isn't that how this works?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.680
I got to get one of those first.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.800
That's what I got to do is I got to get me an assistant.

27:49.800 --> 27:50.800
Yeah.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.880
If there's anyone out there in the audience that's been following me for a really long

27:52.880 --> 27:57.120
time and has figured out how I work and want to be my assistant, let me know.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.300
All right.

27:58.300 --> 28:04.040
So overall impressions, you're, you, you would not, you would not deter anyone from picking

28:04.040 --> 28:05.040
up a Thaleo.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.040
No, I want one.

28:06.040 --> 28:07.040
Yeah.

28:07.040 --> 28:11.200
But what finish the dark walnut or the, you know, I liked the dark in person.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.000
I thought I'd like the lighter one and they sell a lot more of the dark.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
It turns out.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Yeah.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Yeah.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
I, you know what?

28:18.000 --> 28:20.200
I almost pulled the trigger on one tonight.

28:20.200 --> 28:24.840
The, the manufacturing I'm showing right now on the stream involves a lot of modern shit,

28:24.840 --> 28:30.720
like a 3d printing, like I mentioned, and they have, they have a laser, they have an

28:30.720 --> 28:38.640
80 amp laser cutter that has a, has a laser beam that will cut through pretty much anything

28:38.640 --> 28:41.560
that steps in front of it, including your legs.

28:41.560 --> 28:48.440
So like, Oh yeah, they're using really advanced and modern technology to build this thing.

28:48.440 --> 28:53.920
So they're not, they have an interesting advantage that they don't have a manufacturing legacy.

28:53.920 --> 28:57.080
They're coming at it with a perspective of how can we use Linux?

28:57.080 --> 28:58.840
How can we use 3d printing?

28:58.840 --> 29:03.200
How can we use lasers and that kind of, so they can buy the newest equipment instead

29:03.200 --> 29:06.080
of being like, well, but that's the other thing I think is I think they've been able

29:06.080 --> 29:10.720
to buy some of this stuff used, but it, the market is established enough now that you

29:10.720 --> 29:12.480
can buy a used laser cutter.

29:12.480 --> 29:17.720
You can, you can, you know, and the 3d printer that is large enough to do this is, is not

29:17.720 --> 29:18.720
$20,000.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.280
It's $10,000.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.280
That kind of stuff.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.280
Yeah.

29:22.280 --> 29:27.120
It's really fascinating to watch a company that their strong suit before was customer

29:27.120 --> 29:33.020
service software and, and management of parts to now actually building them.

29:33.020 --> 29:37.720
And to see the other thing as a, as a former now small business owner is to see how different

29:37.720 --> 29:44.080
individuals of the team have stepped up to you know, like in the, I'm showing a picture

29:44.080 --> 29:45.080
of Kate here.

29:45.080 --> 29:48.080
You know, it was the industrial designer of this thing.

29:48.080 --> 29:51.240
People each individual members of the team that did something in the past have now had

29:51.240 --> 29:54.900
to step up to do something that they didn't do before.

29:54.900 --> 29:57.640
And they had to grow as a team to pull this off.

29:57.640 --> 30:02.760
So it wasn't just that the, you know, Carl and a few others, but the entire team had

30:02.760 --> 30:06.120
to add something new to their repertoire.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.120
And they all did it.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.120
That's the thing.

30:08.120 --> 30:11.000
Like they all, like, I don't, I think that's it.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.400
I think that's the lesson I'm taking away from this is if cult, if the culture wasn't

30:15.400 --> 30:19.080
as strong and if the bonds between the people there weren't as strong, this would not have

30:19.080 --> 30:21.720
worked because you can't do this.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.280
You cannot pull this off.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.120
It's not possible to do what they did.

30:25.120 --> 30:31.920
It isn't, it isn't doable unless everybody is pulling in the same direction and people

30:31.920 --> 30:34.920
are willing to pull a new weight that they didn't have to pull before.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.760
And maybe they're willing to have a really shitty three months or maybe they're willing

30:37.760 --> 30:40.160
to have a really shitty six months.

30:40.160 --> 30:46.200
And if the team, the entire, if the CEO can be willing to do it, but the team isn't necessarily

30:46.200 --> 30:47.280
willing to do it.

30:47.280 --> 30:53.360
And when the entire team is willing to do it, you can do something that I swear to God

30:53.360 --> 30:54.360
is not possible.

30:54.360 --> 30:56.200
And it's just, it's really remarkable.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.200
Very impressive.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.200
I think that's what it is.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.200
Yeah.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.200
It's a culture.

31:00.200 --> 31:03.960
They have a shared goal, a shared idea, and they're all in it together.

31:03.960 --> 31:04.960
Maniacs.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.680
Well, it's nice.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.120
It's something you envy.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.960
You know, you go there and you're like, gosh, the army wouldn't be man being part of this,

31:11.960 --> 31:12.960
you know?

31:12.960 --> 31:13.960
I envy it deeply.

31:13.960 --> 31:20.720
I mean, this is, oh, there's so much here that I don't want to dive into until our end

31:20.720 --> 31:29.280
of the year episode, but there is something to be said from being in a market, a geographical

31:29.280 --> 31:37.040
market, that's in a certain state where you can have a culture of like-minded people and

31:37.040 --> 31:40.520
take a lot of risk towards a certain goal.

31:40.520 --> 31:43.360
Right in this case, it would be an open desktop Linux platform.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.360
Yeah.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.360
Yeah.

31:45.360 --> 31:48.080
They joked about having a mutual suicide pact.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.080
Well, yeah.

31:49.080 --> 31:50.080
Yeah.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.080
Yeah.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.080
Yeah.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.080
Yeah.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.080
It is.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.360
It is.

31:55.360 --> 32:01.280
It's humbling to see it because they roll with their weird.

32:01.280 --> 32:04.680
And I think having Kate on their team, she's their designer.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.240
She's their Johnny Ives, really.

32:06.240 --> 32:11.760
And she's really helped with the, yeah, she's helped with the branding so much and they've

32:11.760 --> 32:16.920
she's helped them embody what they all as a team represent with, you know, the robots

32:16.920 --> 32:18.300
and the kind of sci-fi look.

32:18.300 --> 32:21.920
And I appreciate that as somebody who named his company Jupiter Broadcasting.

32:21.920 --> 32:30.280
I saw a lot of that is they're now communicating, they're communicating their unique style via

32:30.280 --> 32:33.320
their branding now via their hardware.

32:33.320 --> 32:36.680
And I believe within a year or two, I think that's capable this team could pull it off

32:36.680 --> 32:38.060
with Pop OS too.

32:38.060 --> 32:41.880
And Pop OS is getting close too, but that's where Pop OS fits into this whole thing is

32:41.880 --> 32:47.800
it's part of communicating System 76 as well as solving problems for customers because

32:47.800 --> 32:49.600
they, they have their own support data.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.960
You know, they have their own customer base.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.480
They know what these people want.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.840
They also know what kind of hardware they want to ship and they know what they need

32:54.840 --> 32:56.520
to do to ship that.

32:56.520 --> 33:02.160
And it all kind of comes together with the branding, the story, the hardware and the

33:02.160 --> 33:03.160
OS.

33:03.160 --> 33:07.600
And when they're eventually in a couple of years making their own laptops, it will complete

33:07.600 --> 33:08.600
the circle.

33:08.600 --> 33:11.700
It sort of closes the loop.

33:11.700 --> 33:18.960
And the crazy thing is, and Carl reaffirmed this is they haven't taken any outside investing.

33:18.960 --> 33:25.040
This isn't, this is being done with this, with the financing of the sales of their existing

33:25.040 --> 33:26.400
Linux products.

33:26.400 --> 33:32.380
They're financing this with the sale of Linux hardware and Linux desktops, which in itself

33:32.380 --> 33:36.240
is a bit of a success story for Linux that doesn't get talked about very much.

33:36.240 --> 33:41.600
Well, I think that's the best place to leave it.

33:41.600 --> 33:42.600
All right.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.600
Yeah.

33:43.600 --> 33:46.160
So, and I'll have, I'll talk more about some of the hardware details and the software details

33:46.160 --> 33:48.360
that I saw in Linux Unplugged tomorrow too.

33:48.360 --> 33:52.720
So I've saved some of that for the Linux Unplugged show too, cause there's lots to share, lots

33:52.720 --> 33:53.720
to share.

33:53.720 --> 34:00.080
But, you know, we joke a lot about Yoda on this show, but there was a, what would you

34:00.080 --> 34:01.080
call it?

34:01.080 --> 34:02.080
A retrofactor?

34:02.080 --> 34:03.080
A retrofactor?

34:03.080 --> 34:04.080
I don't know.

34:04.080 --> 34:09.160
Just kind of like a profile piece on Donald Knuth, one of the founding fathers of computer

34:09.160 --> 34:10.160
science.

34:10.160 --> 34:11.920
I'd just like to wrap up the show today.

34:11.920 --> 34:16.200
I know we've talked a lot about Linux and System76 and next week's episode is our end

34:16.200 --> 34:17.200
of the year.

34:17.200 --> 34:20.120
So these are two kind of non-codey code radios.

34:20.120 --> 34:27.060
But if you want to know like the deep low level of coding, I was once forced to read

34:27.060 --> 34:34.120
The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth and it's thick, like a very dry steak.

34:34.120 --> 34:35.880
But let me tell you something.

34:35.880 --> 34:41.560
He is, the New York Times calls him the Yoda of computer programming and frankly that's

34:41.560 --> 34:42.900
what he is.

34:42.900 --> 34:48.840
If you're looking for someone's papers and he's written books, he's written a bunch of

34:48.840 --> 34:52.320
academic materials for you to study.

34:52.320 --> 34:55.040
If you're looking for someone to get a little deeper, let's say you're a web developer and

34:55.040 --> 34:59.960
you want to learn more about, oh jeez, see it's hard for me not to slap around JavaScript

34:59.960 --> 35:00.960
developers.

35:00.960 --> 35:06.680
Actual, let's just say if you want to learn more low level stuff, I would encourage you

35:06.680 --> 35:07.680
to read some Knuth.

35:07.680 --> 35:08.680
Okay.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.480
Knuth, Knuth, put it this way.

35:11.480 --> 35:16.160
When I was a young whippersnapper, Knuth is key, it's one of the first things I was taught.

35:16.160 --> 35:20.000
And a gift I got was the entire set of The Art of Computer Programming.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.600
Oh, that's a value of like almost $300 my friend.

35:23.600 --> 35:26.800
Yes, which I was then compelled to read and report on.

35:26.800 --> 35:27.800
Okay.

35:27.800 --> 35:28.800
Very good.

35:28.800 --> 35:29.800
It's worth it.

35:29.800 --> 35:30.800
It's a nice piece.

35:30.800 --> 35:32.440
It's got good photos too.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.680
I was just skimming it as you were talking about it.

35:34.680 --> 35:35.680
The Yoda's are looking good.

35:35.680 --> 35:36.680
Well, it's universal, right?

35:36.680 --> 35:40.200
It's not like, you know, JavaScript for dummies or C sharp for dummies.

35:40.200 --> 35:45.240
It's literally The Art of Computer Programming.

35:45.240 --> 35:48.920
When the show's title is The Art and Business of Software Development, well, he's the art

35:48.920 --> 35:49.920
of software development.

35:49.920 --> 35:50.920
This is the guy.

35:50.920 --> 35:51.920
There you go.

35:51.920 --> 35:52.920
There you go.

35:52.920 --> 35:53.920
Thank you.

35:53.920 --> 35:59.680
I strongly recommend that everybody read his, at least volumes one and two.

35:59.680 --> 36:03.640
The subsequent volumes and he has Fast Seals, which he calls them, which are like little

36:03.640 --> 36:09.800
editions, can get a little rough and very like data mathy, but the first two I think

36:09.800 --> 36:10.800
are very important.

36:10.800 --> 36:11.800
You know what?

36:11.800 --> 36:15.600
I will put links to some of the eBooks and this article in the show notes so people can

36:15.600 --> 36:21.880
go grab and make it easy for the lazy web, coder.show slash three three six for that.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.880
Mr. Dominic, is there anybody you want to link to anything you want to plug before we

36:25.880 --> 36:26.880
get out of here this week?

36:26.880 --> 36:29.800
I'd like to plug a Carl O'Chel's beard.

36:29.800 --> 36:30.800
No kidding.

36:30.800 --> 36:31.800
I'm a little jealous.

36:31.800 --> 36:32.800
No.

36:32.800 --> 36:35.960
Go to at Domenico on Twitter and the bad fodder dot com.

36:35.960 --> 36:39.480
You know what the worst thing about Carl is, is that he's working his butt off and he's

36:39.480 --> 36:40.480
still in great shape.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.480
And it's the.

36:41.480 --> 36:42.480
It looks amazing.

36:42.480 --> 36:43.480
It's so frustrating.

36:43.480 --> 36:44.480
It's so frustrating.

36:44.480 --> 36:45.480
What a jerk, right?

36:45.480 --> 36:46.480
I don't know how he pulls it off.

36:46.480 --> 36:49.760
Actually, I know how he pulls it off because he stayed in shape since like his early 20s.

36:49.760 --> 36:50.760
He's like a workout enthusiast.

36:50.760 --> 36:53.720
I tell you what, that's the trick.

36:53.720 --> 36:54.720
I'm so lazy.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.480
Anyways, you know what I would do if you're lazy, just want to get these episodes every

36:57.480 --> 36:58.480
single week.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.520
I go to coder.show slash subscribe.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.440
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

37:02.440 --> 37:05.400
You get the week's episode whenever we put it out on a Monday.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.400
We put on Tuesday.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.400
We put on a Friday.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.400
You get it.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.400
Coder dot show slash subscribe.

37:09.400 --> 37:14.120
Also, we'd love to have you participate in our subreddit coder radio dot reddit dot com.

37:14.120 --> 37:19.080
And last but not least, give us some feedback, your thoughts, your stories.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.080
Coder dot show slash contact.

37:20.080 --> 37:21.080
Thanks for being here.

37:21.080 --> 37:39.240
And we'll see you right back here for our year end wrap up next week.
