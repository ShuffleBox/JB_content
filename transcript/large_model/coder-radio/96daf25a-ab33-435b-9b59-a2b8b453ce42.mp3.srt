00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 491 for November 7th, 2022.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:19,420
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,900
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,860
My name is Chris and joining us every single week, hopefully fully caffeinated, it's our

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,400
host, Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Hello Mike.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,340
Damn, skip it Chris, I'm a pot of coffee in and I have a steaming cup of hot matcha right

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,340
next to me.

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,340
In.

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,340
Yes!

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,340
In.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,340
Cause I'm, you know, I'm no pleb.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,340
In a mad-botterer cup.

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,340
Ah, very good.

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,340
A mad-botterer coffee cup, yep.

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,060
You know, I'm still loving that KOTOR robe.

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,060
Still loving it.

18
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,060
Just rocking it the other day.

19
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,460
It's all I wear when the mailman comes.

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,840
You know, I really genuinely had the thought the other day, like, why don't I just wear

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,680
this all the time and nothing but this when I'm just going to be home all day?

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,620
It doesn't happen very often, but my God, the two things together are so glorious.

23
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,660
So, so glorious.

24
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,300
We are gathered here today mostly, I think, to hear about your two-factor nightmare and

25
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,700
looks like you went deep into Swift again.

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,100
So that's going to be, I think, the bulk of the show today.

27
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,820
However, since we gathered together last week, there has been a tremendous amount of news.

28
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,660
So we're going to do a little hangover watch for the economy, pour yourself a cup of coffee.

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,660
Yeah.

30
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,340
I found a new site that I wanted to tell you about that is shocking.

31
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:38,740
It's called layoffs.fyi and it's currently tracking 755 startups with over a hundred

32
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,780
and four thousand layoffs in 22 so far.

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,300
And of course you can jump around, you can look at the charts.

34
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,780
They've got, they're doing some really interesting ways of tracking it and showing different

35
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,740
waves of different, I guess, phases of layoffs since COVID-19 really hit.

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:03,620
And the list is, it's kind of depressing to see, honestly, but the news has been unbelievable.

37
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:10,580
Today before we started recording, Apple announced an update on the supply of iPhone 14 and

38
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,780
iPhone 14 Pro Max.

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,620
I haven't seen one of these updates since about 2008 or 2009.

40
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:25,720
They say that, they say due to COVID-19 restrictions in China and the concern about the health

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:33,140
of their workers, they are going to miss the supply and that they will have more shipments

42
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,980
than previously anticipated that will experience longer wait times as they will be producing

43
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,500
fewer iPhones.

44
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,140
And we've seen rumors about less iPhone demand.

45
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,820
And I had speculated that that would be an early recession indicator is all of a sudden

46
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
a thousand dollar phone looks a little ridiculous.

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,420
When times are good and the money's flowing, you can buy a $1,100 phone.

48
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,760
But when the price of gas is going up on a monthly basis and the price of food still

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,940
going up, $1,100 phone is kind of silly sometimes.

50
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,380
And I think Apple's feeling, they're blaming COVID-19, but they've also been moving more

51
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,540
and more manufacturing to India and Taiwan and other places.

52
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,300
So I don't know.

53
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,740
But I think that's a big indicator there.

54
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,860
Also today's the day that Elon set the deadline for Twitter Blue and it seems to have worked,

55
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,860
remember?

56
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
He said they have until like the seventh or they're fired.

57
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,860
Yeah.

58
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,860
Well, they're fired.

59
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,860
And they're rolling out the Twitter Blue.

60
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,380
They're rolling out the new membership stuff.

61
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,460
I think they, although yeah, a lot of them are fired.

62
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,900
You know, I've been thinking about this too.

63
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,900
Imagine what we're going to see here after, if Elon pulls this off even somewhat, and

64
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:47,220
if the metric is going by ruthless CEO standards in the market, not going by human standards,

65
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,220
if the metric is profitability, he might do it.

66
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,300
I mean, if he gets thousands of people to pay eight bucks a month and he lays off 60%

67
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,940
of the staff, he might get it.

68
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,900
And if he has verified accounts, advertisers are going to eat that up.

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,380
I mean, right now you're seeing advertisers pause, but once they know that that's a genuine

70
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,980
human who's been verified and that they know exactly what kind of things they like, that

71
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,740
in terms of an ad buy, a person who is a knowable, verifiable person is worth substantially more

72
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,500
than an anonymous number.

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Right.

74
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,260
Than an impression on a page or a CPM or anything like that.

75
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,260
Sure.

76
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,260
So what if we're seeing an extreme recession model be created here?

77
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,100
You'll see other tech companies essentially go on sale.

78
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,980
They'll have some CEO that buys them out ruthlessly, comes in, fires half the staff, brings in

79
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:43,420
their own people, basically carves it down to an MVP, takes it private, does all of this

80
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,420
work, because you wouldn't do it when it's a public company, does all this carving.

81
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:52,380
It's kind of the Romney strategy of past, you know, the bank capital strategy, only

82
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,420
it's for tech companies now.

83
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,920
And it's by tech CEOs.

84
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,600
And I think if he pulls it off, and I'm not saying this is a good thing.

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,500
If he pulls this off, I think it's going to be looked at as a model for the next two years,

86
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,020
because we're going into a multi-year recession and there's going to be a lot of businesses

87
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,320
on sale.

88
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,460
And I think this is going to be the play, is the idea is you go in, you clean up, and

89
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,460
then you turn it around.

90
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,060
And by the time the market's picking back up in 2024, 2025, you bring it public again,

91
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,500
you make a bunch of money.

92
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Yeah.

93
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,060
I mean, I think Twitter itself, I mean, that could be a model that generally works.

94
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,840
I still feel kind of going along with what I said last week, that Twitter itself has

95
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
some unique problems.

96
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,100
One, I mean, I don't know if you've noticed this.

97
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,540
I know I'm much more active on Twitter than you generally are.

98
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,900
My Twitter feed is basically worthless now.

99
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,820
And I used to get a lot of good tech news, dev news, follow a bunch of open source people

100
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:51,780
or people at Microsoft, stuff like that, because it's everybody just being mad about Elon.

101
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,820
And I understand that it's just strange.

102
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,620
The things I've been saying are the Magic the Gathering 30th anniversary event and Elon

103
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,100
hate.

104
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,180
So I feel like he's somehow got to get a handle on this.

105
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,540
Now, of course, the Internet's attention span is like that of my dogs.

106
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,700
So maybe, you know, maybe he just needs to ride it out for another week.

107
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Yeah.

108
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,300
I mean, I think inevitably, once we get past all this, right, and I think this, I don't

109
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,300
really want to go on about Twitter, but yeah, I think inevitably, people just, they freak

110
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,300
out, they have an absolute panic attack.

111
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,460
And then in six months, they pretend like it never happened.

112
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,020
That's our current state of the world right now.

113
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,020
Right.

114
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,300
I mean, as far as like the way I like to use Twitter, other than like trolling and like

115
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,100
memes or whatever, I still feel like Google Plus was a much better like techie social

116
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,740
network where I got more valuable data than I ever did with Twitter.

117
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,740
Right.

118
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,180
Like I had different circles for perfect example.

119
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,780
So Google Plus, I had like an iOS dev circle I was in and I had your whatever the JB one

120
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,740
was right there was like, I don't know if it was official by you or what.

121
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,740
Yeah, yeah.

122
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Yep.

123
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,740
It was like the JB circle.

124
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,740
You could have like the, Hey, I have this problem with like UI table view conversation

125
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,460
and avoid getting the, you know, sometimes friendly, sometimes less than friendly trolling

126
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,380
from the Linux folks, right?

127
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,100
And then you could have the Linux conversation about, you know, whatever open source.

128
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,180
I think at the time I was like trying to help out with Geary or something like that.

129
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,900
It was better, right?

130
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,900
Than just like scream.

131
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,060
I feel like Twitter in a lot of ways is, you know, going to the Empire State Building and

132
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,420
just shouting at the top of your lungs.

133
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:40,020
So I don't know, I, maybe I'm just retroactively assigning more value to the Google Plus than

134
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,020
there really was.

135
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:47,500
But I felt like I had more serious, deeper conversations that actually produced you know,

136
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
mutual value.

137
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Right.

138
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Oh, absolutely.

139
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,820
Mastodon is seeing a big boom right now.

140
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,300
So some people are moving over there.

141
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,500
I want to keep going on the Hangover Watch though.

142
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,620
Apple also warned investors they predict a substantial drop in Mac revenue for the holiday

143
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,220
quarter.

144
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,660
Tim Cook made it clear during the earnings call with investors that the company is subject

145
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,540
to impacts of the macro economy, which has been affected by the war in Eastern Europe

146
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,220
and as a consequence of the pandemic.

147
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,500
In other words, the supply chain and inflation is going to cost them.

148
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,140
Well, and they sold a ton of MacBook Airs, right?

149
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,820
The MacBook Air, see, I know our audience, we're all like MacBook Pros, you know, or

150
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,540
the Linux folks, whatever.

151
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,620
They sold a lot of those and those buyers are your average Joe and Jane.

152
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,940
They're buying maybe every three years.

153
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,820
So and there was huge pent up debate.

154
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:46,380
I worry that if the iPhone is being paused in production and they're predicting a quote

155
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:52,100
substantial drop in Mac revenue, which Apple is usually very accurate about these things.

156
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,360
I think we're going to see dark Apple.

157
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
I think we really are.

158
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,700
You know, there is also since we got together, developers have discovered that recent changes

159
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,580
made to the App Store ads sort of raised some serious privacy concerns.

160
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:11,200
It seems that the App Store app on iOS 14.6 and up is sending every tap you make inside

161
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,860
the app everywhere to Apple.

162
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,040
We that could be exploited.

163
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,420
There's some uncertainty is that if you have analytics on or not, right, or is it by default?

164
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,140
I wonder, though, you combine this with the recent gambling ad stuff.

165
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,380
And that's that, of course, you know, they they they just knocked the knees out from

166
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,140
meta for app tracking and a bunch of other advertising platforms.

167
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,900
And they've only been turning it up on their own platform.

168
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,160
And it's this, I think, is pretty alarming.

169
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,700
Because if their hardware sales are going to go down, then they're just going to have

170
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,020
to push even harder on services.

171
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,900
And they just raised the rate of Apple one.

172
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,140
They're all in subscription package.

173
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,380
The level of details in the video that they show here is striking.

174
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,500
Gruber says Apple ads are going wild.

175
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,860
Even Gruber is not on board.

176
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,820
Jason Snell, also very concerned, like long time Apple commentators feel like we're starting

177
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,220
to see dark Apple develop here.

178
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,380
And I just got to imagine a recession with hardware sales is just going to make the situation

179
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,820
even worse.

180
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,420
I think Apple is becoming more and more of a threat factor.

181
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,500
It sucks because the M1 hardware, the M2 stuff, I'm sure is going to be great.

182
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Like the M series is fantastic.

183
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,820
But Apple is a company, I think, not good.

184
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,000
We mentioned the Twitter layoffs.

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,340
Jack Dorsey came out playing cover for Elon Musk, said it's his fault.

186
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,940
They hired too many people.

187
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,660
Facebook has announced they are planning, quote, large scale layoffs this week.

188
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,500
Stripe is cutting its head count by 14%, readies for, quote, leaner times.

189
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,980
Lyft to lay off 700 employees in a second round of job cuts.

190
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:52,740
And Lyft has been having just a bear of a time for a couple of years.

191
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,180
Amazon executives confirm a hiring freeze.

192
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:02,040
Additionally, the scuttlebutt in my local town is they have a ginormous Amazon facility

193
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,420
by the studio that's going to bring 2,000 trucks a day into my area.

194
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:12,820
And it was about 95% finished, and Amazon hit the pause button.

195
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:18,620
And they're not going to finish it until proceeds go up, because they don't know if there's

196
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,740
enough demand for another warehouse in this area.

197
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,900
So they're just going to leave it at 90% finished.

198
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,380
They're going to have to keep security on it.

199
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,860
They're going to have to keep the lights on.

200
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,540
And there's a lot of homeless around here.

201
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,460
So if they're not constantly guarding it, it's going to turn into a ginormous homeless

202
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,460
encampment.

203
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,460
Oh, my god.

204
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,740
It's really going to be something.

205
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,100
And it's wild, because it's just this huge building that blocked my view of the mountains

206
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,380
and just totally took over the skyline.

207
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,020
And they're just hitting pause.

208
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,820
I mean, we've been saying it for months now, right?

209
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,820
I know.

210
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,300
It's going to be an icy winter.

211
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,300
So why do we talk about it?

212
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,860
We talk about it not because we want to watch the economic porn.

213
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,620
We're not talking about it because we want to scare you.

214
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,580
We're talking about it because these macro trends are going to impact developers.

215
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,900
They're going to impact client jobs.

216
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,100
They're going to impact employment.

217
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,520
They're going to impact your negotiation abilities.

218
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,420
There's a real world impact that's going to hit the development community.

219
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:16,000
And they're going to be hit hardest because this is specifically going after tech.

220
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,500
Investors are pivoting from growth stocks to value stocks.

221
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,300
They're literally transferring money out of tech stocks, like another trillion dollars

222
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,540
in tech stocks was drained last year or last week, last week.

223
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,560
And they're putting it into other places, assets and other stocks that are like value

224
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,140
stocks and things like that.

225
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,440
And the tech companies are getting hit the hardest because the tech companies were the

226
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,520
biggest recipients of the easy money for the last decade.

227
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,620
And so now they're getting hit the hardest and it's going to directly affect our community.

228
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,020
And we've been talking about it, but now it's actually happening.

229
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,820
And it just seems like the pace is picking up faster and faster.

230
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,940
You got to wonder where we're going to be in a couple of months.

231
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
A couple of months.

232
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
Right.

233
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,940
We're going to see more layoffs.

234
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,820
I agree with you on the multi year thing.

235
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,580
I think this actually doesn't hit the depending on how you want to look at it, the peak of

236
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,300
pain or the trough of misery.

237
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
Right.

238
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:12,220
It's going to be a maximalist destruction probably for another whole year.

239
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,340
You convinced me of something last week and I was thinking about it after the show.

240
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:22,240
I don't think that unless you get a sorry, Europeans, this is super America, United States.

241
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,540
Our Canadian friends don't like it when we say America, the super U.S. focused.

242
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:32,460
But unless you have a Republican sweep in Congress, there is no way Biden is going to

243
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,660
not turn on the money printer.

244
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:41,400
He'll tolerate it for maybe a year, but not if this isn't going to be five years because

245
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,580
they'll never win another election.

246
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:50,540
It's just unfortunately, the whole the whole economy and the populace as a whole is now

247
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,240
addicted to printing money.

248
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,280
And everything runs on printed money now.

249
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,820
Everything runs on.

250
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,400
You know, you take a look at the housing market, which is going down somewhat.

251
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,320
But the prices are still unattainable for your average, you know, your average 20 something

252
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,420
coming out of college, getting married, whatever.

253
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,820
Where if you go back to the halcyon days after World War Two and let's even say like the

254
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,460
60s, 70s, that was much more doable.

255
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,240
And not only that, that was the normal, very attainable path.

256
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,260
So same thing for wages.

257
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,940
This is not one that you'll see in the Wall Street Journal, but I think it's interesting

258
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:31,380
that we effectively lease everything now in terms of all these services instead of actually

259
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,800
owning anything as something that's been on my mind.

260
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,580
Like I paid 10 bucks a month to listen to the same maybe 30 albums when I could have

261
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
just bought.

262
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,500
And I, in fact, do have many of them either in iTunes purchased or CD or whatever.

263
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:54,260
The universe that happens if they just let this burn is a total realignment of the economy.

264
00:14:54,260 --> 00:15:02,460
And probably that's actually good if you're a little guy, if you can survive it.

265
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,700
Because I don't, I think tech businesses, particularly software businesses are gonna

266
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,140
sober up a little bit and go back to, hey, we actually have to be a business where we

267
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,500
sell or license a product and actually make money.

268
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,940
Where I can tell you one of my big pain points has been, and I've talked to other people

269
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:24,320
in similar positions, VC backed companies who are just a drunk on the free money, find

270
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,500
out you're a competitor and they're like, oh, they're charging 8,000 or 5,000 for a

271
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,760
license or whatever, we'll do it for 500, right?

272
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,700
They just literally kneecap you and effectively bleed out your capital, right?

273
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,380
Cause you're bootstrapped.

274
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,340
So that might be my hobby horse, but I think it's bad that all these people are losing

275
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,340
their jobs.

276
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,420
Obviously I feel for them on a human level.

277
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,500
But these businesses, and I'm thinking less of the big, big guys and more of like the

278
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,420
VC companies that are trying to kind of edge their way in.

279
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,980
They need to be real businesses, right?

280
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,780
Even it's funny, you mentioned all these big dudes.

281
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,260
Apple in a way was on this list, the only traditional business that when it started

282
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,260
had to actually make money.

283
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,700
Go down that list, Twitter, Facebook.

284
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,740
My thinking though is if it hits these big guys, it's gonna be even harder on the small

285
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,740
ones.

286
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,460
Well, what's gonna be harder is I think consulting could become harder cause you're gonna have

287
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,500
a bunch of like ex Facebook engineers who are like, screw it, I'm gonna go 1099 it out.

288
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,740
And you know, that's very sexy for the, you know, the marketing agency hiring an iOS dev

289
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,100
for a contract or something.

290
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Sure.

291
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,440
But yeah, I mean, it's bad overall.

292
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Don't get me wrong.

293
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,420
I'm saying there's a slight silver lining, but this is a bloodbath and it shouldn't have

294
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,420
happened.

295
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
It shouldn't have.

296
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,500
But just to touch on the human moment just a little bit, because we often talk about

297
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:54,920
it from a business owner, CEO kind of market perspective, but regular everyday people are

298
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,700
paying the price for policies that led us here.

299
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:07,100
And last week I watched Chair Powell's update on, you know, another rate increase.

300
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,220
And he signaled he's going, he's gonna go for a while.

301
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Pedal to the metal, baby.

302
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
Yeah.

303
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,980
And one of the things I love about the mindblower is so there are 12 members of the feds open

304
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,260
market committee that vote for these rate increases.

305
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,700
And one of them is Esther George.

306
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:26,340
And she is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

307
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,400
She's on this 12 member board that votes for the rate increases.

308
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,300
And she did something really unusual.

309
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,540
She had an interview with NPR.

310
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,980
In this interview, she says they're basically going to keep going until American savings

311
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,980
account are drained.

312
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:46,340
Quote, we see today that there is a bit of savings buffer still sitting for households.

313
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,000
That may allow them to continue to spend in a way that keeps demand strong, she said.

314
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,340
That suggests we may have to keep at this for a while.

315
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,500
Because regular Americans have too much money, they're gonna have to keep at this for a while,

316
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,620
because they can afford the inflation for a little while.

317
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:10,860
And then, you know, you look at what Powell says is he says employment's too high.

318
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,340
The employment market's still too hot, is his term.

319
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,180
They need to cool down the employment market.

320
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,420
There's still too many jobs available.

321
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,820
There's not enough people unemployed.

322
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,340
So you've got a clear, like they want to raise employment and they want to make Americans

323
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:31,780
spend their savings buffer so that way they can lower demand, which will lower pressure

324
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,100
on the supply chain, which will then fix inflation.

325
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,300
So they're talking about like fourth order effects they're going for here.

326
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:43,660
And the experiment is being done on the middle class average workers, while the people that

327
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,620
are rich will be able to just buy up assets that become super cheap as a result of this.

328
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,620
Distressed assets.

329
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,780
Yeah, and they'll just totally blow up in value when the market returns and they'll

330
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,140
make a ton of money.

331
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,940
And meanwhile, the American people, the average people will be left with less sales and a

332
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,940
higher standing unemployment, which is going to bring the quality of life down for everyone.

333
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,300
And that's their stated policy.

334
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
Yeah.

335
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,820
I mean, we should get off the doom and gloom, but I think I also saw her on NPR.

336
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,540
I think it's actually slightly worse than you describe it.

337
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,900
I think there's a thing you kind of missed.

338
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,340
It's not just savings.

339
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,580
It's spending power, which is a euphemism for credit.

340
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,220
So what is likely to happen, and we've seen this before, right?

341
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,260
2008, remember that, it's a good time.

342
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,100
Most households are not going to immediately cut their standard of living.

343
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,460
They're going to, yes, burn through savings, but they're also going to leverage every bit

344
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,700
of credit they have.

345
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,780
And at the end of this, you're going to have a lot of bankruptcies.

346
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,140
And what will happen is the people lucky enough to own modest homes, this is going to be a

347
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,960
party for BlackRock Capital, right?

348
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,620
You're going to have a lot of foreclosures because people use home equity credit if they

349
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,620
have any.

350
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,820
A lot of just bankruptcy is caused by straight up credit card debt.

351
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,580
And yeah, you're going to see payday lending is going to go up, which you should never

352
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,300
ever do that, by the way.

353
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,460
In a weird way, this is going to be, since we're using the addiction analogy, right?

354
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,660
This is going to be, okay, the Fed's cutting off your legal opioid supply.

355
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,380
Now you're doing street heroin.

356
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,760
The history proves it out, and I am 100% sure it will be the same this time.

357
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,620
People aren't just going to say, I'm lowering my family's day-to-day standard of living

358
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,620
significantly.

359
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,620
They're going to whip out that capital.

360
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,620
Not until they're forced.

361
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,580
Well, when they max everything out, right?

362
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,920
But it's not just savings, right?

363
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,220
It's not capital.

364
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,220
It's also debt.

365
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,220
Yeah, you're right.

366
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,220
Yeah, so.

367
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
Yeah.

368
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,580
So I think people that can focus on doing more with less, people that can focus on building

369
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:52,740
a minimum viable product value are probably going to have the most success.

370
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,740
And there's going to be a correction in other places.

371
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,740
That's not true.

372
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,020
The super-rich are still going to have the most success.

373
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,020
Well, that's true.

374
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:03,260
If you bought Apple in 1995, you're in great shape.

375
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,180
No matter what, right?

376
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,900
Linode.com slash coder.

377
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,740
That's where you go to get $100, and it's a great way to support the show.

378
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,460
You get $100 on a new account for 60 days, linode.com slash coder.

379
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,600
Linode is quite simply the best place to build your next application, host your infrastructure,

380
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,420
or run a personal site or a gaming server.

381
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,620
Linode has a really easy-to-use dashboard, and they have one-click deployments for things

382
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,980
like Joplin, Git Tea, Focalboard, which is sort of like a Trello system that you can

383
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,500
just self-host up on Linode, and when you have our $100 credit, why not?

384
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,880
It's like if Trello and Asana had a tacit affair and had a baby, that would be Focalboard,

385
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,360
and you can deploy it with one click up over on the Linode dashboard.

386
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,360
So many great things in here.

387
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,900
I mentioned Gaming Server 2, one-click deployment of the Minecraft Java edition, actually several

388
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,400
game servers, several, including, you know, adult games.

389
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,860
I'm talking about development stuff like Node.js, Nextcloud.

390
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,420
That's my form of gaming, at least.

391
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,540
So they have the one-click deployments, and they have a dozen data centers around the

392
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,940
world, and they're adding another dozen throughout 2023, so they just keep moving from strength

393
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,980
to strength.

394
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,820
They started almost 19 years ago, and they just had to survive on a great product, and

395
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,620
now here we are, standing on the shoulders of generations of development.

396
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,620
It's really quite nice.

397
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:30,380
I had an opportunity recently to deploy one of their GPU systems, 96 gigs of RAM.

398
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:36,140
It had an RTX 6000 GPU, three times over.

399
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:42,100
Unbelievable, and it has a 40 gigabit connection to the network.

400
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,620
Their systems are screaming fast, regardless of which build you go with, because they are

401
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,540
their own ISP, so they all have 40 gigabit connections.

402
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,980
They have NVMe PCIe storage.

403
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,260
They have AMD EPYC processors, if you want a rig that has really fast processors.

404
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,500
They have high memory systems.

405
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,300
This is one thing I've never really needed.

406
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,840
I do have a system that does have 96 gigs of RAM, our matrix server, but they have systems

407
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,500
where you can get like, you know, 300 gigs of RAM.

408
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,860
And because Linode has the best support ever, if you've got a question, you get stuck, or

409
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,900
you want to talk about a custom plan, they'll work with you on that as well.

410
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,460
365, they pick up the phone, they answer your questions.

411
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,100
Because again, as a business, they had to survive on the merits of their product, and

412
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,100
support is part of that product.

413
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,220
And it just reflects throughout the entire Linode product.

414
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,540
They have so many great things over there, like object storage, Kubernetes support, databases

415
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,420
as a service, and a lot more.

416
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,160
So go try it out, support the show, and get $100 on a new account.

417
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,260
You go to linode.com slash coder.

418
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:47,780
One more time, to support the show, it's linode.com slash coder.

419
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,580
So I get the sense you've been deep diving into Swift, but before we get there, I want

420
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,180
to chat about your recent go about with losing a device, and how I think you almost lost

421
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,180
access to everything, at least based on the chat we had.

422
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,760
One way Apple gets device sales is people who are forced to.

423
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:13,460
My iPhone 12 Pro, whatever it was, had an unfortunate trick-or-treating accident.

424
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,940
So I got it kind of working, but of course, it was shattered.

425
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,020
It stopped working completely.

426
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,820
In the time it was working, I thought it was going to be OK, and I had failed to take off

427
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,020
my Google Authenticator from it.

428
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,020
Oh, yes.

429
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,020
Oh, my gosh.

430
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,020
Yep.

431
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
Been there.

432
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,020
Been there.

433
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,740
So OK, I have no phone now, which is super not viable for running a business.

434
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,520
So I march my little butt over to my local Verizon reseller, because for some reason,

435
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,380
you can do Verizon's back to doing the two-year thing, and I've had Verizon for like 10 years.

436
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:58,780
So I go, I get me a handy new iPhone 14 Pro Max, which I can tell you, if I didn't smash

437
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,920
my 12 Pro, I would not have gotten, because it's just not that different.

438
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
It's a little bigger.

439
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
It's more purple.

440
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,820
Which I like, but it's not worth what it costs in terms of upgrades.

441
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,660
No wonder the iPhone 14 isn't selling.

442
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,060
Yeah, they say the camera's better.

443
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,060
I can't see it.

444
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,620
That might just be whatever.

445
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,620
I really could not tell much of a difference between the 12, 13, or the 14.

446
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,060
As you know, I'm on the upgrade plan.

447
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,780
I got my 14.

448
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,780
It's fine.

449
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:30,740
So was the 13, except the device-to-device transfer did not transfer everything like

450
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,360
I had been told it would.

451
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,920
And they've added a new screen after you're done doing device-to-device transfer.

452
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,060
On the original device, your old device, they now come up with a screen that says, would

453
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,340
you like to erase this device?

454
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,520
Because I've been led to believe everything was copied over in a moment of lapse of judgment,

455
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,140
I said, yeah, go ahead and erase it.

456
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
Oh, no.

457
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,580
Then the password prompt for my iCloud account came up, and it says, you got to enter your

458
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,220
password before we can erase this device.

459
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,220
And I thought, OK, yeah.

460
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,240
I don't feel like doing that, because I got to go look it up on Bitward, and so I'll let

461
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,840
me log into my new phone.

462
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,740
So I log into the new phone, and I realize it's like doing that download from the app

463
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,100
store and restoring stuff, and I launch a few of my apps, and they have none of my state,

464
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,980
including my two-factor app.

465
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,020
So I pick up the old phone, and I go hit Cancel.

466
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,820
I'm raising my finger to tap the Cancel button, and before I can hit Cancel, the password

467
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,820
screen clears.

468
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
Oh, god.

469
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,380
And it begins the wipe process.

470
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,960
Oh, god.

471
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
And it wipes my phone.

472
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,260
Oh, so you feel my pain.

473
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,260
Yeah.

474
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,260
So tell me what happened.

475
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,260
All right.

476
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,780
So I'm super, so I get the phone.

477
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,540
I don't know what goes on at the Verizon store, but it always takes an hour and a half to

478
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,540
get out of there.

479
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,780
But sure enough, it took an hour and a half.

480
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,580
I think it's the eSIM.

481
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,560
They just had a hard time activating the phone.

482
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,460
I think they just have a countdown timer on their point-of-sales device, and they just

483
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,900
come up with a reason to keep you there for an hour and a half.

484
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,540
Maybe it's like, baby, get paid by the hour you're there or something.

485
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,540
It was weird.

486
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,540
But so whatever.

487
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,540
I get it.

488
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,540
Then I realized about the Google Authenticator.

489
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,980
So I'm like, crap.

490
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,380
So I'm desperately trying to get my other phone to unlock while I'm sitting there waiting

491
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
for this dude.

492
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,380
Won't do it.

493
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,380
Won't turn on nothing.

494
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,380
Dead at DOA.

495
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,380
Gone.

496
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,500
Luckily, I had diligently saved my override codes.

497
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,360
I can't say this is the first time this has happened.

498
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:20,500
Something like this, especially because I've been using 2FA for a very long time.

499
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,660
On one service that I will not name, I only have two override codes left.

500
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:32,180
So it got me thinking, after I had spent roughly an entire afternoon unlocking and re-2FAing

501
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,740
everything, what happens if you just run out of override codes?

502
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,820
Do you know what happens?

503
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,060
I would imagine then it's going to depend on what their support policies are.

504
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,260
It's going to be per platform.

505
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,520
With the exception of Facebook.

506
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,620
The only one who will override 2FA for you is Facebook, and they require you to send

507
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,020
them your driver's license.

508
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,620
Yeah, you know, I could see that.

509
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,100
They're probably dealing with boomers all the time that are losing their account.

510
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
No offense.

511
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,300
Listen, get off my lawn.

512
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,500
So by the way, we are boomers.

513
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Look at how we bitch about the economy, right?

514
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,660
We're down with it.

515
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,420
I am literally considered a millennial.

516
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,420
Yeah, so am I.

517
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
You're on the edge.

518
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,420
I'm on the edge.

519
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,420
I'm on the line.

520
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:16,380
So it turns out that the answer to my question is, you're hosed.

521
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,700
There is no, for almost every service, there is no way around that.

522
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,260
Yeah, get a new account.

523
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,260
Get a new account.

524
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,980
And in the case of Matrix, message Chris and have him just reset it for you.

525
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,980
Thanks, Chris.

526
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,980
Right?

527
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
Thanks, Wes, really.

528
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,980
Thanks, Wes.

529
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,980
I asked Wes.

530
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,980
You asked me.

531
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
I asked Wes.

532
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,100
So I have a couple ideas here.

533
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,940
One, what I'm doing now is I got rid of Google Auth completely, and I'm just using my phone

534
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,940
number.

535
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
Oh, OK.

536
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,860
Which in itself is problematic, right?

537
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,220
It's not as good.

538
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
It's slow.

539
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,940
There's a problem with their Twilio integration, which is probably what most of them are using.

540
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:00,700
And there's a good amount of documented public hacks where somebody got through because they're

541
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,700
using SMS two-factor.

542
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,700
Well, right.

543
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,420
And it's just SMS, not iMessage.

544
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:12,300
I propose that as Apple wants to conquer more of the known universe, they should make an

545
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:20,100
iMessage-specific 2FA system, like a Google Auth that runs through iMessage.

546
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,580
That if you have access, because think about it, Apple has your biometrics, right?

547
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,940
In my case, they have two fingerprints, a couple face scans.

548
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,580
Well, I think they scan your face like every five, 10 minutes, but a bunch of face scans.

549
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,780
I have multiple passwords.

550
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,300
They have my phone.

551
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:42,460
If you're also wearing the watch, the watch is on you, and they know how close it is to

552
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,820
the phone, which is just another data point.

553
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,620
So why couldn't that be the override?

554
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:55,420
It seems like a system, and I know some of our InfoSec listeners are going to be, well,

555
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,900
every override is an attack vector.

556
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:06,580
That's true, but I fear, and I've always pushed 2FA, I just fear that even me, who knows what

557
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:12,460
he's doing other than destroying his iPhone, people are going to have this experience like

558
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:18,780
I did, but be a little less savvy and not know how to get around it, or frankly, not

559
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:24,620
save their override codes, which I think is probably super likely, super common, right?

560
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:32,260
And they're just going to stop using 2FA altogether, which is a bad idea, to be clear.

561
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,260
So I don't know.

562
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,260
I mean, it was a nightmare.

563
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,020
It wasted most of a day.

564
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,500
Discord was surprisingly hard to recover.

565
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,540
And I only use Discord for Patreon things that I follow.

566
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,820
I don't particularly care for Discord.

567
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:52,500
If I didn't know better, right, I probably wouldn't have re-enabled 2FA on anything,

568
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,140
because it was such a pain in the ass to get stuff back.

569
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,420
And I think about things like, my Discord is the perfect example.

570
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:05,620
I support a bunch of things that I follow, like Unfilter, even though Chris won't give

571
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,380
me any new episodes because he doesn't love me anymore.

572
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,260
I can't remember Shannon Morris's channel, a bunch of Magic the Gathering stuff that

573
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,380
you people never want to hear about because you don't love Magic the Gathering like I

574
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,380
do.

575
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,380
Of course.

576
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:23,620
But I have tons of content that I can only get in that Discord account, right, that I

577
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,620
like to watch.

578
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,620
Right, right.

579
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,620
Yeah.

580
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,620
So what would I have to do?

581
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
I thought about it.

582
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,620
So what if it fails?

583
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,340
Okay, well, I have to somehow get a hold of Shannon Morris, who probably has some pretty

584
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,780
aggressive filters, I would assume.

585
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,900
So actually getting in touch would be challenging.

586
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,780
I have to get all these random YouTubers who play Magic, again, who I have a feeling have

587
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:49,660
some pretty aggressive, you know, filters up, to individually respond to me, believe

588
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,820
me that I am one of the people paying their Patreon, and then somehow let me just give

589
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,140
them another Discord handle that they can give the access to.

590
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,540
There's an entire manual process that I would need about six people to do.

591
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,860
Many of them, I'm pretty sure, never read their DMs, nor should they.

592
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,340
So that would suck.

593
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,900
I imagine this is what life also feels like, say, your Google account gets turned off.

594
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,900
It's a very similar thing.

595
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,300
There's a gentleman we could ask about that from a month ago, right?

596
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,300
Yeah.

597
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,140
And I also use my Google account to authenticate to several services as well outside of that.

598
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,140
Well, I do too.

599
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,860
For all my work stuff, because I use G Suite, it's all Google.

600
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,940
Like I can't use my, if I lost my Google account, I could not use GitHub anymore.

601
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,620
Because I have the SSO thing.

602
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,720
So you know what saved my bacon in this situation, and I'm not necessarily saying you should

603
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,180
do it this way, but what saved my bacon was I use Authy, which syncs your two factors

604
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:50,740
across your different devices that you have Authy on, and I happen to have it installed

605
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,100
on an M1 Mac Mini desktop.

606
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,540
The M1 saves the day.

607
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,340
So I could do my two factor when I was sitting at that machine from the desktop, and so I

608
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:03,100
was able to pull it up on that device and then resync my new phone.

609
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,540
But it took me two days before I remembered that because I don't use that Mac Mini very

610
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,540
often.

611
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:16,580
So I was like for two days, genuinely depressed that I had f that up so badly and that I knew

612
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:22,020
what a, because everything has two factor and I mean, hundreds of different services

613
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,300
and sites I have just for JB alone, not to mention all my personal stuff.

614
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:30,180
Like I was mourning the loss of my two factor codes, and then I remembered it was on that

615
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,180
machine.

616
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,500
So having that sync, I don't think it makes it as secure and it makes Authy, you know.

617
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,940
It seems like Authy is the obvious attack factor then.

618
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,940
Yeah.

619
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,940
Right.

620
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,940
Is it syncing the actual generated codes or is it syncing the overwrite?

621
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,940
Yes.

622
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,940
Okay.

623
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,940
That's actually pretty good.

624
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,700
You know, don't do like I do, but that was that worked really well.

625
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,740
Bitwarden can also be a tool in this bitwarden.com slash Linux if you want to support our shows.

626
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,780
This is an awful experience and the other thing that's really challenging here is if

627
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,620
you're trying to go from iPhone to Android, some of the stuff doesn't move over either.

628
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,620
Yeah.

629
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,500
If you're with an all Apple solution, you'd be tied to Apple and they'd have a lock on

630
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
that.

631
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,860
So I just, but you wouldn't want Google to do it either.

632
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,900
I wouldn't want any of these major companies to do it.

633
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:15,780
Well, the problem is if, you know, security now, right, TNO, trust no one, but that includes

634
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,980
yourself.

635
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,720
So if you're doing a true trust no one security set up, it is totally possible to screw yourself

636
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
these.

637
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,260
I feel like our rough areas, technology needs to work out and as we have more and more digital

638
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,660
assets that we place value on, this just becomes a bigger and bigger problem.

639
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:39,520
Like your photos, you know, your email, cryptocurrency, pictures of like JPEG monkeys, I don't know,

640
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,420
like whatever people think is worth something, like you have this problem where if you want

641
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:49,700
to secure it and protect it, you also make it possible to lose it if you lose access

642
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,700
to it.

643
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,820
It's a genuine problem that humanity really hasn't fully sorted out.

644
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,780
We don't have photo albums like we used to just, you know, we don't have that anymore.

645
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,780
It's all on the computer.

646
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,780
It's all digital now.

647
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,340
Yeah, it's all digital now.

648
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,340
Figure it out.

649
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,820
For some reason I thought you ended up on an Android device during all this.

650
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,040
I briefly was using a pixel test device that I have.

651
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,260
What era of pixel?

652
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,100
Pixel 3, 4, no, pixel 4a.

653
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,100
Okay.

654
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Okay.

655
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,220
Yeah, I have a 3 and that's getting pretty long in the tooth.

656
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,220
It was pretty slow.

657
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,860
Like I tried, I bought a couple like games to try on it, just to see how it ran.

658
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,660
It was pretty, if I was to stick with Android, I might have to get a new one.

659
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,660
But you just got out of there.

660
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,140
You just were like, no way.

661
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:35,540
Well, so this is unrelated, but turns out all my contacts are in iCloud.

662
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,540
Oh yeah.

663
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,540
Yeah.

664
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,380
So like I had to ask my wife for her phone number.

665
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,100
Yeah, I would have to as well.

666
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,100
Yeah.

667
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,140
I was just thinking the other day I should memorize that.

668
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,140
Yeah.

669
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,500
I did a little bender on Android about a month ago.

670
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,380
I went with Graphene OS and my whole thing was not to use Google services.

671
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,900
So I had the same problem with contacts.

672
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,100
I'm like, what the hell do I do for my contacts in my calendar?

673
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,720
And I'm not saying this is what everybody could do, but I have the option and I did

674
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:07,640
this is I was able to put a little wedge in there basically that lets me send all that

675
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,340
to Nextcloud.

676
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,620
So I became my own contacts in calendar sync point.

677
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,240
And then I had that available in Nextcloud as well.

678
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,240
That was really nice.

679
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,820
I had to roll that whole solution myself, including unlock the phone, reflash it with

680
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,180
ADB, set up, you know, find this app.

681
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,040
Thanks to Jeff who gave me an idea where to find it, get this app so I could actually

682
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,020
sync to Nextcloud, get all that configured.

683
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,340
I already had Nextcloud set right.

684
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,540
Like it was just this massive amount of work.

685
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:37,000
If you were starting from square one, I was starting from like square three, but it was

686
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,300
possible on a modern ish Android device to have a clean Android install with no attachment

687
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,460
to Google and still have like cloud syncing stuff.

688
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,460
If you want to build it.

689
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,460
Yeah.

690
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,460
But do you want to build it?

691
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,300
I guess some people do.

692
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,100
It depends on how bad it gets, I suppose.

693
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Yeah.

694
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
All right.

695
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,100
We've been teasing it.

696
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,320
You got you got into like the Swift again, something you smell a little swifty.

697
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,820
Maybe that's the Swift UI that's extra ripe.

698
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,820
I'm not sure.

699
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,820
But I think you've been doing a deep dive.

700
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,780
Yeah, I I've been playing around with Swift again for a while.

701
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,780
It doesn't matter.

702
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
He's six.

703
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,780
He doesn't listen to the show.

704
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,660
I was giving my kid for Christmas a Pokemon, a digital Pokemon trading card binder in Swift.

705
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,460
Yeah, I might throw it on the app store because people always ask, do you have anything on

706
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,460
the app store?

707
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,420
But I figured if I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it right.

708
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:28,500
So it's using the latest, the greatest version of Swift, which I think is five point seven

709
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,860
because I didn't put that in my notes.

710
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,860
Pure Swift UI.

711
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:40,900
None of my safe space of, you know, interface builder or her good old UI view or any storyboards,

712
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
anything like that.

713
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:48,020
I'm doing I'm using the relatively new async await features in Swift.

714
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,460
And and this is what I think is the interesting part.

715
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:59,580
I'm actually doing de-serialization the Swift way, not the Objective C way, which is just

716
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,340
doing it by hand.

717
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,140
Where to begin?

718
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,060
Xcode always has the best error messages.

719
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:15,700
This is something other IDEs need to think about because at one point I opened Xcode.

720
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,180
It's like I can't open this project.

721
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,180
It's from the future.

722
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,260
Closed it, open it again.

723
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,260
It opened it.

724
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,260
Fine.

725
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
Incredible.

726
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,260
Good stuff.

727
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,260
Like Doctor Who.

728
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,260
I crossed my own timeline.

729
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
Amazing.

730
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,260
Yeah, nicely done.

731
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,860
It is far more stable than it used to be.

732
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,860
All right.

733
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,860
That's good.

734
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:38,540
Still, Swift UI, I don't know how much RAM you need, but it wants all of it, all the

735
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,100
RAM in terms of the preview view.

736
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,220
But it's still pretty nice.

737
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,220
Just kind of laggy, kind of slow, whatever.

738
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:53,180
My first takes working in it were, so Apple just sat back, watched like the whole Angular

739
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,300
React thing happen and was like, we're going to do this, but we're going to make it better

740
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,940
because we're Apple and we only care about one platform.

741
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,660
Cool.

742
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:09,500
This one class, async image, which you can put on any Swift UI major components like

743
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,420
a V stack or an H stack.

744
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,380
Those are a vertical stack and horizontal stack, respectively.

745
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,060
I had to write a whole library to do this in old iOS.

746
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,940
And the this is, you have a view.

747
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,100
You have a URL to an image.

748
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,460
You want that image to load asynchronously and show a progress bar and not block the

749
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,460
UI.

750
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:34,900
It is one line of code in Swift UI and the performance is really good.

751
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,900
That sounds nice.

752
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,900
It is super nice.

753
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,380
I mean, I'm super jelly of the new iOS developers because this is easy mode.

754
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:49,500
Async and Swift, it's like they took async in Python, but married it to the bitchiness

755
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
of Rust.

756
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Okay.

757
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,420
We've got a lot of try catching going on.

758
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,620
I mean, it demands.

759
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,460
So this is something I guess I had forgotten about Swift.

760
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:05,140
Unless you slap those exclamation points everywhere, which is the rough equivalent to slapping

761
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,860
unsafe everywhere in Rust.

762
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,900
It makes you catch everything.

763
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,060
But you know, and by the way, this is coming to C sharp as the default now and the dot

764
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,060
net.

765
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,180
I think it just came in six and seven comes out soon, too.

766
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,180
So enjoy.

767
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,980
You could have question marks everywhere and exclamation points.

768
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,980
Beautiful.

769
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,940
I actually think it is beautiful because I'm catching stuff at compile time that basically

770
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,140
once I get the damn view to be buildable, it pretty much works.

771
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,140
Yeah, fair enough.

772
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,140
Might as well catch it then.

773
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,140
Yeah.

774
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,820
So far, device scaling Swift UI, I think does a fair job of being device agnostic with the

775
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,300
big caveat of I have not yet decided to try it out on landscape.

776
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,460
Things that I don't like.

777
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,740
I get it.

778
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,300
And I have this problem with Rust, too.

779
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,540
I get that you want to be absolutely correct.

780
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:00,580
But you know, sometimes it's weird, like the Xcode makes you feel just like Rust does.

781
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:07,100
It makes you feel dirty when you're like overriding its warnings or it's, you know, checking stuff.

782
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:11,860
A lot of it's just feels unnecessary.

783
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:17,340
I know I've read the forums, I've read the subreddit, I may have posted on Reddit and

784
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,820
gotten yelled at by the Swift people that, you know, things should be safe, you need

785
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,380
to know the types, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

786
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,380
Fair enough.

787
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,180
I've been doing too much Python.

788
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:34,940
It is very clear to me, and I'm not sure that maybe this isn't bad, but that Apple is going

789
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,500
to shove Swift UI down your throat.

790
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:44,220
So if you're clinging to, you know, storyboards or it's probably only storyboards at this

791
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,420
point, right, unless you're doing, I guess you could do individual nibs, but I think

792
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,660
you need to change.

793
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:55,620
I wrote a couple, about a year and a half ago, a blog post on bringing over zibs, which

794
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:02,140
they're called nibs, by the way, from UI kit into Swift UI.

795
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,340
I almost think that's basically misguided now.

796
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:13,260
And it's in this weird transitional state of so far, if you stick to just the, it's

797
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:18,420
not, it's unfair to credit slash blame him, but like the Marco Arment style of app development

798
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,020
where you're basically just using Apple's components with very little styling, then

799
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,100
Swift UI is super fast, super efficient.

800
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:31,300
The minute you want to go a little custom, things get rougher and it's tempting to drop

801
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:37,660
to UI view, because you can wrap it in a Swift UI component, but I, having tried it both

802
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:46,100
ways, I almost think it's one, a matter of time before Apple just, you know, makes it

803
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,100
more robust, right?

804
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,380
You get more robust controls out of the box.

805
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,380
You would hope so.

806
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,980
Well, from when I tried it last time to where it is now, they have, right?

807
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,260
They totally have, you know, WWDCs in June.

808
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,260
Yeah.

809
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,780
If they're trending in the right direction, that's a good sign.

810
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,780
Yeah.

811
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:09,060
But the point being, I think it's almost misguided to not just embrace the glory that is Swift

812
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,060
UI.

813
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,900
And I know I like T-Swift.

814
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,900
This is really good.

815
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:19,260
I mean, working on this Pokemon project, I'm like super missing iOS dev.

816
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:25,660
And I do some for clients, the, we have an app from 2010 that is written in no memory

817
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,860
managed objective C, but that's more archeology at this point.

818
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,460
It's not like new dev.

819
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,700
This is like fun to work in.

820
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:39,820
In particular, you can monitor your app's health and tail scale.

821
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,140
Tailscale.com slash coder.

822
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,900
That's where you go to try it for free for up to 20 devices and experience the best mesh

823
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,620
VPN you've ever, ever tried to set up.

824
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:53,460
You get it going in like, probably two minutes on a device.

825
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,840
If not that I, I'm not even kidding you.

826
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,700
It takes me 30 seconds to get a system on my tail scale VPN mesh network, and it's all

827
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,740
protected by wire guards, noise protocol, the encryption is solid.

828
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:09,700
And the other thing is the performance is incredible and the system is smart enough

829
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,460
to know if you're trying to communicate with your tail scale network, or if you're trying

830
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,220
to communicate with a general internet or something on your land, it's also smart enough

831
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,180
to figure out that if you're talking to another tail scale device on your land, it'll just

832
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,180
stay on the land.

833
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,220
It doesn't rat out to the internet and come back in.

834
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:29,060
We had huge storms here in the Pacific Northwest this last weekend, 70 mile per hour winds.

835
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,320
Power got knocked out at the studio.

836
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,740
And one of the things that I love is in the tail scale dashboard, I can see the last time

837
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,580
a node was online.

838
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,560
So I knew exactly when the power went out at the studio.

839
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,060
So I knew how long things were down.

840
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,060
I set up a ping.

841
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,360
I just started pinging the tail scale IP of one of the devices here.

842
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,580
And sure enough, it came back online when the power came up and I knew to come down

843
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,740
and fix everything because it was a bad one.

844
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,980
I just love that flexibility tail scale gives me to just, you know, I can use it in so many

845
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:00,620
different ways, but the thing that really became handy was, this is my bad, but more

846
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:04,840
systems were using DHCP than probably should have.

847
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,460
So a bunch of my boxes got new IP addresses and like my node for Bitcoin and where I checked

848
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:16,020
the boost, but also some studio systems, but their tail scale IP stayed the same.

849
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,480
Same tail scale IP.

850
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,480
So I was like, oh yeah, wait a minute.

851
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,340
I can just connect to the tail scale IP and I'm fine.

852
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,060
It just was like, wow, this is even on my land.

853
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,360
This is just so freaking great.

854
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,260
And tail scale SIN is like airdrop for all my devices, including my Linux boxes and my

855
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,620
mobile devices.

856
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,440
And tail scale SSH is absolute fire.

857
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,940
You can log into your system using tail scale through SSH, it's absolute by you're going

858
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,940
to love it.

859
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,300
There's so many great things.

860
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,120
And they've recently made DNS even better than ever on the tail scale network.

861
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,560
So go try it for yourself for free for up to 20 machines and support the show by going

862
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,160
to tailscale.com slash coder.

863
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,940
I think this is going to blow you away.

864
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,180
You're going to wonder why you hadn't tried it sooner.

865
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,660
tailscale.com slash coder.

866
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,660
Now that's not all.

867
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:09,100
I know you had a continuing journey and have discovered strong opinions, some pushback

868
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,900
and perhaps even a few demons.

869
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,900
Yeah.

870
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,660
So this, this is actually really cool.

871
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:19,740
So I said I did the JSON deserialization for my Pokemon card structs the way that Swift

872
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:25,340
wants you to not the old Objective C way of like just passing in an NS dictionary and,

873
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:28,140
you know, manually parsing the keys, right?

874
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,420
And yes, kids, that is how we used to do an Objective C. Yes, I know it's bad.

875
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:36,340
You guys have no freaking idea how easy you have it.

876
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,500
So I don't want to hear about it.

877
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,500
Go to your room.

878
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,500
Okay.

879
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,500
Is he in his room?

880
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,500
Good.

881
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,660
We're going to call him just some like 13 year old developer and just yell at him.

882
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,660
That's what we do on the show now.

883
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,620
We're going to call him Tim and we're just going to yell at him all day long.

884
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,620
Dang it, Tim.

885
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,180
You are disappointing us.

886
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,820
Tim, what, what do you mean Java?

887
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,820
Java has functions.

888
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,820
That doesn't have functions.

889
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:56,820
Everything's like objects.

890
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,820
Java one.

891
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,880
That's all you get.

892
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,100
How do you not know who Duke is?

893
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,660
Go read Wikipedia.

894
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,660
Go to your room.

895
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,260
Then the problem is me and Chris go to the bar and we get Ubered home because we're crying

896
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,740
about somebody named Scott McNeely and son and the 20 year old bartender has no idea

897
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,660
what's wrong with these two old dudes, but she wants them away.

898
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,460
At poor little Tim, he's just looking at his Coda radio dads and he's just wondering why

899
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,700
do they always cry when son comes up?

900
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,260
I don't understand what's wrong about the son.

901
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:29,820
Every day at sunset, we just sit on the, on the veranda drinks in hand, tears streaming,

902
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,820
openly weeping.

903
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,900
I mean, it's really terrible.

904
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,340
But things that make us happy.

905
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:39,780
The codable protocol and Swift, first of all, if you're going to name protocols, I love

906
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,780
this thing.

907
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,780
Yeah.

908
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,820
In fact, Swift, you guys get a robe.

909
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,820
This is robe worthy.

910
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,820
Yeah.

911
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,820
This is better than coderly.

912
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,820
Ooh, painful.

913
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:48,820
We got to do that.

914
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,820
It's codable.

915
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,820
I know.

916
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:51,820
I know.

917
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,820
I know.

918
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,580
So I linked the documentation.

919
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:01,700
It's so baller that it's really a type alias for two protocols, not one decodable, which

920
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:07,340
does exactly what it sounds like to codes, a Jason object into your class, an instance

921
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:13,300
of your class, or I'm sorry, struct encodable, which does the opposite encode your, you know,

922
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:22,580
your data type into Jason and now it has some opinions on how the Jason should look, but,

923
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,220
and this is what saved my butt.

924
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:30,900
It is possible to do custom decoding and still keep all the other benefits.

925
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,980
So if you have one, let's say easy example, you have like one type that's like a weird

926
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,980
type of Jason.

927
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:41,260
It's some kind of weird like string that they encoded instead of using a real data type.

928
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:45,660
You can just have like a custom function that decodes that as long as it decodes back to

929
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,020
one of the basic Swift types.

930
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,020
Hmm.

931
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,020
That's handy.

932
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,020
Right.

933
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:55,020
But if it is a, if it's an easy map, so like a Jason array to a Swift array, it just does

934
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,020
it.

935
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,400
You just tell it it's an array and it does it.

936
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,540
So you don't have to follow its specific output that it requires.

937
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,380
You can, there's room for fudging it.

938
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:07,820
It expects camel casing, but if you don't have camel casing, you can tell it that it's,

939
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,500
it actually has built in enums for like other crazy casing, like snake casing.

940
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,500
Well, good.

941
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,780
I'm glad you're not compromising on this.

942
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,860
Well, no, I like my snake casing.

943
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,860
Okay, good.

944
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,940
I'm glad it accommodates you.

945
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,340
What's wrong with snake casing?

946
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,340
Nothing.

947
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,340
Nothing.

948
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,340
Hmm.

949
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,340
Sensing a disturbance.

950
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,500
I just, what I find quite humorous is you going out of your way to just not have to

951
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,500
change.

952
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:34,220
Like I would just be like, okay, machine, all right, I'll do it your way.

953
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,220
You're like, no, let's see if there's a.

954
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,740
It's not my API though.

955
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,740
I don't control the JSON.

956
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,740
Oh, that's fair.

957
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,740
Yeah, fair.

958
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:40,740
Right.

959
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,740
You're not, yeah, you're not necessarily controlling the input.

960
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:42,740
Yeah.

961
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,740
I suppose that's fair.

962
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,820
To be fair, the API I'm using is camel cased and I did have it hit one of mine that's snake

963
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,980
cased and you know what snake casing is the right casing.

964
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,740
Although my Swift code, I am, I am being a proper Swift developer and doing it camel

965
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,740
case.

966
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,740
So there you go.

967
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,380
I hear it tastes like chicken.

968
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,620
It tastes like a, it does taste like chicken as a bird.

969
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:05,940
I thought for, I think chicken, I think like Raptors great grandson now and I'm very scared.

970
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:06,940
I had hot wings.

971
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,660
I'm like when the dinosaurs come back, they're going to be so pissed at me.

972
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,520
You could just look at them and kind of see it, right?

973
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,800
You can just see it.

974
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,380
It's surprisingly fast.

975
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:20,860
It can even handle cases where you can do the question mark thing and say it's an optional.

976
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,220
And if it's not there, it just accepts it.

977
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:30,980
You can nest different codable or decodable types within a kind of a overarching type.

978
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,220
So for instance, I have a card result type, which in it has a card and in that has the

979
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,660
card has a set so it can decode the set.

980
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,300
And within that you have like all kinds of crap, right?

981
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,940
Like Pokemon attacks, blah, blah, blah.

982
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,060
Now I know the.net developers are like, we have this too.

983
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,060
You do.

984
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:54,340
It does it a lot better because I think what they did is just rob your ass.

985
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:59,420
I'm feeling a lot of the Swift stuff is just ripping off good ideas from other places.

986
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,140
It's like we have the strictness of RASP.

987
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,340
You can throw an exclamation point in there if you don't want to listen.

988
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,100
And here's all the.net MVVM kind of stuff.

989
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:15,060
But we're going to make it a lot simpler and a little, you know, more I want to say forgiving.

990
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:21,740
I wouldn't say that, but more almost like you can Voltron up your own.

991
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:27,460
You can more easily than I found in.net Voltron up your own custom.

992
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,980
Whatever data structure you need, right?

993
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:31,900
It seems like a good strategy on their part that actually does.

994
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,900
Why not look?

995
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,580
Why not see what others are doing like.net in this case?

996
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,580
For sure.

997
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,580
Yeah, good strategy.

998
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:44,460
Yeah, I would say the closest analogy is probably like a couple of who I think is a Klingon.

999
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,560
Swift does something similar, which I think is ironic.

1000
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,220
Also Microsoft who ripped off C Sharp their own thing.

1001
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:53,540
So I feel like C Sharp being early with the stuff kind of.

1002
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,060
You know, it's got some baggage.

1003
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,240
So I'm going to go on a limb here.

1004
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,240
Swift is enjoyable.

1005
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,180
Just think if I had a time machine right now.

1006
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,180
Don't worry, Alex.

1007
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,180
Alex will find it.

1008
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,220
I have perfect faith in him.

1009
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,340
I think he's kind of been.

1010
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,460
He's kind of moved past it by now.

1011
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,460
He's like a 200 now.

1012
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,460
Yeah, he's in the.

1013
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,460
I can't believe he's I can't believe you.

1014
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,300
It was 2016, I know it was one ninety something.

1015
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,300
OK, OK.

1016
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:22,180
It was such a wild episode for me on my end where you rage quit in the middle of the show

1017
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:27,660
because so short version is we were doing the Apple event live and now it's Swift and

1018
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,940
then we go to record the show to get the reaction and Mike's reaction is just rage on bridled

1019
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,940
rage.

1020
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,100
And then he leaves the show and I'm like, all right, well, thanks for coming, everybody.

1021
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,700
It's like a twenty five minute show.

1022
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,460
Yet one of our most listened to shows.

1023
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:44,340
I just I'm pretty sure I keep people keep sending me stuff about it.

1024
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:47,300
I feel like.

1025
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,300
Swift has made a big journey since that episode.

1026
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,220
Oh, it's a I would argue it's a completely different language to like even from where

1027
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,380
Swift one point started to Swift five point seven.

1028
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,380
I'd say it's more like rust than anything else.

1029
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,980
I think it's been trending this way because it seems like each time we check in, you're

1030
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,180
like, OK, this is getting better.

1031
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,180
I like this.

1032
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,060
This is getting a little you know, I like where they're going here.

1033
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:12,300
So it sounds like this is it's really starting to come together for you.

1034
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,300
Codable protocol.

1035
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,300
I like it.

1036
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:20,560
I mean, I kind of wish Apple wasn't so vampiric with the App Store, but, you know, I since

1037
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:25,980
I'm doing this Pokemon card thing anyway for the kid, I may as well throw it on there and

1038
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,100
charge ninety nine cents, which guarantees I will get one download or you can make it

1039
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:34,460
free and do a nine dollar in app purchase for something really basic.

1040
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,980
You know, and then Apple will spotlight it because it's free.

1041
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:44,660
Just not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

1042
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,860
We got a ton of great support for last week's episode.

1043
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,860
Thank you, everybody.

1044
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:54,260
Zurno boosted in with twenty nine thousand nine hundred sats.

1045
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,420
Keep the change, you filthy animal.

1046
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:00,740
It was spread across a couple of boosts because he was bailing out of Breeze.

1047
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:04,060
I've also sort of stopped using Breeze myself.

1048
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,320
Fountain has done recent updates and they've added CarPlay support and they just did an

1049
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,860
update yesterday to fix a couple of stability issues.

1050
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:13,940
I got to say, I'm still I'm really liking Fountain Podverse.

1051
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:19,260
But Zurno says, OK, Mike, every time you say GitHub Copilot produces terrible code, I wonder

1052
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,980
I've heard on other podcasts that it seems to produce code based on the user's previous

1053
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,980
work.

1054
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,760
Does this mean your repository is filled with bad code?

1055
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,180
That's not quite how it works, right?

1056
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,780
It doesn't just go on your code alone.

1057
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,020
No, it doesn't.

1058
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,460
And I would even challenge firms.

1059
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,340
I don't say it only produces terrible code.

1060
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:40,620
I would say that when it produces bad code, it's really funny, but it it doesn't produce

1061
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,620
bad code.

1062
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,620
Right.

1063
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:49,860
Like if you're for example, if you're just doing a jQuery form or a Python WTF form,

1064
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,300
it will do that and it will be fine.

1065
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,300
Right.

1066
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,900
It'll do it in context and it it'll scan.

1067
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,780
I think it scans a collection per language.

1068
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,340
I think it's actually per platform, too.

1069
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:08,380
It can tell like if you're doing flask or fast API, for example, or rails, it will produce

1070
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:11,340
code for, I don't know, most common cases.

1071
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:16,660
I don't think it's all terrible, but how valuable is someone generating a form for me that I've

1072
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,420
written 400 times?

1073
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,420
GitHub says on their site, languages with less representation in public repositories

1074
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:26,760
may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

1075
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:32,180
But they say, for example, JavaScript is well represented in public repositories and is

1076
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:36,620
one of GitHub Copilot's best supported languages because there's so many examples of it.

1077
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,400
So you can kind of imagine how that would probably work.

1078
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,780
The more there is of something, the more source it has.

1079
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:44,780
Also on the topic of Copilot, a lawsuit has been filed.

1080
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,780
Oh, Lord.

1081
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,460
It's basically along the lines of what we've talked about, a class action lawsuit in a

1082
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,680
U.S. federal court in San Francisco.

1083
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,260
You know the details and we'll follow it.

1084
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:56,180
We'll follow it quietly and we'll update everybody if there's anything worth really discussing

1085
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,180
there.

1086
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,500
But I think it's interesting that that process has now kicked off.

1087
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,660
It's probably wasn't and we probably should have, we probably could have had a bet on when

1088
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,660
it would happen, not if.

1089
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,060
Yeah, I have a little fascinating thought.

1090
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,500
I mean, I still hold what I said a couple of weeks ago.

1091
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:15,580
It would be a shame if legal chicanery got rid of Copilot.

1092
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,340
Maybe not get, you know, the idea of a Copilot like tool, right?

1093
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:23,500
It's funny because from the first, from Zerno's message, I would actually prefer to be able

1094
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,220
to tell Copilot only to look at my repositories because then I could actually use it on client

1095
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,220
work.

1096
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:32,100
I think you can with like the private version for Visual Studio, but I'm not sure.

1097
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,180
Isn't there some way to do that privately?

1098
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,180
There is some way.

1099
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,180
Maybe there is.

1100
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,860
I just turn it off when I'm not working on my own thing, so.

1101
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:43,620
I would, you know, if I was going to be selfish, if I knew I could go use Copilot and it would

1102
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:48,620
be a pretty good aid and if there was a way I could somehow trust its results, maybe I

1103
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,700
could just do that through peer review.

1104
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:55,860
I'd probably be more inclined to write my own stuff and do my own like little side projects

1105
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,860
if I knew it was actually going to be a good guide.

1106
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:04,780
If you're writing like a very mainstream, you know, node with an Angular front end or

1107
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:11,160
node with a React front end, there's just a ton of examples that Copilot can pull from.

1108
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,540
It's when you get more domain specific, you're going to, yeah.

1109
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,540
Which I probably would.

1110
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,540
Yeah.

1111
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,540
Yeah.

1112
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:23,620
All right, Nomadic Coder 5 boosted with 5,555 SATs.

1113
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:28,060
I recently started using my iPod Touch just to listen to podcasts and music, but with

1114
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,660
Apple's latest money grab, I'll have to switch to Fountain on my Calix OS phone in case Apple

1115
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,700
starts taxing boosts.

1116
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,160
With every announcement Apple does, something that drives me further and further away seems

1117
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,380
like it drives me further and further away from them.

1118
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,380
I agree.

1119
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:46,260
Yeah, they are going after like in-app advertising, although with like Fountain you don't buy

1120
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:49,940
the SATs, so there's no transaction happening, thankfully.

1121
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:50,940
That's why.

1122
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,940
They know.

1123
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:56,620
I've talked to the folks behind both Fountain and Podverse and they're very much aware of

1124
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,860
Apple's shenanigans.

1125
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,900
They're very careful.

1126
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,340
They try not to even play in the gray zone.

1127
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,340
They go by the letter of the law.

1128
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:07,740
No, I got to say, like if you're doing an iOS app, I've learned this for many years

1129
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:11,500
of complaining about it on this show, don't even go in.

1130
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,740
It's like the neutral zone with the Romulans.

1131
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,780
Don't just stay the hell out.

1132
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,420
Don't go there.

1133
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,420
I agree.

1134
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,420
I agree.

1135
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:23,260
Sam Squatch comes in with 16,180 SATs.

1136
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,100
Hey, rich lobster.

1137
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,860
Oh, shit.

1138
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,460
I'm buying a car suite.

1139
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,460
I know.

1140
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,220
Like I said, we've got some great support this week.

1141
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:37,560
They say, so I absolutely think Twitter is likely pretty bloated, but the metric of code

1142
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,140
is a bit of an odd choice to go by.

1143
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,140
I agree.

1144
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,380
People have been tossing around how much code.

1145
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,380
Bad management.

1146
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,380
Yeah.

1147
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,900
My experience as my career has gone on and I've gone through to become a principal engineer

1148
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,260
and now a manager, I write less and less code.

1149
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:56,340
I spend more time reviewing other people's code, catching bad decisions, overseeing early

1150
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,900
design plans, et cetera.

1151
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,860
Effectively, I try to be a force multiplier.

1152
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,500
Does that mean by Elon's metric, I'm a bad engineer?

1153
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:08,420
No, I mean, I don't know if we have any data to suggest that.

1154
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,860
I did see an article that said they actually are trying to reach back out to some of the

1155
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,220
people that have been fired so far and rehire them.

1156
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,220
Jackass.

1157
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,220
That's embarrassing.

1158
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:21,460
That is, that's just, I tell you what, I don't know.

1159
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,140
It's going to be wild to watch that.

1160
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:27,580
I think his best shot, just to touch on it one last time, is to make his changes and

1161
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,620
get the hell out of there and hand it off.

1162
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,620
Yeah.

1163
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:35,940
I don't think you should take Elon super seriously when he talks about the management stuff or

1164
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:40,680
basically anything else because I'm pretty sure he's playing a caricature of himself

1165
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,820
at this point, right?

1166
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:49,100
It's like when I go and decide I'm going to complain and make fun of the PHP people.

1167
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,580
I don't actually hate PHP people.

1168
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:53,460
I don't even think PHP is that bad of a language.

1169
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,540
It's just an act, right?

1170
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:59,940
And to his detriment at this point, I would say, he's playing a caricature.

1171
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:04,860
There's no way he is sitting there reading printouts of thousands of lines of code.

1172
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,700
No, they didn't even do that eventually.

1173
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,780
There's been some bogus reporting, but...

1174
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,340
Yeah, it's just bull.

1175
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,340
Yeah.

1176
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,500
Anyway, moving on.

1177
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,580
I think he is moving quick and ruthlessly because he just spent $44 billion on something

1178
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,220
that's probably worth a billion dollars.

1179
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,860
Well, maybe more, but anyways.

1180
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,860
Okay.

1181
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:25,180
Noob Steve Boostin with 48,600 sats.

1182
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,460
I hoard that with your kind covet.

1183
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,140
Now he's listening to episode 483.

1184
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:35,780
I think he's responding to something he said in episode 481 about subscriptions in Adobe

1185
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,340
Cloud, which kicked off a series of discussions.

1186
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,340
He said, sorry, guys.

1187
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:44,220
I didn't really mean to kick off an S-storm, as he puts it.

1188
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,200
I promise I'll never mention those who shall not be named again.

1189
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,900
Please accept my humble boost as a formal apology.

1190
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,900
Also, congrats, Mike.

1191
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,380
Sorry, you're having to deal with green bubbles right now.

1192
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,100
I lasted less than a day, don't worry.

1193
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,540
That's amazing.

1194
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,420
That is amazing.

1195
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,820
Who was the not to be named?

1196
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:05,780
I believe it was Adobe and Creative Cloud that kicked off.

1197
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:06,780
Oh, yeah.

1198
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:10,020
Noob, you can correct me, but that's what I recall.

1199
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:14,020
So Ham boosted in with a row of ducks, 2222 sats.

1200
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,660
This old duck still got it.

1201
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:16,660
All right.

1202
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,660
Brace yourself for this one.

1203
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:22,380
Capitalism requires the funny green line profit to always go up.

1204
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:26,700
The catch, the earth and humanity is a finite resource.

1205
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,020
Infinite growth is simply not possible.

1206
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,900
Apple really has no choice other than to become a bully.

1207
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,840
Can you really blame them?

1208
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,940
This is I agree to a sense here.

1209
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,140
It's like if we are serious about wanting to protect the environment, then we can't

1210
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,180
have unlimited everything.

1211
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:47,300
We have to be real about some of these limited resources like, honestly, lithium.

1212
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,260
There's a new OPEC being organized around lithium now, which is just going to recreate

1213
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,740
the same problem we have with oil.

1214
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:56,540
And the number one producer of lithium is China.

1215
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,780
And I hate to think what the labor standards are.

1216
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,980
It really is quite a conundrum.

1217
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:06,860
I don't know because I think capitalism is really just human nature.

1218
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,860
It's trading and creating value for things.

1219
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:15,220
I think that's human nature where obviously as it gets at a certain scale and certain

1220
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:18,960
amount of control and influence, it tries to get perverted and now it's become something

1221
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,220
that seems very sick.

1222
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:27,060
But I don't know if you can take trading and selling out of humanity.

1223
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:30,660
So we just have to, I guess, have a way to do it sustainably.

1224
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:31,860
Let us know if you've got an idea for that.

1225
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:32,860
Also, shout outs for Boost CLI.

1226
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:33,860
Whoa.

1227
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:34,860
Yes.

1228
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,740
You know what you get?

1229
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,100
That's just for you, Soham, for using Boost CLI.

1230
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,100
All right.

1231
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:45,260
Trevdev boosted in with some leet sats saying, inflating your downloads, we're talking about

1232
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:49,500
people that have been buying downloads, is a whole industry in third world countries,

1233
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,500
he writes.

1234
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,780
It boosts your placement on the top podcast list in the Apple Podcast Index.

1235
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:59,940
That artificial inflation of your popularity gets you a real audience.

1236
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,160
That's a good point.

1237
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,160
That is true.

1238
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,780
That actually does make the transaction worth it.

1239
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,140
As an example, when we get big baller boosts into the show, we go to the top of the Fountain

1240
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,140
FM list.

1241
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:15,380
Koda Radio is like in sometimes the top four podcasts when people give us big boosts.

1242
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,060
And that's a serious signal.

1243
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,240
People are spending real sats.

1244
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:22,340
That's a real signal of quality and we've been picking up new audiences as a result

1245
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,340
of that.

1246
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:24,340
LUP too.

1247
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,420
LUP's been benefiting from that as well.

1248
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:31,140
Pegdot boosts in with some enterprise sats, 1701.

1249
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,700
Make it so.

1250
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,700
This is our last one.

1251
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,140
Hello, Star Trek Radio Show.

1252
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:39,060
A few weeks ago, I asked which series to get started with, with Star Trek.

1253
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,060
We remember.

1254
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,380
Both of you recommended The Next Generation.

1255
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:47,340
I started yesterday with Encounter at Farpoint, which is episode one and two, and I'm continuing

1256
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:51,180
today with episode three, the one where everyone gets drunk and horny.

1257
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:54,180
Really enjoying it so far.

1258
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,180
Thanks for the recommendation.

1259
01:03:55,180 --> 01:04:01,220
P.S. I tried the Lord of the Rings series yesterday too, but I like Star Trek better.

1260
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,220
That's great.

1261
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:07,340
I thought TNG was a little risky just because that first season, first two seasons, they

1262
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:10,900
have some gems, but they also have some rough spots.

1263
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,340
But if you're enjoying the drunk episode, I think you're going to be all right.

1264
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:18,620
Yeah, I was in the drunk episode is one of the worst episodes in that season.

1265
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:25,020
So yeah, there's also that one where the king of a planet like captures Tasha to make

1266
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:29,580
her his love slave, and then they have to fight his current love slave.

1267
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:33,740
You have to have the original series sexism reboot, right?

1268
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,740
Well, it's funny you say that, man, because that's the drunk episode.

1269
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:41,740
That episode, a lot of the season one and two episodes were old scripts from the 60s.

1270
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:42,740
Yep.

1271
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:46,860
And they just kind of put the 80s lipstick on them, right?

1272
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:47,860
Exactly.

1273
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,820
80s hair and lipstick.

1274
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:54,180
Season three, The Next Generation kind of gets its own identity, although if you want

1275
01:04:54,180 --> 01:05:01,180
the one true Trek, and I will stand by this, I'm rewatching Strange New Worlds.

1276
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:02,660
I just love it.

1277
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,580
It's funny you say that.

1278
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:10,900
I was reading this boost with Wes yesterday, and he and I were talking about how TNG was

1279
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:11,900
kind of a risk.

1280
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:16,100
And I said, I think the other way to go now would be Strange New Worlds because it's good

1281
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,860
Trek with modern production values.

1282
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,820
I think it's a good introduction possibly.

1283
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:26,620
So, if you can enjoy TNG, it gets so rich because then you can move into DS9 and Voyager

1284
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:29,660
and then Enterprise and just work your way up.

1285
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:33,220
And that is quite literally years of TV watching.

1286
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,300
I started doing that with my wife when we were dating.

1287
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,580
And we're now on season two of Enterprise.

1288
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:44,700
And so we started with TNG, and we've been married for like six, I don't know, I don't

1289
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,700
know how long.

1290
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,140
We've been married a couple of years, but we've been dating for a while, it's been years.

1291
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,100
And we're just now in Enterprise.

1292
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,620
And so it's literally years of great television.

1293
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:56,820
And you can store it locally and there's no ads and it's just, if you get into it, it's

1294
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:57,820
pretty great.

1295
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:58,820
All right, enough.

1296
01:05:58,820 --> 01:05:59,820
Enough.

1297
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:00,820
Big shout out too.

1298
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:01,820
I really want to say thank you to those that boosted in.

1299
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:05,380
Some just send in some sats without saying anything, few send in some notes.

1300
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:07,940
We don't put them all in the show if you can believe it.

1301
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:15,340
But we did get 109,999 sats from WM, who went on a little bit of a boosting spree for our

1302
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,780
shows and Coda Radio was a big beneficiary there.

1303
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:23,900
We got 100 sats from jmac217, who says no one in his real life circle is using Twitter

1304
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,780
in central Illinois.

1305
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:29,220
Twitter is just not a thing in his neck of the woods, he says, in the real world.

1306
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:32,140
And we got 3,000 sats from Agania or Ahagania.

1307
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,620
Thank you guys very much or appreciate you very much.

1308
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:35,820
You're doing a good job.

1309
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:41,260
If you'd like to send a boost into the show, go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

1310
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:45,880
There's a whole suite of options there from a whole new podcast app to just using tools.

1311
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:49,540
And if you're in the U.S. and you want to grab some cheap sats, the Strike app or the

1312
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,860
Cash app is fantastic outside the U.S.

1313
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:54,100
I like Blue Wallet a whole bunch.

1314
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:57,880
And of course, you can invest in the ongoing production, the real nuts and bolts of the

1315
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,500
show by becoming a member, codercua.co.

1316
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,500
I got an email, I got a nice note from one of our members, I think we both got it, from

1317
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:09,500
one of our members over the week who says, this would be my boost would be, but since

1318
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,300
I'm a member, I'm just going to send it to you directly.

1319
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,300
Totally fine.

1320
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,300
We love hearing from you.

1321
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:16,980
And as a thank you, you get an ad-free version of the show and a coderly report, which we're

1322
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:17,980
going to get together.

1323
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:18,980
We will.

1324
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:23,100
Oh, my gosh, you guys, you wouldn't believe how busy the world has been, but we'll get

1325
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:26,660
it together and send it out to our members as a thank you, codercua.co.

1326
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:30,620
I don't know, you feeling like you got anywhere you want to send the people this week, Mr.

1327
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:31,620
Dominic?

1328
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:34,220
You know, as always, I'm at Team Unuku on Twitter, but why don't you all sign up for

1329
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:35,580
the Matrix Room?

1330
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:39,420
I usually hang out in the Coder Radio general Matrix chat room.

1331
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:41,020
Yeah, we got two Coder chat rooms.

1332
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:44,740
There's like a feedback specific room and a general chat and we link to the general

1333
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,020
chat at coder.show slash matrix.

1334
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:50,580
That's a great call because that's also what we put up on our live stream.

1335
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:54,260
And so you can find out when we're live just by being in there or you can just review the

1336
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:57,500
chat if you're listening to an episode and you're curious to know what the chat room

1337
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,500
said.

1338
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,500
It's all there.

1339
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,620
And of course, yeah, both Mike and I are hanging out and they're pretty much every day from

1340
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:02,620
time to time.

1341
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,620
I'm popping in at least a few times a day.

1342
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,100
So join us over there.

1343
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:11,420
We got links to what we talked about today at coder.show slash 491.

1344
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,500
How about that?

1345
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,700
And you can actually watch how these shows get made over at Jupiter.tube.

1346
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,940
It's live 9 a.m. Monday, 12 p.m. Eastern.

1347
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:23,660
And then the archived version stays up there for playback because why not?

1348
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:24,660
It's our own YouTube.

1349
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:28,380
I can do whatever I want.

1350
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,020
Is that not a great laugh?

1351
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,180
I'll work on an evil laugh, though.

1352
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,500
I'll get that together for the next time I talk about it.

1353
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,820
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program, and we'll

1354
01:08:36,820 --> 01:09:03,900
see you right back here next week.
