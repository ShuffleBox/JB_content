My name is Chris and joining us with his podcast pants on and hopefully feeling a bit better,

00:51.040 --> 00:52.800
it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:52.800 --> 00:53.800
Hello Mike.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.800
Hello Mr. Fisher.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.400
Yes, I'm feeling tons better.

00:56.400 --> 01:00.480
Oh, you must have done like the regime or something that you're like, you sound totally

01:00.480 --> 01:01.480
normal again.

01:01.480 --> 01:07.840
I have a whole hippie approved regime of echinacea, vitamin C, vitamin D, make your jokes in the

01:07.840 --> 01:09.360
comments.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.920
And what's the other one I take?

01:10.920 --> 01:11.920
Elderberry?

01:11.920 --> 01:12.920
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.240
You got to get the elderberry.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.480
But I actually take it as a fluid, like just liquefied and that tastes like butts.

01:18.480 --> 01:22.880
Right, you just got to what you got to do is chase it with a little gin or vodka, you

01:22.880 --> 01:23.880
know?

01:23.880 --> 01:24.880
No, you can't.

01:24.880 --> 01:30.360
Or because I negates the whole point is clean, eaten and good sleep is a big part of it,

01:30.360 --> 01:31.360
too.

01:31.360 --> 01:32.360
That's it.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.360
So I know that like some sort of like weird fever state, you ended up installing Windows

01:35.360 --> 01:36.360
11 and gave it a go.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.360
I mean, we shocked and appalled, but I'm here to support you.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.360
Shocked and appalled.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.360
Really?

01:41.360 --> 01:42.360
Yeah.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.360
So I do have a gaming laptop.

01:43.360 --> 01:44.360
It's a Lenovo Legion.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.360
It came at Windows 10.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.240
So I upped it to Windows 11.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.320
And I had some thoughts.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.880
So I blogged it up my takeaway from your blog post, which will have a link to in the notes

01:51.880 --> 01:56.640
was overall mostly positive, but there's still an element to the Windows experience that

01:56.640 --> 01:57.640
I find very grating.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.680
And you honed in on it.

01:58.680 --> 02:05.200
You said the constant boardwalk pitches of like antivirus and aftermarket OEM services,

02:05.200 --> 02:07.020
it just makes the desktop feel cheap.

02:07.020 --> 02:10.800
You get hammered by all these OEM messages.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.840
And like when you come from Mac OS or Linux, that's a huge difference on Windows.

02:14.840 --> 02:19.120
And it just you know what, when you wrote that, Mike, you know what I pictured is like,

02:19.120 --> 02:24.120
have you ever been walking down Vegas and had all of the guys like slapping the pamphlets

02:24.120 --> 02:27.880
for lady dancers and stuff like that, just shoving pamphlets in your face?

02:27.880 --> 02:30.980
Many many times and I was very young, I was like 12.

02:30.980 --> 02:35.880
One of my first times in Vegas, I was walking down the strip and there were so many pamphlets

02:35.880 --> 02:39.640
all over the place because these guys are shoving in people's faces and you know, naked

02:39.640 --> 02:43.720
half naked women are on them that a little seven year old child that we were walking

02:43.720 --> 02:49.080
in our group with slipped and fell on the curb on one of these pamphlets and he landed

02:49.080 --> 02:55.520
in a pile of half naked ladies, essentially, because they were pushing this stuff so hard.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.680
And that's what Windows kind of feels like, but without the naked ladies.

02:58.680 --> 03:03.520
Yeah, I mean, so, you know, I posted to Reddit got some feedback, mostly positive, a couple

03:03.520 --> 03:05.480
people did point out, you know, you can uninstall of that.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.980
And of course, I'm aware that you can uninstall programs on Windows, right?

03:08.980 --> 03:14.400
My point being, you get the box and you spend like, if you want to get rid of all this crap,

03:14.400 --> 03:17.880
you have to do this whole process of well, getting rid of all this crap.

03:17.880 --> 03:18.880
Yeah.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.560
So you're giving me a job to do on my high end, expensive gaming laptop.

03:22.560 --> 03:26.320
But I just want to assure folks, I am very aware of add remove programs.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.920
There you go.

03:27.920 --> 03:28.920
Yeah.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.180
But it sounds like you're able to get Python and fast API up in pretty much no time.

03:32.180 --> 03:35.400
So I did I did something different this time, because, you know, a couple of times a year,

03:35.400 --> 03:37.840
I like switch OS is for a little bit.

03:37.840 --> 03:41.520
I actually used PowerShell instead of WSL to do everything.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.520
Oh, really?

03:42.520 --> 03:47.200
So you're going like the native, completely native Windows route completely negative.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.160
There's one caveat to that, but I think we'll do the Python stuff first.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.160
It was pretty good.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.280
I started in PowerShell 5, which is the default install.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.440
And then, you know, in PowerShell, it's like, hey, dog, you can upgrade to PowerShell 7

03:57.440 --> 03:58.440
and you should.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.440
So I did.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.040
There was no material difference for me in what I was doing.

04:02.040 --> 04:07.760
But setting up Python, setting up a virtual environment for Python, pretty, pretty easy.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.440
Setting up Postgres, super easy.

04:09.440 --> 04:14.920
The only thing I didn't like is I kept forgetting to use the Windows terminal terminal instead

04:14.920 --> 04:15.920
of PowerShell.

04:15.920 --> 04:20.440
But once I had that set up, I think I put some images in the blog post like Windows

04:20.440 --> 04:24.160
terminal is get ready to throw your tomatoes.

04:24.160 --> 04:28.480
The best terminal I have used, granted, I use stock Mac OS terminal right now.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.720
So I don't believe you.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
I actually do believe you.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.200
I saw your screenshots in the article.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.240
It's a nice looking terminal.

04:33.240 --> 04:37.480
You got a background in there, branded the company stuff in the terminal like TMB stuff.

04:37.480 --> 04:40.360
That was pretty custom transparency.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.360
It was really nice.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.360
Yeah, that stuff is nice.

04:42.360 --> 04:46.320
You didn't have to use WSL for any of that, but it does sound like at one point you did

04:46.320 --> 04:49.160
kind of end up having to use WSL to get some work done.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.160
Yeah.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.960
So I was a little careful about this.

04:52.960 --> 04:59.720
It's possible to do Ruby development in a purely Windows environment.

04:59.720 --> 05:04.280
But it's not a good idea.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.480
It's kind of hard to set up.

05:05.480 --> 05:09.800
It really like Ruby was not meant with Windows in mind, right?

05:09.800 --> 05:13.200
So particularly when I say Ruby, I mean Rails.

05:13.200 --> 05:16.120
So I did just to see like how it would all run.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.000
I didn't end up installing WSL.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.120
I didn't put this in the post because I thought maybe it's a future post, but I did do the

05:22.120 --> 05:24.460
WSL to Ruby mine bridge stuff.

05:24.460 --> 05:26.880
It was a little finicky, but it worked.

05:26.880 --> 05:32.600
Having said that, if you just use Visual Studio from WSL with Ruby, it works exactly as you

05:32.600 --> 05:35.520
would expect on like pop or Ubuntu or whatever.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.160
I mean, it's fine.

05:37.160 --> 05:41.560
Like if I was going to run Windows as a daily driver, I would almost certainly be running

05:41.560 --> 05:45.960
Penguin, which is my WSL destroy of choice.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.080
And I should add that Penguin and maybe I should do a post on this.

05:48.080 --> 05:53.380
Penguin has quick starts for like Ruby and Node and Python and a bunch of other crap.

05:53.380 --> 05:57.240
You noted on something else in there that I feel like I used to struggle with with Google,

05:57.240 --> 05:58.920
but they have improved it greatly.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.960
And that is a big issue you encountered.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.520
Windows just simply does not understand that you can have multiple Microsoft accounts that

06:05.520 --> 06:07.680
do different things in different contexts.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.880
Yeah, it did not get that.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.820
Like I have the, you know, Michael at the Mad Botter account, which is where my Visual

06:14.820 --> 06:18.400
Studio and all my fun Microsoft dev licenses are.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.560
And like my personal email, which is my Xbox account.

06:22.560 --> 06:26.280
And the thing that made me go down this path was Age of Empires four.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.280
Oh, my God.

06:27.280 --> 06:32.680
I really, really wanted to play like I needed that Xbox app working at one point.

06:32.680 --> 06:36.360
And then I accidentally signed up for a second trial of Xbox Live or whatever they call it

06:36.360 --> 06:37.940
Game Pass.

06:37.940 --> 06:41.100
And I had to like cancel that and just get it to like, no, I understand that there's

06:41.100 --> 06:43.080
two different accounts on here.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.880
And that was just a bad process.

06:44.880 --> 06:51.080
I had to actually go into the browser to sign in and just convince it that like I am who

06:51.080 --> 06:52.720
I say I am.

06:52.720 --> 06:53.720
Download the game.

06:53.720 --> 06:58.360
I tried to sign up for the like xCloud streaming service that I guess is in beta, but they're

06:58.360 --> 07:03.960
not clear if once you sign up to xCloud streaming, if you can get access to the web based streaming

07:03.960 --> 07:04.960
version or not.

07:04.960 --> 07:10.520
So I wanted to do a little three way shootout between GeForce Now streaming, Stadia and

07:10.520 --> 07:12.320
the Microsoft xCloud thing.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.840
So I go over there and I sign up for the xCloud gaming service.

07:15.840 --> 07:20.360
And I tell you what, man, it is so obtuse and unclear.

07:20.360 --> 07:23.520
And it doesn't even, it wasn't even clear if I had to have an Xbox to use it, which

07:23.520 --> 07:24.940
I do not.

07:24.940 --> 07:28.760
And it seems the xCloud streaming in the web browser is still unavailable and I had to

07:28.760 --> 07:29.760
try to cancel.

07:29.760 --> 07:34.440
I mean, it was the most convoluted signup process I have ever been through to sign up

07:34.440 --> 07:38.260
for any kind of service, especially from Microsoft.

07:38.260 --> 07:39.520
That's just a little side tangent.

07:39.520 --> 07:43.520
Their account stuff is in a really weird place now because they've increased and expanded

07:43.520 --> 07:45.420
all of the things they use it for.

07:45.420 --> 07:48.940
Even like playing Minecraft now, you have to have a Microsoft account, but they haven't

07:48.940 --> 07:52.760
caught up like Google has where I can easily switch between four or five different Google

07:52.760 --> 07:53.760
accounts in a day.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.080
They got to get there.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.080
Yeah.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.960
Well, and Google is like aware that you have multiple accounts and it's a simple dropdown

07:58.960 --> 08:02.160
of like, okay, you want your personal because you're like listening to YouTube, but you

08:02.160 --> 08:04.120
want your business because you're reading Gmail.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.120
Right.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.120
Kind of felt like though your big takeaway from Windows 11 is sort of what you and I

08:08.120 --> 08:13.960
have been getting at more and more is all of the major desktops have really stepped

08:13.960 --> 08:19.640
up their developer support and game and Windows 11 seem, I mean, from, I have not tried it

08:19.640 --> 08:20.640
much.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.280
I have used it a little bit, but not much.

08:22.280 --> 08:25.340
But what I've been, the feedback I've been getting is a lot of people like it.

08:25.340 --> 08:29.560
It does the job and it's a good tool for getting their work done.

08:29.560 --> 08:33.240
Seems like if you had to, for like a client or something like that, you'd, you'd get by

08:33.240 --> 08:34.760
if you stayed in Windows 11.

08:34.760 --> 08:35.760
Yeah.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.760
I mean, I wouldn't even say get by.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.880
I would say it would be just fine.

08:38.880 --> 08:42.680
I mean, it's, it's come a long way.

08:42.680 --> 08:46.680
And I know a lot of this was in like later versions of Windows 10 too, but it's come

08:46.680 --> 08:52.440
a long way since like the Windows eight, seven days, if you are a non-Microsoft developer

08:52.440 --> 08:56.880
to the point where it's really kind of good.

08:56.880 --> 09:01.480
There's a funny, like almost uncanny valley that Windows sits in right now because almost

09:01.480 --> 09:06.900
always if you were to adopt Windows 10 and bring it totally current with all patches,

09:06.900 --> 09:11.400
in a lot of ways that may actually be a better workstation OS than Windows 11 is right now.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.400
Yeah.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.640
But it won't always remain that way.

09:13.640 --> 09:18.000
Windows 11 is like, they've made some choices that are other choices that could have been

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
made, I guess.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
But you're not sticking with it.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.160
It sounds like you're, you're not daily driving.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.240
Well, it's my, it's my gaming rig, right?

09:23.240 --> 09:25.520
And it's my gaming and visual studio rig.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.720
Cause I, I got tired of fighting with VMs.

09:27.720 --> 09:33.680
Hey, I wanted to say, as we get into the feedback, huge thank you to Drew last week who just

09:33.680 --> 09:36.800
really did a hero's amount of work to save the show.

09:36.800 --> 09:43.000
Our editor went above and beyond last week because let me just give you the high level.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.080
During the recording of last week's episode, there was a massive storm in the Pacific Northwest.

09:47.080 --> 09:52.260
We lost power twice and we've recently been eliminating the UPSs out of the studio because

09:52.260 --> 09:55.280
of buzz and we really rarely have power outages.

09:55.280 --> 09:59.060
And then go figure the power went out twice while we were recording.

09:59.060 --> 10:04.420
Then after we finished recording, the power went out again and I was hours late getting

10:04.420 --> 10:08.200
the files up to our next cloud instance for editing.

10:08.200 --> 10:12.680
So of course there was data loss in the recorder because the power went out twice.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.260
So Drew had to go to like double backups to recover some of this stuff.

10:16.260 --> 10:23.740
Like he was in the project folder of the recording, pulling out stuff and Mike had device issues.

10:23.740 --> 10:27.380
I think he switched to AirPods, his, his input switched to AirPods on one of the reconnects

10:27.380 --> 10:30.860
and disconnects and Drew had to try to make that sound consistent.

10:30.860 --> 10:36.320
It was a total show and not to mention there was a little bit of extra editing on the beeping

10:36.320 --> 10:42.380
side too, which I just thought was hilarious, but he really went above and beyond last week.

10:42.380 --> 10:48.260
So a big thank you to Drew for making this show actually listenable, despite all of the

10:48.260 --> 10:51.460
crap it went through, he is the hero.

10:51.460 --> 10:57.340
And I don't think we heard from a single person who disagreed with your take on web three.

10:57.340 --> 11:00.300
It was, it was one of the show classics to tell you the truth.

11:00.300 --> 11:01.300
Yeah.

11:01.300 --> 11:02.300
I found that kind of interesting.

11:02.300 --> 11:06.420
I thought for sure we'd get a lot of like, usually when we go hard on anything we get,

11:06.420 --> 11:08.540
we get pretty strong pushback.

11:08.540 --> 11:13.540
You know, I, I thought this was kind of like my unique insight, but in conversations that

11:13.540 --> 11:18.980
I had subsequent to the show, like DMS and stuff, I guess I'm kind of not alone on this,

11:18.980 --> 11:24.300
that it feels like a lot of like would be startup people or like, you know, personalities

11:24.300 --> 11:28.980
are like looking for the next big thing and God damn, they're trying to make this web

11:28.980 --> 11:29.980
three thing.

11:29.980 --> 11:30.980
Yeah.

11:30.980 --> 11:31.980
Yeah.

11:31.980 --> 11:32.980
I don't know.

11:32.980 --> 11:33.980
I think that's like an industry wide problem outside of web three, right?

11:33.980 --> 11:38.860
I mean, I think Facebook changing their name to Metta for obvious reasons, but also like

11:38.860 --> 11:44.060
they need to be the leader in some other revolution because mobile is like locked with Google

11:44.060 --> 11:46.440
and Apple.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.920
So they're going to try Metaverse, whatever the hell that means.

11:49.920 --> 11:57.340
Are you just struck by the fact that we appear to exist now in a mostly grifter economy?

11:57.340 --> 12:01.540
When you look at the political class, when you look at the crap that the tech giants

12:01.540 --> 12:05.800
are selling us that they never fully deliver on, when you look at things like web three

12:05.800 --> 12:10.780
and all the different initiatives online or my God, look at YouTube, look at all those

12:10.780 --> 12:16.980
YouTubers, tell me, are we not predominantly now existing in a grifter economy?

12:16.980 --> 12:21.620
And I feel like we're a couple of guys sitting here making an honest product.

12:21.620 --> 12:27.420
I make a media product, you make a software product and we're surrounded by grifters.

12:27.420 --> 12:31.500
And I think that's what triggers me the most about the web three stuff is it seems like

12:31.500 --> 12:35.700
people who made some money and want to either double down on and make their next big bet

12:35.700 --> 12:41.240
or they want to become famous because they're such narcissists and they don't even realize

12:41.240 --> 12:43.300
they're grifters probably until it's too late.

12:43.300 --> 12:50.840
Like it's just normal now for there to be a thing such as an influencer who just post

12:50.840 --> 12:53.080
doctored pictures on Instagram.

12:53.080 --> 12:58.940
And yet somehow we give these people credibility when they're really just grifters and it's

12:58.940 --> 13:00.780
this everywhere now.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.720
And boy, oh boy, I really, I worry about that kind of thing.

13:03.720 --> 13:08.940
And I think when you look at how they talk, they wrap it in all of these massive ideals

13:08.940 --> 13:15.980
about freeing society from corporate overlords and control and about centralizing your information

13:15.980 --> 13:20.740
that you have direct control over and making it cryptographically verifiable and trusted

13:20.740 --> 13:25.660
peer to peer payments that underline all of this with, you know, smart contracts backed

13:25.660 --> 13:26.660
up by Ethereum.

13:26.660 --> 13:31.320
Yeah, that stuff would be fantastic, but that is not reality.

13:31.320 --> 13:36.380
We live in a world where trillion dollar companies have influence over the way and direction

13:36.380 --> 13:40.440
the web and technology are going to go and they're never going to push it in a direction

13:40.440 --> 13:43.780
like that regardless of what they say.

13:43.780 --> 13:49.020
So it just seems like what you have is a bunch of people grifting in the middle, selling

13:49.020 --> 13:54.860
a promise that can never be delivered on because of the fundamental structure of the market.

13:54.860 --> 14:00.420
And it just is sad that they managed to convince so many people and it continues to propagate

14:00.420 --> 14:01.420
what they do.

14:01.420 --> 14:02.420
I don't know.

14:02.420 --> 14:08.020
It's hard because there's definitely a way to go overboard on this, but like I look at

14:08.020 --> 14:14.060
our businesses, it is very hard, but also kind of not that sexy to provide a product

14:14.060 --> 14:19.820
that provides value or, you know, in your case, content, right, which I guess is a product

14:19.820 --> 14:25.100
and just like do the work of actually generating more revenue than you spend.

14:25.100 --> 14:29.700
But it's super sexy to never make money and then, quote, start a revolution.

14:29.700 --> 14:30.700
What's it?

14:30.700 --> 14:31.700
Is it Thanos?

14:31.700 --> 14:32.700
Is that what it is?

14:32.700 --> 14:33.700
I think.

14:33.700 --> 14:34.700
Am I getting that right?

14:34.700 --> 14:36.340
That I mean, you think of the Theranos case is going on right now, right?

14:36.340 --> 14:40.620
You know, I am certainly I got a lot of criticism because I was like calling bull on that a long

14:40.620 --> 14:41.620
time ago.

14:41.620 --> 14:42.620
Yep.

14:42.620 --> 14:47.820
Like every article in the Theranos case was about the person of Elizabeth Holmes, not

14:47.820 --> 14:55.380
like, hey, can I see an article from like a doctor, not, you know, some possibly politically

14:55.380 --> 14:58.860
inspired journalist who happens to cover tech or science?

14:58.860 --> 15:04.060
I really want to see like the medical journal or at least like quote the medical journal

15:04.060 --> 15:05.860
in your fluff piece.

15:05.860 --> 15:11.900
You're touching on our cult of personality culture now and grifters take advantage of

15:11.900 --> 15:12.900
that.

15:12.900 --> 15:18.340
That's what's happening is the personality leads the headline, not the actual hard work

15:18.340 --> 15:24.100
or the details, but it's the story they can sell around a personality.

15:24.100 --> 15:29.020
If you even see this happening in the Linux world where the founder of Rocky Linux, the

15:29.020 --> 15:33.420
narrative now is that he founded Centos and now he's gone on to found Rocky Linux.

15:33.420 --> 15:34.700
But that's not really true.

15:34.700 --> 15:39.580
He was involved in finding something, founding something called Chaos Linux, which was abandoned

15:39.580 --> 15:44.300
in effort of Centos and you know, like the whole thing is very nuanced, but there is

15:44.300 --> 15:50.500
a narrative around a person that is, it's the way the media works.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.460
They need to write, they need to, they need to fill airtime.

15:53.460 --> 15:58.660
And if they can tell a story about Elizabeth Holmes, they're going to go that direction

15:58.660 --> 16:01.740
every time because they don't have to be an expert on the product.

16:01.740 --> 16:03.400
They don't have to be an expert on the market.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.360
They just have to know how to tell a story.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.100
And then what happens is people like Elizabeth can grift on that.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.540
They can, they've been given this exposure.

16:10.540 --> 16:14.780
They roll with the media and you know, they can get really far without actually producing

16:14.780 --> 16:15.780
much.

16:15.780 --> 16:17.820
You see it happen in Linux and you see it happen in the political sphere and you see

16:17.820 --> 16:19.020
it happen in the technology space.

16:19.020 --> 16:23.100
And I think that's part of why crypto gets such a bad name because it's so common over

16:23.100 --> 16:27.300
there, even though it's totally nothing related to the actual core technology.

16:27.300 --> 16:31.260
But it's weird because like the crazy VC back stuff is just taken on faith.

16:31.260 --> 16:36.800
Like I just did a, got interviewed a few times, which hopefully the pieces come out good.

16:36.800 --> 16:41.120
And the first step in every process was, Hey man, you got to like prove to me this isn't

16:41.120 --> 16:42.120
just bull.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.120
Right.

16:43.120 --> 16:48.940
And like serious, almost antagonistic kind of like show me like vetting.

16:48.940 --> 16:52.120
I mean, I think that's good, but I think it should be that way for everybody.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.000
But again, a VC is like a brand.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
It's like a name.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
It's a personality.

16:57.000 --> 17:02.220
So if such and such VC backs you now, like their cult of personality rubs off on your

17:02.220 --> 17:05.380
company and you're just taken as legitimate.

17:05.380 --> 17:06.900
That's all it takes.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.460
We are so obsessed with personalities and celebrities and we've made tech celebrities

17:10.460 --> 17:11.460
now.

17:11.460 --> 17:16.120
And it's the same thing, you know, Shem wrote in kind of speaking to this and wanted to

17:16.120 --> 17:17.580
know if we had a take on solid.

17:17.580 --> 17:23.420
Now solid is that effort started by sir Tim Berners-Lee that promises in his version of

17:23.420 --> 17:25.300
a decentralized internet.

17:25.300 --> 17:28.380
And he released this whole implementation in spec.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.380
I got to be honest.

17:29.380 --> 17:34.060
I actually was pretty familiar with it when solid was first announced, but it's completely

17:34.060 --> 17:35.140
faded from my memory.

17:35.140 --> 17:37.180
I can barely remember it now.

17:37.180 --> 17:38.420
This is not going to be a thing.

17:38.420 --> 17:42.900
Now, I don't know if this is necessarily a grift as much as it is someone's dream of

17:42.900 --> 17:44.300
taking things to the next step.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.300
No, I think it's legitimate.

17:45.300 --> 17:48.300
It's just not going to catch on with the, with the general public.

17:48.300 --> 17:49.300
Right.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.300
Right.

17:50.300 --> 17:54.020
Well, there's, there's so much momentum around the way things are now, you know what this

17:54.020 --> 17:55.020
reminds me of?

17:55.020 --> 17:56.340
And I'm going to get some heat here.

17:56.340 --> 17:57.340
Matrix.

17:57.340 --> 17:58.340
Oh yeah.

17:58.340 --> 18:01.300
Or how about, what was, what was the one I used to be on that all the Linux folks were

18:01.300 --> 18:02.300
on for a while?

18:02.300 --> 18:03.300
Mattermost?

18:03.300 --> 18:04.300
It wasn't matter.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.300
It was Mastodon.

18:05.300 --> 18:06.300
Oh, Mastodon.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.300
Maybe it was.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.300
Maybe it was Mastodon.

18:08.300 --> 18:09.900
Mastodon still exists, but yeah, it's a niche.

18:09.900 --> 18:10.900
It still exists.

18:10.900 --> 18:11.900
Yeah.

18:11.900 --> 18:14.620
It's definitely a niche, right?

18:14.620 --> 18:16.060
Linode.com slash coder.

18:16.060 --> 18:20.580
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

18:20.580 --> 18:21.580
show.

18:21.580 --> 18:23.620
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

18:23.620 --> 18:24.980
You've got to try it out for yourself.

18:24.980 --> 18:26.280
Maybe try it out for your next project.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.920
It's what I use for everything we've deployed in the last couple of years, especially now

18:29.920 --> 18:32.780
that Linode has been rolling out MVME upgrades to their rigs.

18:32.780 --> 18:34.140
It's a great time to try them out.

18:34.140 --> 18:40.740
I mean, the radical speed up available using MVME is a game changer for certain types of

18:40.740 --> 18:41.740
applications.

18:41.740 --> 18:45.780
In particular, a transactional service like a database or maybe an e-commerce site, it

18:45.780 --> 18:47.980
can operate a lot faster when you use an MVME storage.

18:47.980 --> 18:50.020
I mean, you'll really notice it.

18:50.020 --> 18:53.900
Really anything that does massive parallelism, that's going to be a lot faster with MVME

18:53.900 --> 18:56.660
storage because it's great at density.

18:56.660 --> 18:59.420
It's really good at IOPS per gigabyte.

18:59.420 --> 19:02.940
And even compared to traditional SSDs, you're going to see a big upgrade with MVME storage

19:02.940 --> 19:04.340
on your server.

19:04.340 --> 19:08.420
So if you're a performance hound like me, or your application truly needs that storage

19:08.420 --> 19:13.100
throughput, Linode's team can help you sort through your options with MVME storage and

19:13.100 --> 19:16.340
arrive at the optimum storage configuration for your environment.

19:16.340 --> 19:21.280
I think you're going to find their pricing is great, 30 to 50% less than the major hypervisor

19:21.280 --> 19:22.380
duopolies out there.

19:22.380 --> 19:25.340
And they've got 11 data centers around the world that you can choose from.

19:25.340 --> 19:29.320
So you're going to find something close to you or your customers.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.760
Linode knows how to do this.

19:30.760 --> 19:34.780
They've been doing it for 18 years, and they just keep getting better and better.

19:34.780 --> 19:37.620
They're truly passionate about the technology.

19:37.620 --> 19:41.880
Go try it for real and see for yourself, linode.com slash coder.

19:41.880 --> 19:42.880
What an opportunity.

19:42.880 --> 19:47.220
You get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you get to support the show and really

19:47.220 --> 19:53.340
try this out, linode.com slash coder, $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, linode.com

19:53.340 --> 19:55.340
slash coder.

19:55.340 --> 19:58.900
Well, listener Chris just wrote in with a short email.

19:58.900 --> 20:03.180
He says, I totally agree with your take on Apple and the Mac in the last episode, and

20:03.180 --> 20:06.780
he feels like Mac OS has been withering on the vine for years.

20:06.780 --> 20:10.880
But he says there's a 900-pound gorilla in the room that we aren't addressing when we

20:10.880 --> 20:16.060
talk about the M1 and the M1 Macs and Intel responding with their chips.

20:16.060 --> 20:20.040
He says, yeah, short term, the pandemic-induced binge buying.

20:20.040 --> 20:25.460
But beyond that, there's really no money long term for the major players.

20:25.460 --> 20:27.700
He thinks the desktop market's dead.

20:27.700 --> 20:28.700
I'm wondering if you agree.

20:28.700 --> 20:32.620
Do you think long term that the surge we're seeing with these desktops, and I'd say laptops,

20:32.620 --> 20:37.860
is just a temporary thing while people build up for work from home and then the desktop

20:37.860 --> 20:38.860
begins to fade again?

20:38.860 --> 20:43.900
Yeah, I wouldn't say dead, but obviously this is just like people are moving and buying

20:43.900 --> 20:49.220
larger houses in the burbs or even more rurally because they're working from home, and it's

20:49.220 --> 20:52.180
nice to have a home office that has a door.

20:52.180 --> 20:53.820
I think it's the same thing.

20:53.820 --> 20:54.820
Is it dead?

20:54.820 --> 20:56.940
I don't know, right?

20:56.940 --> 21:00.420
I think news of the desktop's demise have been greatly exaggerated.

21:00.420 --> 21:01.780
I agree.

21:01.780 --> 21:05.700
Certainly, particularly for Apple, the insane numbers they're putting up, or probably will

21:05.700 --> 21:10.460
put up for the rest of the year, and I would say like the first quarter next year on the

21:10.460 --> 21:11.940
Mac are going to go down.

21:11.940 --> 21:18.220
But part of that is like the market, the people who buy Macs and use Pro Macs are super hungry

21:18.220 --> 21:20.820
for like a good Pro Mac.

21:20.820 --> 21:25.900
If my adventures in Windows and back in Linux and everything fail over the next few months,

21:25.900 --> 21:28.820
I will be looking, do I get another Air, right?

21:28.820 --> 21:34.280
Because they haven't released, and in particular the pros, they haven't released a laptop machine

21:34.280 --> 21:36.420
this good in a while.

21:36.420 --> 21:40.280
Their pricing's insane, but it's Apple.

21:40.280 --> 21:45.860
It's a confluence of remote working and they have legitimately released good products.

21:45.860 --> 21:50.380
Put it this way, no one is getting fired for buying Apple right now.

21:50.380 --> 21:53.340
I'd say too, they've created pent up demand for decent machines.

21:53.340 --> 21:58.100
By releasing crappy ones with keyboards that don't work, they have created an excellent

21:58.100 --> 21:59.100
device.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.100
Maybe they're geniuses.

22:00.100 --> 22:05.180
I mean, maybe, because it seems like if you get them hooked on your platform, you can

22:05.180 --> 22:07.060
kind of stretch things out like that.

22:07.060 --> 22:09.100
But you can't have the escape key.

22:09.100 --> 22:13.620
I wouldn't be surprised if things end up back that way again, but they still have a bit

22:13.620 --> 22:14.620
longer to go.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.980
They have more professional machines to replace.

22:16.980 --> 22:21.300
There's still more pent up demand out there, so this cycle is not over yet.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.300
You know what?

22:22.300 --> 22:26.660
To the audience, nobody sent in like a productivity hack tip or hardware or anything like that,

22:26.660 --> 22:27.660
which is fine.

22:27.660 --> 22:28.660
Maybe nobody cares.

22:28.660 --> 22:29.660
That's fine.

22:29.660 --> 22:32.220
But nobody sent anything in last week and I was trying to collect a few more, so I'm

22:32.220 --> 22:35.500
going to extend it for one more week just in case you got lazy and you thought, ah,

22:35.500 --> 22:36.500
somebody will send one in.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.060
No, I needed you to do it.

22:38.060 --> 22:41.820
So go to coder.show slash contact and we're going to just punt it for one week because

22:41.820 --> 22:44.660
honestly, there's a lot going on this week.

22:44.660 --> 22:49.340
Some of it's happening today and we want to spend the show talking about that, but we'll

22:49.340 --> 22:53.620
try to get back to it next week with productivity tips to make you work faster and better.

22:53.620 --> 23:00.100
Python, please stop screwing over Linux distros is the headline that caught my attention.

23:00.100 --> 23:05.180
This is a real screamer from Drew DeVault, who seems to really know how to say things

23:05.180 --> 23:07.820
to get people talking.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.540
The man knows how to write a headline.

23:09.540 --> 23:10.580
Yeah, he sure does.

23:10.580 --> 23:14.180
For better or for worse, I might add, because I would say for worse.

23:14.180 --> 23:18.900
Yeah, but he writes the Python community is obsessed with reinventing the wheel over and

23:18.900 --> 23:22.620
over and over and over again, and I thought, all right, this is something our audience

23:22.620 --> 23:23.820
is going to see.

23:23.820 --> 23:26.260
This is probably something we should discuss.

23:26.260 --> 23:28.380
He goes on to write.

23:28.380 --> 23:29.380
Python is a mess.

23:29.380 --> 23:30.940
I really want to like Python.

23:30.940 --> 23:35.200
I've used it for many years in many projects, including Source Hut, which was predominantly

23:35.200 --> 23:37.580
developed in Python.

23:37.580 --> 23:43.580
But I simply can't handle it anymore, and I have been hard at work removing Python from

23:43.580 --> 23:44.580
my stack.

23:44.580 --> 23:49.260
He says I manage Python in the only way I think is sane, installing them from my Linux

23:49.260 --> 23:50.820
distributions package manager.

23:50.820 --> 23:58.020
He also maintains a few packages for Alpine, but he says he is sick and tired of dealing

23:58.020 --> 24:00.420
with this half hazard approach.

24:00.420 --> 24:04.960
Every one of these package managers, he says, is designed for a reckless world in which

24:04.960 --> 24:09.540
programmers chuck packages into home pip, set up virtual environments and pin their

24:09.540 --> 24:13.660
dependencies to 10 versions and six vulnerabilities ago, and then they ship their computers directly

24:13.660 --> 24:18.580
into production in Docker containers, which aim to do the minimum amount necessary to

24:18.580 --> 24:24.540
make their users' private data as insecure as possible.

24:24.540 --> 24:28.240
None of these newfangled solutions address the needs of any of the distros, despite our

24:28.240 --> 24:30.020
repeated pleas.

24:30.020 --> 24:33.740
They all break backwards compatibility with our use case and send our complaints to Dev

24:33.740 --> 24:34.740
Null.

24:34.740 --> 24:39.180
I have seen representatives from every Linux distro making repeated separate pleas to

24:39.180 --> 24:44.380
Python to address their concerns, from Debian to Arch to Alpine to NixOS, plus non-Linux

24:44.380 --> 24:47.020
distros like FreeBSD and Olumos.

24:47.020 --> 24:48.020
Everyone is frustrated.

24:48.020 --> 24:53.180
We've all been struggling to deal with Python right now, and Python is not listening to

24:53.180 --> 24:54.180
us.

24:54.180 --> 24:59.540
He says he calls on the PSF to sit down for serious, sober engineering work to fix this

24:59.540 --> 25:04.080
problem, drop a list of use cases you need to support, pick the most promising initiative,

25:04.080 --> 25:07.380
and put hours in to make it work properly, today and tomorrow.

25:07.380 --> 25:13.060
Find something you can stick with and make stable for the next 30 years.

25:13.060 --> 25:14.780
So you've been working with Python for a bit.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.780
Has it been this dramatic for you to manage from a developer's end?

25:17.780 --> 25:21.340
I have a very nuanced answer, no.

25:21.340 --> 25:22.900
Is this guy like maintaining a distro?

25:22.900 --> 25:23.900
Is that what he's doing?

25:23.900 --> 25:27.500
Well, he's doing, he's maintaining packages for a couple of distros.

25:27.500 --> 25:30.220
He maintains a few dozen Python packages for Alpine.

25:30.220 --> 25:32.900
All right, but that's not like the use case.

25:32.900 --> 25:33.900
Yeah.

25:33.900 --> 25:37.420
I mean, Alpine's pretty much like the go-to base for a container, which is probably why

25:37.420 --> 25:43.340
he's, what he's complaining about is people are just kind of being lazy and pinning their

25:43.340 --> 25:49.140
dependencies to, you know, 10 releases back that have tons of vulnerabilities and shipping

25:49.140 --> 25:51.060
it inside a Docker container.

25:51.060 --> 25:53.900
But has he heard of C++ and Clang?

25:53.900 --> 25:54.900
It's worse.

25:54.900 --> 25:55.900
Trust me.

25:55.900 --> 25:59.140
I mean, again, like my use, so the use case I have, right, since you made the comparison,

25:59.140 --> 26:04.100
because I'm an end developer, but I have lots of Python environments on all of my machines

26:04.100 --> 26:05.180
now.

26:05.180 --> 26:11.260
And I even have some that are like experimental environments, like upping to 3.10, right?

26:11.260 --> 26:16.700
Or for instance, before I upped to SQL Alchemy 1.4, or 1.4.1, I don't know, the 1.4 series,

26:16.700 --> 26:19.820
I tried it out just to see.

26:19.820 --> 26:25.420
And if it didn't work, I would have just blown away the venv and created a new one and it

26:25.420 --> 26:26.420
would have been cool.

26:26.420 --> 26:31.860
I mean, I, from an end developer's point of view, the thing I care about is building my

26:31.860 --> 26:34.580
software or doing client work.

26:34.580 --> 26:39.820
I'm perfectly happy with pip and end and virtual end and all that.

26:39.820 --> 26:45.260
I have been tempted by poetry a few times, but that's mostly because I like the name.

26:45.260 --> 26:49.980
He says part of the problem has been for the past few years, everyone and their cousin

26:49.980 --> 26:55.760
has decided to solve different packaging problems in Python, but they've all created incompatible

26:55.760 --> 26:57.060
messes.

26:57.060 --> 27:01.100
All the solutions end up enjoying varying levels of success in the community, but none

27:01.100 --> 27:05.460
of them are blessed as the official answer and none of them go away since they have users.

27:05.460 --> 27:09.500
And it just becomes a growing and growing horizontal problem.

27:09.500 --> 27:10.500
Yeah.

27:10.500 --> 27:15.460
I mean, the part that I kind of agree with Drew on is the security vulnerabilities, right?

27:15.460 --> 27:21.660
It is super easy to pin your packages and your rex.txt to something old and just never

27:21.660 --> 27:23.820
think about it again.

27:23.820 --> 27:24.820
That's bad.

27:24.820 --> 27:25.820
You shouldn't be doing this.

27:25.820 --> 27:26.820
You shouldn't be doing that.

27:26.820 --> 27:30.180
And yeah, you could get like a version of, I don't know why I'm picking on SQLAlchemy,

27:30.180 --> 27:36.540
but it's the most common ORM folks in the Python world use, myself included.

27:36.540 --> 27:40.300
You could get an outdated version of SQLAlchemy that has some sort of vulnerability in itself

27:40.300 --> 27:43.260
or one of its dependencies, and that would suck.

27:43.260 --> 27:48.320
I would also argue that that problem exists in literally every programming language in

27:48.320 --> 27:49.320
the world.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.320
Right.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.320
Exactly.

27:51.320 --> 27:56.540
I'm not a package manager at all, like the problems that are described here also exist

27:56.540 --> 27:58.160
in Bundler for Ruby.

27:58.160 --> 28:00.540
They exist in, oh my God, Maven.

28:00.540 --> 28:02.260
I haven't done Java in a long time.

28:02.260 --> 28:03.260
I think it's Maven.

28:03.260 --> 28:08.900
I think his point is there's too many options for Python, so it's a broader problem, but

28:08.900 --> 28:09.940
I completely agree.

28:09.940 --> 28:11.860
The fundamental issue is the same.

28:11.860 --> 28:14.280
Sure, but there's too many options.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.580
But if you look at the, I forgot, I think it was the stack overflow stats we looked

28:17.580 --> 28:18.580
at.

28:18.580 --> 28:22.860
We're using the default, the de facto default, which is pip, right, pipenv.

28:22.860 --> 28:28.860
So I don't know, I mean, yeah, if you're super new and you make the mistake of not creating

28:28.860 --> 28:34.740
a virtual environment in your project directory and you do like pip install, I don't know,

28:34.740 --> 28:40.020
whatever, right, fast API, yeah, you have installed it to your home directory and that's

28:40.020 --> 28:41.020
not good.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.600
I mean, that's bad.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.980
You don't want to be working like that.

28:44.980 --> 28:50.220
But that's something, that's almost like saying back in the Objective-C days, it's like Objective-C

28:50.220 --> 28:54.060
is a terrible language because all these people who are new to it don't know how to handle

28:54.060 --> 28:55.060
memory.

28:55.060 --> 28:58.060
Well, they just need to learn how to handle manual memory management.

28:58.060 --> 29:04.260
And this for younger folks who don't remember those days or didn't do Objective-C, before

29:04.260 --> 29:08.460
Arc, it was literally like C where you had to manage your own memory, but the Alec retain

29:08.460 --> 29:10.140
release, all that good stuff.

29:10.140 --> 29:15.860
I mean, I feel for him and his frustration, it sounds like he's certainly agitated.

29:15.860 --> 29:19.420
I've also seen other of his posts where he complains about other package managers that

29:19.420 --> 29:21.060
aren't the default.

29:21.060 --> 29:27.180
So I think what Python has done, tying it back to my Windows post, Python has become,

29:27.180 --> 29:33.500
or frankly is, maybe has been for some time, a very native working and native feeling development

29:33.500 --> 29:36.960
of, I know it's not native code, but like you don't feel like you're doing something

29:36.960 --> 29:39.460
foreign to that dev system you're on.

29:39.460 --> 29:44.540
It just works, to quote Apple, on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

29:44.540 --> 29:51.500
So as a developer, I'm go snakey, snakey, kill, kill, kill.

29:51.500 --> 29:58.940
It strikes me too, that we have been discussing this core problem for a really long time.

29:58.940 --> 30:05.040
The one of shipping out of date libraries inside a container or statically linked to

30:05.040 --> 30:06.320
an application.

30:06.320 --> 30:09.540
This problem just, it won't shut the fuck up.

30:09.540 --> 30:12.420
It just keeps coming up all the time.

30:12.420 --> 30:16.820
And I gotta feel like there's maybe another solution here.

30:16.820 --> 30:21.540
Something that's like mandatory access controls or something that solves this at least from

30:21.540 --> 30:23.020
another angle.

30:23.020 --> 30:31.700
Because it almost seems like this is a fundamental compromise in making software that remains

30:31.700 --> 30:33.820
consistent and ships for long periods of time.

30:33.820 --> 30:37.620
I guess, but at some point, hard problems are just hard.

30:37.620 --> 30:38.620
True.

30:38.620 --> 30:40.220
Maintaining distros is hard.

30:40.220 --> 30:41.220
Maintaining repos for distros.

30:41.220 --> 30:42.220
I mean, it's just...

30:42.220 --> 30:46.460
Let's say you had a self-hosted version of Alice that everybody has or something like

30:46.460 --> 30:47.460
this.

30:47.460 --> 30:51.460
Or it's like a version, or maybe you just have a dozen instances up in the cloud that

30:51.460 --> 30:52.460
you manage for them.

30:52.460 --> 30:55.500
So you've described the actual situation, okay, keep going.

30:55.500 --> 31:00.900
What happens if one Python library in the container or a couple need to be updated every

31:00.900 --> 31:03.940
couple of weeks, just when you look at all of them that are in use?

31:03.940 --> 31:07.160
Do you really want to be in that situation where you're constantly having to ship new

31:07.160 --> 31:10.900
versions of the container just because the underlying parts have to be updated once a

31:10.900 --> 31:11.900
week?

31:11.900 --> 31:13.460
That's kind of a straw man, a little bit, right?

31:13.460 --> 31:14.460
Yeah, you're right.

31:14.460 --> 31:17.780
But you could end up in a situation like that if you really wanted to keep all the software

31:17.780 --> 31:18.780
current.

31:18.780 --> 31:19.780
Well, let's take a real situation, right?

31:19.780 --> 31:21.340
The open SSL vulnerability.

31:21.340 --> 31:24.380
Because I, at the time, was doing mostly Rails.

31:24.380 --> 31:29.500
You could get away with not updating open SSL, but that was a very, very stupid idea.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.500
Poor choice.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.660
It was a poor choice.

31:31.660 --> 31:36.180
But updating the underlying open SSL lib required you to update a bunch of your gems.

31:36.180 --> 31:40.600
I don't remember the ones off the top of my head, but it was core to Rails itself.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.520
So it was a thing.

31:42.520 --> 31:46.620
That's the kind of thing where it is, yes, rip your hair out, the sky is falling, do

31:46.620 --> 31:47.620
the update.

31:47.620 --> 31:52.460
But like minor point releases for features, I don't know.

31:52.460 --> 31:58.180
I tend to look at things like once a quarter-ish, with the exception of security issues that

31:58.180 --> 32:00.740
I'm, like, I do jump on those.

32:00.740 --> 32:04.020
But it's, I mean, it's Unix, man.

32:04.020 --> 32:05.020
Just write a script.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.020
I'm sorry.

32:06.020 --> 32:11.820
Well, and the other reality is build for the world as it is and create something that you

32:11.820 --> 32:15.260
can tear down and stand back up with relative ease, because you're going to have to tear

32:15.260 --> 32:16.260
it down and stand it back up.

32:16.260 --> 32:17.260
Well, it's not just that.

32:17.260 --> 32:20.180
OK, so if you're saying you don't want to manage packages, the alternative is that you

32:20.180 --> 32:25.100
have to write my new HTTP library, TCIP, ORM.

32:25.100 --> 32:29.660
It just isn't that big of a price to pay relative to what the alternative cost would be.

32:29.660 --> 32:35.460
It is interesting, though, like how many different takes there are on this, even just on Linux,

32:35.460 --> 32:36.460
for example.

32:36.460 --> 32:39.820
Like for the desktop application side, you've got Flatpak and AppImage, which are trying

32:39.820 --> 32:40.900
to solve some of these problems.

32:40.900 --> 32:42.300
You've got Snap.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.300
You've also got containers.

32:43.300 --> 32:45.400
I mean, you've got Charrutes even.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.660
You've got all of these.

32:46.660 --> 32:49.240
You've got 47 different ways to do it.

32:49.240 --> 32:54.180
You really do, because it's clearly been a longtime problem.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.420
And we've come up with a lot of solutions for it.

32:56.420 --> 32:59.140
Wayland, I just have to say it.

32:59.140 --> 33:02.340
I think the solution is just to spam DLLs all over the hard drive.

33:02.340 --> 33:03.340
That'll solve it.

33:03.340 --> 33:10.140
Listen, there is nothing that cannot be solved by dynamically linking.

33:10.140 --> 33:12.140
Shortcut.com slash coder.

33:12.140 --> 33:14.700
Have you ever really been happy with your project management tool?

33:14.700 --> 33:20.580
I mean, most are either too simple for a growing engineering team to manage or so complex that

33:20.580 --> 33:25.940
you have to have basically a dedicated person to poke people and prod it to use the tool.

33:25.940 --> 33:28.200
That's where Shortcut comes in, formerly known as Clubhouse.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.200
It's different.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.840
I mean, it's better in just about every way.

33:30.840 --> 33:34.580
It's a project management tool built specifically for software teams.

33:34.580 --> 33:35.580
It's fast.

33:35.580 --> 33:36.580
It's intuitive.

33:36.580 --> 33:37.580
It's flexible.

33:37.580 --> 33:38.580
It's powerful.

33:38.580 --> 33:39.580
And all the other kind of things you're going to like.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.300
Like, let's look at some of the highlights here.

33:41.300 --> 33:42.940
It has a team-based workflow.

33:42.940 --> 33:46.500
Individual teams can use Shortcut's default workflows or customize them so they match

33:46.500 --> 33:47.780
the way you work.

33:47.780 --> 33:51.580
And it has organizational-wide goals and roadmaps.

33:51.580 --> 33:55.920
The work in these workflows is automatically tied into a larger company goal.

33:55.920 --> 34:01.100
It just takes one click to move from a roadmap to a team's work to an individual update and

34:01.100 --> 34:02.100
vice versa.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.500
You really get fantastic visibility.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.540
And it has tight VCS integrations.

34:06.540 --> 34:11.540
If you use GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, whatever, Shortcut ties directly into them so you can

34:11.540 --> 34:13.420
update your progress from the command line.

34:13.420 --> 34:15.820
And I love to tell you guys about this because you know I'm a big fan of this.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.220
They have a very keyboard-friendly interface.

34:18.220 --> 34:19.780
You could rock it with your keyboard.

34:19.780 --> 34:23.900
In fact, they have a power bar, which is a keyboard-friendly interface for the entire

34:23.900 --> 34:24.900
thing.

34:24.900 --> 34:26.820
You can do virtually anything without touching your mouse.

34:26.820 --> 34:27.820
How great is that?

34:27.820 --> 34:30.460
Go throw that thing in the trash.

34:30.460 --> 34:31.780
They also have iterations planning.

34:31.780 --> 34:36.180
I think this is fantastic because you can set weekly priorities and then let Shortcut

34:36.180 --> 34:39.700
run the schedule for you with accompanying burn-down charts and all the other reporting

34:39.700 --> 34:40.700
you need.

34:40.700 --> 34:42.980
Go give it a try today and support the show.

34:42.980 --> 34:44.500
Shortcut.com slash coder.

34:44.500 --> 34:47.740
Shortcut, formerly known as Clubhouse.

34:47.740 --> 34:50.820
Because you shouldn't have to project manage your project management.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.820
Shortcut.com slash coder.

34:53.820 --> 35:01.700
All right, so breaking today as we record the program, the entire Rust development moderation

35:01.700 --> 35:05.340
team has resigned, effective immediately.

35:05.340 --> 35:06.740
Holy crap.

35:06.740 --> 35:11.500
The resignation has been done in protest of the core team placing themselves unaccountable

35:11.500 --> 35:14.500
to anyone but themselves, they write.

35:14.500 --> 35:15.780
Now, they have not shared details.

35:15.780 --> 35:21.540
We're recording this on Monday, November 22nd, so we don't actually know anything yet.

35:21.540 --> 35:28.660
However, if you go through all the threads, read different takes, it appears that a situation

35:28.660 --> 35:33.580
that may violate the code of conduct came up and the consensus from the core team was

35:33.580 --> 35:37.780
perhaps, or maybe not a consensus, but an individual member, we don't know, believes

35:37.780 --> 35:43.940
that the core team cannot have rules enforced on them by a subcommittee, which would be

35:43.940 --> 35:45.740
the moderation team.

35:45.740 --> 35:51.620
However, when you read the formation docs of all of this, it actually to me very much

35:51.620 --> 35:55.940
reads like the core team is held accountable to the moderation team.

35:55.940 --> 35:58.540
And that may be the core of the conflict here.

35:58.540 --> 36:02.340
We do not know at this point, but whatever it is, it was significant enough that the

36:02.340 --> 36:11.300
entire moderation team in unison resigned this morning and they leave a note saying

36:11.300 --> 36:15.500
that they suggest the Rust team members come to a consensus on a process for oversight

36:15.500 --> 36:16.780
of the core team.

36:16.780 --> 36:22.900
Currently, they're answerable only to themselves, which is a property unique to them in contrast

36:22.900 --> 36:25.940
to all other Rust teams.

36:25.940 --> 36:33.340
In the interest of not perpetuating unaccountability, we recommend the replacement for the mod team

36:33.340 --> 36:38.700
be made by the Rust team members, not on the core team.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.300
Things are not so good in Rust town.

36:40.300 --> 36:43.140
Okay, so I have to make a confession.

36:43.140 --> 36:47.140
Bless me, Fisher, for I have sinned.

36:47.140 --> 36:50.340
I was actually coding all day today and did not see this.

36:50.340 --> 36:51.340
I know, isn't this something?

36:51.340 --> 36:53.700
Well, it just broke up like a couple hours ago.

36:53.700 --> 36:58.060
So when we say moderation, we mean like what I think moderation means.

36:58.060 --> 37:02.740
Like somebody did something, I guess, allegedly inappropriate.

37:02.740 --> 37:03.740
Correct.

37:03.740 --> 37:04.740
Okay.

37:04.740 --> 37:08.060
But this person was like a core developer on Rust.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.060
Allegedly.

37:09.060 --> 37:13.180
We really have very few details, but it seems to be that person was a core team member.

37:13.180 --> 37:14.900
They attempted to moderate the situation.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.100
Was his name Boppy Kotick?

37:17.100 --> 37:19.740
I don't know.

37:19.740 --> 37:25.880
Because I feel like just like remove the whole Linux, the open source part of the story.

37:25.880 --> 37:27.380
And I think we've described Activision.

37:27.380 --> 37:30.500
Oh, man, I tell you, it's this kind of stuff.

37:30.500 --> 37:34.460
You know, it always looks it's such a bad look, too, because it is it's bad for I mean,

37:34.460 --> 37:35.460
this is terrible.

37:35.460 --> 37:36.460
If this is true.

37:36.460 --> 37:39.920
I mean, you know, those Facebook posts when somebody says, Oh, I'm so sad.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.140
And then they don't say anything else.

37:41.140 --> 37:42.980
And they want you to ask why they're sad.

37:42.980 --> 37:43.980
Right.

37:43.980 --> 37:45.100
It has that vibe to it.

37:45.100 --> 37:46.420
I immediately on in front of those people.

37:46.420 --> 37:47.420
So no, I don't.

37:47.420 --> 37:48.620
But I do know of them.

37:48.620 --> 37:49.620
It's so frustrating.

37:49.620 --> 37:50.620
It's annoying.

37:50.620 --> 37:51.860
And it has that vibe to it.

37:51.860 --> 37:55.240
But they said the reason why we didn't say anything more is because we chose not to name

37:55.240 --> 37:59.660
names or divulge specifics that could implicate anyone.

37:59.660 --> 38:03.420
Even so, we felt we should state our reasons for resigning to avoid people making up their

38:03.420 --> 38:05.860
own drama.

38:05.860 --> 38:09.780
Which sort of implies this whole thing is drama, because instead of making up our own

38:09.780 --> 38:13.260
drama, we just have their drama now that they've led the drama.

38:13.260 --> 38:14.260
What does that even mean?

38:14.260 --> 38:15.260
All right.

38:15.260 --> 38:16.260
So I'm sorry.

38:16.260 --> 38:17.260
I'm hippies.

38:17.260 --> 38:18.260
I owe you an apology.

38:18.260 --> 38:19.500
I need to be more into open source.

38:19.500 --> 38:20.500
I'm getting back there.

38:20.500 --> 38:21.500
Don't worry.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.500
My Pangolin arrives tomorrow or Wednesday.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.500
Calm down.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.740
I'm going to do the Linux challenge again.

38:26.740 --> 38:28.700
There was no mod team, right?

38:28.700 --> 38:31.940
Like it was you started the project.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.900
You're the dictator until you decide that you're done.

38:34.900 --> 38:35.900
Right.

38:35.900 --> 38:38.020
And in most cases, your little project just dies.

38:38.020 --> 38:42.020
Like my empty network because it was like people used it.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.500
Nobody contributed back except for one dude.

38:43.500 --> 38:44.500
Right.

38:44.500 --> 38:48.220
That's probably 98 percent of open source, which is fine.

38:48.220 --> 38:51.300
And then like, you know, ASI HTTP came out and you didn't need it anyway.

38:51.300 --> 38:52.300
So fine.

38:52.300 --> 38:53.300
Yeah.

38:53.300 --> 38:54.300
But every now and then something goes big.

38:54.300 --> 38:55.300
Right.

38:55.300 --> 38:58.740
So look, is the mod team like a board of directors of sort where they can, like, hold the I guess

38:58.740 --> 39:02.180
the executives, for lack of a better term, accountable?

39:02.180 --> 39:08.300
Or are they just like they're to police like the forums and I guess GitHub in this?

39:08.300 --> 39:11.620
Now the mod team is the is the team I have the least knowledge about.

39:11.620 --> 39:15.460
But my understanding is sort of the rust governance structure is the court.

39:15.460 --> 39:19.660
If you look at it like an org chart, essentially, the court team is at the top of the org chart.

39:19.660 --> 39:22.220
And then you have a bunch of different sub teams, well, at least a few different sub

39:22.220 --> 39:23.220
teams.

39:23.220 --> 39:25.540
And the moderation team was one of them.

39:25.540 --> 39:29.980
And yeah, their role was to maintain a certain, you know, the code of conduct, community standard

39:29.980 --> 39:33.660
and essentially the hall monitors, if you will.

39:33.660 --> 39:39.740
But, you know, as chosen by, I believe, the core team, a lot of large projects that have

39:39.740 --> 39:44.640
a lot of people interacting with the project, find that to be a necessary function.

39:44.640 --> 39:50.020
But almost in all of these cases, it always ends up coming back around on somebody in

39:50.020 --> 39:53.740
the court team, ironically, or not, I guess.

39:53.740 --> 39:55.100
I'm sorry, my head is spinning.

39:55.100 --> 40:02.500
So okay, so basically, the problem is my team allegedly found out that somebody did somebody

40:02.500 --> 40:07.940
did something that is against their code of conduct, they believe.

40:07.940 --> 40:14.020
They went to the core team because this person was a member of said core team and said, I'm

40:14.020 --> 40:15.420
going to make up a name here.

40:15.420 --> 40:18.620
Yo, dog, Steve Jobs over here did something bad.

40:18.620 --> 40:22.780
You need to like throw him out or like chastise him in some way.

40:22.780 --> 40:26.740
And the core team was like, um, no, go back to your little cave.

40:26.740 --> 40:30.780
I mean, so is this like when like the cops arrest somebody and the DA is just like, no,

40:30.780 --> 40:31.780
I'm not prosecuting it.

40:31.780 --> 40:32.780
I don't care.

40:32.780 --> 40:33.860
That's what it sounds like to me.

40:33.860 --> 40:40.380
I think and you know, the rust team has really always played kind of politics on this stuff.

40:40.380 --> 40:48.260
Earlier this year, there was a lot of hoopla around Amazon's influence over the Rust Foundation.

40:48.260 --> 40:52.780
And an individual named Steve came forward and outlined his concerns.

40:52.780 --> 40:54.280
And it just got buried.

40:54.280 --> 40:58.460
And there was never really any information released by the foundation.

40:58.460 --> 41:02.540
The Rust Foundation has since chosen an executive director.

41:02.540 --> 41:05.540
And you know, there doesn't seem to be any influence by Amazon, but that whole thing

41:05.540 --> 41:10.360
just got quietly put away and just, I don't know, like, there's been a couple other things

41:10.360 --> 41:14.480
I've seen here where I just wish they were a little more transparent about this stuff.

41:14.480 --> 41:17.220
And the problem is, is the moderation team shot first publicly now.

41:17.220 --> 41:20.480
And so it's like, what is the court team even going to say?

41:20.480 --> 41:21.660
What can they even say?

41:21.660 --> 41:22.660
Nothing.

41:22.660 --> 41:23.660
Just keep on trucking.

41:23.660 --> 41:24.660
Maybe.

41:24.660 --> 41:28.020
Since they didn't name the person, you don't have to worry about the Twitter rage, right?

41:28.020 --> 41:29.020
I would just say nothing.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.020
I don't know.

41:30.020 --> 41:32.200
You know, we may see someone step down.

41:32.200 --> 41:35.260
And that may be another indicator of what happened here.

41:35.260 --> 41:38.360
But it's a little unsettling if you're if you're thinking rust is going to be the future

41:38.360 --> 41:41.100
and you see politics being played like this, don't you think?

41:41.100 --> 41:44.980
Well, they seem to keep having these kind of problems, not necessarily moderation, but

41:44.980 --> 41:51.620
like weird stuff going on behind the scenes where it just I don't know, it seems like

41:51.620 --> 41:57.540
a lot of energy spending on stuff, you know, other than developing rust as a technology.

41:57.540 --> 41:58.540
Maybe that's unfair.

41:58.540 --> 42:01.780
Maybe that's like, I don't understand how modern open source works, which if I don't,

42:01.780 --> 42:02.780
I apologize.

42:02.780 --> 42:07.120
But and I think, too, we're still figuring out how to implement some of these code of

42:07.120 --> 42:09.280
conducts as well.

42:09.280 --> 42:13.540
You know, and I think there is a bit of that, like, who's held accountable to it?

42:13.540 --> 42:14.540
In what ways is it enforceable?

42:14.540 --> 42:18.060
Like, there's still kind of ironing that out.

42:18.060 --> 42:21.780
And I wouldn't be surprised if they're holding information behind there's probably some personal

42:21.780 --> 42:24.420
nature to the story as well, right?

42:24.420 --> 42:28.180
I'd like to know more, because it feels like rust is becoming more and more important.

42:28.180 --> 42:32.620
We're talking about, you know, building drivers for the Linux kernel in rust, system 76 is

42:32.620 --> 42:36.580
talking about building a desktop environment in rust, you're seeing rust using so many

42:36.580 --> 42:38.700
different applications and industries now.

42:38.700 --> 42:42.380
Like how much would this matter to any like any big organizations using rust?

42:42.380 --> 42:47.900
Because I can't imagine like, someone being like, Oh, no, you know, the moderators are

42:47.900 --> 42:48.900
mad.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.300
Well, now we're not going to use rust, right?

42:50.300 --> 42:53.420
No, especially when Bezos is sending, you know, penis pics to people.

42:53.420 --> 42:55.180
I mean, I just can't see it.

42:55.180 --> 42:59.780
I think what it does is it reduces confidence in the organization.

42:59.780 --> 43:02.220
And that's why it's concerning.

43:02.220 --> 43:06.420
But you're right, it's not this kind of stuff isn't going to impact anybody who's out there

43:06.420 --> 43:08.460
working in rust, really.

43:08.460 --> 43:11.020
But it's a big deal for an entire team.

43:11.020 --> 43:14.140
That's what makes me think there's something, you know, to this, there's some fire to the

43:14.140 --> 43:15.140
smoke.

43:15.140 --> 43:19.100
Listen, I'm sure Reddit or Hacker News, the detectives are on the case.

43:19.100 --> 43:20.100
Suss it out.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.100
Yeah.

43:21.100 --> 43:22.100
So true.

43:22.100 --> 43:24.300
They totally are, right?

43:24.300 --> 43:28.740
I'm sure it just comes down to a good old fashioned human power struggle, like it always

43:28.740 --> 43:30.860
does of some form, I suppose.

43:30.860 --> 43:31.860
Wow.

43:31.860 --> 43:35.360
Well, I want to say thank you to our members, you guys make this show possible.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.020
Not only that, but you know what else?

43:37.020 --> 43:38.020
Hold on.

43:38.020 --> 43:39.020
I got something special for us.

43:39.020 --> 43:40.020
Here you go.

43:40.020 --> 43:41.020
You do this for us, right?

43:41.020 --> 43:43.100
Help us pay for Drew's fine, fine skills.

43:43.100 --> 43:44.100
Yep.

43:44.100 --> 43:45.860
You help us pay for Drew's fine, fine skills right there.

43:45.860 --> 43:50.140
Plus, you get access to the code of the report and you get a limited ad feed, which may have

43:50.140 --> 43:53.860
some tweaks coming up in the near term, but you're going to want to get it on now.

43:53.860 --> 43:56.740
You can get it all at CoderQA.co.
