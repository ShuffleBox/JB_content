00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 454 for February 21st, 2022.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,600
Hello friends and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,500
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,840
My name is Chris, and joining us at his backup podcast machine, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,480
Hey, hey, hey, I'm on an M1 today.

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,440
I can't believe you've never...

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
That's a good little rhyme.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
There you go.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
Okay.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
What happened?

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
I know you had some problems this morning.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,160
This is a backup machine.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,500
This is a backup machine.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,920
I've been using the Thaleo again.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,520
I don't even think we really talked about that.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,880
It's a power machine.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
It's been glorious.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,080
Yeah, as they are.

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,560
And I naively went into the pop shop and it's like, you have updates and I'm like, sure.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
I love updates.

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Let's do it.

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Yeah, no.

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,680
Totally broke my Wi-Fi.

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,880
You're using Wi-Fi on the Thaleo?

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,440
The router is on the other side of the house.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
I feel you.

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
I don't have Ethernet and Lady Jeeps.

28
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,520
I only have Wi-Fi, so I know how that goes.

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,760
Yeah, and it's very evil because if I go into recovery mode and you can run what is effectively

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,960
a live image off the partition, it's fine.

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,280
Oh, so it's definitely something in that update, you think?

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,280
Yeah, it's one of the drivers or some firmware or some nonsense like that that they batch.

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,000
We love System76, but you really like you can't have that be a thing that through the

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,200
gooey pop shop can break your Wi-Fi.

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Yeah, I wonder.

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,600
I wish there was something I could do to help you troubleshoot it, too, because I don't

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,280
have any ideas for you.

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
That's tricky.

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,720
Yeah, I've been looking at things and it is a common problem-ish.

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,240
There's some folks on the Mint and Minjero, actually it was the Arch forms, of course,

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,760
because of course it is.

42
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,200
The solutions were all insane.

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,760
I tried each and every one of them and they all failed, so then I got desperate.

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,720
I said, well, there's this little refresh my install thing for Pop OS.

45
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,480
Surely that just resets all the firmware to whatever was on the 2110 disk, right?

46
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,320
No, just the OS, right?

47
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,880
But not the firmwares.

48
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,040
Not the firmwares, not the drivers, no.

49
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,640
So I lost all my data, yay.

50
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,760
I still don't have working Wi-Fi and the solution that seems obvious is just reinstall 2110,

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,520
but then at some point I'm going to have to do like an apt upgrade, right?

52
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,920
Or I'm going to make a mistake and click this thing in the pop shop because you want some

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,480
of the updates.

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,000
Surely you want the new Firefox and I'm going to break my Wi-Fi again.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,960
I have to say, just recently I had a friend who had their display borked after an update

56
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,440
in Pop OS.

57
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,360
I'd be willing to bet you in both cases, it's not actually like a Pop OS thing per se, but

58
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
apt.

59
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,120
Something went wrong with apt because any time I've actually ever had an Ubuntu based

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,400
system break badly, it's been something didn't install right or a post install script didn't

61
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,920
run correctly or a package didn't get configured properly because something else didn't happen

62
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,660
and I love apt.

63
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,520
It made me switch away from Red Hat and I will always be grateful because my systems

64
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,140
are so much easier to maintain with apt.

65
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,560
Back in the day you had to manually resolve RPM dependencies, it was brutal.

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,760
So I really truly do love apt, but I feel like it's gotten fragile and brittle and these

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,960
are the kinds of things like, for example, and I'm not trying to make this a Fedora versus

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,880
Ubuntu thing, but DNF, the package manager for Fedora, does a dry run before it actually

69
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,240
installs stuff.

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,800
And so if something's going to break, it breaks in that dry run.

71
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
What a brilliant idea.

72
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Right.

73
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,480
Yeah, that would be great.

74
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,360
So I have suspicions.

75
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,800
I know there are lots of reasons to update the point versions of your kernel.

76
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,360
I'm pretty sure that's what happened here though, because one of them I saw the list

77
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,880
was like, and it was just like a point rev of the Linux kernel headers or whatever.

78
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,960
But yeah, that's probably what broke it.

79
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Yeah, I could see that.

80
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,240
I could see the recovery environment would be using an older version of the kernel.

81
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,960
There is one thing I didn't try from the Wizards of Arc, because I am not screwing with my

82
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:20,020
router to accommodate what I consider a software bug on either Pop, Linux, or maybe it is aptitude.

83
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,720
I have one of those new fancy routers, I'll link it in the show notes sometime if I ever

84
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:31,960
figure out what I did with it, that does not broadcast the SSID for 5G and 2.4 hertz separately.

85
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,820
It gives you one network name and then it intelligently routes your traffic.

86
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,500
This has never been a problem.

87
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,780
But someone was saying that they got desperate and what they did was they forced the router

88
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,400
back into that manual mode.

89
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,560
I saw the speed test you were doing, shouldn't you even be getting better speeds on 2.4 gig

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
hertz Wi-Fi?

91
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,920
I mean, the maximum speed I was able to get was 14 megabits a second and that was like

92
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,960
maximum.

93
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
That's a bummer, man.

94
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,680
Well, keep us posted.

95
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,520
I was going to open the show with, once again, acknowledging the fact that I openly stalk

96
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,640
you on Twitter and I saw some really big news this week.

97
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
So I got two reactions.

98
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,760
I mean, first, I'm very excited for you.

99
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,560
Second reaction is I'm just a little confused.

100
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
You're confused?

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,920
Well, nobody came to me for permission.

102
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,080
Yes, I got engaged and I guess I didn't pass by.

103
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,760
I forgot in that JP contracting agreement there was that clause, wasn't there?

104
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,000
My blessing was required.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't understand.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't understand.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,440
I mean, we're podcast married.

108
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
True.

109
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,920
Does anybody else know this relationship?

110
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,480
That's a lot for me.

111
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,040
And I find out on Twitter.

112
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
You knew.

113
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
You knew because I had...

114
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Yes, I got engaged.

115
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Nice.

116
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
She's a good woman.

117
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,760
Although, in the second part of that tweet was to convince her to run Linux, today's

118
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,960
showing did not inspire too much confidence.

119
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Oh, man.

120
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,840
That's so embarrassing when that happens.

121
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,120
That is the worst.

122
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Well, congratulations.

123
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Thank you.

124
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Thank you.

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,720
I assume we'll probably just take care of the blessing thing later.

126
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
We'll talk about it.

127
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
That's fine.

128
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
We'll talk about it.

129
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Ouch.

130
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
All right.

131
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
We did get some great feedback this week.

132
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,680
Daryl from South Africa says that, I also had troubles with my Nissan radio.

133
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,520
I couldn't figure out why my Nissan car system kept rebooting when listening to podcasts.

134
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,000
And then I realized it was only when I played the 99% Invisible podcast.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm guessing that the percent sign is not sanitized and bugged out of the system.

136
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
So it's not just the Mazdas.

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,440
The Nissans as well suffered from that problem, referring to something we talked about last

138
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
week.

139
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
All right.

140
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
But this one came in.

141
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
This is a problem we've never solved before.

142
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
And Josh writes in.

143
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,000
He says, hey, Coder Crew, I have a conundrum that I hope you'll have a solution for.

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,420
I don't know about you, but during the winter, my hands get really cold when I'm working.

145
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,420
And it's just my hands.

146
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,280
If I get a space heater, it gets everything too hot.

147
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,320
And I can't really type with gloves on.

148
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,360
Do you guys have a solution for cold hands?

149
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,760
And you know what?

150
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,240
First of all, I want to put this in the show because I bet some people in the audience

151
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,640
have some solutions.

152
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,360
But I actually went down the rabbit hole and found a few products for Josh.

153
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
I don't know.

154
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
You probably don't have this problem in Florida.

155
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,120
This is probably not something you worry about.

156
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
Yeah, not really.

157
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
No.

158
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
You bastard.

159
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Alligator hands.

160
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Snake in the bathroom.

161
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Yeah.

162
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
All those.

163
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Those are problems.

164
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Okay.

165
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Yeah.

166
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
All right.

167
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Fair.

168
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
So the number one is I know he said Josh said he didn't want a space heater.

169
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,960
I am going to link to a five hundred watt ceramic small space personal mini heater.

170
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
This thing is so great.

171
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
I have one of these.

172
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,920
I bought it back in October of twenty nineteen and it just does a real small radius.

173
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,120
That's one thing to consider.

174
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,560
But but Josh, I got the real solution for you here.

175
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,600
And of course, this is a product.

176
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,520
It's a warm desk pad.

177
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,480
You know, those giant mouse pads that are such a thing now.

178
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, some brilliant entrepreneurs have created one that is heated.

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,680
So the space right where your hands can rest by your keyboard can be warmed.

180
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,880
And of course, it'll warm the keyboard a little bit as well.

181
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,580
And it's also a mouse pad.

182
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,740
So it's a ginormous heated mouse pad for your desk.

183
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,300
Also it says don't wrap it around your body.

184
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,300
Just put it on your desk.

185
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,300
It's thirty one by thirteen inches.

186
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
So that's pretty neat.

187
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
And you know what?

188
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,540
It's like twenty two bucks after tax.

189
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,120
That's not bad for something like that.

190
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
That's really good.

191
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Yeah.

192
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
All right.

193
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Coder dot show slash contact.

194
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
All right.

195
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,120
But now here is our tough question of the week.

196
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,240
I think we're going to have to chew on this one for a minute.

197
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,120
Andrew writes, and he said, I've been listening to Coder for years and I've come to value

198
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,920
your opinions about technology in the industry.

199
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,840
Recently my doctor told me I may lose my eyesight and I have been reading about technical solutions

200
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,400
to my vision problems.

201
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,400
I came across this article in the IEEE Spectrum yesterday and I wanted your thoughts on how

202
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:55,240
medical implant makers should support devices when they go out of business.

203
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,720
And so I took a look at this article, Mike, and they've got like a story in here about

204
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,220
three patients and there's actually like 350 people that are affected by this.

205
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,120
But these three, they focus on three patients and they have these second sight implants

206
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,920
in their eyes that give them sight.

207
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,720
And it's totally changed their life.

208
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,040
But the company in one case is like being sold, the other one's focusing on a new vision

209
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,560
and discontinuing support.

210
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,520
Like in the cases that they talk about in this article, like the companies are either

211
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,400
just moving on or have been sold and they're no longer supporting that.

212
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,380
And like one problem, a broken wire, a loose connection, the thing's out forever.

213
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,960
And to add injury to insult, a defunct system in the eye could cause medical complications,

214
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:46,520
interferes with procedures like MRI scans, and is painful and expensive to remove.

215
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,960
But the company is no longer supporting it.

216
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,720
And this is a huge topic, but it just seems like obvious this is a direction we're going

217
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
to go in.

218
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,080
Your good buddy Elon Musk is working on a brain implant so you can code even better.

219
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,560
So you can always be in the zone.

220
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,080
And Andrew's looking at options and thinking, well, how do I pick something?

221
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,520
How do I even navigate this?

222
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,000
And I'm struggling to even come up with some basic answers for him.

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,160
Yeah, I don't know.

224
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,160
That's a real tough one.

225
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,520
Ooh, that is a tough one.

226
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,800
Yeah, I don't even know, see, it's an area I don't know too much about.

227
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,280
Isn't there some kind of law that those kind of things have to be supported for the lifetime

228
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
of the device itself?

229
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,080
I mean, I don't think so.

230
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,820
You know, I think of Karen Sandler, who works for the Software Freedom Conservancy.

231
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,080
And she always tells the story about trying to get just the information on the pacemaker

232
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,080
that she had to get installed at a young age.

233
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,000
And just trying to even just talk to the medical industry about why a patient might want to

234
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,480
have access to this information.

235
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,600
And she views it as a free software issue.

236
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,920
And I kind of agree with her.

237
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,720
I think she makes a pretty good case for it.

238
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, yeah, for sure.

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,080
Something you're putting in your body.

240
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:06,580
I can't think of a more, frankly, intimate device that you would want to know exactly

241
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,400
how it works and what's the deal, what's the life expectancy.

242
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,160
I also think of diabetics, who have pumps or measurement tools, and all of those are

243
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,720
proprietary commercial products that connect back to a proprietary iPhone app or Android

244
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,400
app.

245
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,120
And while the grass is green, and you know, everybody's on board, and they're paying developers

246
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,440
to develop the app and support it, like, great, it works.

247
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,280
But this is something you need for your entire life.

248
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,920
And what if one day those things go away?

249
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,840
I think that's something we have to think a lot about, because my gut tells me, we as

250
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:49,960
a society will rush into this, especially in competitive areas.

251
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,680
You know, if you could get an implant in your brainstem, and you could learn kung fu in,

252
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,120
if you can learn kung fu in like 15 seconds, would you seriously not be tempted by that?

253
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:07,640
And if, you know, replace kung fu with anything, you know, what if tomorrow, you could somehow

254
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,920
learn everything you needed to know about rust, that you could learn practically, that

255
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,340
you don't learn by just doing?

256
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:20,720
You could just plug in tomorrow, and be a technical rust expert.

257
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,440
How could you say no to that?

258
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,940
We're gonna rush into this like crazy.

259
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,740
I feel like you definitely want to say no to that, right?

260
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,900
I'm sorry, I just, it's funny, because we've talked about in the show, I have a heart condition,

261
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,800
and they keep trying to build better modified hearts, right?

262
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,320
And to their credit, the doctors doing this are, I mean, they're genuine innovation.

263
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,600
But the last few they've done, the, what's almost all men, the men they put them in have,

264
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,880
you know, they're fine, they're fine, they're fine, and then they just drop.

265
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,840
Because oh, there's some unforeseen interaction between like, giving you this, it was in France,

266
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,540
they built like a synthetic heart.

267
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,200
And turns out, I forgot what killed him, it was like some kind of a weird electrical thing,

268
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,880
he couldn't be around, but no one knew that, and he just died, right?

269
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,080
I can't imagine putting something like you're saying into my brainstem, just because I want

270
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
my Wi-Fi to work.

271
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:24,120
I mean, because I want to learn Rust, and then maybe later, will I be unable, do you

272
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
know what I mean?

273
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,980
Will there be some weird interaction with some external force, or even an internal biological

274
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,540
change in me, that then causes that implant or that chip to start malfunctioning?

275
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,560
Or an injury, a car accident, you know, you hit that point.

276
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Anything, right?

277
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,240
I forbid, you know, I'm the victim of a crime, and someone assaults me and hits me the wrong

278
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
way, right?

279
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,160
Or realistically, you know, Elon goes to Mars to become the king, his implant company closes

280
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,680
up shop because of the lag time, and then you're left with an unsupported brainstem

281
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
implant.

282
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,400
Right, and it runs apt, and then you get two conflicting implants, and you just die.

283
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,320
I mean, I don't know, I feel like, I almost feel, okay, the law doesn't exist, somebody's

284
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
DMing me.

285
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,640
But like, maybe there should be a law that says, for these products, you by law have

286
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,480
to say how long you're going to support it.

287
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,400
You know, these things exist, right, bonding, right, like a bound insurance policy, that

288
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,360
if your company goes out of business, well, that insurance pays out to all the patients

289
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,520
who've gotten this, because I would be so afraid of any of these new things.

290
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,840
Even like mergers and acquisitions, right?

291
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,800
Let's say that like, evil pharma company just buys out the little company that does your

292
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
implant.

293
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,080
If you've seen Repo, the genetic opera, it's bad.

294
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,640
I mean, I just, I know that's dystopia, but best of luck to the writer.

295
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,520
Well, if we have time, speaking of dystopia, if we have time, I want to tell you about

296
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,960
my weekend in the metaverse, but we'll see if we get there.

297
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
We'll see.

298
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,880
Oh my God, why would you do that to yourself?

299
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
I had to try it out.

300
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,000
I had, I was gifted an Oculus, I had to try it out.

301
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,880
Would you like to spend a weekend in Leavenworth too?

302
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
It's probably better.

303
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,320
You know, Leavenworth is a wonderful little town.

304
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,440
If you're ever going to make it to the Pacific Northwest, it's a wonderful little town, but

305
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
you better...

306
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,320
Well, if I ever make it to the Pacific Northwest, that's probably where.

307
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,640
It's a Bavarian themed town in the hills.

308
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,000
It's pretty adorable, actually.

309
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,320
In the winter, it's sort of perfect.

310
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,880
Hey, before we go on, I just want to give a special shout out to the No Agenda program.

311
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,920
The remix we played for your video game intro, we were told by a listener on Twitter, is

312
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,160
from their show, and that checks out.

313
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,240
They have an amazing community who is producing all kinds of jingles and whatnot for them

314
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,520
all the time.

315
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,720
We don't need to play it because it, you know, it's got the swear words and whatnot, but

316
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,840
we wanted to give them a shout out because that's a fun jingle and it made Mike's day.

317
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
That's what really matters.

318
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,080
You know, I always see if I can make you smile with a soundboard clip.

319
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
What was that about again?

320
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,600
Is there a way we can glue this together?

321
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
I don't know.

322
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,120
I mean, yeah, it would be great, you know.

323
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,720
Maybe Joe could come in and give him an atta boy.

324
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Woo!

325
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,480
Linode.com slash coder.

326
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

327
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
show.

328
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,480
Linode is the developer's cloud.

329
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,280
They got 11 data centers worldwide and they have been hard at work for 19 years creating

330
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,200
the best experience to host your applications.

331
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,040
If you like to build it yourself from the ground up or you're ready to deploy a stack

332
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,080
that's going to get you set and going in minutes, they've got options for you.

333
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:26,240
I'm saying like server admin for 20 years or this is your first project, they've got

334
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,240
a route and a path for you and they've got the best customer support in the business.

335
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,320
That is the number one thing I hear from the audience.

336
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,680
Number two is the performance is incredible, but number one is the support.

337
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,640
I hear that like, you know, something blew up.

338
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,120
I did X, Y, Z. I had these questions.

339
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,980
I know they just rolled out these new PCI MVME storage.

340
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,280
Like how do I use that properly?

341
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,000
They answered those questions.

342
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,960
Linode nails it every single time.

343
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,440
The performance is incredible.

344
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
That's what I love about it.

345
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,080
That's what made me stick with it.

346
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,520
And now we use Linode for basically just about every bit of hosting we've built that is audience

347
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,360
facing and just about every little bit of hosting we've built that is internally facing

348
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,960
as well.

349
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,840
They really are just always making it better too.

350
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,740
So if you go try it for a little bit, you'll see what I'm talking about.

351
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,760
How the dashboard works, how the information you get when you glance at your system so

352
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,540
you get an idea of how it's doing overall, how they clearly explain what the backup state

353
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:24,520
is and how simple it is to take advantage of their API with their command line client

354
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,760
or Python libraries or you name it, they've got support for it.

355
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,920
So go get that $100 and really try it out.

356
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,960
Go build something and support the show, linode.com slash coder.

357
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,480
So today we find out that Chris Ladner has left the Swift core team.

358
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,760
He writes, to answer your question, the root cause of my decision to leave the core team

359
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,160
is a toxic environment in the meetings themselves.

360
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,920
The catalyst was a specific meeting last summer.

361
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,560
After being insulted and yelled at over a WebEx, not the first time and not just one

362
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,960
core team member, I decided to take a break.

363
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,680
I was able to get leadership to eventually discuss the situation with me last fall, but

364
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,920
after avoiding dealing with it, they made excuses and made it clear they weren't planning

365
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,420
to do anything about it.

366
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,720
As such, I decided not to return.

367
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,240
They reassure me that they want to, quote, make sure things are better for others in

368
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,640
the future based on what we've talked about, end quote.

369
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,840
And then the core team announced today that they are going to restructure the team's leadership

370
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,360
in the wake of this announcement.

371
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,220
But when you dig into it, it looks like Ladner has really been out since last summer.

372
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,480
And it's just everybody in the public is figuring it out now.

373
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480
What's your take?

374
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,120
You're more into the whole community like hippie stuff.

375
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:51,360
But what I know of Ladner is he seems like a pretty reasonable, level-headed, practical

376
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
person.

377
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,960
However, this comes on pretty hot, you know, when you start throwing around toxic environment

378
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,720
and that you were getting yelled at, those are some strong accusations.

379
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,680
And I hope that's not true because nobody should be getting yelled at in a work environment.

380
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,440
But I wish we knew both sides of this story in particular because I can't help but feel

381
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,440
in the back of my mind that rockstar mentality still is a thing.

382
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Somebody can get big enough where they can be like, I'm not getting the respect I deserve.

383
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,480
I've said this is the way it is and this is the way it is and you're fighting, why are

384
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
you arguing with me?

385
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,260
You know, and that can also be their perspective sometimes and they don't necessarily realize

386
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,520
that's the standpoint they're coming from.

387
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,960
And that can also add friction in a team meeting.

388
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,640
So it's hard to really know what's going on here.

389
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,480
I don't think it's the end of the day for Swift.

390
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,800
I think Swift is going to be just fine.

391
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,880
You know, I think it's interesting that we're getting the story very shortly after we got

392
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,960
some more about the Rust brouhaha.

393
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,000
And it definitely seems like these modes of community management and engagement are, I

394
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,400
don't want to say like being a problem, I think they're changing somehow, right?

395
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,280
I mean, if you want to laugh, read the old Linux mailing list.

396
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,120
It's a woo!

397
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:12,420
Things get heated or honestly old Linux message boards and somebody, some poor bastard would

398
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,160
come in with a username that had Mike in it and say he was running Mint and people would

399
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
be mean to him.

400
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,020
I'm not bitter.

401
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,160
My wife, I worked back then.

402
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Back then?

403
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,920
Back in my day, you just turned the damn thing on and put in the WEP key.

404
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
I don't know.

405
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:34,520
I see this is where I have very little patience for a lot of the like political community

406
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
stuff.

407
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,320
Are we seeing more of this or is it just my perception of being like cranky and old and

408
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
being a little?

409
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,600
I think everyone is cooked.

410
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Okay.

411
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,000
I think, you know, you're seeing more stories about fights on airplanes.

412
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,520
You're seeing more stories about community fights.

413
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,800
It's just everyone's fried from the last couple of years is what my sense of it is.

414
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,760
I also, reading through all of this, got the sense that Ladner has been concerned about

415
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,360
the technical direction of SWIT for a little bit.

416
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,160
And so you could see how that also adds some friction to the situation.

417
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,720
And I also wonder if the people yelling at him were Apple employees and what Apple's

418
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,600
policy is around that kind of stuff.

419
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,440
I mean, I would imagine if we were to draw a Venn diagram, you know, important people

420
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,160
in the SWIFT projects, people employed by Apple who work on the SWIFT project is probably,

421
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,280
you know, there's a big intersection there, I would assume.

422
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,760
The part that does ring true to his overall point here is that there was yelling going

423
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
on.

424
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
I bet that is true.

425
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,920
Yeah, that's probably a sign it's time to check out, get out, you know, he doesn't need

426
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
to stick around for that.

427
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,960
Also, you got to remember the initial pitch for SWIFT was it was going to be like scale

428
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,620
from scripting to systems development.

429
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,440
That is not a easy nut to crack.

430
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,280
Well, the thing that got you all hot and bothered this week is that Microsoft is apparently

431
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:58,600
going to require future versions of Windows 11 Pro to have a Microsoft account, even at

432
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
setup.

433
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,360
This is something they started doing with Windows like home, and now in the newer versions

434
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,000
of Windows 11, it's still in the like early dev channel.

435
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,080
They've made some improvements, some UI changes, some do not disturb improvements.

436
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:22,560
But the big new thing is that you can no longer create a local user account for even Windows

437
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,840
11 Pro.

438
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,520
You'll have to use a Microsoft account, you'll have to have an internet connection while

439
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,000
you're setting the computer up.

440
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,800
Now, obviously, Microsoft could change this.

441
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,360
Yeah, this also means though, this is where this kind of grinds my gears to quote Peter

442
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,880
Griffith.

443
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:45,120
If you are doing what I frequently do, which is purchase Surface Go or Surface tablets,

444
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,800
and just not configure them with user accounts to give to customers as like, you know, this

445
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,360
is your kiosk, that is now not really possible.

446
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,260
You have to buy the special license.

447
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,000
It's funny, like I saw the comments on this I read as Oh, so you're screwing little companies

448
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,080
who like, basically just code to Windows because every literally the nice thing about Windows

449
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,920
is there any random piece of crap I buy on AliExpress for a like dongle or whatever,

450
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,560
almost certainly has a very shoddy, but existing Windows driver.

451
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,040
For those who don't know, AliExpress is like, it's like a Chinese Walmart, but they sell

452
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
lots of parts.

453
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
Is that fair?

454
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,680
Or Chinese Amazon, I should say?

455
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,280
Yeah, Amazon and Walmart and one maybe, and also eBay, a little bit of an eBay.

456
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
A little bit of an eBay.

457
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
It's weird.

458
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,960
You can buy like, but you can buy like a random just like, I plug this in and it does NFC

459
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
reading, right?

460
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,400
Yeah, yeah, lots of weird random components and parts and gadgets.

461
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,520
And one of the nice things is, you know, these manufacturers all assume that you're running

462
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Windows.

463
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,800
A lot of them also support some variants of Linux.

464
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,520
And that just become a whole of a hell of a lot less really cost effective, right?

465
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I don't like it.

466
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,920
I think you should be able to own your device.

467
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Well, yeah.

468
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,040
And what about those of us that have young kids?

469
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,840
Like, I mean, my kids are not using Windows.

470
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,120
But if they were, I would not want my seven year old daughter to need a Microsoft account.

471
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,480
I don't want to log her into my Microsoft account.

472
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Local accounts are what I would always use for my kids.

473
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,800
I have that exact problem.

474
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,700
My son wants to play Xbox.

475
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,080
And it's like one thing for him to play Minecraft or Plants vs Zombies, right?

476
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
I don't care.

477
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,120
Go ahead.

478
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,400
Like when he's logged in as me, he's me, right?

479
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,960
He can just like go in and do stuff.

480
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,320
So if you were going to bet on this, do you think Microsoft tweaks this?

481
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,960
I mean, they already do it for home.

482
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,640
So it's I mean, that's the part that makes me think this might be a lock.

483
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,640
I think what they'll do is what they tend to do have like some super duper enterprise

484
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,800
plan where you go through a salesman, right?

485
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,760
And you can just get around this.

486
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,320
Yeah, I can think if you buy some of the business versions of Windows like already, yeah, but

487
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
they cost more money.

488
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,160
I mean, I was just dunking on I wasn't dunking, but I'm a little irritated with the whole

489
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,200
Wi-Fi problem I'm having.

490
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,160
But this is why I'm still super bullish on Linux because, you know, if let's just say

491
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,720
system 76 pulls some nonsense and it's like, oh, you have to have a pop account.

492
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,960
Please never even make that a thing.

493
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Just don't.

494
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
You didn't hear that, Carl.

495
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Leave it alone.

496
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,040
I could be like, all right, screw you.

497
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,280
I'm putting on my fedora with Chris, right?

498
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,440
We're going fedora land.

499
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
Let's go.

500
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Ha, ha.

501
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,760
And you know, if you're doing embedded devices, there is only one true base OS.

502
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
It's called Debian.

503
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
It's great.

504
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,080
And also, if it's a server, you could use SUSE.

505
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,160
I like SUSE.

506
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
I have a plushie.

507
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,520
You know, my take on this, and this has been my take now for a very, very, very long time

508
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,440
is I have always found when I worked in the industry professionally and looking at it

509
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:45,080
now as a consumer, I have always found the multiple versions of Windows to be ridiculously

510
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,200
stupid and annoying because we all know it's normalized now.

511
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
It's the same thing.

512
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
They just unlock the features.

513
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Yep.

514
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,600
It's stupid, arbitrary, marketing dividing lines that they've created to productize a

515
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,240
lineup to make a good, better, best type lineup.

516
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,000
And it's so lame.

517
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,800
One of the things I'm really glad that Apple dropped years ago is that stupid, lame pretense.

518
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,240
And I wish there was just Windows.

519
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,280
You could have pre-setup modes or some stupid crap like that because you know they'd have

520
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
to have that.

521
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,000
But I've always found that really annoying.

522
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,780
It feels something like it's out of the 80s or 90s.

523
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:29,180
It definitely absolutely is something that the biz exec sales type people come up with.

524
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,720
It's not something the engineers are fighting for.

525
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,520
And then they are, of course, from above, dictating from a sales perspective to the

526
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,200
engineering team what features get locked up and how and they have to create all of

527
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,980
that and make all of it possible.

528
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,740
And so it just creates work that's even outside the scope of just working on the core OS features

529
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,220
and bugs.

530
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,200
It's so lame.

531
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,200
And it's a way to price gouge consumers for something that costs them the same amount

532
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
to make.

533
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,560
I mean, it is what it is and Microsoft knows better than I do, but I've always found that

534
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,180
such a distasteful aspect of Windows.

535
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:13,120
And now they're really rubbing it in your face with this stuff because now you've got

536
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,960
to buy an even more expensive version of something that's exactly the same thing as the cheaper

537
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,640
version but just doesn't have this absolutely lame limitation.

538
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,200
I wonder if maybe they're not just trying to squeeze money out of Windows.

539
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,540
Maybe this is everybody's a services company now, right?

540
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,120
Nobody wants to just like make the thing and sell it to you.

541
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Yeah.

542
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
You know what?

543
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,040
Watch them in two years start bragging about how many, you know, Microsoft accounts, active

544
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,400
Microsoft accounts they have.

545
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
I bet that's what it is.

546
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Cause it isn't isn't.

547
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Yeah.

548
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,660
Cause my Xbox account is just my personal email.

549
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,280
So that is a Microsoft account.

550
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,360
If they can get you to get that account created and set up at go when you're installing the

551
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,500
PC, then you're already logged into the store, man.

552
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,400
You're already one step closer.

553
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,840
That little friction point's been removed.

554
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,880
Wait, is it going to be like Chrome where it can't understand that I have two versions

555
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
of me?

556
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
One's my personal email.

557
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,600
One's my, the mad botter one that has all the licenses.

558
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Oh God.

559
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Oh, just no, just no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

560
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
no accounts.

576
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,240
So Coinbase has kind of just said the quiet part out loud about the App Store that really

577
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,640
just puts it all in perspective.

578
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:32,200
Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong wrote on February 4th, quote, for any app to be listed in Apple

579
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,600
and Google's app stores, it needs to play by the rules of those two companies.

580
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:44,120
He goes on to say, our approach is to be free speech supporters, but not free speech martyrs.

581
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,480
And so he's essentially saying if a critical partner such as Apple or Google objects to

582
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,720
something and requires its removal, they won't even fight it, they just remove the feature

583
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,560
and they don't bother engaging with that aspect of the business as a company.

584
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,840
They just say, all right, we wanted to try that thing.

585
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,020
Apple has told us no, so Coinbase isn't getting into that business.

586
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:11,840
That's the level of power Apple has now as a gatekeeper, as queen of the mobile land.

587
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,760
Well, the alternative is you get beheaded by the queen, ala Alice in Wonderland.

588
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,560
So this is dark in a few ways to me.

589
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,960
Coinbase represents a nascent business and a nascent industry that is developing very,

590
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,240
very rapidly and is extremely competitive.

591
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:35,260
The exchange aspect of the cryptocurrency market is the most competitive element of

592
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,320
the market, I would imagine.

593
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,180
And other exchanges are constantly adding features.

594
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,440
And some of them give zero about Apple.

595
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,960
And so some of them do.

596
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,280
And what some of them have done have just created simplified versions of their exchange

597
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,920
that they release as an app for the iOS app store.

598
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,500
And then if you want the full thing, you go to the web page.

599
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,600
But Coinbase has kind of just gone the opposite route and just said, no, we're not even really

600
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,780
concerned about it as an entire business objective if we can't ship it through the app store.

601
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,260
That to me is almost a chilling effect on a nascent industry.

602
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:14,520
It's concerning because Coinbase is the largest in the US in this industry.

603
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,280
And if they're essentially cow towing, you can imagine this is an industry wide problem.

604
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,880
Not to say this is a good thing, but what would you have them do that doesn't destroy

605
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
their business?

606
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,640
You're stuck with the app store rules.

607
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,640
You're stuck.

608
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,360
If you're the CEO of Coinbase, you have investors.

609
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,080
And I know, you know, we can listen to Scott Galloway and Kara Swisher, who are usually

610
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,560
right about this, that a lot of the founders basically control their boards.

611
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,220
But I don't think any founder can walk into the board and be like, all right, guys, here's

612
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,220
the plan.

613
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,760
We're going to piss off Apple and they're going to throw us off the app store.

614
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
All right.

615
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
Tim Sweeney aside.

616
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
Yeah.

617
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
It's a it's a rare thing.

618
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
You're right.

619
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Well, that just proves the point.

620
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
Yeah.

621
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,080
So it's kind of like in the board would say, no vote of no confidence.

622
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,360
Bye, buddy.

623
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,720
You have to if I mean, if I was making a piece of consumer software, I wouldn't even consider

624
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,360
not putting it on iOS.

625
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,640
I suppose it doesn't surprise us.

626
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,440
But I think it's noteworthy because it is somebody saying out loud what we've been what

627
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,040
we've really been speculating for a while and they're just kind of outwardly admitting

628
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,480
it and they're just kind of admitting it as well.

629
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,960
This is the cost of doing business in this segment.

630
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
That's remarkable.

631
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,740
And it makes me wonder if in 20 years we'll look back or even 10 years because things

632
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
change pretty quick.

633
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:34,880
We look back and we realize just how Google and Apple shaped the worlds that we lived

634
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,640
in, how they really controlled what comes to market and what doesn't from not just a

635
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,760
software standpoint, but from a chip and silicon standpoint to all of it.

636
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
Right.

637
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:52,040
So they are setting the pace from everything from car infotainment systems to wearables.

638
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,880
And it's remarkable the controlling grip that they have.

639
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,880
And I think this just demonstrated it to me.

640
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,040
And meanwhile, everybody's freaking out about Facebook, you know, and they're like this

641
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
little punk kid.

642
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
So, OK.

643
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
How are you feeling?

644
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
I'm all right.

645
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,840
I mean, it's a little boring.

646
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,080
You know, it's could use a little more transport effects and and popcorn.

647
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,760
So what did you do in Metaverse?

648
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,800
I was really I've been thinking about getting an Oculus Quest recently because I know, I

649
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
know, I know.

650
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,240
But I just don't I hate I hate to, you know, run my mouth and not have any idea what I'm

651
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,420
talking about.

652
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:34,760
So a family member, close family member gifted one to me for my birthday, slightly used,

653
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,080
but in pretty great shape still reactivated my Facebook, I guess, we logged into my Facebook

654
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,040
account for like the first time in two years.

655
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,880
It was never gone, Chris, don't worry.

656
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
Set it all up.

657
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,800
And what really pushed it over into something I was actually actively interested in trying

658
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:56,220
is when I realized that they have these apps to build, like your ultimate virtual home

659
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,800
office that goes with you wherever you go.

660
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:06,520
And so you picture me right in Lady Joop's, the RV, I can sit up front in a seat and create

661
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,620
a beautiful working environment.

662
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:16,040
So what I have right now is a studio log cabin with beautiful wood paneling ceiling, panoramic

663
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,960
windows that are it's on top of a hill and down below me is a lake with fog and it's

664
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
often raining.

665
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:28,360
So there's raindrops coming down the window and I'm on a giant couch and I have a giant,

666
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,920
probably 120 inch screen above me, in front of me and two to my side.

667
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:39,280
And they are bringing in windows from my actual computer and I'm using my keyboard and mouse

668
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,240
and it's a pretty fun, nice, chill way to work.

669
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,680
All right, so you're sitting, you're in the front seat of Lady Joop's, you've got the

670
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
Oculus on, physically.

671
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,480
And I've got my computer up front with me and my keyboard and mouse is up there in this

672
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
spot.

673
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,960
Is it running some software on your computer?

674
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
Yes.

675
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,640
Is your computer still running Fedora?

676
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,840
You can use it with one monitor with Fedora and you can use it with multiple screens with

677
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
the Mac and Windows.

678
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,360
So wait, is it a monitor to virtual monitor situation?

679
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,760
Yeah, it creates virtual monitors in there and then it also brings in your primary screen.

680
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Huh.

681
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
What's the limitation on Linux?

682
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,440
Is it just they haven't done it yet?

683
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
Yeah, I don't know.

684
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,920
I think it's just maybe they just haven't developed it out.

685
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
It's still kind of new.

686
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,280
The app I'm using is called Immersed, but there are several of them, so there might

687
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,460
be other ones that have better support.

688
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,460
How does it look though?

689
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,460
Like you can't...

690
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,460
It works pretty good.

691
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,460
It looks pretty good.

692
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,320
The resolution of the actual Oculus itself could be better and that is something I'm

693
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,480
sure they'll do with the Oculus 3.

694
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,000
But I've used it so far for a couple of hours.

695
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,380
I would say I felt like I had more room, it just made me feel like I had more space.

696
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,040
And the other thing that's fascinating is then I brought it here to the studio, put

697
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,880
it on and I had like the same exact working environment.

698
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,480
I thought, oh, there's some efficiencies in creating one ultimate virtual office and then

699
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,200
bringing that with me.

700
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,960
The only limitation is it needs to be connected to a computer to bring in computer screens.

701
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,160
And if the Oculus was more powerful, you could, in theory, run those applications on the

702
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,880
Oculus directly.

703
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,240
And that's where I realized Apple's going.

704
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,760
That's why they're putting M1s in their headset and they're going to charge $2,000 and put

705
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,400
an 8K screen in there.

706
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,840
Because if you put a real beefy CPU in that thing and you up the resolution just a tiny

707
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,620
bit, it's there.

708
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,220
It's so close.

709
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,760
It's so close.

710
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,200
It's alarmingly close.

711
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,280
I did not expect it to be as polished as it was.

712
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:35,120
The UI to navigate the thing, the experiences, the apps around it, the Oculus app ecosystem.

713
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,280
I even found out there's a whole ecosystem called the side quest ecosystem where you

714
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,400
put the quest into developer mode and you can sideload a whole bunch of VR apps that

715
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,960
aren't in the official store.

716
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,040
It's impressive.

717
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,840
And you wouldn't even really know it's Android.

718
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,120
It's really well done.

719
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,400
And I could definitely see Apple executing on something like this.

720
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:04,280
And if they integrated this headset with Mac OS or with iPad OS, it would be fire.

721
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,180
It would be unbelievable.

722
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,880
It could be such a great, if I could put on the headset and essentially have my entire

723
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,640
computing environment, huge.

724
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,680
It was great.

725
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,580
And you can have giant screens.

726
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,800
You can have unlimited space.

727
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,940
And then I can have multiple rooms and you can bring other people in.

728
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,520
Oh, last thing, but this was also so great.

729
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:34,320
You can bring in a virtual web camera that shows up as a video device on your computer.

730
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,240
And you can join Zoom calls and whatnot from your virtual office as your virtual avatar.

731
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,840
And you can place the camera anywhere in the 360 degree space and participate in a Zoom

732
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,560
meeting from your virtual office.

733
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Okay.

734
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,040
So when they see you, are they seeing your avatar or are they...

735
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
Yeah.

736
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,640
Are they seeing your avatar chilling in your cool pad?

737
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,000
Does your avatar move with you?

738
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Yeah.

739
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,840
And it uses the microphone to move the lips when you talk.

740
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,360
The motion tracking is insanely precise.

741
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,860
The most precise I've ever experienced.

742
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,200
So every little nuance it's aware of.

743
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Okay.

744
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,480
So in theory, if I got one of these, we could do the show.

745
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,560
I could invite you into my chill pad or there's several...

746
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,540
This is one of the big areas is these social things.

747
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,360
One is called like big room or big screen or something like that.

748
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,560
You get a home theater that you can invite people into and they even provide some of

749
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,560
the streaming content.

750
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,660
So like last night I was watching Star Trek TNG in a virtual living room.

751
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,600
I could bring other people in and they could hang out at my couch and we could watch it

752
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,720
and we see each other in real time.

753
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,100
We talk and we're synchronized video playback.

754
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,100
It's pretty neat.

755
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,100
Oh man.

756
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,920
I might have to actually try this.

757
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,820
I'd say it's better than I expected with the caveat that I can still see they have room

758
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,820
to improve.

759
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,680
The battery life needs to be better.

760
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,680
I think it needs a little more horsepower, but it's surprisingly how well polished it

761
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,320
is and you can stream what people are seeing in VR to your phone or to your desktop.

762
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,920
I think it's just using like Chromecast or something.

763
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,740
So you can help people navigate it by watching on your phone.

764
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,580
Then you can tap a button on the app and it brings up the camera and you can do a side

765
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,320
by side capture of what they are seeing in VR and of course what your camera phone is

766
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,680
actually getting in real life and you can create a little side by side video inside

767
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,900
the Oculus app to capture the experience.

768
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,900
Pretty neat.

769
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,160
Or you can go full screen on their VR and see what they're seeing and you can even launch

770
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,160
some apps for them and change a few settings, which is great when you're demonstrating it

771
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
for people.

772
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,400
And you can play Resident Evil 4 because that game was on every platform apparently.

773
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,440
I got Quake 2 last night because of course.

774
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Did you really?

775
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,600
And I got motion sick like an old man.

776
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,320
It really, you move quick in Quake 2.

777
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,520
That was some twitchy first person shooting.

778
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,600
That was really something.

779
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,160
The YouTube VR is surprisingly good too because those are real life images.

780
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,280
So it's as high res as it gets.

781
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,880
This actually does some kind of cool crap.

782
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,960
I know.

783
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,000
After I've used it, I have so little doubt that Apple's working on one of these and that

784
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
it's probably not that far away and that I'm probably going to want it.

785
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,280
If they integrate it with the Mac or they integrate it with your phone or tablet where

786
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,840
you can bring those apps in, it's going to be huge.

787
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,200
Oh man.

788
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,900
Very excited because you don't need to buy a big monitor ever again.

789
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,280
You no longer need to buy multiple screens.

790
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,620
I don't need to even worry about a fancy office.

791
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:29,840
I could be sitting in a little podunk closet and put that thing on and feel like I am in

792
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,760
a beautiful wood cabin.

793
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
It's so awesome.

794
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
Vader Immortal pack.

795
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
Oh yeah.

796
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Yeah.

797
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
All right.

798
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,760
I'm buying one.

799
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
That's it.

800
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
That's what I'm going to do.

801
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
Here we go.

802
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Damn it.

803
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
Now I want to build something.

804
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,560
Give Apple 30 percent because you know theirs is going to be better.

805
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Oh yeah.

806
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,800
But it's going to be like two thousand dollars.

807
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,880
How much are people paying for GPUs right now?

808
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
Oh you're right.

809
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
You're right.

810
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
You can later too.

811
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,560
You can get a cable to connect it to your computer and you can actually do PC VR games

812
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
as well.

813
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
Oh wow.

814
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,160
But I actually think the charm of this thing is that it's totally enclosed like a like

815
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,440
a switch.

816
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,040
You know you don't need any computer.

817
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,040
I got it through a family member who got an Amazon refurbished so they got a refurbished

818
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,040
unit.

819
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,280
I bought them and they gave it to me for like a birthday discount for like 180 bucks.

820
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,560
But I was trying to talk West into it.

821
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,080
I found one on Amazon for 350 bucks and that seems like an outrageously great deal too

822
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,120
because when I was pricing it initially after all the accessories I was expecting to pay

823
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,160
like seven hundred dollars.

824
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
Yeah.

825
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,400
I mean there's a range of prices you can pay.

826
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,200
If you buy it directly you're going to pay more.

827
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,620
But if you buy it used.

828
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,360
So what accessories do you actually need?

829
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,000
There's all kinds of accessories but I just I picked up a case from Amazon.

830
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,160
I've got it from my dad.

831
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,760
So my dad had like covers for the joysticks or whatever they're called the little handle

832
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
things.

833
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,960
But I don't like those.

834
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,380
The thing that really strikes me about it is there is an impressive amount of technology

835
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,760
built in that little headset.

836
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,560
Like it is doing an incredible amount of things.

837
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,260
The Oculus team is at the top of their game.

838
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,640
It's really something and I think people have kind of passed over this because of the Facebook

839
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,320
thing because I admit that also caused me a lot of delay.

840
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,320
But getting past that because what I decided is like this is something I'm just exploring.

841
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,720
I don't think I'm going to go very deep into this Oculus ecosystem.

842
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,080
I don't expect to be buying like the Oculus 3 and the Oculus 4 maybe but I just don't

843
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,940
think this is going to be it for me.

844
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,200
But I wanted to see if the idea held up.

845
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,040
Well I suppose in part if you know if I had to pay seven hundred dollars I probably still

846
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,940
wouldn't have done it to be to be fair.

847
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,240
But because I could get it a discount and because I don't expect to go all in forever

848
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,320
I'm okay with the compromise of using Facebook for a little bit.

849
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,720
You know like to me it's sort of like the same thing of yeah I'm using Google I use

850
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,320
Apple and I got I got a Microsoft account.

851
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:50,160
It's just not ideal but it's the compromise I make and ultimately I imagine if Apple does

852
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,400
ship something that seems interesting and competitive probably end up getting it now.

853
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,320
Whereas before I probably would have considered mocking something like a headset that's two

854
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,320
thousand dollars.

855
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,920
Okay well add to cart you know what maybe next week I will tell you about my virtual

856
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,920
workspace.

857
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,160
Oh yeah check out the Immersed app.

858
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,480
Here's a few of them in there.

859
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,920
The games are pretty great.

860
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,920
Enjoy it.

861
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,000
Let me know how it goes.

862
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Let us all know.

863
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,080
And if you got any tips out there if you've got one coder dot show slash contact I tell

865
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,080
That was a whole fight.

866
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,080
Oh I bet.

867
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,160

Yeah the holodeck addiction definitely begins.

877
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,080
I had a hard time putting it down last night.

878
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,320
Call me Reginald Barkley.

879
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:08,360
Could you make your own like models for for the metaverse thing.

880
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,080
Here's what I think you can do because I've seen this on YouTube and if anybody out there

881
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,600
knows please let me know.

882
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,880
But I think you could use the frickin lidar scanner on your frickin iPhone to totally

883
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,080
capture an area create a 3D model and then somehow get that on the Oculus I've seen it

884
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,080
done on YouTube.

885
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,080
Well that sounds really good.

886
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,160
I realized recently like I'd like to capture the studio you know because I won't always

887
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,160
have the studio.

888
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,160
Yeah.

889
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,160
This has been a big part of my life.

890
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,880
I'd like to actually how rad would it be to be able to walk back in the studio in 20 years.

891
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,880
That would be very cool.

892
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,880
Yeah.

893
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,160
So if anybody knows how to capture that stuff let me know or anything else feedback thoughts

894
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,240
on the show responses to thought provoking emails Coder dot show slash contacts where

895
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,680
you do all that.

899
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,160
that app I'm using for my virtual office.

900
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,480
That's all over at Coder dot show slash for 54 it's real simple that way and if you'd

901
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,680
like to support the show that doesn't involve money you could just tell a friend someone

902
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,080
who'd be interested word of mouth is the best form of advertising for podcasts and last

903
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,200
but not least you can always send us a boost with a new podcast app that supports value

904
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,200
for value.

905
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,200
