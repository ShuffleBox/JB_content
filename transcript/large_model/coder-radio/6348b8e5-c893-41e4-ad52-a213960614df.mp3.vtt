00:00.000 --> 00:15.880
This is KOTORadio, episode 456, for March 7th, 2022.

00:15.880 --> 00:20.080
Hello good looking and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:20.080 --> 00:25.960
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.960 --> 00:30.520
My name is Chris, and joining me like the East Coast Maven he is, it's our host, Mr.

00:30.520 --> 00:31.520
Dominic.

00:31.520 --> 00:32.520
Hello, Mike.

00:32.520 --> 00:33.520
Hello, hello, hello.

00:33.520 --> 00:34.520
Hello.

00:34.520 --> 00:38.160
I join you a wrecked man, you know?

00:38.160 --> 00:44.160
I dabbled in the markets and boy have I been wrecked recently.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.040
Last night my son's Roblox account was hacked and they took everything.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.720
They took everything from the kid.

00:50.720 --> 00:54.480
He just recently got into that game because I have three kids, my daughter, my youngest

00:54.480 --> 00:55.920
likes it.

00:55.920 --> 00:59.080
And he was always like, oh no, Roblox, that's silly.

00:59.080 --> 01:03.560
And then something changed about a month ago and he got so into it that he just accumulated

01:03.560 --> 01:04.780
all this stuff.

01:04.780 --> 01:09.420
He even managed to like convince me to get him a subscription and he like became this

01:09.420 --> 01:13.160
trade king, like one of the top 100 players on the system that he was in.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.000
So he's just doing great.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.960
And then I'm sitting down to record last night and I get a text message, dad, my account

01:21.960 --> 01:22.960
just got hacked.

01:22.960 --> 01:30.000
I'm saying there's probably $60 worth of purchases in there now that are just gone.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
He's devastated.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.800
He built it all up, you know?

01:32.800 --> 01:38.280
He was like the big rapper with a posse handing out like items and pets to people, you know?

01:38.280 --> 01:40.720
There's no recovery mechanism?

01:40.720 --> 01:46.600
This is where it's like, as a dad, do I step in and like interface with the support?

01:46.600 --> 01:51.600
So what I did is I got him all the info and you know, and had him and his mom, they filled

01:51.600 --> 01:55.400
out like the support form and all of that, but then they're like, nope, sorry, nothing

01:55.400 --> 01:57.600
we're going to be able to do for you.

01:57.600 --> 02:01.800
And it just seems like what happened is I think he logged into some website that claimed

02:01.800 --> 02:06.380
to like connect to your account and they stole his credentials and then they just programmatically

02:06.380 --> 02:09.200
emptied his account, basically.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.020
The metaverse is rough, man.

02:11.020 --> 02:13.440
The rough streets of the metaverse.

02:13.440 --> 02:17.760
She like, my youngest, she springs into action because they like have some sort of like shared

02:17.760 --> 02:18.760
bank.

02:18.760 --> 02:23.720
Like she logs in on her iPad, brings up the bank and starts doing like an emergency transfer.

02:23.720 --> 02:28.840
It's like a rug pull in a crypto community, but you just see everybody scrambling.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.080
It's it was wild.

02:30.080 --> 02:33.680
So shall we expect Fisher coin and not by you, but by your children?

02:33.680 --> 02:37.200
So I mean, it seems like your daughter, well, I mean, they got to they got to make it up,

02:37.200 --> 02:38.200
right?

02:38.200 --> 02:39.200
They got to make it back somehow.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.760
She's like, as I say, your daughter seems like she knows what's up.

02:41.760 --> 02:42.760
I don't know.

02:42.760 --> 02:46.200
She's got an NFT if you want to buy it.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.520
Pretty crazy, pretty crazy stuff.

02:48.520 --> 02:52.440
You know, like I felt bad for him because in a way, it feels like getting your account

02:52.440 --> 02:54.840
owned is probably a rite of passage for his generation.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.280
I feel like it's gonna happen a lot.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.800
And it seems like if the stakes are your roblox account, that's probably better than like

03:00.800 --> 03:04.280
your Google account or your bank account when you're older, right?

03:04.280 --> 03:10.840
So maybe this will instill some password hygiene in him at an early age and some caution.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.040
I think mostly was a phishing attack, though.

03:13.040 --> 03:19.040
Well, yeah, the problem is a phishing attack, you know, even 2FA won't really protect you,

03:19.040 --> 03:20.040
right?

03:20.040 --> 03:23.320
Yeah, especially if you're motivated, you know, if they manage to give you a convincing

03:23.320 --> 03:29.480
sell and a reason to authorize your account and well, why don't we follow up on last week's

03:29.480 --> 03:35.420
episode where we talked about the possibility of Proton becoming a platform that brings

03:35.420 --> 03:41.080
apps beyond just gaming for Linux one day, essentially with the downside of making Win32

03:41.080 --> 03:44.240
the sort of de facto ABI for developers.

03:44.240 --> 03:48.720
Marcel wrote in, I have some thoughts about Win32 as a universal target.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.920
I actually really think Proton needs more attention in the productivity software space.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.240
I would love to see Fusion 360 in Linux.

03:55.240 --> 03:59.040
It's one of those applications that just doesn't run well in a virtual machine.

03:59.040 --> 04:02.500
And it really isn't going to be rewritten anytime soon.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.360
And I wouldn't say it's really legacy either.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.120
It's still actively developed and it has many users.

04:08.120 --> 04:14.240
Yeah, a lot of these like large diagramming or CAD programs that are Windows only, when

04:14.240 --> 04:19.460
we start talking about this, we inevitably hear from folks that say like Marcel, I tried

04:19.460 --> 04:20.840
Fusion and Wine.

04:20.840 --> 04:21.840
It just wasn't perfect.

04:21.840 --> 04:25.240
It kind of worked, but you know, nobody's going to deploy that at scale.

04:25.240 --> 04:29.720
If it got the attention the games did, then these productivity tools that are used in

04:29.720 --> 04:33.900
the enterprise desktop space could be brought over to Linux.

04:33.900 --> 04:37.480
And that was kind of where I think I was going and I probably should have used CAD as the

04:37.480 --> 04:42.560
perfect example is like that business space that maybe wants to just standardize on a

04:42.560 --> 04:44.240
Linux desktop for some advantage.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.720
I don't know why.

04:45.720 --> 04:46.800
And maybe there isn't one.

04:46.800 --> 04:47.800
Maybe there is.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.500
And you know, this is the last piece they needed.

04:50.500 --> 04:55.280
But before you jump in, there's something else that was interesting that Sean sent in.

04:55.280 --> 05:00.760
He says that a Proton runtime of sorts was actually foreseen by a great wizard.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.400
He says, I've been listening since episode one.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.760
It's the best show on JB.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.680
The email could really just end there.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.680
He's true.

05:06.680 --> 05:07.680
Yeah, you're right.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.680
Best email ever.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.680
Done.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.680
Although he does pay his respects to Egon.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.280
Egon got some love this week.

05:12.280 --> 05:15.640
You know, Egon's like a part of the show.

05:15.640 --> 05:19.760
Everybody who writes on regularly becomes a character like Josh with the cold hands.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.560
You know, he wrote back in and said that his hands are doing a lot better.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.560
He got the warming pad.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.560
Fantastic, I guess.

05:24.560 --> 05:25.560
It's great.

05:25.560 --> 05:26.560
I'm glad.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.560
I'm glad his hands are warm.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.560
I'm glad you're feeling better, Josh.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.560
All right.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.560
So back to telling me I'm wonderful.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.560
Come on.

05:31.560 --> 05:37.480
I want to point out that Carmack, John Carmack, said nine years ago that essentially, well,

05:37.480 --> 05:38.760
here, I grabbed it.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.080
I went and got the best part.

05:40.080 --> 05:45.000
On Reddit, in like a Reddit comment thread, Carmack says, we blow right past Linux these

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
days.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
We don't even really consider it.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.160
He says, I truly feel, this is a quote from Carmack, that emulation of some sort is the

05:51.160 --> 05:53.360
proper technical direction for gaming on Linux.

05:53.360 --> 05:54.880
This is nine years ago.

05:54.880 --> 05:59.360
He says, it's obviously pragmatic in the range of possible support, but it shouldn't have

05:59.360 --> 06:01.360
the technical stigma that it does.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.480
There really isn't much of anything special that a native port does.

06:04.480 --> 06:10.160
We still make OpenGL calls, Winsock is just BSD sockets, Windows threads become P threads,

06:10.160 --> 06:13.120
and the translation of input and audio interfaces don't make much difference.

06:13.120 --> 06:17.480
A good shim layer should have less impact on performance and variability than driver

06:17.480 --> 06:18.800
quality does.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.920
Ideally, following a set of best practice guidelines could allow developers to get Linux

06:22.920 --> 06:27.680
versions with a little more effort than support, say, Windows XP.

06:27.680 --> 06:32.600
Properly evangelized, again, this is nine years ago, Carmack writes, properly evangelized

06:32.600 --> 06:38.720
with Steam as the monetized distribution platform, this is a plausible path forward.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.760
And he actually goes into more detail, it's long and I'll link to it if people want to

06:41.760 --> 06:42.760
read it.

06:42.760 --> 06:46.960
But he goes in like some historical context about why they don't port to Linux and things

06:46.960 --> 06:48.400
like that.

06:48.400 --> 06:56.700
But I sit here now, having used desktop Linux in some form since the late 90s, and I wonder

06:56.700 --> 07:00.480
if maybe this just isn't the better direction to go because it seems like it's either this

07:00.480 --> 07:02.320
or Electron.

07:02.320 --> 07:08.200
And I know as wild as this sounds, I think I'd rather run Windows applications under

07:08.200 --> 07:13.440
Proton than have 1530 Electron apps on my PC.

07:13.440 --> 07:18.360
So it would be easy to do like the cheap dunk here, but I'm not going to do it because this

07:18.360 --> 07:20.240
isn't that crazy.

07:20.240 --> 07:27.520
This before YouTube commenters, yeah, right, what's the difference between Win32 and emulating

07:27.520 --> 07:34.140
some other platform, or running an entire giant ass, you know, Chromium instance for

07:34.140 --> 07:35.140
every application?

07:35.140 --> 07:36.140
Right.

07:36.140 --> 07:37.140
That's my thinking.

07:37.140 --> 07:38.140
Am I mistaken on this?

07:38.140 --> 07:44.040
I thought Electron was moving towards having like a shared Chromium resource.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.440
There is actually a way to do that today.

07:46.440 --> 07:51.120
I think though the Electron app can still opt to always build their own and run that.

07:51.120 --> 07:55.200
It's like, for example, on some Linux systems, you could actually run a system level Electron

07:55.200 --> 07:56.720
and all the apps run on top of that.

07:56.720 --> 08:00.880
But it can be so hit and miss because take Slack, for example, they don't account for

08:00.880 --> 08:02.880
you running a newer runtime.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.400
And so there are bugs.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.400
It's crashy.

08:06.400 --> 08:12.640
I feel like I should be more spicy, but I kind of don't think this is the worst idea

08:12.640 --> 08:13.640
ever.

08:13.640 --> 08:20.200
Let me try to put this in a non-douchey way, which of course means it's going to get rough.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.680
First of all, you know, I just had this meeting yet again at TMB.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.680
All right.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.200
Remember we talked a couple of weeks ago about the Windows 11 change?

08:27.200 --> 08:30.120
Oh, for the login stuff where you need a Microsoft account?

08:30.120 --> 08:31.120
Yeah.

08:31.120 --> 08:38.880
Well, that's creating a surprising level of angst with a couple of my customers.

08:38.880 --> 08:44.080
And honestly, like, to hell with those guys, right?

08:44.080 --> 08:47.160
There was nothing wrong with the old Win32 APIs.

08:47.160 --> 08:52.020
Hell, there's nothing wrong with Qt except Qt's strong desire to change their license

08:52.020 --> 08:53.020
terms every year.

08:53.020 --> 08:54.560
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

08:54.560 --> 08:59.880
Oh, and don't forget their strong desire to communicate in the most obtuse way that can

08:59.880 --> 09:02.640
always be interpreted in multiple different ways.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.640
You know, it's funny.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.780
We, so the last, we coupled Qt again.

09:05.780 --> 09:08.880
We covered it, what, like four months ago, something like that?

09:08.880 --> 09:11.400
I don't know, man, because I'm still singed.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.460
So it's hard for me to tell at all, Blair's.

09:13.460 --> 09:17.180
One of their dev evangelists actually reached out to me and said that I was simply confused

09:17.180 --> 09:23.520
and that there was a misunderstanding between myself and the sales rep, which is honestly

09:23.520 --> 09:24.520
completely possible.

09:24.520 --> 09:25.520
Right?

09:25.520 --> 09:26.520
Right.

09:26.520 --> 09:27.520
I recall.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.520
Yeah.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.520
I mean, you've been dealing with me for, what, like 10 years?

09:29.520 --> 09:30.520
You know how I am.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.960
I, when I said, when I want something, I'm like, this is what I want.

09:32.960 --> 09:33.960
Right.

09:33.960 --> 09:38.920
I'm not really good at the whole, you know, wheel and deal kind of game.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.520
So a lot of the cut, my customers listen to show I, my pitches, I'm always the Saturn

09:42.520 --> 09:43.520
dealer.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.560
You're so old.

09:45.560 --> 09:51.280
Do you kick the doors too and show that they don't, you know, hell no popcorn, no hot dogs.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.600
I'm just the Saturn dealer.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.600
Right.

09:53.600 --> 09:54.840
Do I really have to explain what that means?

09:54.840 --> 09:57.080
I feel like I do since you're like, you're so old.

09:57.080 --> 10:00.520
Well, I mean, they haven't, like they literally haven't even been around for like a decade

10:00.520 --> 10:01.520
or something.

10:01.520 --> 10:07.360
All right, so Saturn was a sub brand of GM, much like Corvette, Chevy, whatever.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.960
Started by like the best of the best in GM, right?

10:09.960 --> 10:13.520
So it was like their elite people, at least that's the story I heard.

10:13.520 --> 10:17.880
Their whole deal was no scummy sales tactics.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.480
You go to the lot, you want to buy a car, the car has a price.

10:21.480 --> 10:25.600
If you're a GM employee, you get a different price because that's a weird union deal.

10:25.600 --> 10:30.280
Or if you're like the relative, like I'm related to GM employees, that's why I buy Chevys because

10:30.280 --> 10:31.960
you get a better price.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.160
Can I, oh, just to interrupt.

10:33.160 --> 10:39.240
So that GM, that employee deal thing, it's so funny because as you would expect, if you've

10:39.240 --> 10:45.320
ever been to a GM building, a large GM office, the entire parking lot looks like a GM car

10:45.320 --> 10:48.720
dealership because it's all clean, new GMs.

10:48.720 --> 10:53.480
And then like the one black sheep of the group shows up in like a Ford and it's like, oh,

10:53.480 --> 10:57.000
well my car is, my car's still, it still hasn't arrived yet.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
This is my old car.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
He has to like defend himself.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
It was funny.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.400
Well, cause the employee pricing is like really good.

11:03.400 --> 11:08.040
So anyway, the Saturn dealers whole shtick was you come here, you see a car in the lot,

11:08.040 --> 11:09.080
you'd like it.

11:09.080 --> 11:12.320
Let's say the cars, I don't know, Saturn's weren't that expensive either, right?

11:12.320 --> 11:13.320
Like $22,000 maybe.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.320
Right.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.320
Right.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.920
When you, when the sticker says 22 grand, the salesman, there's no bull going back to

11:18.920 --> 11:22.660
the manager and like having to say, oh, like, okay.

11:22.660 --> 11:27.200
The douchey thing I always do is I don't say that I get the union discount because once

11:27.200 --> 11:31.280
you do that, they always, all of a sudden they're showing you like the LS, the night

11:31.280 --> 11:35.400
that I serve cars, I'm always like, oh geez, that's a little steep.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.840
Don't you want the one with two power seats?

11:37.840 --> 11:38.840
Right.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.080
Well, what I say is, well, what can you do?

11:40.080 --> 11:42.720
Let me, let me just see, I have this union number.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.200
Can I, what's that price?

11:45.200 --> 11:46.920
And the salesman always wants to slap me.

11:46.920 --> 11:47.920
There goes his commission.

11:47.920 --> 11:48.920
Right.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.280
Cause that's, they really do f**k them over.

11:50.280 --> 11:54.440
But the deal with Saturn was the price on the car is the price on the car with the one

11:54.440 --> 11:56.240
exception of the union deal.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.080
But then they even published the employee price.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.680
So if you were, you, you knew what it was.

12:00.680 --> 12:01.680
That's my whole shtick.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.680
And it's not that old.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.440
They, they haven't been dead for 10 years.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.440
Have they?

12:05.440 --> 12:06.920
I don't know.

12:06.920 --> 12:07.920
Feels like it.

12:07.920 --> 12:08.960
Maybe it's been longer.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.440
Here's my thinking on it.

12:10.440 --> 12:16.560
Again, I'm just looking at this as a selfish Linux user who wants to reclaim his desktop

12:16.560 --> 12:18.640
back from electron.

12:18.640 --> 12:19.640
Here's the beauty.

12:19.640 --> 12:28.240
I believe of Linux users just accepting that Win32 would make a great target base for developers.

12:28.240 --> 12:33.040
Proton could make a great shim to get a good experience at native speeds.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.360
But here's the best part.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.420
It cuts the Mac users out, right?

12:38.420 --> 12:42.820
Because when something gets ported to electron, it's just as easy to run it on a Mac.

12:42.820 --> 12:45.560
And often the experience is even slightly better.

12:45.560 --> 12:52.320
So if you just kept everything Win32's ABI, that's going to be really hard on the M1 Macs.

12:52.320 --> 12:55.400
That's going to be hard on Apple's future direction.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.840
Makes it hard to move it over to their platform.

12:57.840 --> 13:02.240
It keeps the business apps on Windows and Linux.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.400
And I think they could live in peace together.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.560
You know, when you consider WSL, when you consider, they all could kind of work together

13:08.560 --> 13:11.040
in that sense and screw Apple.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.040
And I think that'd be great.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.760
What a, what a nice twist of events.

13:13.760 --> 13:20.600
And the slow capitulation to electron that we're seeing in the industry is about enabling

13:20.600 --> 13:27.200
people to leave the Win32 world, which before this episode, I would have thought is great.

13:27.200 --> 13:32.400
But now that I'm thinking about it and I want to be like, you know, if Linux had a CEO,

13:32.400 --> 13:34.280
if I was Linux's CEO today.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.800
Oh, like what the Linux Foundation wants to be.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.800
Oh, sorry.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.800
Too mean.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.800
Well, yeah.

13:39.800 --> 13:44.080
If there was a CEO of Linux that was looking at how to like secure the next 30 years of

13:44.080 --> 13:46.400
the desktop, whatever remains of it.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.200
First of all, that's a bad job.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.720
But second of all, I'd be like, well, we always talk about on this show, how do you build

13:51.720 --> 13:52.720
a moat?

13:52.720 --> 13:56.240
You build a moat by making sure you don't keep bleeding to the Mac, in my opinion.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.240
And you deal with that.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.240
I'm sorry.

13:58.240 --> 14:03.760
If you're the CEO of Linux, you ignore the desktop and you do your actual goddamn job,

14:03.760 --> 14:05.360
which is IoT.

14:05.360 --> 14:08.980
All these new, by the way, the metaverse is a huge opportunity for Linux now that I actually

14:08.980 --> 14:10.320
believe in it.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.320
Right.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.320
Servers.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.320
Oh, for sure.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.320
These devices.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.720
Nobody wants to license Windows.

14:15.720 --> 14:20.400
The way we ended up on this weird topic is that Windows 11's new account thing is screwing

14:20.400 --> 14:25.540
over the types of enterprise deployments that I do at the Mad Botter for my customers.

14:25.540 --> 14:33.920
So I am considering some, we should DM about this, some drastic actions here.

14:33.920 --> 14:44.040
Like crazy, like Colorado style actions, because I need a platform that I'm not going to get

14:44.040 --> 14:47.760
hammered because of somebody's, you know, weird strategy tax.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.760
Boy.

14:48.760 --> 14:49.760
Oh, boy.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.600
And I know that strategy tax, that's your that's your thing, right?

14:52.600 --> 14:57.480
You know, today it came out, I've been feeling the same way only in the podcast space.

14:57.480 --> 15:04.280
Today it came out that YouTube is offering like $50,000 to certain podcasters to take

15:04.280 --> 15:09.160
their audio only podcast and make it a video podcast and then, you know, start using their

15:09.160 --> 15:11.800
ads and stuff like that.

15:11.800 --> 15:16.520
And you know, you watch what Spotify is doing, you watch what Apple is doing, you see what

15:16.520 --> 15:20.880
Libsyn is trying to do with suppressing ad prices and YouTube is trying to do by taking

15:20.880 --> 15:21.880
over podcasting.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.400
And I start thinking to myself, how the hell am I going to be able to stay independent

15:25.400 --> 15:27.440
for the next five years?

15:27.440 --> 15:30.420
It's getting really, really centralized out there.

15:30.420 --> 15:35.600
For some, like the rumor is as much as $300,000 the offer is, which I still find ridiculous.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.380
$50,000 couldn't even convert a single one of our podcasts to video.

15:39.380 --> 15:40.380
Think about it.

15:40.380 --> 15:42.760
That doesn't even pay for a year of a video editor.

15:42.760 --> 15:47.320
Not to mention camera equipment, lighting, sets, editing equipment.

15:47.320 --> 15:51.160
I mean, give me a break $50,000 is spent in one weekend buying the gear.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.200
No, that makes no sense.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.200
Yeah.

15:54.200 --> 15:58.360
I'm trying to incentivize a centralization of podcasters because once you go onto the

15:58.360 --> 16:04.840
YouTube platform, you create content for the algorithm and you have to create content that's

16:04.840 --> 16:12.120
also appealing to the ad bot because it's all an auction system behind the scenes.

16:12.120 --> 16:15.040
And the auction system has preferences.

16:15.040 --> 16:20.400
It looks for brand safe content and brand safe content is not only the type of things

16:20.400 --> 16:24.080
that you cover, but it's the genre that you cover as well.

16:24.080 --> 16:28.840
I look at independent podcast operations and I just think, I don't even know if most of

16:28.840 --> 16:30.620
them are going to make it the next couple of years.

16:30.620 --> 16:33.280
I think it's really bleak out there.

16:33.280 --> 16:39.880
I mean, how many people do you know that do this full time?

16:39.880 --> 16:42.000
Not many, if they're not part of a large company.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.480
I mean, I'll see your podcasters and raise you independent app developers.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.480
Right.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.440
That's what I'm thinking is where the parallels are at.

16:48.440 --> 16:53.600
Well, we're not even through the feedback and I think it's, if you're a drinkin' man,

16:53.600 --> 16:56.120
it's time for your Coder Radio depression cocktail.

16:56.120 --> 17:02.720
If you had a bummer episode on your bingo card, no, I don't know.

17:02.720 --> 17:03.720
It'll be fine.

17:03.720 --> 17:08.760
Listen, when Spotify owns the market and they still have to pay Apple 30 percent, it'll

17:08.760 --> 17:09.760
be great.

17:09.760 --> 17:10.760
Don't worry.

17:10.760 --> 17:14.320
I actually think both you and I have been fairly good at keeping up with the way that

17:14.320 --> 17:15.840
the internet wind is blowing.

17:15.840 --> 17:20.960
But when you have been in this for a while and it keeps happening, there's just an inevitable

17:20.960 --> 17:22.640
exhaustion that comes along with it.

17:22.640 --> 17:27.680
Then you think to yourself, like at least I do, I think, God, I really just want something

17:27.680 --> 17:33.880
that I could essentially put on autopilot and do for the next 40 years.

17:33.880 --> 17:34.880
That's what I want.

17:34.880 --> 17:38.000
I want a job I could just and one that doesn't kill me health wise.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.880
Like I've realized I've really got to start making some improvements in that regard.

17:42.880 --> 17:48.840
From the holidays until just about last week, I think I was having like some real high blood

17:48.840 --> 17:54.280
pressure days, some really bad migraines and hypertension issues.

17:54.280 --> 17:57.400
I was really pushing the health stuff too far.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.520
I had to dial it back a little bit.

17:58.520 --> 18:00.800
I have to keep rethinking that all the time.

18:00.800 --> 18:05.000
These inevitable changes in the business, they don't make things easier, they make it

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
more stressful.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.640
They make it harder and harder to just have a... A lifestyle business feels like the

18:12.640 --> 18:20.640
wrong connotation because I do work hard, but I'd like not to have to work hard every

18:20.640 --> 18:22.320
day all the time.

18:22.320 --> 18:28.320
I feel like maybe I'm not exactly on the same wavelength, but I just went through a pretty

18:28.320 --> 18:33.680
dramatic shift personally and with the business, with TMB.

18:33.680 --> 18:40.240
Now just things, I feel like the rate of... I can't see a change, because it's not like

18:40.240 --> 18:42.880
there's a new iPhone style event.

18:42.880 --> 18:48.040
Although again, if you're young, check out, seriously, the metaverse, although I hate

18:48.040 --> 18:49.040
that term.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.040
I would say VR.

18:50.040 --> 18:57.120
Although I'm more interested in AR practically, but just the rapid consolidation in basically

18:57.120 --> 19:02.840
everything makes the problems almost like the technical stuff, like, oh, should I do

19:02.840 --> 19:08.080
this in Mac or Windows or Pop or some other Linux?

19:08.080 --> 19:13.880
Or is this, oh, if I try to do this and enter this vertical, who is going to put their boot

19:13.880 --> 19:14.880
on my throat?

19:14.880 --> 19:15.880
Yeah.

19:15.880 --> 19:16.880
Who's the gatekeeper?

19:16.880 --> 19:17.880
The platform?

19:17.880 --> 19:18.880
Yeah.

19:18.880 --> 19:19.880
Who's the heavy?

19:19.880 --> 19:20.880
Yeah.

19:20.880 --> 19:24.800
We've done a good job of taking the internet and really centralizing it super well.

19:24.800 --> 19:30.440
I watched... Forgive me, I don't recall, but there was a PBS documentary, it was made

19:30.440 --> 19:33.960
by the people who made Triumph of the Nerds with Bob Cringley.

19:33.960 --> 19:34.960
Remember that one?

19:34.960 --> 19:36.520
Yeah, I remember that.

19:36.520 --> 19:41.560
He did another one about the internet, or not him, but the same producers.

19:41.560 --> 19:44.800
Just the utopianism, right?

19:44.800 --> 19:49.600
Everybody you can have a business... The mom will be working when the kids are at school

19:49.600 --> 19:51.600
and she'll run a little shop.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.600
It's like Etsy.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.600
Everybody's Etsy, effectively.

19:54.600 --> 19:59.200
But damn, the centralization, it's just like... It's so funny.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.080
No one predicted Facebook back then.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.000
Not that I hate Facebook.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
I hate Facebook.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.640
I don't know, like Apple is once again in court, right?

20:08.640 --> 20:11.880
That lady who's suing Apple just got slapped by the court.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.760
She had to pull down all the documents she shared.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.800
Well, all right.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.480
So let's talk about building something, because-

20:18.480 --> 20:19.480
Positivity.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.480
You gotta try.

20:20.480 --> 20:25.960
Like, you can't stop trying, and a lot of times I think what we discover is in times

20:25.960 --> 20:31.640
where it just seems like there's total chaos, some of us eventually figure out the signal

20:31.640 --> 20:37.360
from the noise, and you start building, and when things turn around, you're hopefully

20:37.360 --> 20:39.160
in the right position to ride that wave.

20:39.160 --> 20:45.880
So Steve asks, really, how do I build something today that I'm involved with today but I know

20:45.880 --> 20:49.560
I will not be involved with shortly down the road?

20:49.560 --> 20:53.720
I'm the VP of my kids' high school band parent association, and we've decided we're gonna

20:53.720 --> 20:54.720
create a website.

20:54.720 --> 20:58.200
He says, of course, I headed over to Linode and made an account, got that $100 credit

20:58.200 --> 21:00.880
at linode.com slash coder, I made a WordPress server.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.160
I had it running within five minutes.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.160
That's great.

21:04.160 --> 21:07.140
Got the DNS SSL going 10 minutes after that.

21:07.140 --> 21:11.720
But after a week of doing different mockups for the other board members, I started to

21:11.720 --> 21:15.760
think to myself in three years when my kid graduates, I'm not gonna need to run this

21:15.760 --> 21:16.760
anymore.

21:16.760 --> 21:20.240
I'm probably gonna hand it off to somebody who uses password 123.

21:20.240 --> 21:24.000
So it started getting me thinking, how should I set this up in a way where I can hand it

21:24.000 --> 21:26.040
off to somebody who might not be an expert?

21:26.040 --> 21:30.480
Should I go with some sort of fully built hosting service, document everything?

21:30.480 --> 21:31.480
What do you guys think?

21:31.480 --> 21:34.200
Also, by the way, Egon is amazing.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.520
He is instantly my hero.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.520
There you go, Egon.

21:36.520 --> 21:39.080
You got a fan club now.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.360
I don't understand what's happening.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.480
He's got more fans than we do.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.600
Egon, bastard.

21:46.600 --> 21:50.080
Kind of riffing on Chris's complete nihilism here.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.480
It's not your problem.

21:51.480 --> 21:54.720
If you're handing a system over to somebody who's gonna also have complete control of

21:54.720 --> 21:59.160
the system, there are many more ways for them to screw that up than having password 123.

21:59.160 --> 22:02.320
Brandon, that's a pretty, you can't, right?

22:02.320 --> 22:03.320
You can't see the future.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.960
You can't protect against everything.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.320
Hell, I'm right now using add-in for IRC.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.960
Do you know why?

22:08.960 --> 22:12.560
Because all the other ones are crappy, the new ones are crappy electron apps.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.560
It's true.

22:13.560 --> 22:14.560
You cannot account for Luddite.

22:14.560 --> 22:15.560
I see what you did there.

22:15.560 --> 22:16.560
I like it.

22:16.560 --> 22:17.560
No, but I don't know, Chris.

22:17.560 --> 22:20.680
All right, what would you tell him to do?

22:20.680 --> 22:23.580
I think he is thinking about the right things.

22:23.580 --> 22:26.880
What I suspect he needs to do is just be really clear up front.

22:26.880 --> 22:32.000
Here is your options, and these are the risk trade-offs, and one of the risks of the go

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
set up WordPress on Linode would be in three years when I move on, you're gonna need to

22:35.000 --> 22:38.100
find somebody else who knows how to operate this system.

22:38.100 --> 22:43.720
With that kind of a heads up, that does not seem like an impossible goal to me at all.

22:43.720 --> 22:47.040
You do have things on the other end of the spectrum, like your Squarespace is out there

22:47.040 --> 22:50.660
where they essentially will maintain all the backend tech.

22:50.660 --> 22:54.680
That's my value proposition where I see a thing like Squarespace or Tumblr is if you

22:54.680 --> 22:59.280
want a webpage that somebody can just set up and then forget about for five years, it'll

22:59.280 --> 23:00.440
do that for you.

23:00.440 --> 23:04.120
You won't have to touch it, but I think you and I probably both know there's disadvantages

23:04.120 --> 23:05.920
to that as well.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.880
I would just say communicate first.

23:07.880 --> 23:12.840
Build something, and then really all you need is a document, a Google Doc that they have

23:12.840 --> 23:18.200
the URL to or something that just documents these things, store the username and password

23:18.200 --> 23:22.680
somewhere on their site so they have it, and tell them to refer to that envelope.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.640
You've done your due diligence, and you've also, I think, gone above and beyond at that

23:25.640 --> 23:26.640
point.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.740
That's how you build it to handoff, and document it early.

23:29.740 --> 23:30.920
Don't wait.

23:30.920 --> 23:31.920
Do it while it's fresh.

23:31.920 --> 23:32.920
I like it.

23:32.920 --> 23:33.920
Very reasonable.

23:33.920 --> 23:34.920
Thank you.

23:34.920 --> 23:40.600
Well, also in the good news side of things, we have an East Coast Meetup.

23:40.600 --> 23:41.600
That's right.

23:41.600 --> 23:48.240
We are finally doing a East Coast Jupiter Broadcasting Meetup on April 9th, 2022 in

23:48.240 --> 23:50.080
Raleigh, North Carolina.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.280
We have details at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.680
About 30-ish people are going so far.

23:55.680 --> 24:01.320
Starts at 3 p.m. Eastern at a park, and across the street, there's Prime Barbecue, and on

24:01.320 --> 24:05.660
the other side of the park, there's a brewery as well, so we figured we'd hang out at the

24:05.660 --> 24:06.660
park.

24:06.660 --> 24:07.660
Barbecue.

24:07.660 --> 24:08.660
Now, what do you think?

24:08.660 --> 24:12.280
I know this is in your neck of the woods, but it's going to be tricky, you know?

24:12.280 --> 24:14.080
I'm going to say it now.

24:14.080 --> 24:18.960
If I can get childcare, which is extremely likely, I'll be there.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.560
I'm looking forward to that.

24:21.560 --> 24:26.480
We could have ourselves quite the J.B. reunion, because it sounds like there's a good chance

24:26.480 --> 24:27.480
you're going to make it.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.920
I think there's a good chance Westpain is going to make it.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.920
There's a good chance that, well, I know I'm going to make it.

24:32.920 --> 24:36.380
I know that Alex from Self-Hosted is going to make it, Brent from Linux Unplugged and

24:36.380 --> 24:37.780
Brunch is going to be there.

24:37.780 --> 24:40.480
My wife, Adia, will be there.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.600
So that's just, you know, so far.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.880
So we're getting quite the party.

24:43.880 --> 24:44.880
Can I bring swag?

24:44.880 --> 24:45.880
Oh, yeah.

24:45.880 --> 24:46.880
Of course.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.520
Now, can I run a little contest?

24:48.520 --> 24:51.200
Chris does not know I was going to say this beforehand.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.120
I have one question.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.280
What is the best version of BSD?

24:55.280 --> 24:56.480
And there's only one correct answer.

24:56.480 --> 24:59.200
Do I have a guess or do you want people to tell you at the meetup?

24:59.200 --> 25:00.200
Guess.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.200
You can guess.

25:01.200 --> 25:05.440
Well, then it has to be the one and true free BSD, because that's the one Alan...

25:05.440 --> 25:06.440
Incorrect.

25:06.440 --> 25:07.440
Snow Leopard.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.440
Of course.

25:08.440 --> 25:09.440
Of course.

25:09.440 --> 25:13.680
How did I, how did I not know that?

25:13.680 --> 25:14.680
Of course.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.080
First of all, barbecue and brews.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.640
You know, Chris, this was like a mic trap.

25:19.640 --> 25:21.480
He's never been able to get me to go anywhere.

25:21.480 --> 25:25.560
He's like, I will locate it between the bar and the barbecue place.

25:25.560 --> 25:28.860
No matter which advice he wants to hit, he has to cross us.

25:28.860 --> 25:29.860
He has to.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.120
There's no way around it.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.120
It is the perfect trap.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.780
Although, you know, we're probably going to wreck the show because it feels like if we

25:35.780 --> 25:41.120
haven't met this far into the show, if we meet now, it's going to make things weird.

25:41.120 --> 25:45.900
Well, I used to watch you in your, in your youth days on the video, the old...

25:45.900 --> 25:47.160
Back when I was handsome.

25:47.160 --> 25:49.400
Listen, I've heard stuff.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.240
Apparently you're quite the silver Fox these days.

25:51.240 --> 25:54.040
Let's not, let's not get wild with ourselves.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.040
Tell me, tell me.

25:55.040 --> 25:58.320
Now this is North Carolina and you know this.

25:58.320 --> 26:01.360
I love me some nice Carolina barbecue.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.880
Have we looked into this place?

26:02.880 --> 26:03.880
So I, it's funny.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.760
I think it might be Texas style, but I'm not sure.

26:05.760 --> 26:06.760
Son of a bitch.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.780
But the, the ratings are good.

26:08.780 --> 26:10.600
The ratings and reviews are really good.

26:10.600 --> 26:14.080
I will prepare my lower intestines.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.080
Yeah.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.120
See, I love barbecue, but you got to plan for it.

26:18.120 --> 26:22.440
You know, what I do is, uh, I kind of like go easy.

26:22.440 --> 26:23.960
You have a barbecue safety plan?

26:23.960 --> 26:24.960
Yeah.

26:24.960 --> 26:25.960
Yeah.

26:25.960 --> 26:26.960
Well, it's just a regime.

26:26.960 --> 26:27.960
It's a regime.

26:27.960 --> 26:31.240
Like if I'm going to go somewhere special and I want to eat, I'll just kind of, I'll

26:31.240 --> 26:32.960
go light for a couple of days.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.100
I'll super hydrate.

26:34.100 --> 26:35.640
You got to super hydrate.

26:35.640 --> 26:38.720
And then I'll go into the barbecue place strategically.

26:38.720 --> 26:44.200
I go, I go light on the really processed meats, you know, your sausages, your links, that

26:44.200 --> 26:45.560
kind of stuff.

26:45.560 --> 26:49.680
And I'll go more so on their specialties because it's a more of a rare thing and they're generally,

26:49.680 --> 26:51.680
I find easier on my system.

26:51.680 --> 26:55.360
And then, uh, I also kind of try to not do much on like the Mac and cheese, but I got

26:55.360 --> 26:56.880
to have a little bit of Mac and cheese and beans.

26:56.880 --> 27:00.200
And of course, if they got the corn and they got the cornbread and they got the butter

27:00.200 --> 27:02.520
and the honey, I got to get that with some root beer.

27:02.520 --> 27:03.640
I got to try that too.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.240
And if they got the slaw, I'm going to get the slaw.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.280
They got a couple of sauces.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.840
I got to try a couple of, oh man, I'm getting excited.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.480
The sauces is what kills me because I'm like, oh, I got to try this.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.320
I mean, I just run around like a maniac.

27:14.320 --> 27:17.160
I am getting excited about this.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.900
And you know, Alex has got a spot where we could go back.

27:19.900 --> 27:23.800
We could do some recording if time allowed, you know, if, I mean, if we got you, me and

27:23.800 --> 27:26.040
Wes in a room, we could probably do some podcasts.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.480
Maybe that's, maybe that's when we do our coderly.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.800
Maybe we do like a coderly special while we're there.

27:30.800 --> 27:31.800
Something like that.

27:31.800 --> 27:36.600
Anyways, if you want to join us April 9th, 3 PM in Raleigh, North Carolina, join the

27:36.600 --> 27:40.740
meetup page so we can tell the restaurant about how many we expect meetup.com slash

27:40.740 --> 27:45.280
Jupiter broadcasting, and of course you should come because cold hands, Josh will be there.

27:45.280 --> 27:48.360
You can shake his cold hands, keep him, keep him warm.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.360
That's exciting.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.400
Do we know how roughly large his hands are?

27:51.400 --> 27:52.400
I could bring him mittens.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.080
You know, I think he's good now.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.080
He's good.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.080
I think he's healed up.

27:56.080 --> 27:59.160
Well, he's got a suite of suggestions from the audience that took care of him.

27:59.160 --> 28:00.160
He's got a whole suite.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.080
So, but yeah, come shake his cold hands.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.400
Maybe Egon will be there.

28:03.400 --> 28:07.040
People that, you know, are famous.

28:07.040 --> 28:12.280
Linode.com slash coder, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and go there

28:12.280 --> 28:13.280
to support the show.

28:13.280 --> 28:17.160
It lets them know you appreciate them sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

28:17.160 --> 28:20.040
It's the cycle of podcast life after all.

28:20.040 --> 28:23.340
And Linode is such a great product to be right here on the Coder Radio program because this

28:23.340 --> 28:25.320
is the developer's cloud.

28:25.320 --> 28:28.920
This is where I genuinely think you should build your next project.

28:28.920 --> 28:32.400
You can run the infrastructure for your business or your personal project with Linode.

28:32.400 --> 28:35.440
They have 40 gigabit connections coming into those hypervisors.

28:35.440 --> 28:38.160
They've got 11 data centers around the world.

28:38.160 --> 28:42.040
They just recently rolled out MVME PCI storage for some of their rigs.

28:42.040 --> 28:45.260
So you can just get incredible IOPS per gigabyte.

28:45.260 --> 28:48.940
It's one of those constantly improving services.

28:48.940 --> 28:51.440
And that's why it's easy to recommend it for you.

28:51.440 --> 28:55.640
And just recently, a brand new thing has arrived.

28:55.640 --> 28:59.360
You can now join the Linode Managed Database beta.

28:59.360 --> 29:04.520
They're rolling out managed database support, the perfect combination of industry standard

29:04.520 --> 29:10.560
software like MySQL, backed by Linode's team on their infrastructure.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.840
You can sign up right now for early access.

29:12.840 --> 29:15.800
You can help influence the product's direction and give them some feedback.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.160
This is going to be a big service.

29:17.160 --> 29:18.560
This is big business.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.720
And it makes running a database simple and straightforward.

29:20.720 --> 29:25.540
You don't have to be some sort of DBA to now have the power and scalability of a database

29:25.540 --> 29:27.300
backed by Linode.

29:27.300 --> 29:29.520
They're working on that kind of stuff all the time.

29:29.520 --> 29:34.320
They've been doing this for 19 years, constantly improving, making things better and better.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.400
And with 11 data centers around the world, you know you're going to find something close

29:37.400 --> 29:40.740
to you or close to your customers.

29:40.740 --> 29:45.440
Over the years, I think I've appreciated now their object storage and their UI and the

29:45.440 --> 29:49.040
way their dashboard works and the way their API works more than just about anything else.

29:49.040 --> 29:54.040
But what I hear from the audience all the time is how great the support is.

29:54.040 --> 29:59.560
Someone ends up in a jam and Linode's 24-7 customer support by phone or by ticket, along

29:59.560 --> 30:03.720
with hundreds of guides and tutorials, helps them get things figured out.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.840
That really matters when it comes down to it.

30:05.840 --> 30:10.080
And with pricing 30% to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers, well, you can make

30:10.080 --> 30:11.920
an economic argument too.

30:11.920 --> 30:15.720
So I've got the performance reasons, I've got the support reasons, I've got the pricing

30:15.720 --> 30:19.240
reasons, and it's an opportunity to support the show, learn, and try something.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.200
That's pretty good combo.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.960
Now you see why I love having them as a sponsor and think you should check it out.

30:23.960 --> 30:29.760
So go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 for 60 days on a new account and support

30:29.760 --> 30:30.760
the show.

30:30.760 --> 30:36.080
Go to linode.com slash coder.

30:36.080 --> 30:39.400
Holy crap, NVIDIA and Samsung have had a bad week.

30:39.400 --> 30:45.920
I guess the same hacker group, Lapisus or something to that effect, has targeted Samsung

30:45.920 --> 30:47.120
and NVIDIA.

30:47.120 --> 30:50.240
They're leaking data for both of them.

30:50.240 --> 30:54.720
They're trying to get NVIDIA to open source their driver, threatening to release core

30:54.720 --> 30:57.680
information about their cards if they don't.

30:57.680 --> 31:03.080
They've put out data for Samsung's bootloader on newer Samsung Galaxy phones, including

31:03.080 --> 31:08.200
stuff for some of their encryption and access control information and activation servers,

31:08.200 --> 31:14.000
and data on maybe source code on how they authorize and authenticate Samsung accounts,

31:14.000 --> 31:16.400
APIs, and other user-facing services.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.460
I mean, huge leak.

31:18.460 --> 31:22.880
This happened on Friday over the weekend, so I didn't get to go through it very much.

31:22.880 --> 31:27.540
The NVIDIA leak, so far 19 gigs of data has been released by this group.

31:27.540 --> 31:33.480
They kind of became famous in late 2021 for targeting Brazil's Ministry of Health.

31:33.480 --> 31:37.320
And it's 190 gigs of data they've released for Samsung, which is 10 times bigger than

31:37.320 --> 31:38.440
the NVIDIA one.

31:38.440 --> 31:42.680
It's a massive two leaks in the same amount of weeks.

31:42.680 --> 31:47.160
You know, I took this and I know, you know, whatever big companies, but I feel a lot of

31:47.160 --> 31:51.880
sympathy for the IT folks working at these companies that have to deal with this shit

31:51.880 --> 31:52.880
now.

31:52.880 --> 31:53.880
Oh, man.

31:53.880 --> 31:54.880
Yeah, the IT folks.

31:54.880 --> 31:55.880
Oh, yeah.

31:55.880 --> 31:56.880
When you think about that.

31:56.880 --> 31:57.880
Look, this is a nightmare.

31:57.880 --> 31:58.880
I don't even know.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.800
Yeah, I don't like this kind of thing.

32:00.800 --> 32:01.800
I think it's bad.

32:01.800 --> 32:02.800
Yeah.

32:02.800 --> 32:05.440
I mean, I don't think this should be going on.

32:05.440 --> 32:10.360
I think if you want somebody to open source something, okay, we talk a lot about people

32:10.360 --> 32:12.240
using Linux open source.

32:12.240 --> 32:18.160
I've talked about my perspective on maybe open core needs to not be a dirty word, right?

32:18.160 --> 32:19.160
Over and over again.

32:19.160 --> 32:25.800
And that, you know, maybe people doing Linux development in the open on the server side

32:25.800 --> 32:30.320
should be considered part of the community, even though it's not like the desktop.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.360
And there are disagreements there that I think make sense, right?

32:32.360 --> 32:36.520
I'm pretty sure other hosts in the network strongly disagree with that.

32:36.520 --> 32:41.960
I would say that I'm pretty sure I could speak for all of us when I say that hacking someone

32:41.960 --> 32:46.360
to make them open source something is just not gonna work, right?

32:46.360 --> 32:47.600
Not a good look, huh?

32:47.600 --> 32:53.080
It's also going to upset them and probably make them be even more protective, more closer.

32:53.080 --> 32:57.340
In a statement, they say, quote, we request that NVIDIA commits to completely open source

32:57.340 --> 33:02.500
their graphics processing unit drivers, which is never going to happen.

33:02.500 --> 33:03.500
Not now.

33:03.500 --> 33:04.500
Are you kidding me?

33:04.500 --> 33:05.500
I don't know, Chris.

33:05.500 --> 33:10.320
If somebody like punched you in the face and was like, no more M1 Mac for you, I'm pretty

33:10.320 --> 33:12.280
sure you'd go buy the M1 Mac mini.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.000
That's almost certainly going to be announced tomorrow.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Yeah.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
That's what I did there.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.920
Yeah, I did see that the group said that if NVIDIA does not comply, they will release

33:20.920 --> 33:25.920
the complete silicon graphics and computer chipset files for all recent NVIDIA graphics

33:25.920 --> 33:26.920
processing units.

33:26.920 --> 33:27.920
Direct quote.

33:27.920 --> 33:31.200
Well, then I hope you were in Russia, because if you're American, you're going to Leavenworth.

33:31.200 --> 33:34.920
I don't even know what to say, like, what's with you in Leavenworth?

33:34.920 --> 33:35.920
It's a great town.

33:35.920 --> 33:38.880
I'm real worried about going to Leavenworth.

33:38.880 --> 33:39.880
What are these days, man?

33:39.880 --> 33:41.080
What are these days?

33:41.080 --> 33:42.080
Coder from Leavenworth.

33:42.080 --> 33:45.560
You know, old time listeners know that Dick Cheney used to guest star on the show.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.100
He's not particularly happy with me right now, so.

33:49.100 --> 33:53.040
This to me feels almost like they must know this.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.600
There's another motivation here.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.600
It's almost like a publicity stunt.

33:56.600 --> 34:01.280
Like when I say publicity stunt, I mean, they are clearly very skilled, and they're getting

34:01.280 --> 34:03.080
a lot of notoriety for this.

34:03.080 --> 34:06.440
I don't know how they monetize that, but that could be a goal here just to kind of get attention

34:06.440 --> 34:07.440
for that.

34:07.440 --> 34:11.440
And this is a cause that they can kind of attach to, or, you know, this is something

34:11.440 --> 34:15.480
they really think that we're a method they can affect change.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.120
And I think both of you and I are of the opinion that that's ludicrous.

34:18.120 --> 34:21.680
Like these U.S. companies are just going to get more defensive as a result.

34:21.680 --> 34:25.960
I just can't even imagine this ever happening, as much as I would love to see it.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.760
I mean, part of me is like, well, just do it.

34:28.760 --> 34:29.760
Just do it.

34:29.760 --> 34:35.840
No, it's the methodology that bothers me too, because, you know, you and I both know this

34:35.840 --> 34:36.840
very well.

34:36.840 --> 34:41.200
I won't mention that show that we don't like to talk about, but I love Unfilter, sorry.

34:41.200 --> 34:47.960
There is an entire, like, wing of industry and of Congress that is all about FUD around

34:47.960 --> 34:48.960
technology, right?

34:48.960 --> 34:54.120
It's always, oh, you can't buy this printer because the Chinese are going to hack your

34:54.120 --> 34:58.520
kids' photos or stupid lease agreement that you're printing.

34:58.520 --> 34:59.720
Don't buy this from this company.

34:59.720 --> 35:00.720
Yeah.

35:00.720 --> 35:01.720
Yeah, sure.

35:01.720 --> 35:02.720
That happens all the time.

35:02.720 --> 35:03.720
This is a legitimate problem.

35:03.720 --> 35:10.400
I don't know if I was a congressman from, let's say, Florida or a senator, the person

35:10.400 --> 35:12.160
I'm thinking of.

35:12.160 --> 35:22.000
I would be talking about this because this is my whole anti, you know, open software,

35:22.000 --> 35:23.640
open international cooperation, right?

35:23.640 --> 35:27.920
Because when you talk about open source, you're really, you know, when you're not talking

35:27.920 --> 35:32.820
about like Billy Bob or Mike's open source project, you're talking international cooperation

35:32.820 --> 35:34.200
by the community, right?

35:34.200 --> 35:40.000
By the regular people, not, you know, defense to defense or industry to industry, right?

35:40.000 --> 35:45.440
The scale of NVIDIA going full open source would change the industry forever.

35:45.440 --> 35:51.040
It probably wouldn't be good for NVIDIA at this juncture because they're winning, right?

35:51.040 --> 35:53.560
You know, Netscape was the big open source community win.

35:53.560 --> 35:56.960
I can't believe we're going to talk about Revolution OS here, but we are.

35:56.960 --> 36:03.100
So watch the documentary Revolution OS and it's definitely a product of its time.

36:03.100 --> 36:08.520
But the key takeaway from that that I'd like you to get is that Netscape went open source

36:08.520 --> 36:15.720
not from engineer activism, it's the bottom, but from top down, the top of the company,

36:15.720 --> 36:18.720
using it as a strategic moat against Microsoft, right?

36:18.720 --> 36:21.960
As a way to try to defend themselves from IE.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.480
Our younger listeners have no idea what the hell I'm talking about.

36:24.480 --> 36:30.400
Chris, can we just briefly give them a history of the browser war?

36:30.400 --> 36:37.400
There was once a great browser with a big N. Yeah, and it had flying stars every time

36:37.400 --> 36:38.400
the page would load.

36:38.400 --> 36:42.840
Netscape offered really the first usable consumer browser.

36:42.840 --> 36:46.560
There was things like Mosaic and other browsers that you could browse the web with, but Netscape

36:46.560 --> 36:51.160
came along and offered something that was truly a leap forward and it took Microsoft

36:51.160 --> 36:53.400
years to catch up with Internet Explorer.

36:53.400 --> 36:59.280
And as Microsoft got closer and started bundling Internet Explorer into Windows, Netscape realized

36:59.280 --> 37:01.220
they needed to make some sort of change.

37:01.220 --> 37:06.000
They could no longer charge for Netscape, which before had been a paid product.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
Airware was a big deal back then, and they would have to pivot to open source.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.800
And Netscape wasn't just a browser, it was a whole suite of software back then, and so

37:13.800 --> 37:16.360
it was a revolutionary change.

37:16.360 --> 37:22.320
And as we now know, Microsoft caught up around Internet Explorer time, four, and by five

37:22.320 --> 37:26.320
they were starting to dominate, and by six they'd completely taken off.

37:26.320 --> 37:32.820
During that time, Netscape faded, and from the ashes of Netscape, Firefox rose as like

37:32.820 --> 37:35.360
the phoenix that came from the ashes of Netscape.

37:35.360 --> 37:42.160
And so Mozilla and Firefox's legacy ties back to that Netscape browser from the 90s.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.080
I mean, that's it, right?

37:44.080 --> 37:45.080
That's right.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.200
But long gone now, right?

37:46.200 --> 37:49.440
And now Firefox isn't in great shape either as time goes on.

37:49.440 --> 37:56.880
And like the strategy there was we got to do something because this 10,000 pound gorilla

37:56.880 --> 37:57.880
is coming for us.

37:57.880 --> 38:02.720
It wasn't like a, what you're saying, and I agree with, is it wasn't this grassroots

38:02.720 --> 38:08.080
let's give something back to humanity, let's make something common code of the people so

38:08.080 --> 38:09.580
everyone can rise.

38:09.580 --> 38:15.320
It was, oh, we've got to save ourselves from this gorilla.

38:15.320 --> 38:20.040
It wasn't like a, it wasn't so much a charity as it was an act of desperation.

38:20.040 --> 38:24.400
It was a strategic choice by a very, very pro-capitalist business exec.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.400
Right.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.400
Yeah.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.960
I mean, the reason I keep going back into all this ancient history about Saturn and

38:28.960 --> 38:33.280
about Sun Microsystems, got to get them in every week.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.280
Nicely done.

38:34.280 --> 38:35.280
Thank you.

38:35.280 --> 38:41.120
And Netscape is in a lot of ways what we're seeing now with the giant tech titans, I don't

38:41.120 --> 38:46.360
know how we end here every week, but I feel like we have no choice, is basically the dream

38:46.360 --> 38:53.760
of I'll roughly call it the 90s tech world, right, failed, right?

38:53.760 --> 38:55.160
It never happened.

38:55.160 --> 39:02.240
It became these giant platforms that effectively are walled gardens.

39:02.240 --> 39:09.880
It's hard if you weren't there, but I think predicting where we are from where we were

39:09.880 --> 39:13.760
is very hard and I don't think you would be happy, right?

39:13.760 --> 39:20.320
If you teleported 1996, Chris, into now, yeah, the new gadgets are cool and iPhones are great

39:20.320 --> 39:29.000
and whatever, but the promise of the open internet has effectively, I think, been basically

39:29.000 --> 39:30.840
the value has been gated off, right?

39:30.840 --> 39:32.920
The value has been corralled.

39:32.920 --> 39:33.920
That's bad.

39:33.920 --> 39:34.920
Yeah.

39:34.920 --> 39:41.400
I wonder if it isn't sort of, there is layers of ecosystems that are essentially built on

39:41.400 --> 39:46.260
TCP IP and HTTP is one of them.

39:46.260 --> 39:48.800
The app stores, that's one of them.

39:48.800 --> 39:53.440
Bitcoin is one of them, like there's all these different layers and they all sort of inevitably

39:53.440 --> 40:02.320
have this creep towards centralization and it just seems to be that centralization offers

40:02.320 --> 40:09.360
efficiencies at scale that are so attractive we inevitably end up there.

40:09.360 --> 40:12.600
Oh, and it offers the best return on venture capital.

40:12.600 --> 40:13.600
Sure.

40:13.600 --> 40:16.920
And control, right, that's what you mean because then they own it, it's theirs, they spent

40:16.920 --> 40:19.240
their money and they have control over it.

40:19.240 --> 40:24.040
Now the interesting thing there is when something like this becomes the reality, the norm, like

40:24.040 --> 40:31.880
it is today, then when we go to war, the dynamics of how that war is fought now are so different

40:31.880 --> 40:36.520
than anything we have ever seen.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.360
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

40:38.360 --> 40:43.600
Go there and receive a free Datadog t-shirt and try out Datadog two weeks for free.

40:43.600 --> 40:48.520
That's right, Datadog is a software as a service monitoring and security platform.

40:48.520 --> 40:53.460
It enables full stack observability for developers, IT operations, security and business teams

40:53.460 --> 40:55.240
in the cloud age.

40:55.240 --> 40:59.640
Datadog's platform, along with 500 plus vendor backed integrations, allows you to correlate

40:59.640 --> 41:05.920
your metrics, your traces, your logs, security signals, infrastructure data, your applications,

41:05.920 --> 41:09.480
third party service information, all in a single pane of glass.

41:09.480 --> 41:12.080
Are you getting how powerful this is?

41:12.080 --> 41:13.680
And they're beautiful too.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.480
The dashboards are beautiful.

41:15.480 --> 41:20.040
These capabilities combined with these drag and drop, beautiful dashboards, I mean bootiful,

41:20.040 --> 41:24.240
and Datadog's machine learning based alerts, well that's going to help your team troubleshoot,

41:24.240 --> 41:28.360
it's going to help you collaborate more effectively, it's going to prevent downtime, it's going

41:28.360 --> 41:32.640
to enhance performance, reliability, and generally improve communications.

41:32.640 --> 41:36.320
Check all those boxes, it's a powerful platform.

41:36.320 --> 41:40.680
And for Coder Radio listeners as well, we got something for you.

41:40.680 --> 41:44.080
You can go to datadog.com slash Coder Radio and support the show.

41:44.080 --> 41:47.560
You get a two week free trial and some free swag.

41:47.560 --> 41:49.880
Datadog's going to send you a t-shirt as well.

41:49.880 --> 41:52.040
That's pretty nice.

41:52.040 --> 42:00.400
I'd say like a solid 38 to maybe even 40% of my wardrobe, quote unquote wardrobe, is

42:00.400 --> 42:01.580
swag.

42:01.580 --> 42:03.360
And that has taken a hit these last couple of years.

42:03.360 --> 42:04.840
Who couldn't use a free t-shirt?

42:04.840 --> 42:09.440
So go to datadog.com slash Coder Radio, support the show, get the two week free trial, and

42:09.440 --> 42:10.440
get a t-shirt.

42:10.440 --> 42:15.880

42:15.880 --> 42:20.560
So Russia is looking to legalize software piracy.

42:20.560 --> 42:25.160
The business news, which is like their Wall Street Journal or Financial Times over there,

42:25.160 --> 42:30.760
is reporting that in the backdrop of sanctions that are gaining momentum, Russian authorities

42:30.760 --> 42:34.680
are urgently preparing support measures along which are being discussed, the suspension

42:34.680 --> 42:40.140
of criminal and administrative liability for the use of pirated software from countries

42:40.140 --> 42:42.140
that support sanctions.

42:42.140 --> 42:47.240
And the way they're going to do this is they're going to essentially declare, for national

42:47.240 --> 42:52.780
emergency purposes, a standard nationwide software license.

42:52.780 --> 42:57.420
And in this software license, they're going to make this essentially permissible.

42:57.420 --> 43:04.800
So they're going to license software piracy by any company that's participating in these

43:04.800 --> 43:09.720
sanctions, which is remarkable because most Western tech companies are at this point.

43:09.720 --> 43:13.160
Microsoft probably being the one that's going to affect them, followed by IBM and Oracle

43:13.160 --> 43:17.160
the most because they do run Windows in the Russian government.

43:17.160 --> 43:20.840
And you know, when I think about this, the other thing that they're responding to, Mike,

43:20.840 --> 43:26.700
is this gets really tricky in the world of Office 365 subscriptions and software as a

43:26.700 --> 43:29.400
service when all of a sudden you just get turned off.

43:29.400 --> 43:30.680
Like they have to scramble.

43:30.680 --> 43:31.680
Yeah.

43:31.680 --> 43:32.680
It's Russia, though.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.000
They'll find a way around that.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.600
And by the way, I want to say Privyet, Sukhi.

43:36.600 --> 43:39.960
You little Sukhi have been stealing every app I've ever made.

43:39.960 --> 43:41.760
It's really not that new to them.

43:41.760 --> 43:42.760
I'm like, what?

43:42.760 --> 43:43.760
This is new?

43:43.760 --> 43:47.480
I think they're legalizing something that has been probably practiced a lot.

43:47.480 --> 43:51.960
I don't want to like besmirch all Russians, but many software developers I've talked

43:51.960 --> 43:56.800
to have said that like the number one source of piracy for their software is Russia.

43:56.800 --> 43:57.800
Yeah.

43:57.800 --> 44:03.400
But still, fascinating for a nation just to say, as a nation, we're going to legalize

44:03.400 --> 44:04.400
software piracy.

44:04.400 --> 44:08.400
I'm sort of amazed that Putin is running Windows.

44:08.400 --> 44:09.520
There's that picture.

44:09.520 --> 44:10.520
I know, right?

44:10.520 --> 44:12.440
Although it is Windows 7, apparently.

44:12.440 --> 44:13.440
Yeah.

44:13.440 --> 44:17.120
They've been trying to drop the habit for a while, but they just haven't.

44:17.120 --> 44:20.120
Which says a lot about Microsoft's strategy, right?

44:20.120 --> 44:23.660
That it definitely is good to sell people things they can't quit.

44:23.660 --> 44:30.360
As a software developer, I believe that people should pay me for my work and my fellow developers.

44:30.360 --> 44:35.240
Maybe just this last month, I think in February, we did the lament for all the dead indie Mac

44:35.240 --> 44:36.240
developers.

44:36.240 --> 44:39.840
I don't think we need to go into that again, but if the little companies could have grown

44:39.840 --> 44:45.400
into middle-sized companies and survived and thrived, you wouldn't have this monopoly

44:45.400 --> 44:47.000
problem quite as bad, right?

44:47.000 --> 44:50.800
This kind of like a Titans against the rest of the world.

44:50.800 --> 44:51.800
Yeah.

44:51.800 --> 44:54.920
I almost wonder if the fragmentation you see in the Linux community has been a good thing

44:54.920 --> 44:55.920
in this regard.

44:55.920 --> 44:59.960
There's not one centralized authority that can turn your access off to open source and

44:59.960 --> 45:01.720
free software desktops.

45:01.720 --> 45:07.520
I fantasize one day, a decade, when El Salvador has had time to continue to grow and improve,

45:07.520 --> 45:11.640
maybe going down there and spending six months out of the year or three months out of the

45:11.640 --> 45:17.040
year living and working out of El Salvador, or someplace where life is a little slower

45:17.040 --> 45:19.440
and I can spend Bitcoin.

45:19.440 --> 45:25.800
I think to myself, well, how would I feel if I was there and one day they started getting

45:25.800 --> 45:27.960
some of these sanctions like this?

45:27.960 --> 45:32.520
I try to remove myself from the present day and think, where do we take this?

45:32.520 --> 45:36.420
Now that this is a thing, where does this stop now?

45:36.420 --> 45:42.660
If and when we start having an issue with China, will the Western tech companies respond

45:42.660 --> 45:45.160
as strongly in shutting China out?

45:45.160 --> 45:47.160
I suspect they won't.

45:47.160 --> 45:50.940
I think it's going to be an interesting, weird standard that these tech companies are going

45:50.940 --> 45:52.960
to have to apply now.

45:52.960 --> 45:57.440
I would even argue it's very strange that these companies are effectively acting as

45:57.440 --> 45:58.440
nation-states.

45:58.440 --> 46:03.640
They're essentially just applying sanctions of their own.

46:03.640 --> 46:08.720
I suppose nobody wants to be seen as earning money from Russia.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.160
That's got to be a part of it.

46:10.160 --> 46:13.140
But also, you're not earning that much money in Russia.

46:13.140 --> 46:14.800
That's such a great point.

46:14.800 --> 46:20.000
It's easy for them to make this move today because Netflix just made a big deal out of

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
it, but Netflix doesn't even have a million subscribers in Russia, and they're doing it

46:25.000 --> 46:26.840
through a third-party company as well.

46:26.840 --> 46:31.400
It's like, yeah, it really wasn't a big deal for them to pull out of Russia.

46:31.400 --> 46:36.480
To be clear, I don't think either of us condone any kind of invasion or any sort of shit like

46:36.480 --> 46:37.480
that.

46:37.480 --> 46:39.040
Oh, no, of course not.

46:39.040 --> 46:43.240
This is what the centralization, though, that we talk about all the time does enable.

46:43.240 --> 46:47.680
Besides just from control over the market, besides just putting a boot on developers'

46:47.680 --> 46:55.140
face, besides setting the price for what software should be, they also have this ability now.

46:55.140 --> 46:59.760
If Google shuts them off, that's a massive loss for the people.

46:59.760 --> 47:04.860
And probably only really, in my personal opinion, strengthens the regime's control.

47:04.860 --> 47:10.120
And I think we should be careful to say that when you have said it, we have nothing against

47:10.120 --> 47:11.120
Russians.

47:11.120 --> 47:13.200
I don't know what to say on all this stuff.

47:13.200 --> 47:17.400
I feel like there's a lot of virtue signaling going on.

47:17.400 --> 47:23.740
I wish the internet was being used to humanize each other more and bring us closer together

47:23.740 --> 47:27.640
and realize that we have more in common than we have different.

47:27.640 --> 47:34.680
But instead, what we're seeing play out here is we are splitting the internet up.

47:34.680 --> 47:36.840
We're creating different internets.

47:36.840 --> 47:39.720
We're creating three internets effectively, right?

47:39.720 --> 47:46.800
The Eastern European Russian one and the Chinese one and roughly the American Anglo.

47:46.800 --> 47:51.580
And we're using it to drive a wedge between each other and get even further apart, which

47:51.580 --> 47:55.900
is incredible because the technology could be used for exactly the opposite.

47:55.900 --> 47:58.960
But the way things have played out, that's just not how we're using it.

47:58.960 --> 48:03.760
And I just have no other comment other than this is just what we're seeing play out.

48:03.760 --> 48:05.580
These are the times in which we live.

48:05.580 --> 48:08.520
And I do think these things swing.

48:08.520 --> 48:12.280
The Web3 guys, they get a hard time for being pie in the sky.

48:12.280 --> 48:13.280
But...

48:13.280 --> 48:14.460
Oh, from me, right?

48:14.460 --> 48:18.800
But what is like their number one mantra is decentralized.

48:18.800 --> 48:23.640
They I can't say that they make sense, but they're starting to seem a little less crazy

48:23.640 --> 48:24.640
to me.

48:24.640 --> 48:27.760
Yeah, I'm still like, I don't think everything needs a token.

48:27.760 --> 48:34.920
But I do like the idea of decentralized services, decentralized identity, decentralized data,

48:34.920 --> 48:38.480
that kind of stuff I think I'm getting more and more into.

48:38.480 --> 48:39.480
So maybe they're onto something.

48:39.480 --> 48:41.320
Maybe eventually we'll shape out into something.

48:41.320 --> 48:46.280
You know, it's not to tie it into another podcast, but do you listen?

48:46.280 --> 48:48.880
I'm sure you do the Verge cast, right, the Verges?

48:48.880 --> 48:50.360
I have, not regularly, but I definitely have.

48:50.360 --> 48:51.360
I listen regularly.

48:51.360 --> 48:57.120
And one of their kind of chief writers there, Dieter Bohn, he actually moved on to Google.

48:57.120 --> 48:59.800
So they did like a farewell interview with him.

48:59.800 --> 49:02.900
It's interesting because they brought Walt Mossberg back for this.

49:02.900 --> 49:05.960
You should listen to it because I know you like Walt.

49:05.960 --> 49:06.960
Sure.

49:06.960 --> 49:12.280
And Walt and him have been having this multi-year argument about the open web, which is Dieter's

49:12.280 --> 49:13.840
kind of position.

49:13.840 --> 49:18.320
And Walt, you know, was a very, I wouldn't call him an Apple fanboy, but-

49:18.320 --> 49:21.040
But he's basically apps have killed the open internet position, right?

49:21.040 --> 49:22.040
No, Walt is pro-app.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.040
Yeah, right.

49:23.040 --> 49:25.680
Security, blah, blah, blah.

49:25.680 --> 49:29.280
And at the very end, Walt says, I think, you know, with everything going on, you may have

49:29.280 --> 49:30.280
had a point.

49:30.280 --> 49:31.280
Really?

49:31.280 --> 49:34.980
And I'm starting to feel the same way about the hippies that I get irritated with on Telegram

49:34.980 --> 49:37.080
and don't log in for three months.

49:37.080 --> 49:44.880
You all may have a point that when you have centralized app stores, you effectively have

49:44.880 --> 49:52.760
a centralized control system and a kill switch, which I'm not sure we want that.

49:52.760 --> 49:57.800
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

49:57.800 --> 50:02.480
I think that's why somebody as repugnant as Richard Stallman got so much traction for

50:02.480 --> 50:07.960
so long, why he was given so much runway, because he did make some solid core arguments.

50:07.960 --> 50:11.500
The problem is the messenger botched it.

50:11.500 --> 50:13.960
The messenger was also kind of a dickhead, right?

50:13.960 --> 50:14.960
I'm just saying.

50:14.960 --> 50:15.960
Yeah.

50:15.960 --> 50:16.960
Well, that's what I mean.

50:16.960 --> 50:17.960
They botched it.

50:17.960 --> 50:20.280
The free software movement.

50:20.280 --> 50:24.660
It's like it needed Richard Stallman and then it needed to split away from Richard Stallman

50:24.660 --> 50:25.660
a long time ago.

50:25.660 --> 50:31.880
You and I both know somebody who also is very much in line with him that lets his personal

50:31.880 --> 50:40.400
issues get in the way of what I am now coming to believe is a kind of correct message.

50:40.400 --> 50:45.880
It's very anti a lot of what I've been doing, but I kind of, you know, it doesn't sort of

50:45.880 --> 50:52.800
make sense that somebody who is wired to have an extreme personality is also wired to maybe

50:52.800 --> 50:55.920
see things that everybody else isn't really seeing.

50:55.920 --> 50:59.480
Like, you can kind of understand why some of these people are ahead of the curve on

50:59.480 --> 51:00.480
this.

51:00.480 --> 51:01.480
Oh, it makes complete sense.

51:01.480 --> 51:05.440
I'm thinking about the few individuals that I think we both have in mind.

51:05.440 --> 51:10.760
Yeah, obviously being kind of a contrarian, not really giving a crap if people don't like

51:10.760 --> 51:11.760
you, right?

51:11.760 --> 51:20.640
Like if you almost relishing in it, in the one case, I yeah, not the best business choice,

51:20.640 --> 51:23.040
but it's certainly a thing you could do.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.040
Yeah.

51:24.040 --> 51:25.040
It's definitely not the best business choice.

51:25.040 --> 51:30.680
You know, I'm sitting here in front of an iMac pro because reasons.

51:30.680 --> 51:31.680
More and more.

51:31.680 --> 51:38.240
I'm just less and less comfortable with proprietary platforms, especially as we go into things

51:38.240 --> 51:39.240
like VR.

51:39.240 --> 51:41.600
Yeah, I'm really worried about that.

51:41.600 --> 51:48.780
The resources, the ecosystem, it feels like the domain of big tech because it is so it

51:48.780 --> 51:53.760
lends itself to the app store model and it lends itself to a content ecosystem where

51:53.760 --> 51:57.360
you can pop into a room and watch an episode of Star Trek on demand, right?

51:57.360 --> 52:00.880
So that stuff needs deals.

52:00.880 --> 52:04.420
There's no like open ecosystem for that kind of thing as far as I know.

52:04.420 --> 52:09.320
So I worry, I worry a lot about VR and my family this whole last weekend in the evening,

52:09.320 --> 52:15.000
we sat down and I let each kid spend a little bit of time in VR and explore it and my youngest,

52:15.000 --> 52:20.400
she loves the chill out, like go in the forest, plant trees, feed the animals games.

52:20.400 --> 52:21.400
What game is that?

52:21.400 --> 52:22.520
It's one of the Oculus ones.

52:22.520 --> 52:27.720
It might even be pre-installed or if it's not, it's just like in one of their meditation

52:27.720 --> 52:28.720
areas.

52:28.720 --> 52:30.400
It's actually kind of nice.

52:30.400 --> 52:35.920
My middle child, she likes the Beat Saber type stuff and my oldest, he is a big fan

52:35.920 --> 52:39.200
of like the socialized metaverse, go in and talk to people.

52:39.200 --> 52:46.520
He went into Facebook's metaverse thing and they actually have it staffed.

52:46.520 --> 52:55.120
Facebook or Meta is paying people to staff their virtual like, you know, amusement park

52:55.120 --> 52:56.120
games.

52:56.120 --> 52:59.600
So you go in there and there is Meta employees that are explaining to you how to play the

52:59.600 --> 53:04.080
games and get you on the ride, like in a real amusement park.

53:04.080 --> 53:05.720
That's what they're spending their money on.

53:05.720 --> 53:10.200
It's incredible and I just, when you see that sort of stuff, I don't really see how free

53:10.200 --> 53:15.640
software and Linux is really going to compete or when you look at gaming like Microsoft

53:15.640 --> 53:18.520
with their Xbox streaming platform.

53:18.520 --> 53:24.120
And I know you noticed this week that they're like doing a whole flight simulator API system.

53:24.120 --> 53:27.560
I don't even know really what it does, but to me it seems like this is an obvious direction

53:27.560 --> 53:31.740
where they can take their technology, their cloud tech and make it available as like an

53:31.740 --> 53:33.320
API.

53:33.320 --> 53:34.960
So it's not a flight simulator system.

53:34.960 --> 53:43.120
They're using Azure to make Xbox cloud services available to other people, to other developers.

53:43.120 --> 53:46.800
The flight simulator is Microsoft flight simulator was their test case.

53:46.800 --> 53:50.840
So the way they're getting it to work on lower powered Xboxes is through the cloud, leveraging

53:50.840 --> 53:52.600
it off on cloud services.

53:52.600 --> 53:57.300
So again, you could see how you could take something like the Oculus Quest that maybe

53:57.300 --> 54:01.040
doesn't have enough horsepower if you want some decent battery life and you could supplement

54:01.040 --> 54:03.260
it with something like this.

54:03.260 --> 54:08.360
And again, I just don't see that being in the domain of a free software project.

54:08.360 --> 54:09.360
I don't know.

54:09.360 --> 54:10.360
We'll see.

54:10.360 --> 54:13.680
It's tricky for sure, but everyone in my family is a believer now.

54:13.680 --> 54:15.280
We're all on board.

54:15.280 --> 54:16.280
They all want one.

54:16.280 --> 54:19.480
I'm not getting them one.

54:19.480 --> 54:21.560
We're only going to have one VR headset in the family.

54:21.560 --> 54:24.920
That's one of the ways I'm just going to kind of tap the brakes on this thing.

54:24.920 --> 54:27.560
Yeah, the same here.

54:27.560 --> 54:32.360
I have barely used the Oculus other than the first couple of days early in the morning

54:32.360 --> 54:41.480
because the 14 year old is scary addicted to it.

54:41.480 --> 54:45.240
I think there's a whole set of problems that are going to come, not for us personally,

54:45.240 --> 54:50.240
but society as a whole from these more immersive experiences.

54:50.240 --> 54:54.720
Probably so far it's been positive for us.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.880
It really has.

54:56.880 --> 54:59.900
They move around more than when they're playing on their iPads.

54:59.900 --> 55:02.200
The socialization has been good.

55:02.200 --> 55:06.200
That aspect I was a little concerned about, but in small doses, it's been interesting

55:06.200 --> 55:07.200
and good.

55:07.200 --> 55:12.520
It's been fun to watch them be creative because you can cast the Oculus to your phone or to

55:12.520 --> 55:17.360
your computer, and it adds a little bit of extra load to the Oculus.

55:17.360 --> 55:21.400
I can see what they're seeing in a 2D version, which is fantastic for walking them through

55:21.400 --> 55:22.780
stuff.

55:22.780 --> 55:26.600
It's fun to watch them explore and play in there, but I do think it would be something

55:26.600 --> 55:31.440
that I would set rules around on total amount of time and stuff like that.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.440
It's all going to be interesting.

55:33.440 --> 55:39.600
I've been really thinking, when you look at the macroeconomic situation going on in the

55:39.600 --> 55:45.240
US, when you look at the conflicts going on in Ukraine and the long-term ramifications

55:45.240 --> 55:52.780
between Russia and China and all of what's going to come of this conflict, when you look

55:52.780 --> 55:57.280
at how the tech industry is changing, when you look at what's brewing in the cryptocurrency

55:57.280 --> 56:03.780
community and Bitcoin and you look at what's going on with VR, I can't help but feel like

56:03.780 --> 56:08.500
the ride to 2030 is going to be like nothing we've experienced so far.

56:08.500 --> 56:14.280
These last 40 years of my life were just like nothing compared to what we're about to go

56:14.280 --> 56:17.160
through in the next eight years or so.

56:17.160 --> 56:19.120
It's going to be wild.

56:19.120 --> 56:21.000
It's going to be a blur.

56:21.000 --> 56:27.120
We're going to be struggling to make sense of it every single day for a while.

56:27.120 --> 56:29.040
But tis the season.

56:29.040 --> 56:32.480
I guess we'll see how we do.

56:32.480 --> 56:35.920
So far, our track records have been pretty good on the calls, but we'll see how we do.

56:35.920 --> 56:40.960
That's why in a way, the meetup feels almost like life returning to normal.

56:40.960 --> 56:45.840
We're just going to get together and hang out and be at a park and eat barbecue and

56:45.840 --> 56:47.640
talk about stuff.

56:47.640 --> 56:50.920
That's weirdly normal all of a sudden.

56:50.920 --> 56:54.680
That's why I'm looking forward to that meetup big time.

56:54.680 --> 56:55.680
It's less than a month away.

56:55.680 --> 56:56.680
It sounds like a party.

56:56.680 --> 57:00.240
Well, then, just last but not least, I'll say thank you to our members, everybody who

57:00.240 --> 57:02.400
joined us at CoderQA.co.

57:02.400 --> 57:05.560
You are the heroes of this show and we'd love some more support.

57:05.560 --> 57:11.840
You get this show with limited ads to no ads, actually, and you also get the same production

57:11.840 --> 57:14.360
quality that Drew always puts into it, which is nice.

57:14.360 --> 57:18.820
You just get a slightly more compact version and you get our Coderly report, which comes

57:18.820 --> 57:20.760
out once a quarter.

57:20.760 --> 57:21.760
We appreciate that.

57:21.760 --> 57:26.000
If you want to support this show and all of the shows on the network, well, that's at

jupiter.party.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.560
I stuck my hands out to celebrate all of the shows and I knocked over my pen because I

57:31.560 --> 57:36.280
was so excited about you supporting all the shows at jupiter.party.

57:36.280 --> 57:37.760
Anywhere you want to send folks?

57:37.760 --> 57:42.400
Alice.dev and at Dumanuco, D-O-M-I-C-C-U-O.

57:42.400 --> 57:45.640
I hope that that was wrong, but at Dumanuco on Twitter.

57:45.640 --> 57:47.080
Tell you what, I'll link it in the show notes.

57:47.080 --> 57:48.620
How about that?

57:48.620 --> 57:54.680
Don't tell my very dead uncle that I forgot how to spell our real last name.

57:54.680 --> 57:59.080
Thanks to what we talked about today, coder.show slash 456.

57:59.080 --> 58:00.800
You can join our matrix community.

58:00.800 --> 58:02.880
We've got some Coder Radio chats over there.

58:02.880 --> 58:03.880
Take the blue pill.

58:03.880 --> 58:04.880
Matrix is terrible.

58:04.880 --> 58:05.880
IRC for life.

58:05.880 --> 58:06.880
Yeah, that's probably true.

58:06.880 --> 58:07.880
That's probably true.

58:07.880 --> 58:10.480
It's a little rough, but it's colony.jupiterbroadcasting.com.

58:10.480 --> 58:13.760
That's colony.jupiterbroadcasting.com if you want to join us.

58:13.760 --> 58:14.760
We're live on Mondays.

58:14.760 --> 58:19.400
If you'd like to join us live and we love your feedback at coder.show slash contact.

58:19.400 --> 58:21.360
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode.

See you right back here next week.
