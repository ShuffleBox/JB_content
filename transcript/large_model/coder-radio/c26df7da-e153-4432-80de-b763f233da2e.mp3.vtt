00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 424 for July 26, 2021.

00:15.760 --> 00:20.560
Hello friend and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.560 --> 00:25.320
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.240
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.640
A Cloud Guru has cloud playgrounds.

00:29.640 --> 00:36.580
Now these are Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

00:36.580 --> 00:40.760
Go get certified, get hired, get learning at thecloudguru.com.

00:40.760 --> 00:46.640
My name is Chris and joining us one last time from the beach of Florida, it is our host,

00:46.640 --> 00:47.640
Mr. Dominic.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.640
Hello, Mike.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.640
Hello, Mr. Fisher.

00:49.640 --> 00:50.640
How are you?

00:50.640 --> 00:54.560
You know, I just assume you do every episode on the beach down there with that beautiful

00:54.560 --> 00:57.560
Florida sand, crystal clear water.

00:57.560 --> 01:00.560
No, it's kind of a dreary day today actually.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.560
Really?

01:01.560 --> 01:06.520
Yeah, but this is, this is our last, you know, official regular Florida episode.

01:06.520 --> 01:10.680
I feel like it's going to be a shift, you know, cause there was pre-Florida and then

01:10.680 --> 01:15.480
there was post-Florida and now, I don't know, it's not really, it's not really going back

01:15.480 --> 01:18.680
because like when I went independent again, it wasn't a backwards step.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.400
It was a good forward step.

01:20.400 --> 01:25.280
Like for you, it seems like this is actually a good move, but it's like how it used to

01:25.280 --> 01:26.280
be.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.680
And now they're coming back the way they were.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.680
Right.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.920
We're normalizing back to our one o'clock right after lunch or, or, you know, your lunchtime

01:32.920 --> 01:33.920
break.

01:33.920 --> 01:34.920
You know?

01:34.920 --> 01:38.480
We are staying live on Mondays, but we're moving it to 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.800
So that's no more drinking.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.080
Well, I mean, maybe actually sometimes a lunch drink is kind of nice actually.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.960
If you listen back to the bad catalog, that definitely wasn't true.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.880
Actually, I kind of love the idea of like going out to lunch, having a drink, coming

01:50.880 --> 01:51.880
in, shooting, shoot.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.720
Actually for me, it'd be brunch, right?

01:53.720 --> 01:56.760
Come in, shoot the crap with you and then go lay down and take a nap.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.240
That actually sounds like a great afternoon.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.240
Yeah.

01:59.240 --> 02:02.320
Well, this is back, you know, and for those who haven't performed closely, I will be doing

02:02.320 --> 02:04.820
Jersey Mike is going back to Jersey.

02:04.820 --> 02:05.820
How is that going?

02:05.820 --> 02:08.840
I know you've been doing stage one and we want to talk about working during the move,

02:08.840 --> 02:12.920
but just like on a high level status update, how is that move going?

02:12.920 --> 02:16.840
You know, on a high level, like any big project or move, there's been complications, but it's

02:16.840 --> 02:18.240
overall going well.

02:18.240 --> 02:24.200
It's and I hate to say this, but it's on schedule, but you know, that, yeah, just like any dev

02:24.200 --> 02:28.920
project saying something's on schedule is like begging for a problem, right?

02:28.920 --> 02:29.920
Yeah.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.440
It's just basically means you haven't figured out what's going wrong yet.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.440
Right.

02:33.440 --> 02:34.440
Well, I will.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.440
We'll get to it shortly, but I did.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.440
Something did go wrong.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.440
You know, tomorrow is a big day.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.880
I'm flying with with the little one tomorrow.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.120
Ah, that's the day, huh?

02:43.120 --> 02:45.200
The flight is at six a.m.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.760
Both of you have to be up at four a.m.

02:46.760 --> 02:47.760
Yes.

02:47.760 --> 02:52.480
So this, you know, and, you know, mass mandate, fine.

02:52.480 --> 02:54.400
Makes tons of sense to me.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.400
But five year olds.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.400
I don't know.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.400
Right.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.240
This is going to be, I think, a little taxing.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.240
Yeah.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.240
Yeah.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.240
Yeah.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.240
It's a lot.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.240
That's a big ask for someone that age.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.240
Right.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.240
Especially don't touch this.

03:06.240 --> 03:07.240
You got to wash your hands.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.240
You got to plus security.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.240
I bet it should be fine.

03:09.240 --> 03:13.920
I've flown with him before, but this is, you know, I just had a travel experience both

03:13.920 --> 03:19.600
on the Amtrak and which for those outside the US is basically our what is it, like a

03:19.600 --> 03:25.160
weird federal pseudo government train system, right?

03:25.160 --> 03:26.160
This is more an unfiltered topic.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.160
But you know, Amtrak is actually the government.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.160
Yeah.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.160
Yeah.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.160
Yeah.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.160
It's like some weird private.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.160
Yeah.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.160
Pseudo private, whatever.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.160
And then I flew.

03:35.160 --> 03:40.560
And like on the one hand, I got to give it to Newark Airport, which I so I took the train

03:40.560 --> 03:41.560
up and I flew back.

03:41.560 --> 03:46.240
I don't know how this is possible, but somehow COVID has made them more efficient.

03:46.240 --> 03:47.240
What?

03:47.240 --> 03:48.240
They're just fast.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.760
I think it's because they like are less concerned.

03:50.760 --> 03:51.760
Yeah.

03:51.760 --> 03:52.760
Less people.

03:52.760 --> 03:53.760
Maybe that's probably what it is.

03:53.760 --> 03:57.360
Actually, I didn't think of it, but, but the Amtrak was a goddamn mess.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.360
Really?

03:58.360 --> 03:59.360
Okay.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.360
Well, we'll get there.

04:00.360 --> 04:01.360
We will get there first.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.080
I need your advice on this.

04:03.080 --> 04:06.560
You know how we get a lot of these emails into the show about, Hey, you know, so-and-so

04:06.560 --> 04:07.560
just put a book out.

04:07.560 --> 04:10.920
Would you like to have them on the show or so-and-so just sold their first company?

04:10.920 --> 04:11.920
Would you like to have them on the show?

04:11.920 --> 04:16.640
Like we get, we get so many of those a week, people constantly trying to, trying to come

04:16.640 --> 04:18.960
on the show to like market their thing.

04:18.960 --> 04:22.920
And like, sometimes they try to pretend like they listen to the show and sometimes they

04:22.920 --> 04:23.920
don't.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.240
They just, it's just obviously a template, but I want, I want to know what you think

04:27.240 --> 04:28.400
I ought to get about this one.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.500
So I opened up this one.

04:29.500 --> 04:33.620
I don't even open them all anymore cause I can spot most of them by the subject line,

04:33.620 --> 04:40.040
but this one comes from Sarah M and she writes, would you be interested in acquiring Dell

04:40.040 --> 04:42.440
EMC user data?

04:42.440 --> 04:47.440
We provide an extra edge to companies like yours by providing user data to unleash the

04:47.440 --> 04:52.680
competition and gain an aggressive lead over your arch rivals.

04:52.680 --> 04:57.920
You'll get a continuously updated data set with access to direct dial of phone numbers,

04:57.920 --> 05:02.680
email addresses, and professional background information so that accordingly you can craft

05:02.680 --> 05:06.080
the right sales pitch to target the right prospect.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.160
Let me know if this is something that would interest you and I'll share a sample file

05:09.160 --> 05:12.840
for your review along with the total counts available for pricing.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.840
Thanks.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.560
Sarah Moon, marketing manager at tech data optimizer Inc.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.200
I looked up tech data optimizer Inc doesn't exist.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.520
Not a real company.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.000
You just answered a huge question for me.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.680
I've been getting tons of spam on my work email.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.680
This is why, isn't it?

05:26.680 --> 05:27.680
It's the damn show.

05:27.680 --> 05:30.200
They hacked Dell EMC or somebody did.

05:30.200 --> 05:34.880
They got Dell EMC user data apparently and now they're just selling it out there.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.880
Wow.

05:35.880 --> 05:36.880
Yeah.

05:36.880 --> 05:41.720
It's like as if, as if the Coder Radio program would want to buy this hot user data and like

05:41.720 --> 05:44.320
market to people in it.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.240
I don't know what you thinking.

05:46.240 --> 05:47.600
I have been getting tons of these.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.600
I thought it was just like my email was on some stupid list.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.640
Oh, it probably is.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.000
Do I report this to Dell?

05:54.000 --> 05:57.640
Do I like forward this to some, is there some email address?

05:57.640 --> 05:58.960
I just marked them as spam.

05:58.960 --> 05:59.960
Is that bad?

05:59.960 --> 06:00.960
Should I be reporting this stuff?

06:00.960 --> 06:05.440
I mean, I normally do too, but when she's sitting there selling user data from Dell,

06:05.440 --> 06:07.240
how do you know it's real user data?

06:07.240 --> 06:09.040
She says she provides samples.

06:09.040 --> 06:14.720
You mean the, the, the almost certainly illegitimate spammer.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.000
It's wild.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.120
Just the emails we get in.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.080
And that's why I appreciate the legit emails.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.080
And honestly, how do you know she's a she?

06:21.080 --> 06:22.080
Just throwing it out there.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.400
I don't, I don't, you know, I mean, I don't even know if Sarah Moon doesn't even sound

06:25.400 --> 06:26.400
like a real name.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.920
I'm thinking it's like EMC.py, right?

06:28.920 --> 06:29.920
It's a Python script.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.920
Yeah.

06:30.920 --> 06:36.920
I wonder if they have any, any data on Alan Jude, you know, we get some good market research

06:36.920 --> 06:37.920
on Alan Jude.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.240
You know, if we could spy on those BSD people, that's, that's good.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.240
Might be worth it.

06:42.240 --> 06:48.000
Now, if they want it to sell me the M one specifications, well, all right.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.740
So Daniel writes in, speaking of the M one, he says, hi Chris and Mike, I was listening

06:52.740 --> 06:56.420
to the recent show and Mike was complaining about the terminals on the Mac and talking

06:56.420 --> 06:59.000
about how he's liking the direction of the new windows terminal.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.160
Well, good news for you, Mr. Dominic, are you ready for this?

07:03.160 --> 07:05.660
There is a new terminal emulator that's in the work.

07:05.660 --> 07:09.840
It's currently in private alpha, but you can request access to it.

07:09.840 --> 07:13.240
It's available at warp.dev.

07:13.240 --> 07:17.480
The project is focusing on Mac OS first and then branching out to Linux and windows and

07:17.480 --> 07:20.880
the web has a really nice slick look to it.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.260
And from the screencast they have available online, it seems very impressive.

07:24.260 --> 07:31.200
And I think Chris will enjoy the fact that it is written in rust.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.200
I do.

07:34.200 --> 07:41.240
Yeah, so it's called warp, warp.dev, I'll have a link in the show notes.

07:41.240 --> 07:45.240
And I mean, as far as terminals go, I'm not a very picky guy anymore, but it, it does

07:45.240 --> 07:47.280
look awfully fancy.

07:47.280 --> 07:52.600
And it's just a pleasure to see something not written in basically electron, you know,

07:52.600 --> 07:57.400
at least not using electron and written in web, web technology, because so many of these

07:57.400 --> 07:59.360
things that I've seen recently have just been web apps.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.880
Yeah, I actually, uh, I read this email this morning.

08:01.880 --> 08:02.880
I got excited.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.360
I actually reached out to the warp folks.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.360
Did you?

08:05.360 --> 08:06.360
So I'm hoping to hear back.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.360
Yeah.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.240
Cause, uh, they tease you with this beautiful looking website and then it's like, Oh, but

08:10.240 --> 08:11.880
we'll let you know when you can try the beta.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.080
I'm like, give me the beta.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.080
Yeah.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.080
I signed up for the beta.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.080
Yeah.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.160
I don't do that often, but I was like, no, give me the beta.

08:19.160 --> 08:23.120
But Ethan writes in, it says, loves the show, uh, and he says, I have to agree with Chris's

08:23.120 --> 08:24.120
take on gnome.

08:24.120 --> 08:28.400
I certainly didn't know their philosophy before I didn't realize they were so delusional.

08:28.400 --> 08:33.240
Sadly, though, as a blind Linux user, who's worked on and off Linux over the past decade,

08:33.240 --> 08:35.320
I'm pretty much locked to gnome.

08:35.320 --> 08:39.520
This is primarily because of Orca, the gnome screen reader for Linux, which is the only

08:39.520 --> 08:45.120
screen reader for Linux that is not console based and works with the majority of applications.

08:45.120 --> 08:49.960
This therefore means I'll always need gnome no matter what desktop environment I may want

08:49.960 --> 08:51.640
to go with.

08:51.640 --> 08:55.920
There's some like LXDE that do pretty good, but it all really comes down to Orca.

08:55.920 --> 09:00.120
And since Orca is a gnome based product, it generally works the best with gnome based

09:00.120 --> 09:01.120
applications.

09:01.120 --> 09:06.020
I tried plasma earlier this year because you've spoken so highly of it, but unfortunately

09:06.020 --> 09:08.040
it was inaccessible for me.

09:08.040 --> 09:12.360
Then I found out that much of gnome and even other apps like electron based apps are not

09:12.360 --> 09:13.960
accessible when they're on Wayland.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.480
I'm not quite sure why it is, but it seems like they're supposedly going to be working

09:17.480 --> 09:18.480
on it.

09:18.480 --> 09:22.160
However, when someone is blind or has a visual impairment who must use a screen reader for

09:22.160 --> 09:26.880
everything to use Linux, I along with the majority of blind Linux users just have to

09:26.880 --> 09:29.720
use gnome or LXDE pretty much exclusively.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.160
I'd love to hear your thoughts about this.

09:31.160 --> 09:36.120
I'm quite sad that gnome has fallen so far because they once used to be a great organization,

09:36.120 --> 09:38.360
but I'm even sadder that I can't switch away.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.360
Ethan.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.600
I'm going to let you go first on this one.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.080
I wish I had something better to say.

09:44.080 --> 09:49.360
This has been an ongoing problem for a really long time, and I know each desktop environment

09:49.360 --> 09:54.040
has their different initiatives, but often I have heard that Orca is the best screen

09:54.040 --> 10:00.980
reader for Linux, and that's a really tricky area because Linux is already so understaffed,

10:00.980 --> 10:04.240
if you will, in the desktop area.

10:04.240 --> 10:09.340
There's really nobody that's handling some of these really hard problems that could be

10:09.340 --> 10:13.680
involved at all the decision-making levels because if you think about, in order to support

10:13.680 --> 10:17.440
something like screen reading top class, you have to be part of the conversation when you're

10:17.440 --> 10:21.840
designing the UI of applications and the system and the control panel applets and all that

10:21.840 --> 10:22.840
kind of stuff.

10:22.840 --> 10:26.760
You really have to be thinking about it consistently and continuously, and it has to be a member

10:26.760 --> 10:31.200
of the team who's advocating for those things, and that's not how free software development

10:31.200 --> 10:32.200
works.

10:32.200 --> 10:36.400
It's different people desperately working on different aspects of a code base on their

10:36.400 --> 10:42.240
own, and they don't have a PMO who's making sure that they hit these key results for this

10:42.240 --> 10:43.240
application.

10:43.240 --> 10:47.840
It's just not how things go, and so I think it's an area where Linux struggles particularly

10:47.840 --> 10:54.400
badly, and it's an opportunity for improvement, and it's an area where commercial desktops

10:54.400 --> 10:58.720
and platforms in general are generally going to be a little more disciplined about that

10:58.720 --> 11:03.980
kind of thing in my experience, and so I appreciated Ethan's perspective on that GNOME conversation

11:03.980 --> 11:04.980
we were having.

11:04.980 --> 11:07.080
Yeah, I mean, for me, I don't know much about Orca.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.480
I mean, it sounds great, man.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.920
If the screen reader is working for you, that's awesome.

11:10.920 --> 11:15.040
I almost feel like I'm going to have to just pass on this one, only because I have nothing

11:15.040 --> 11:17.360
new to say on GNOME that I haven't already said.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, boy, man.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.620
Here's the thing, too.

11:21.620 --> 11:24.880
The vast majority of our email this week was about this, like...

11:24.880 --> 11:25.880
Was extremely negative.

11:25.880 --> 11:26.880
Right.

11:26.880 --> 11:27.880
It was, yeah.

11:27.880 --> 11:28.880
Yeah.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.880
Yeah.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.600
So here's what I did, because we couldn't just do this.

11:31.600 --> 11:37.000
We legitimately could fill three episodes with just the feedback about GNOME.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.400
I am reading it all.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.920
I've grabbed one more for this episode, and then I think what I'll do is I'll read the

11:41.920 --> 11:45.640
others and maybe one other will come on, or I'll just respond to them directly or whatever.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.920
I still want to get people's thoughts.

11:47.920 --> 11:51.320
It helps me inform my position.

11:51.320 --> 11:56.760
Getting people's experiences at a large scale is actually a pretty useful data signal, data

11:56.760 --> 11:57.760
point for me.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.600
Anyways, Dan comes in with his own GNOME hot take, and this is our last one.

12:00.600 --> 12:04.320
He said, I want to chime in with your discussion for the GNOME desktop, and I 100% agree.

12:04.320 --> 12:09.200
The GNOME developers are building a terrific product for a market that is not there.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.320
I've recently tried out Fedora Silverblue, and the default GNOME experience is pretty

12:12.320 --> 12:16.280
good out of the box, but I always reach a point where things start driving me nuts.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.880
What really annoys me about this, though, is not a new problem.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.040
It's been like this for a decade.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.040
I have to agree.

12:23.040 --> 12:28.420
GNOME would be a terrific environment if desktop Linux was a thing outside of, like, developers.

12:28.420 --> 12:33.080
I can imagine my grandma using something like Fedora Silverblue or OpenSUSE or MicroOS Desktop

12:33.080 --> 12:36.200
with GNOME 40 after I explained it to her.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.540
But beyond this niche, there's Windows, there's Mac.

12:39.540 --> 12:44.200
They're already solving this problem, and I don't see anyone using a vanilla GNOME install

12:44.200 --> 12:45.200
at all.

12:45.200 --> 12:49.160
Have a great week, and a successful and quick move to Michael.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.560
Well, thank you for the well wishes, of course.

12:51.560 --> 12:55.840
I have to say, I was pretty blown away by the amount of feedback we got on this one.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.980
I think, you know, we have an audience that's very technical.

12:58.980 --> 13:03.040
They're using these as development workstations in a lot of cases, and that's not the direction

13:03.040 --> 13:04.040
the project's going in.

13:04.040 --> 13:07.820
So I think that's why it resonated with people so much.

13:07.820 --> 13:10.880
You've already made your peace with it when your backgrounds couldn't be changed anymore.

13:10.880 --> 13:11.960
You made your peace with this, right?

13:11.960 --> 13:16.000
But there's a whole new generation or a whole new wave of GNOME users who saw this blog

13:16.000 --> 13:19.960
post and went, oh, man, they're detached from reality, and they're not building this for

13:19.960 --> 13:20.960
me.

13:20.960 --> 13:21.960
Like, this confirms it.

13:21.960 --> 13:22.960
They put it over the top for a lot of people.

13:22.960 --> 13:27.840
You know, I feel like this is one of those topics that's going to seem, and there were

13:27.840 --> 13:29.240
a bunch of them over the years, right?

13:29.240 --> 13:30.240
We've been doing this forever.

13:30.240 --> 13:34.360
That's going to seem like a really big deal for maybe another six to eight months.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.360
Yeah.

13:35.360 --> 13:40.500
But by mid-2022, let's say this time next year, it's going to resolve itself in one

13:40.500 --> 13:41.500
of two ways.

13:41.500 --> 13:46.880
And I could give you my prediction if we're going to fry some bacon here.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.640
You have a prediction?

13:48.640 --> 13:51.080
It's kind of an A or B prediction, right?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.880
One of two things is going to happen.

13:53.880 --> 13:59.400
Someone in desktop Linux is going to, quote unquote, resolve these issues, right?

13:59.400 --> 14:02.080
I'm not going to get into the pissing contest of are these real issues.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.720
I think they are.

14:03.720 --> 14:07.160
Other people don't, and I get that.

14:07.160 --> 14:13.360
Or goddamn, those M1s are sexy, and people are going to go back to the Mac.

14:13.360 --> 14:17.840
And when I say people, I mean the people who would listen to this show, right?

14:17.840 --> 14:20.560
The more pragmatic developer audience.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.760
And I know we have a lot of freedom diehards.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.760
And that's cool.

14:24.760 --> 14:25.760
Great.

14:25.760 --> 14:28.640
You know, I personally, I did accept the KDE challenge.

14:28.640 --> 14:29.640
I haven't done it yet.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.320
I'll do it probably over the winter break.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.320
Yeah.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.320
Take your time.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.320
Don't rush it.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.320
Right.

14:35.320 --> 14:39.580
So maybe I'll use plasma, and it'll be like, you know, suck off his eyes wide open, right?

14:39.580 --> 14:40.580
By the way.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.640
There you go.

14:41.640 --> 14:47.880
My hot tip for taking on a plasma challenge is, say it's a five-day challenge or a seven-day

14:47.880 --> 14:51.600
challenge, each day adopt a new plasma way of doing something.

14:51.600 --> 14:55.440
Train yourself on something new each day, like maybe how you launch an application or

14:55.440 --> 14:57.040
manage Windows or something.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.000
And that made it a lot smoother for me.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Okay.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.440
Todd wrote in, he summed it up and said, yeah, here's the thing, guys, and you missed this

15:04.440 --> 15:05.440
point.

15:05.440 --> 15:09.600
Basically, I'm summarizing Todd, but he said, the thing that's going to save Linux, and

15:09.600 --> 15:11.080
it's always the thing that saves Linux.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.080
Server.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.080
Is choice.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.680
Well, yeah, right, but the server.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.780
But the thing that really is going to save the desktop environment is you have choice.

15:17.780 --> 15:21.760
On Mac OS or on Windows, if they may, if Apple makes a bad UI decision or Microsoft makes

15:21.760 --> 15:24.420
a bad UI decision, you're screwed.

15:24.420 --> 15:27.260
But on Linux, you can just switch to a different desktop environment.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.400
And because you have choice, it saves everything.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.240
And I just don't know if I agree with that anymore.

15:32.240 --> 15:39.440
I used to think that way, but now looking at the years of just all of the energy and

15:39.440 --> 15:43.520
developer time being dispersed into all of these different areas and the fragmentation

15:43.520 --> 15:48.320
that it's caused and talking to developers who didn't really know how to even begin to

15:48.320 --> 15:52.520
target the Linux desktop for years now, I don't know if I totally agree with Todd.

15:52.520 --> 15:56.480
I think it is also the thing that saves Linux at the same time, though.

15:56.480 --> 16:02.600
It's both a huge impedance, the fragmentation, and it's also, I think, ultimately, kind of

16:02.600 --> 16:03.600
an organic savior.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.760
Well, I mean, I think there's a lot of things going on, right?

16:05.760 --> 16:09.240
Like, when I first started out with Linux, way back, you know, when I was listening to

16:09.240 --> 16:15.960
you and Lunduke, when I was, oh, we owe you that, in the early aughts, whatever it was,

16:15.960 --> 16:21.240
you know, it was no offense to everybody at Canonical, but Ubuntu was fucking garbage,

16:21.240 --> 16:22.240
right?

16:22.240 --> 16:24.900
Like, it just was, it was, it was bad.

16:24.900 --> 16:25.900
I mean, it was-

16:25.900 --> 16:29.760
And early Ubuntu was considered a pretty big step up from standard Linux back then.

16:29.760 --> 16:30.760
Right.

16:30.760 --> 16:35.640
But, you know, if, if Pop OS existed, I mean, maybe I would have still went the way I went

16:35.640 --> 16:40.560
because of, like, you know, my, my kind of breakout thing was iPhone development.

16:40.560 --> 16:46.720
But barring that, I don't know that I ever would have been, like, over to the Mac side.

16:46.720 --> 16:51.440
My point being, it's, it's important to recognize there's been just a ton of progress, right?

16:51.440 --> 16:56.360
I remember fiddling with Wi-Fi drivers and having to, like, ethernet in to download some

16:56.360 --> 17:00.860
stupid script that you had to run or copy pasta something into ETC, whatever.

17:00.860 --> 17:04.280
Now you just have to adjust the power mode so that way your transfer rate's reasonable,

17:04.280 --> 17:05.280
but it connects.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.560
Oh, you're using my own tips against me.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.400
We'll link to that in the show notes.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.400
Wow.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.400
That was good, right?

17:11.400 --> 17:15.720
And I like how that's broken on, like, most of the laptops that most Linux vendors ship.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.720
Yeah.

17:16.720 --> 17:17.720
Ooh.

17:17.720 --> 17:18.720
Anything that's really used in Ubuntu, right?

17:18.720 --> 17:21.880
Well, because they want to pump their battery life.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.980
So they default to the power.

17:23.980 --> 17:28.880
So for those who don't know, on Twitter, I was having just a bear of a time with my Wi-Fi

17:28.880 --> 17:32.480
speeds and I had my Mac book next to my system 76.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.480
And this is an, oh, I'm sorry.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.480
Next to my ThinkPad.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.200
Actually all three of them.

17:37.200 --> 17:43.480
And I was getting roughly just shy of double the bit, the I'm talking down, right?

17:43.480 --> 17:49.840
The down bandwidth on the Google speed test and using the same speed test, the same network,

17:49.840 --> 17:54.920
same machines averaging out, doing everything the right mathematical way.

17:54.920 --> 17:55.920
And it took me forever.

17:55.920 --> 17:59.960
And I started like, you know, you get into this world where you're on the dark side of

17:59.960 --> 18:04.920
the Ubuntu forums that haven't been looked at since like 20, 2015.

18:04.920 --> 18:08.360
You're already, as soon as you see the post date, you're like, oh no, I'm screwed.

18:08.360 --> 18:13.520
And there's like one dude who's like, dude, just going to get them or nano and you sick

18:13.520 --> 18:14.520
weirdos.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.520
Somebody wrote in about nano.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.520
Hell yeah.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.680
And edit this file.

18:17.680 --> 18:21.800
Change a three to a two, I think is what it was, but you can, it's in my Twitter feed

18:21.800 --> 18:22.800
somewhere.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.800
Sure.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.480
Change a three to two, save it, restart the machine.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.600
That sounds stupid.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.160
I did it right on par with the Mac.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.160
Now it's faster.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.160
Yeah.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.440
But there's a price.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.440
Battery life went down.

18:36.440 --> 18:37.440
Yes.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.440
Yeah.

18:38.440 --> 18:39.440
I'm both the think one carbon.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.440
I'm sorry.

18:40.440 --> 18:46.280
The ThinkPad carbon and the, uh, I, I believe it's the lemur that I have, right?

18:46.280 --> 18:47.280
That sounds right.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.280
I always confuse it with the Galileo.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.640
I think it's a lemur.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.340
So I don't know.

18:51.340 --> 18:54.120
Is it to me, I pay a lot for bandwidth.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.120
I like having bandwidth.

18:56.120 --> 18:59.480
I'm just going to say my M1 Mac can do it without any power savings.

18:59.480 --> 19:04.760
Well, yeah, it's probably doing it dynamically or some, you know, clever thing like that.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.180
I will also know while we're talking about laptops, the framework laptop has started

19:08.180 --> 19:09.240
shipping to customers.

19:09.240 --> 19:14.440
That's that DIY modular and the early reviews decent sounds like it's early days for the

19:14.440 --> 19:20.840
hardware Linux, you know, longer, older Linux's are still not really well supported yet, but

19:20.840 --> 19:21.840
it's getting there.

19:21.840 --> 19:22.840
It's getting there.

19:22.840 --> 19:27.520
I may, I may end up, uh, asking for a review unit or see if I can't twist his West's arm

19:27.520 --> 19:30.440
on actually pulling the trigger on purchasing one he's been thinking about.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.440
We'll see.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.440
Cause I wanted to see it.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.080
I want to see it to believe it.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.640
I want to see everyone's faces too.

19:35.640 --> 19:40.560
We have two meetups coming up, one in Salt Lake city on August 7th, the other in Denver,

19:40.560 --> 19:44.080
August 20th links to both those meetups will be in the show notes or you can just go to

19:44.080 --> 19:46.040
meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

19:46.040 --> 19:51.960
We have locked in the venues, really great venues for both Salt Lake city and Denver.

19:51.960 --> 19:57.480
I have a box full of swag I'm bringing with me some great art that Linode helped us put

19:57.480 --> 19:58.480
together.

19:58.480 --> 20:02.840
Their design team created some really great unique stickers just for the road trip.

20:02.840 --> 20:07.040
So if you're in the area and you can make it love, I'd love you to join us.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.360
It'd be great to actually see people again.

20:10.360 --> 20:15.000
It's super, super useful to actually like put faces to names and the whole thing.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.120
Like it's, it's part of the process and we'd love to have you involved, meetup.com slash

20:19.120 --> 20:24.320
Jupiter broadcasting and then like a maniac, I'm going to have a live tracker on me during

20:24.320 --> 20:25.540
the road trip.

20:25.540 --> 20:28.760
So if you're in our route, if it looks like we're going to be in your area, maybe you

20:28.760 --> 20:29.760
can get ahold of me.

20:29.760 --> 20:34.880
I'll have a form and all of that at colonytracker.live once I'm on the road.

20:34.880 --> 20:39.280
That's all coming up very, very soon.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.300
Linode.com slash coder.

20:41.300 --> 20:49.440
Go there and get $100 in credit on your account for a new account, I should say for 60 days

20:49.440 --> 20:51.880
and Linode is our cloud computing provider.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.960
So I think you're going to love them because I've tried them all and Linode's the one I've

20:54.960 --> 20:55.960
stuck with.

20:55.960 --> 21:00.800
Now they have been around since 2003 so they've been doing this for 18 years and they've really

21:00.800 --> 21:02.920
honed what they have done.

21:02.920 --> 21:07.000
Like they, that's, that's, I love the way they have just stayed focused and made their

21:07.000 --> 21:10.360
platform better and they've made it more price aggressive.

21:10.360 --> 21:15.120
They've made their interface cleaner and you know what Linode does is they, they just upgrade

21:15.120 --> 21:16.120
you.

21:16.120 --> 21:19.200
They, they just, at the price point you're paying, you get more for it later on.

21:19.200 --> 21:23.440
I've seen that over the last couple of years is it's, they, they invest continually in

21:23.440 --> 21:24.520
their hardware.

21:24.520 --> 21:28.840
They're not just sitting around on their laurels, they're, they're, they're always moving forward.

21:28.840 --> 21:32.460
They're always making the service better and that's one of the things that checks my boxes

21:32.460 --> 21:33.460
for Linode.

21:33.460 --> 21:38.240
But I think truly you can see in the product when you use something that is as well refined

21:38.240 --> 21:43.160
and focused as Linode's platform is after 18 years, you can see it in there.

21:43.160 --> 21:47.400
They are focusing on just making cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible.

21:47.400 --> 21:52.040
They got started back in 2003 when user mode Linux was landing in the Linux kernel and

21:52.040 --> 21:56.800
some of the people on their team now recognize where it was going and realized there was

21:56.800 --> 22:00.400
an opportunity here to scale out Linux in a way that had never been done on the internet

22:00.400 --> 22:01.400
before.

22:01.400 --> 22:06.680
All right, this is before AWS started, this is way before Azure started, way before Google

22:06.680 --> 22:11.720
cloud services, Linode had their head in the game and they saw where this was going.

22:11.720 --> 22:15.120
So they built out something that's easy to use and it's powerful.

22:15.120 --> 22:18.380
If you've never deployed a server before, you're going to be fine.

22:18.380 --> 22:22.160
If you've been deploying servers for 20 years, you're going to love what they offer.

22:22.160 --> 22:25.400
And then they have a bunch of services on the back end that I use the hell out of, like

22:25.400 --> 22:31.800
S3 compatible object storage, they have DDoS protection, they have VLAN support, powerful

22:31.800 --> 22:35.420
DNS manager, and of course they have traditional block storage.

22:35.420 --> 22:40.080
If you just want to get like some block storage on a device, I use that sometimes as well.

22:40.080 --> 22:44.320
And they'll plug in with your management platform, so if you're using Terraform or Kubernetes,

22:44.320 --> 22:45.320
they support all of that.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.840
They have one click application deployments, if none of that's your bag and you just want

22:48.840 --> 22:50.720
to hit something and get started.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.520
And the nice thing about Linode, the other thing, there's another check for one of my

22:53.520 --> 22:59.760
boxes, fantastic performance, very fast, super fast networking between their data centers

22:59.760 --> 23:03.980
with pricing 30 to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers.

23:03.980 --> 23:09.560
And maybe you should also consider a multi-cloud strategy, something that Linode exceeds at.

23:09.560 --> 23:13.880
Check it all out, get started, kick the tires as they say, experiment with it, see what

23:13.880 --> 23:17.780
you can do by going to linode.com slash coder.

23:17.780 --> 23:23.560
Use that $100 to test your network out, Linode makes it really simple to deploy iperf and

23:23.560 --> 23:27.840
then just get a real read on your network performance.

23:27.840 --> 23:33.000
Something like that, super simple, there's all kinds of opportunities when you get $100

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
in credit.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.280
So go sign up today at linode.com slash coder, get $100 in credit and support the show, linode.com

23:39.280 --> 23:43.360

23:43.360 --> 23:46.980
You've had a busy week and I want to cover a couple of things.

23:46.980 --> 23:50.800
You're doing a giveaway I want to get to, before we get into that, there's a little

23:50.800 --> 23:54.560
bit of hoopla we should probably talk about because it's in our wheelhouse.

23:54.560 --> 24:01.120
And it's this takedown of IDOS2 from the Apple App Store and it just is so infuriating,

24:01.120 --> 24:02.120
it's the worst.

24:02.120 --> 24:07.440
Yeah, I mean, this one really, really, God, this just...

24:07.440 --> 24:10.880
The back and forth, the back and forth with Apple, right?

24:10.880 --> 24:16.040
He's been going back and forth with Apple for years and for a while in a period of time,

24:16.040 --> 24:17.520
he couldn't even update his own app.

24:17.520 --> 24:21.620
Apple like cut him off, then they let him back in September 2020, they let him roll

24:21.620 --> 24:26.360
out a few changes and now, oh, nope, you're all again, you're all again, you're just,

24:26.360 --> 24:31.240
you're violating the app store rules around executing code, you have 14 days or something

24:31.240 --> 24:33.520
like that to fix your app or you're out of here.

24:33.520 --> 24:41.560
Yeah, so this guy Choji Lee, I hope I'm saying your first name right, pretty sure L-I-S Lee,

24:41.560 --> 24:47.000
has an app called IDOS2, what it does is exactly what it sounds like, it is a very, I think

24:47.000 --> 24:51.040
kind of cute, because it's got like the old DOS, it looks like an old DOS computer, like

24:51.040 --> 24:52.520
the old IBM, whatever.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.840
Yeah, I've got the app, it looks just like that.

24:54.840 --> 24:59.240
I bought it myself, yeah, it looks just like that, that's right, so one, probably the best

24:59.240 --> 25:02.960
marketing he could have ever hoped for, but let's just move on from that.

25:02.960 --> 25:06.640
Yeah, it's sort of like a, I guess a silver lining kind of way, you know, he's been on

25:06.640 --> 25:08.120
the app store since 2014.

25:08.120 --> 25:14.000
Yeah, so this app has been around, he's had updates rejected here and there, but basically,

25:14.000 --> 25:20.640
it's exactly what it sounds like, it's a DOS emulator, for lack of a better term, and he

25:20.640 --> 25:27.920
submitted a bug fix update and Apple decided that running DOS code is not okay.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.280
It's too dangerous, it's too dangerous.

25:30.280 --> 25:35.720
They say in their rejection letter, quote, specifically, your app executes IDOS packages

25:35.720 --> 25:41.640
and image files and allows iTunes file sharing and file support for importing games.

25:41.640 --> 25:46.520
Executing code can introduce or change features or functionality of the app and allows for

25:46.520 --> 25:49.800
downloading of content without licensing.

25:49.800 --> 25:55.900
Right, so they're making two arguments, right, it's theoretically insecure, although he goes

25:55.900 --> 26:01.000
to great strains to some of the articles that have been written to explain that he actually

26:01.000 --> 26:07.240
only does anything in the app sandbox, so, you know, it's sandboxed, right?

26:07.240 --> 26:11.040
Right, it seems like Apple would be aware of how their sandbox security model works,

26:11.040 --> 26:14.840
but then again, maybe it doesn't work.

26:14.840 --> 26:22.480
There is a licensing issue, I suppose, that I guess someone from 1985 or four could come

26:22.480 --> 26:27.760
back and be like, yo, you got this random thing you packaged up as an IDOS package and

26:27.760 --> 26:34.080
shared with somebody, therefore we're going to sue Mr. Lee, and probably Apple because

26:34.080 --> 26:40.480
lawyers scumbags, but I don't know, man, I mean, OpenMU runs just fine on my Mac.

26:40.480 --> 26:44.600
Well, and you could make the same claim, I shouldn't even say it out loud, with ISH,

26:44.600 --> 26:47.200
which lets you run a Linux environment on an iPad.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.200
Yeah.

26:48.200 --> 26:53.560
And you know what's also really weak about this is that you got 14 days to fix this or

26:53.560 --> 26:54.560
you're out.

26:54.560 --> 27:01.560
Well, fix this would be to remove the ability to run DOS apps, which is the core function

27:01.560 --> 27:02.640
of the app.

27:02.640 --> 27:08.040
Or I guess you could preload a bunch of like your own DOS apps in the thing, and it's just

27:08.040 --> 27:12.160
like a weird curated DOS museum, right, but that's garbage.

27:12.160 --> 27:18.860
So there's actually another couple takes of this, one, Apple is pushing the iPad Pro as

27:18.860 --> 27:23.760
a computer replacement, while executing code is a pretty fundamental goddamn thing that

27:23.760 --> 27:24.760
pros do at computers.

27:24.760 --> 27:29.640
Yeah, I mean, why else do I have this keyboard and this trackpad and this M1 and these things

27:29.640 --> 27:30.640
now, right?

27:30.640 --> 27:31.640
Come on.

27:31.640 --> 27:36.100
Also, this is why text editors on Mac generally suck.

27:36.100 --> 27:41.160
This is why it's hard to get a good linter that's not doing some insane like cloud stuff.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.960
I'm sorry, not on Mac on iOS on iPad.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.400
This is the problem.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.400
Right here.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.940
This is the problem.

27:48.940 --> 27:54.560
Given the sandboxing mechanism and how it works, it ought to be pretty possible to execute

27:54.560 --> 27:58.760
code within a package and keep it relatively secure.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.760
Yeah.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.760
Right.

28:00.760 --> 28:05.440
And I would I would go even further to say that maybe you only you know, you you add

28:05.440 --> 28:09.240
some automated checks, make sure it's staying in package.

28:09.240 --> 28:12.560
Obviously people in the past have done things to avoid app review and cheating with the

28:12.560 --> 28:15.600
automated checks, but whatever.

28:15.600 --> 28:20.600
Honestly, some of this falls down on the OS like have a security model where only allowed

28:20.600 --> 28:21.600
things can execute.

28:21.600 --> 28:25.800
I just I mean, there's se Linux, this can manage something like this.

28:25.800 --> 28:29.860
I mean, at certain points, I find like I find that two things here.

28:29.860 --> 28:32.120
It's like they don't trust their own sandbox.

28:32.120 --> 28:35.760
And two, shouldn't their OS be robust enough to handle something like this?

28:35.760 --> 28:41.160
Well, is it they don't trust their own sandbox or, you know, over the years, we've had these

28:41.160 --> 28:42.160
stories all time.

28:42.160 --> 28:50.360
I'm starting to think, are they afraid of the iPad in particular, somehow eclipsing

28:50.360 --> 28:51.360
the Mac?

28:51.360 --> 28:52.360
Right.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.360
These restrictions.

28:53.360 --> 28:58.040
I mean, some of them are they want their 30% cut, right?

28:58.040 --> 29:02.720
That's, you know, pretty, pretty common.

29:02.720 --> 29:07.440
This one just feels like, like, I understand they have a general principle about executing

29:07.440 --> 29:08.440
code.

29:08.440 --> 29:12.460
But there's also like the specific case of this dude has a little DOS emulator.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.360
What the hell is gonna happen?

29:14.360 --> 29:15.360
Right.

29:15.360 --> 29:21.480
And as far as the license content argument goes, I mean, Safari can download unlicensed

29:21.480 --> 29:25.920
content, Chrome can, can download mail dot app could download unlicensed content.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.560
I mean, it's it's a bogus argument.

29:27.560 --> 29:31.200
Well, also, DMCA exists.

29:31.200 --> 29:36.080
I mean, I'm a rinky dink developer, and I had my old app code journal pirated, and I

29:36.080 --> 29:37.800
had to take down on it.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.160
Yeah, I remember that.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.280
Why is this different?

29:41.280 --> 29:42.280
I just don't get the logic.

29:42.280 --> 29:47.480
Well, so to your point about Apple trying to, like, prevent the iPad from stealing MacBook

29:47.480 --> 29:48.640
sales.

29:48.640 --> 29:49.640
Apple's kind of famous.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.880
I mean, I don't know if it's true in all cases, maybe things have shifted, but aren't they

29:52.880 --> 29:57.560
they're famous for cannibalizing one product line to sell another product line.

29:57.560 --> 30:00.240
They cannibalized iPod to sell iPhones.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.240
For more money.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.240
Yeah.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.480
Well, that's the big difference here.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.480
That is right.

30:05.480 --> 30:06.480
I mean, you got to figure a MacBook.

30:06.480 --> 30:12.120
I mean, a MacBook starts at the high end of an iPad price, right?

30:12.120 --> 30:14.560
And now they're making them basically out of the same components.

30:14.560 --> 30:17.800
It's just one's got a metal case and one has less case.

30:17.800 --> 30:21.440
But remember one has an expensive touchscreen with the feedback for the pencil.

30:21.440 --> 30:27.040
I mean, in your mind, what is the logic behind this kind of rule?

30:27.040 --> 30:31.880
Well, there is the original mindset that Apple wanted to treat this thing like an appliance,

30:31.880 --> 30:33.160
like a console.

30:33.160 --> 30:37.720
And so they have a very specific idea of what can and can't be done on it.

30:37.720 --> 30:42.200
And because of the security issues, and because of this idea, this thought model they have

30:42.200 --> 30:47.840
about what the iPad is and what iOS devices are, they may have just reflexively acted.

30:47.840 --> 30:55.000
But what seems so strange is the way App Review didn't have an issue with this core functionality

30:55.000 --> 30:59.880
since September 2020, when they've allowed the developer to resume updating it.

30:59.880 --> 31:04.280
It's not like he just added the ability to execute applications.

31:04.280 --> 31:10.040
And when you see these kind of shifts all of a sudden, one on its own doesn't tell you

31:10.040 --> 31:11.040
much.

31:11.040 --> 31:15.360
But we have seen shifts in Apple policy, I think you'll recall like around the hey email

31:15.360 --> 31:20.080
day, we saw Apple lean heavy on how people did subscriptions and made sure Apple got

31:20.080 --> 31:21.080
their cut.

31:21.080 --> 31:27.880
It was like a new initiative that was being pushed by Apple leadership via App Store Review.

31:27.880 --> 31:31.400
And you don't really know if that's what we're going through right now until you start to

31:31.400 --> 31:34.120
see several of them happen.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.560
I mean, maybe ISH gets their door knocked on next.

31:36.560 --> 31:37.560
I hope not.

31:37.560 --> 31:38.560
God bless.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.560
I hope not.

31:39.560 --> 31:40.560
That's such a good project.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.280
Well, no, but that's actually a great point, right?

31:42.280 --> 31:48.720
Because Apple, they like to, when they want to hit somebody big, they usually go after

31:48.720 --> 31:52.080
somebody a bunch of small people and say, well, we're consistent.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.160
Look at these 20 other apps.

31:53.160 --> 31:56.480
We did take we did not take downs, but we did rejections for right.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.480
They're building.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.480
They're building to something.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.480
They're building the case.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.480
Right.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.960
Because what was one of Fortnite's sorry, Epic Games defense?

32:03.960 --> 32:04.960
Because of Fortnite.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.920
Well, look at all these other apps that you're ignoring the rules from.

32:06.920 --> 32:07.920
What did Apple do?

32:07.920 --> 32:08.920
Start taking them down.

32:08.920 --> 32:09.920
Right.

32:09.920 --> 32:10.920
Yeah.

32:10.920 --> 32:11.920
Yeah.

32:11.920 --> 32:15.600
So also, we have we don't want to go too much into this, but from the epic lawsuit, we

32:15.600 --> 32:18.080
have the emails that were put into discovery.

32:18.080 --> 32:23.720
Where right from the jump in like 2010, Apple was thinking about the app store as a mechanism

32:23.720 --> 32:28.600
to leverage value out of developers and to control their platform.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.800
And that control has made a good product.

32:30.800 --> 32:31.880
It really has.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.380
And a ton of money.

32:33.380 --> 32:36.460
But the technology hasn't stood still.

32:36.460 --> 32:40.160
And they have to update the way they treat these things and their policy around software

32:40.160 --> 32:45.120
on these as the capabilities of these machines becomes truly PC level.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.120
Well, do they have to?

32:47.120 --> 32:48.120
No.

32:48.120 --> 32:53.520
I mean, unless somebody makes them how they have what I mean, Mr. Lee for for all the

32:53.520 --> 32:55.720
positive press he's getting.

32:55.720 --> 32:59.400
The best case for him is he makes some negotiated solution with Apple and he's still gonna his

32:59.400 --> 33:03.880
app is still going to be slightly, you know, disabled or gamed.

33:03.880 --> 33:09.040
If I were him, I would be selling my core technology to some old famous dos games company,

33:09.040 --> 33:13.200
you know, and getting them to use it as a runtime to prepackage up like five other games.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.280
That's a great line of business for something like this, right?

33:15.280 --> 33:17.440
You sell it as a B2B product.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.360
Play Apple's game and make more money.

33:19.360 --> 33:25.000
I mean, even hey, they ended up like they claim they won, but I don't know, they ended

33:25.000 --> 33:26.720
up kind of having to compromise, right?

33:26.720 --> 33:29.360
Like they didn't get what they wanted.

33:29.360 --> 33:33.240
People do crazy stuff for what to get into Walmart to get to get their product on the

33:33.240 --> 33:34.240
shelf of Walmart.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.760
They'll make crazy sacrifices.

33:36.760 --> 33:41.760
So maybe it's worth it for some I feel like as a company who is building a technology

33:41.760 --> 33:44.520
product, they should care about technology.

33:44.520 --> 33:48.820
And if you care about technology, then limiting what these machines can do in this way artificially

33:48.820 --> 33:55.200
when you're putting 16 gigs of RAM and an M1 processor in there, just it feels negligent.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.400
It feels like you don't care about the technology, really.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.800
You just, you know, you're doing it to do it, I guess.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.600
I just don't get that sense from all of Apple.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.000
I'm sure that could be true at some levels of leadership.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.560
But I think they would say they care about the users and they're protecting the users.

34:09.560 --> 34:13.400
But in the darkest corners of their private management meetings, they also care about

34:13.400 --> 34:14.400
the 30 percent.

34:14.400 --> 34:20.280
And when you when you get to be their size, you don't get bigger by cutting the ways you

34:20.280 --> 34:21.280
make money out.

34:21.280 --> 34:24.440
Like, you don't get bigger by cutting back revenue.

34:24.440 --> 34:28.060
And they need every penny they can if they want to be because Wall Street always wants

34:28.060 --> 34:29.060
them to be growing.

34:29.060 --> 34:30.060
Right.

34:30.060 --> 34:33.860
And for the last few years, we were speculating on what that services revenue chunk that was

34:33.860 --> 34:35.840
growing and growing and growing was, right?

34:35.840 --> 34:37.000
Could it possibly be iCloud?

34:37.000 --> 34:41.120
Well, the Epic lawsuit once again showed us, no, they consider the App Store revenues like

34:41.120 --> 34:42.840
the third part of services.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.640
This like the biggest piece.

34:44.640 --> 34:45.920
Yep, that's it.

34:45.920 --> 34:49.080
I mean, once you understand that little piece of it, a lot of it starts to make sense, I

34:49.080 --> 34:50.080
think.

34:50.080 --> 34:53.720
And and then it's just like, how much are they willing to sacrifice to not get their

34:53.720 --> 34:55.240
heads chopped off over it?

34:55.240 --> 34:57.740
They got to find that line.

34:57.740 --> 35:02.120
And I think there's like I feel like sometimes a mandate comes down from upstairs that says,

35:02.120 --> 35:04.100
all right, start enforcing this.

35:04.100 --> 35:07.480
If you see an app that comes through that does this, let us know.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.580
And, you know, maybe he's maybe he's the right size.

35:09.580 --> 35:14.320
So he's the first one, or maybe he just happens to be submitting at the wrong time when this

35:14.320 --> 35:16.000
new policy is in effect.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Probably both.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Right.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
He wrong time.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.560
But he has enough of a following that he could get attention.

35:20.560 --> 35:24.880
I'm sure if we cast our net wide, this is going on with a bunch of other developers

35:24.880 --> 35:28.240
who can't get a Verge article or a MacRumors article.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.240
Right.

35:29.240 --> 35:30.240
That's how it works.

35:30.240 --> 35:31.240
Right.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.240
So.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.240
Yeah.

35:33.240 --> 35:34.240
Yeah.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.240
All right.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.240
Well, hey, let's talk about something fun.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.240
Sure.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.240
You're giving away another computer.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.240
Not just a computer, Chris.

35:39.240 --> 35:42.660
It's just a computer Thalia, as always.

35:42.660 --> 35:45.960
This is the first time I don't have the contest fully formed, but I figured I'd give the

35:45.960 --> 35:48.320
code radio folks a pre announcement.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.920
So I missed Earth Day this year.

35:50.920 --> 35:55.760
So I'm doing something for back to school end of the year, probably shipping around

35:55.760 --> 35:58.400
Thanksgiving something false.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.400
Same deal as always.

35:59.400 --> 36:02.900
You got to be a U.S. middle school or high school student.

36:02.900 --> 36:05.920
And you know, your your submissions and I'm going to write this all up and we'll link

36:05.920 --> 36:07.280
it in next week's show.

36:07.280 --> 36:11.760
But your submission has to be public on GitHub and the winner will get a I actually already

36:11.760 --> 36:12.760
have the Thalia.

36:12.760 --> 36:20.320
It is a black Thalia with a 12 gig NVIDIA chip and I think 64 gigs of RAM and it rise.

36:20.320 --> 36:23.760
Of course, because I don't I don't do until when I don't have to.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.280
That is a heck of a giveaway.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.280
Really?

36:26.280 --> 36:27.280
Yes, really.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.280
So we'll have a link soon.

36:28.280 --> 36:31.280
It's also there's some info on Mike's Twitter feed as well.

36:31.280 --> 36:37.360
Yeah, well, could you imagine as a being a student going to get a machine like that?

36:37.360 --> 36:39.280
Oh, that's going to be cool.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.280
All right.

36:40.280 --> 36:43.200
So let's talk about your your adventures coding on the train.

36:43.200 --> 36:46.680
So you got on the Amtrak for better for worse and you had work to get done.

36:46.680 --> 36:47.680
I assume.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.280
How did all this go?

36:49.280 --> 36:50.840
What did you bring with you?

36:50.840 --> 36:52.960
Was it a horrible mistake?

36:52.960 --> 36:57.600
So I had to take the Amtrak, the old train, which for those who don't know is a train

36:57.600 --> 37:00.760
where you can drive your car on or you can load your car onto it.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.760
And then you get in the train.

37:02.760 --> 37:07.960
Unfortunately, there was some sort of accident and the train was wildly delayed about five

37:07.960 --> 37:09.280
or six hours.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.280
Like a train accident?

37:10.280 --> 37:15.620
No, there was a storm and they were saying some kind of just like crap fell on the tracks

37:15.620 --> 37:17.460
and it delayed another train.

37:17.460 --> 37:21.240
So I mean, this is way inside baseball, but I learned a lot about how Amtrak works.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.800
Amtrak does not own the railroad line.

37:22.800 --> 37:26.200
Amtrak is not, in fact, the federal government.

37:26.200 --> 37:33.600
They lease the lines from a company called in this case, CTX truck, CTX rail or something.

37:33.600 --> 37:38.160
What happens is when there's an accident, either a train accident, you know, suicide,

37:38.160 --> 37:42.040
God forbid, or in this case, a weather related problem.

37:42.040 --> 37:46.760
The owner of the line, the freight train company, CTX, or there's different ones, right, for

37:46.760 --> 37:52.860
different lines, prioritizes their trains that go very slow.

37:52.860 --> 37:55.200
Amtrak gets last bid most of the time.

37:55.200 --> 37:58.700
Because it's just what it's just the it's just the people.

37:58.700 --> 38:02.520
It's just the just the middle class who cares about them.

38:02.520 --> 38:06.000
With the exception of like the Acela line, which is the fancy, you know, New York to

38:06.000 --> 38:12.200
D.C. to Boston line, which this was not Amtrak basically does not make money.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.200
The Acela line does.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.240
The Northeast Corridor does.

38:14.240 --> 38:19.060
This line, the auto train is arguable.

38:19.060 --> 38:25.800
So there was a lot of just like sitting in the train and I had work to do.

38:25.800 --> 38:30.360
So with me, I had my M1 MacBook Air.

38:30.360 --> 38:33.040
My Verizon, whatever they call it, 5G.

38:33.040 --> 38:39.120
Don't call it ISIS because they used to call it that hotspot thing.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.760
And an iPad.

38:41.760 --> 38:42.760
And let me tell you something.

38:42.760 --> 38:44.240
Did you bring charging cables with you?

38:44.240 --> 38:45.240
I did.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.240
I know.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.240
OK.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.240
All right.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.240
All right.

38:49.240 --> 38:50.240
Goddamn lie.

38:50.240 --> 38:53.440
Oh, 5G truth are here, everybody.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.440
What happened?

38:54.440 --> 38:57.120
It worked fine in Florida.

38:57.120 --> 39:03.280
We hit South Carolina and North Carolina basically didn't work.

39:03.280 --> 39:07.660
And it was down to LTE, but really spotty LTE.

39:07.660 --> 39:12.120
So at that point, Zoom calls became impossible.

39:12.120 --> 39:17.440
And I was having like get remote hung up, timed out stuff going on.

39:17.440 --> 39:24.560
You get further up north, the train runs from Sanford, Florida to Lorton, Virginia, I believe.

39:24.560 --> 39:28.040
Virginia, everything works again because you're close to D.C., right?

39:28.040 --> 39:33.720
And of course, the closer you are to the FCC headquarters, the better your wireless signal

39:33.720 --> 39:36.360
is going to be in a very general kind of way.

39:36.360 --> 39:44.440
So I cannot express how disappointed I am in this rather expensive, unlimited 5G thing

39:44.440 --> 39:51.680
that looks like a brick, like an actual brick that I bought from Verizon, because I don't

39:51.680 --> 39:56.160
know where people are talking about the race to 5G or, you know, getting rid of home Internet

39:56.160 --> 39:57.240
and just 5Ging it up.

39:57.240 --> 40:00.200
That is just not like this was for me.

40:00.200 --> 40:03.940
This was like, all right, I got this business line with 5G.

40:03.940 --> 40:04.940
It's unlimited.

40:04.940 --> 40:06.080
I'm going to see what I can do.

40:06.080 --> 40:09.000
And it just it wasn't like a throttling issue.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.440
It was a coverage issue.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.760
Yeah, it's really disappointing, huh?

40:12.760 --> 40:19.320
It's weird what I have over here on the West Coast is I'll be driving around in this backwoods

40:19.320 --> 40:29.040
rural area that is two and a half, three hours from Seattle, and I'll have screaming 5G coverage,

40:29.040 --> 40:30.040
screamer 5G.

40:30.040 --> 40:32.400
And then I get into downtown.

40:32.400 --> 40:33.400
I got nothing.

40:33.400 --> 40:37.540
And like, I get into city towns, like small towns up north of Seattle, nothing.

40:37.540 --> 40:41.580
You get out into the into like the rural areas, 5G again.

40:41.580 --> 40:43.960
That's been very frustrating for me.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.880
It's not widely deployed.

40:45.880 --> 40:46.880
I'm sorry.

40:46.880 --> 40:47.880
I was crying a little bit.

40:47.880 --> 40:51.520
Yeah, well, I couldn't even get LTE for half the trip.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.400
Yeah, that just sounds like you didn't have coverage at all.

40:53.400 --> 40:58.000
I've just built my whole setup in the RV around LTE at this point.

40:58.000 --> 41:04.720
But I've got Verizon, AT&T, and I've got through Ting, I've got a couple of other networks

41:04.720 --> 41:05.720
that are backup networks.

41:05.720 --> 41:06.720
Well, so that's the thing.

41:06.720 --> 41:07.880
I was relying on one network, right?

41:07.880 --> 41:14.840
So maybe if I had an AT&T or a T-Mobile SIM, I might have gotten lucky.

41:14.840 --> 41:19.920
That's generally your best route in the US, Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile.

41:19.920 --> 41:22.340
But it's very expensive to do that.

41:22.340 --> 41:25.280
In the moment, it feels so worth it, though.

41:25.280 --> 41:29.000
But then when you're sitting here and you're not actually out and about, it's a big chunk

41:29.000 --> 41:30.960
of change to be paying for data.

41:30.960 --> 41:31.960
It is.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.200
But there is a hero of this journey.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.360
Oh, yeah?

41:34.360 --> 41:38.400
The M1 MacBook Air, baby.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.080
How am I not surprised?

41:40.080 --> 41:41.600
That battery life, right?

41:41.600 --> 41:43.160
Battery life plus performance.

41:43.160 --> 41:46.920
As long as I didn't have to hit a network, I was in good shape.

41:46.920 --> 41:50.560
I was wondering if you would be screwed since you get on the train, you're expecting it

41:50.560 --> 41:55.840
to be X amount of hours, delays, delays, delays make it a lot longer.

41:55.840 --> 41:59.820
I was wondering if battery life was going to be a problem, but also did you end up just

41:59.820 --> 42:05.320
having to eat all of their prepackaged sandwich food type stuff?

42:05.320 --> 42:06.480
Absolutely not, because I was fasting.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.640
I would rather not eat.

42:07.640 --> 42:09.360
Yeah, I hate the train food.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.360
It's such a bummer.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.920
Fasting on the train is a brilliant idea.

42:12.920 --> 42:14.560
Then you just avoid the temptation.

42:14.560 --> 42:15.560
That's what I do.

42:15.560 --> 42:23.560
I drink tea and I had a tonic, not a gin and tonic, for the listeners, jumped out by the

42:23.560 --> 42:25.880
but tonic because there's sugar in it and it fills you up.

42:25.880 --> 42:29.200
It also settles your stomach for when you don't eat and you feel nauseous.

42:29.200 --> 42:33.160
You're going to be beating the ladies off with a stick when you get to Jersey.

42:33.160 --> 42:38.520
You're going to come back with that Florida glow plus that fasting slimness.

42:38.520 --> 42:39.840
You're going to be beating them off with a stick.

42:39.840 --> 42:40.840
You're not going to know what to do.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.120
I already got one.

42:43.120 --> 42:44.520
I'm fast like the M1.

42:44.520 --> 42:48.440
She better prepare for competition, that's what I'm saying.

42:48.440 --> 42:54.320
So next time, flight, flying up, you guys get there, you're done.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.480
You're not going back anymore after that.

42:56.480 --> 42:57.540
Not for any long periods of time.

42:57.540 --> 43:01.140
We still have the server facility in plant city, so I'll be back maybe once a quarter

43:01.140 --> 43:03.120
for like two or three nights.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.120
Yeah.

43:04.120 --> 43:05.120
Wow.

43:05.120 --> 43:06.120
That's huge, though, man.

43:06.120 --> 43:07.600
Oh, man.

43:07.600 --> 43:11.440
The bulk of stuff is moved now then, or is that getting still in transit?

43:11.440 --> 43:12.440
Like how's that working?

43:12.440 --> 43:14.000
Like the big the big items.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.400
So this is, again, a little inside baseball for folks who do the Amtrak auto train.

43:19.400 --> 43:24.640
I loaded most of the expensive equipment for for the Mad Botter in my car that then went

43:24.640 --> 43:25.720
on the train.

43:25.720 --> 43:27.160
So that is up there.

43:27.160 --> 43:28.160
That's so nice.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.720
We don't have that on the West Coast, though.

43:29.720 --> 43:30.960
There is no equivalent.

43:30.960 --> 43:31.960
I don't think so.

43:31.960 --> 43:33.480
No, I've never seen one.

43:33.480 --> 43:35.000
So I don't have a space for it yet.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.400
So it's just sitting in the in the townhouse I'm going to be living in.

43:38.400 --> 43:43.360
But I like personal effects, clothes, the kids toys are all going to I have movers,

43:43.360 --> 43:45.520
they're going to like deliver it, whatever.

43:45.520 --> 43:46.520
That's good.

43:46.520 --> 43:47.520
Good for you.

43:47.520 --> 43:48.520
Like the iMac Pro is up there.

43:48.520 --> 43:52.040
The thick couple Thalios are up there.

43:52.040 --> 43:57.240
I now have the joy of trying to find a space to work out of or where I have this whole

43:57.240 --> 43:59.800
thing of like, do I finish a basement to make a working space?

43:59.800 --> 44:00.800
I don't know.

44:00.800 --> 44:01.800
That's a job, too.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.120
That's a whole other set of projects.

44:03.120 --> 44:07.720
Yeah, there's all kinds of weird fun coming up in Koda radio with mics.

44:07.720 --> 44:11.600
Oh, my God, I'm back in Jersey and I I had to remember how to drive in New Jersey.

44:11.600 --> 44:12.600
Oh, yeah.

44:12.600 --> 44:13.600
Yeah.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.600
Yeah.

44:14.600 --> 44:16.800
It's like that when I come back to Seattle when I'm on a road trip, I have to change

44:16.800 --> 44:19.960
how I drive because people here cannot drive.

44:19.960 --> 44:23.640
People there can drive, but you got to dial up the aggression like 50 points.

44:23.640 --> 44:27.680
Yeah, I will be in studio for next week's episode.

44:27.680 --> 44:30.600
And then after that, for a few weeks, I'll be on the road doing the show was everything

44:30.600 --> 44:33.400
still planned as normal, but I'll just be doing it from the road.

44:33.400 --> 44:36.160
So that should be nice and crazy and wild.

44:36.160 --> 44:39.000
I'm actually freaking out today.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.920
Today's the day because it's like, oh, it's just one week away and then I'm pretty much

44:43.920 --> 44:45.040
hitting the road.

44:45.040 --> 44:48.000
And that's really soon.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
Life is always just a series of projects, isn't it?

44:51.000 --> 44:53.280
Like you're going through a bunch of projects right now.

44:53.280 --> 44:56.800
I'm going through a bunch of projects and sometimes they're personal projects, sometimes

44:56.800 --> 44:57.880
they're work projects.

44:57.880 --> 44:59.920
Usually it's all at the same time.

44:59.920 --> 45:00.920
That's it.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.000
So good luck to you.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.100
And don't forget everyone to join us next week.

45:05.100 --> 45:10.760

45:14.640 --> 45:15.640
time.

45:15.640 --> 45:19.040
It's perfect when you get it because we're just recording a few hours earlier.

45:19.040 --> 45:24.160
If you're not a Coder QA member yet, Coder QA dot co, go get a membership going, support

45:24.160 --> 45:31.040
the show, get a limited ad feed and also a brand new Coderly is out perfectly on theme.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.320
So it's posted to the members area for direct download.

45:33.320 --> 45:35.220
If you're a member, you can just go log in and grab it.

45:35.220 --> 45:39.320
Or if you're already subscribed to the limited ad feed, I just added it to that feed.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.200
So it just shows up in your podcatcher.

45:41.200 --> 45:46.880
And if you're not a member yet, Coder QA dot co, you get access to all previous Coderlys,

45:46.880 --> 45:49.120

45:51.520 --> 45:52.920
His company is at the Mad Potter Inc.

45:52.920 --> 45:56.160
Is there anything else you want to mention before we get out of here, Mr. Dominic?

45:56.160 --> 45:57.160
Nope.

45:57.160 --> 45:58.160

46:12.360 --> 46:16.800
