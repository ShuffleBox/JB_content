00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
This is Kota Radio, episode 334, recorded on November 26th, Crazy 218.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.120
Hey y'all, it's Chris and I'm fixing to do a Kota Radio from a Texas location in the future

00:35.760 --> 00:42.320
for all you out there that are concerned about programming and maybe want to take a pragmatic

00:42.320 --> 00:47.200
look at that and the art and the business of it even and maybe it's related technologies. My name

00:47.200 --> 00:54.480
is Chris and pre-recorded in the future from the beautiful Pacific Northwest and I'm joined this

00:54.480 --> 01:01.680
week by my established host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike. Hello, Chris and this is Mike from the

01:01.680 --> 01:06.960
future. No. Who's probably using his powers of darkness to make Swift run on every platform.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.280
You know, when you and I talk to each other from the future, I get excited because there's so many

01:11.280 --> 01:17.120
potentially amazing things that could yet to be happened. Those are my least favorite episodes

01:17.120 --> 01:24.720
of Star Trek. Really? Really? Because nothing like the crazy comb badges and the beard.

01:24.720 --> 01:30.880
Unless we have different facial hair. Right. My dream has been to have not a goatee, but like

01:30.880 --> 01:35.200
an evil goatee. You know what I'm talking about? Oh, okay. Okay. See, in this episode, I thought

01:35.200 --> 01:40.880
you had a mustache and I had the soul patch. Is that not this episode? Well, you are very

01:40.880 --> 01:48.080
soulful, gentlemen. Well, I suppose, Mr. Dominic, but either way, we are both in the middle of

01:48.080 --> 01:53.600
travel and so we are pre-recording an episode and a soul patch or not. Actually, I got a question

01:53.600 --> 01:59.200
for you. Do you bring a razor with you? I do. It turns out I can totally bring my razor with me.

01:59.840 --> 02:07.440
Electric or old school? I'm old school. Okay. Why? Are you electric? Yeah. I stashed.

02:07.440 --> 02:14.080
Absolutely. Truth. A hundred percent truth. I stashed an electric razor at Linux Academy

02:14.080 --> 02:19.760
and I would do this anywhere I go frequently. I have one at the RV, I have one at the studio,

02:19.760 --> 02:26.880
and I have one in Texas. I just go get the cheapest electric razor possible from the store

02:26.880 --> 02:32.400
and I buy one and I save it in the location I'm traveling. Truth. I keep a go bag in my trunk.

02:32.400 --> 02:40.800
Oh, that's why the Qt Corporation has had such a hard time tracking you down.

02:42.080 --> 02:49.360
Yeah. So, long-time listeners, meaning within the last 30 days,

02:49.360 --> 02:52.640
or depending on when in the future. You know what, Chris, this is the future.

02:52.640 --> 02:57.440
No, no. This Qt saga has been going on for like a solid six months at this point.

02:57.440 --> 03:03.600
Let's not. This has been the 30 years war. All right. I don't even know where to begin.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.760
I was evaluating using Qt for a recently launched product.

03:07.760 --> 03:11.600
And then you talked about it on a fairly well-listened podcast.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.440
I didn't know it was fairly well-listened. You didn't know? Okay.

03:16.160 --> 03:19.280
I haven't asked for numbers in months because the less I know, the less liable I am.

03:19.280 --> 03:26.160
True, true. Fair enough. No. So, there was a misunderstanding between myself and a sales rep

03:26.160 --> 03:33.840
from Qt. Basically, it was about what defines an embedded device. Now, since my product's

03:33.840 --> 03:38.000
completely public, I'm happy to discuss Gryphon. We all know Gryphon. I mention it every week

03:38.000 --> 03:46.400
because, yay. Gryphon runs on Microsoft Surface tablets and other tablets with Linux, right?

03:46.400 --> 03:51.520
It is a radar display software made in partnership with a wonderful company in North Carolina

03:51.520 --> 03:56.560
who does radar display systems. Or, I'm sorry, radar hardware systems. We do the displays at

03:56.560 --> 04:02.480
TMB. Right. TMB is the mad botter. Google it. Buy something. Unless you're from Qt, then don't.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.280
Don't. Apparently.

04:04.400 --> 04:12.320
Well, I wrote the application in Qt that I had to throw out after a conversation with a Qt sales rep

04:12.320 --> 04:18.720
who told me that I needed an embedded license. Now, the initial version of this application

04:18.720 --> 04:24.240
ran on Microsoft Surface tablets on Windows. I don't know about you, but there's nothing

04:24.240 --> 04:31.440
embedded about an i7. Yeah, fair enough. That's a desktop PC. That's a desktop.

04:33.120 --> 04:38.400
After months of back and forth, I finally got from on high, from the good folks in Boston,

04:38.400 --> 04:44.080
what the hell they mean by embedded. Is this a phone call? Is this an email thread? What are we

04:44.080 --> 04:50.320
talking about? This is a number of phone calls. It got down to, when they say embedded,

04:51.280 --> 04:58.640
they consider embedded if I sell them the actual hardware. What? What? Sell who the hardware?

04:58.640 --> 05:06.400
There was a fundamental misunderstanding. I do not resell Surface tablets. No. Or the

05:06.400 --> 05:11.440
generic Linux tablet in my business. I am not a hardware vendor. I am a pure software vendor.

05:11.440 --> 05:17.120
I would assume, ideally, it's the customer that's buying tablets and then deploying the software

05:17.120 --> 05:22.160
on those tablets. To my specifications, yes. The original sales rep misunderstood that

05:23.040 --> 05:27.360
and thought I was building these tablets and selling them. Like as integrated devices.

05:28.160 --> 05:34.000
Right. So if I were, well, it's not just integrated devices though. So in a world where I bought,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.600
let's say, a hundred Microsoft Surface Pros and then sold them to some, you know, the Navy,

05:39.600 --> 05:49.920
let's just make up, make something up. Right. Then they claim I need a cute embedded license.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.760
That's or you can go LGPL, but then, you know, the sales reps don't like to talk about it.

05:57.760 --> 06:02.320
Actually, neither do you. Let's be honest. Yeah. It's got, I'm a little afraid of the LGPL.

06:02.320 --> 06:06.640
I'm like, no, let's talk about BSD or MIT or Apache. Come on guys. Let's play ball here.

06:06.640 --> 06:13.360
We can all be friends. Yeah. So, but that's not what I was doing. Right. So this is,

06:13.360 --> 06:16.720
you know what, this is almost like a programming error where you have one little piece of data

06:16.720 --> 06:22.960
that was wrong. Right. That led to a big problem. So the irony is I could totally have done what I

06:22.960 --> 06:28.880
was doing in Qt and been fine. I wasted, well, I didn't waste, but you know, the original

06:28.880 --> 06:39.120
couple of weeks in Q whatever it was a good proof of concept and it, I don't even know what to say.

06:39.120 --> 06:45.520
Like I, the funny part is I still don't agree with them on the definition of embedded, right? Like,

06:46.640 --> 06:51.360
but, but even that aside, so folks, if you were concerned and I do feel kind of bad because I

06:51.360 --> 06:55.920
should have probably gone higher up on, you know, as a technical resource, certainly if you're

06:55.920 --> 07:01.520
writing software, as long as you are not, you're fine. As long as you're dynamically linking,

07:01.520 --> 07:06.720
basically, I met an attorney, this is not legal advice. Well, I appreciate that. They wanted to

07:06.720 --> 07:11.440
actually clear the record with you. Yeah. That was several hours of phone conversations. So,

07:12.080 --> 07:16.560
you know, if you look at like some of the most successful magazines in the world,

07:16.560 --> 07:24.800
they might have an annual distribution of say 180, 200,000 unique. I think I'm going to yell that by

07:24.800 --> 07:29.600
daddy here. Hang on. I'm just letting you know, I'm just putting things in perspective. So, you

07:29.600 --> 07:34.560
know, that would be a successful magazine. Like maybe the world's most successful magazine might

07:34.560 --> 07:39.120
make it. Wait, you said 180. Yeah. See the reality is they like to pretend like it's millions,

07:39.120 --> 07:43.440
but people that actually are receiving the magazine, it's a hundred and eighty thousand.

07:43.440 --> 07:49.360
A month. This explains a lot of the hate email I get. So our numbers, our numbers are much, much,

07:49.360 --> 07:54.800
much, much, much higher than that. So you got to think of our numbers around the 500,000 mark. You

07:54.800 --> 07:59.200
see, I just, I was just, I just dropped my pen. I was just doing a little quick math, but yeah.

07:59.200 --> 08:06.640
So we have, we think about us like, think about it as like the most successful technology magazine

08:06.640 --> 08:10.960
in the market. That's our reach. It's the most successful magazine in the world.

08:10.960 --> 08:15.680
In the market. That's our reach. It's not like the world's most successful website,

08:15.680 --> 08:20.880
like maybe ours, Technica, like technically because they get millions, but it's seriously ours.

08:21.600 --> 08:26.880
I don't know. I'm just giving you an example. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're right. But like,

08:26.880 --> 08:31.200
but it's, it's, it's, so it's, it's somewhere between like the most successful tech website

08:31.200 --> 08:38.240
and the most successful magazine. So basically I subscribed to Linux user and developer and I'm,

08:38.240 --> 08:41.840
I should believe, and it's weird that we're doing this on the air, but I should believe that we have

08:41.840 --> 08:49.360
more distribution than they do without doubt. So this is the part where everybody gets the

08:49.360 --> 08:53.360
right comments. Mike doesn't know how many people listen to the show because we don't focus on that.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.240
That's not, Mike doesn't know how many people listen to the show. That's not what that's,

08:56.240 --> 08:58.960
well, that's not what our whole network's about. That's all I thought it was like,

08:59.920 --> 09:05.120
maybe like 2000 a month. Yeah. No, I'm looking, I'm, oh really? No, I'm looking, I thought it

09:05.120 --> 09:11.280
was super low. Yeah. I, I thought we went, okay. I am looking at the most conservative numbers

09:11.280 --> 09:16.000
I have right now. I'm not even, I'm not even looking at like the optimistic numbers where

09:16.000 --> 09:20.400
maybe somebody downloads it at home and then continues listening at work. It is the most

09:20.400 --> 09:24.800
conservative numbers you download behind a gnat. We're counting it once kind of thing.

09:25.840 --> 09:29.120
What if they go into like Stitcher? We're not even counting. I've heard not counting

09:29.920 --> 09:34.960
this is not counting a YouTube Stitcher or any video downloads either. Yeah. This explains when

09:34.960 --> 09:40.720
I go to things like, like DevFest Florida. And if I wear like a coder t-shirt or a DMV shirt.

09:40.720 --> 09:44.480
And by the way, I should mention, I should mention this is just for 2018,

09:44.480 --> 09:50.320
right? So the, the show has had six years of run. Wait a minute. Cheesy Bacon saying we're

09:50.320 --> 09:54.800
bigger than PC world. That's not possible. PC world's millions. It's gotta be. Well,

09:54.800 --> 09:59.040
I mean, this is just one show on Jupiter broadcasting. Oh, see, let's not, let's not

09:59.040 --> 10:04.080
get drunk now. He's like, no, no, I, I actually haven't released these numbers yet, but, um,

10:04.080 --> 10:10.800
LAN just surpassed 2.2 million downloads for 2018 and Linux unplugged just surpassed

10:10.800 --> 10:16.720
1 million downloads for 2018. Well, let me tell you something. Our original deal still stands.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.920
I will be using these facts to advertise to you.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.920
Yeah. All right. Moving forward. Yeah. It's been a, 2018 has been a really good year.

10:25.920 --> 10:30.720
You know, we focused. What if it's all hate mail? I mean, I get like several thousand hate

10:30.720 --> 10:35.040
mail. Actually, I'll say this. I feel like we've had the best Twitter engagement that we've ever

10:35.040 --> 10:39.200
had on the show. Like, you know, we had a really good one that I didn't put in the notes, um,

10:39.200 --> 10:44.000
regarding me being elderly and angry. I feel like, but I feel like the people that are engaging with

10:44.000 --> 10:48.400
us on Twitter, like it's just like, it feels like a real genuine connection I'm having with somebody

10:48.400 --> 10:53.920
else in the field. Like I've, I've the last like two months on Twitter for this show have been

10:53.920 --> 10:57.920
great. They've been the best they've ever been. Yeah. I tell you what I, you know, I, it's funny

10:57.920 --> 11:05.120
because time dilation aside, I was unavailable for one week. Yeah. And, uh, and you and I have been

11:05.120 --> 11:11.520
tasting, we have to stop. Have you read the book salvation by Peter Hamilton yet? No. All right.

11:11.520 --> 11:16.320
It's a sci-fi novel about this fabulous technology called portals, which, you know, what portals are.

11:16.320 --> 11:21.760
All right. Is this on audible? Hold on. You've already got me. But imagine all the time you and

11:21.760 --> 11:27.360
I spent in airport security and lounges and like just waiting to get on planes and on planes.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.600
If you have to go to Texas, I have to go to Texas. I have to go to New York or North Carolina or

11:31.600 --> 11:36.880
wherever. You just walk on and you're there five steps, you know, in, in a funny way,

11:36.880 --> 11:43.040
in a really backwards, funny way. This is why I prefer to drive because I know I prefer to drive

11:43.040 --> 11:49.600
completely. It takes way, way longer, but I'm immediately applying time to accomplishment.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.920
Do you know what I mean? Like, well, I just listen, I get to, I get to like not be groped

11:53.920 --> 11:57.680
by the TSA. That's my whole thing. You got to get pre. What do I search for on audible?

11:57.680 --> 12:00.880
What do I, what should I say? Salvation by Peter Hamilton. I'll just put a link in the

12:00.880 --> 12:05.040
chat. No. Yeah. I'm getting this. So this is, this is happening. It's so good. I mean, it's,

12:05.920 --> 12:09.920
I was so mad. I didn't know it came out this year. I was so pissed because I went to buy the second

12:09.920 --> 12:14.080
for the second. It's a trilogy. Yeah. I mean, I'm flying out on Sunday. This is what I'm going to

12:14.080 --> 12:21.760
listen to. So it's 19 hours. Holy crap. I don't know. I've been, you know what? I dropped my

12:21.760 --> 12:27.520
Kindle on so many planes. I got woken up by so many people saying, Mr. Are you okay? Really?

12:28.800 --> 12:33.120
Best thing to do is to answer. That's a simple question with a very complicated answer.

12:34.240 --> 12:38.560
I love that. I'm going to steal that. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to put a link to that in

12:38.560 --> 12:42.560
the fact. If we ever do t-shirts or coffee cups again, we should say code radio. That's a simple

12:42.560 --> 12:47.360
question with a very complicated. That is good. We should do. We, I actually said a client,

12:47.360 --> 12:51.440
although you're stealing my sales pitch here, but that's yeah, that's good. I've been thinking we

12:51.440 --> 12:56.320
should like do like a refresh on our look to like represent like, I agree. Yeah. We got to like

12:56.320 --> 13:02.480
represent, right? Like the show has very 2012. It's very iOS like seven. Right. So we need to

13:02.480 --> 13:08.160
refresh the look, but I, uh, we, yeah, we should talk more about that. Um, so me and Q are good

13:08.160 --> 13:12.240
now. I'm sorry. Oh, I love you. Are you, I'm really not sorry. Actually. It's kind of your

13:12.240 --> 13:17.200
fault, but let's just let it go. Yeah. There's been a lot of confusion there. So if you had a

13:17.200 --> 13:22.160
time machine though, would you still be, I got to ask, would, if you had a time machine, would you

13:22.720 --> 13:27.440
still be using cute? If you could go back now knowing what, you know, right. That's a good

13:27.440 --> 13:31.760
question. Um, let me think about my answer. That is a simple question with a very complicated answer.

13:35.360 --> 13:41.280
That's so true, right? So set it right up there. All right, let's jump to Leo. So Leo writes in,

13:41.280 --> 13:45.520
he went over to a quarter radio, Nope. Coder dot show slash contact. He might've gone to

13:45.520 --> 13:49.920
coder radio dot red dot com. Anyways, fun fact. I own the quarter radio domain so I could just

13:49.920 --> 13:55.360
redirect that. You should. Yeah. Yeah. Dakota dot show. Uh, he says, hello, I love the show,

13:55.360 --> 13:59.920
even though I'm not much of a programmer, I'm 24 and I'm turning 25 next year.

14:00.720 --> 14:09.440
And my question is simple. Oh, I know, right? And then what I love is that he's 25 asking this,

14:09.440 --> 14:16.800
he says, is it too late for me to get into programming in order to get a job? I've

14:16.800 --> 14:22.000
dabbled with learning C plus plus in Java before, uh, and in my free time,

14:22.000 --> 14:26.560
but due to events in my life, never passed the learning phase to the development phase.

14:26.560 --> 14:32.640
What do you think? Is it, is it too late at 25? That's a simple question with a one word answer.

14:32.640 --> 14:38.560
No, it's not too early. It's super not too late. It's super, super duper, not too late. If you

14:38.560 --> 14:43.040
were writing this email and you were 40 years old, I would say it's not too late. I would give you

14:43.040 --> 14:48.480
the exact same answer, right? It's, you know what, figure out what you want to do, what kind of

14:48.480 --> 14:52.320
development you want to do, what technology you're passionate about. Obviously listen to JB, so you

14:52.320 --> 14:57.920
might be a bit of a hippie. You might, your beer may be several feet long, but whatever, right?

14:57.920 --> 15:05.760
Like if he, if you, um, maybe I wouldn't recommend diving directly into C plus plus,

15:05.760 --> 15:11.920
although you said John, cause it's more ways to get hurt there. But you know, the future is,

15:13.040 --> 15:19.600
well, as last as Chris would tell you with the home pot, no, it's rest. Oh, savage. No,

15:19.600 --> 15:23.840
but really that was, that was brutal. You caught me off guard with that one. Misa very upset with

15:23.840 --> 15:30.800
you, Chris. I mean, I don't know. We figure out what you want to do. Java's fine. I, although I

15:30.800 --> 15:35.520
would say if you want to learn Java, take a look at Kotlin cause that's, I mean, we have a

15:35.520 --> 15:39.840
story in the doc for the show that we're going to ignore it like we traditionally do, but Kotlin's

15:39.840 --> 15:46.320
gaining momentum and mind share at a rate that's shocking. Right. It's so if you really like the

15:46.320 --> 15:51.360
Java ecosystem, I would, um, maybe some Android Devon Kotlin, Chris, what do you think? Yeah. You

15:51.360 --> 15:56.400
know, I actually feel like we should take a moment and maybe we should just reduce expectations. Um,

15:56.960 --> 16:05.200
I feel like we need to, we need to have some lowered expectations

16:05.200 --> 16:10.880
because when you're outside the industry, there is this mystique about software developers,

16:10.880 --> 16:17.120
like they have God mode privileges in life where they can spontaneously create life from

16:17.120 --> 16:23.840
applications. It's not how it works. In fact, Leo, if you're asking these questions, you're probably

16:23.840 --> 16:30.000
further ahead than most people that were in actually already in the software development

16:30.000 --> 16:34.480
field. And I don't mean to be, can you pass fizzbuzz? I don't mean to be disrespectful to

16:34.480 --> 16:38.960
people listening to the show, but many people in the software development field don't have any

16:38.960 --> 16:44.320
idea what they're doing and they're just Googling it as they go along. And if you're going to talk

16:44.320 --> 16:52.320
about me directly, that's what Linux unplugged was for. Yes, I heard it the other week. You know,

16:52.320 --> 16:57.360
it's just one of those things though where like you have to learn as you go. And if you're asking

16:57.360 --> 17:04.080
these questions and you have a passion for this field, then you may be more qualified than 75%

17:04.080 --> 17:07.360
of the people that are already in the field. The fact that you're listening to podcasts in

17:07.360 --> 17:11.360
a show called Coder Radio, hell, if you were just listening to that awful BSD Now show,

17:11.360 --> 17:17.920
that would be fine too. So I think Leo is probably better off than most people. And then he's asking

17:17.920 --> 17:23.600
if he's too young at 25. Chris, I will bet you a beer. Leo, you should email me again, email me

17:23.600 --> 17:30.080
directly and copy crazy man over here on it. We will send you fizzbuzz online. If you pass it,

17:30.080 --> 17:34.640
Chris owes me a beer. And if you fail it, I owe him a beer. Dude, I bet you by Linux Fest Northwest,

17:34.640 --> 17:41.280
he has a job. Oh, that's way away. I bet you by Jan one, he has a job. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So

17:41.280 --> 17:46.560
the next one comes in from a guy named Ryan. He says, please discuss how you evaluate open source

17:46.560 --> 17:53.600
libraries, frameworks, or software for inclusion in your own projects, especially if those projects

17:53.600 --> 18:01.120
are part of a production system. Thanks. And keep up the awesome work. So I think what Mike does is

18:01.120 --> 18:08.640
he, he evaluates them from a position of fear. That is correct. I curl up into a defensive crouch.

18:10.400 --> 18:16.960
And unless I see the following letters, I ignore them. MIT, PSD, or Apache. And it better be Apache

18:16.960 --> 18:23.680
too. I think that we should all make those businesses fail. Now, why? I, this seems unreasonable.

18:25.200 --> 18:30.560
Well, we just talked about my whole thing with Q right? Like, cause the LG, it's hard and confusing

18:30.560 --> 18:37.040
and it could cost you a lot of headaches. If you get it wrong, it's negative in the freedom.

18:37.600 --> 18:42.560
Now that's just the licensing side thing. Yeah. Let's assume that you're not as a,

18:42.560 --> 18:47.760
let's say conservative with my patented high pitch, which it makes me sad now that I know

18:47.760 --> 18:53.760
how many people heard that. I should grab that. Somebody needs to grab that and send it to me.

18:53.760 --> 18:58.640
Conservative? Go grab that. I'll soundboard it. You know, I will not pull in a gem or I'm using

18:58.640 --> 19:03.680
gem, obviously Ruby gems, but let's just use the word gem to mean package, or we could just use

19:03.680 --> 19:09.920
package. That hasn't been updated in like a year from GitHub. Oh God, dude. Cause I'm not crazy.

19:09.920 --> 19:15.120
Oh, I mean, I don't do anything. And we've talked about this before. I don't do anything below

19:15.120 --> 19:21.520
version 1.0. Sure. As rule, that's an arbitrary rule, but it helps me weed out the, like, for

19:21.520 --> 19:25.920
instance, I have a package called Kurt Kurt's JS named after Kurt's from the heart of darkness.

19:25.920 --> 19:34.960
That's a JavaScript package. It's 0.02 or 0.01 or 0.0. No, sorry, 0.0.2. So I wouldn't even ship

19:34.960 --> 19:44.080
that. Um, it's on GitHub if you're really curious, but yeah, that, I mean, I don't know. I do tend

19:44.080 --> 19:50.160
to like look at the code. I mean, I don't do a deep analysis of it. Um, but again, I am pretty

19:50.160 --> 19:56.320
conservative on this. I tend to use packages. For instance, if I'm on Cocoa pods, I don't go off the

19:56.320 --> 20:02.240
beaten path. I use packages that are generally accepted by the iOS community. If I'm in rails,

20:02.240 --> 20:11.600
again, I tend to try to use the bigger gems. Um, I have rolled my own gems for private use or for

20:11.600 --> 20:16.720
private customers once or twice, but I don't think that's really what you're asking about because

20:16.720 --> 20:20.960
that's kind of a different ball game. Yeah. I don't know, Chris. I feel like in a way, this is

20:20.960 --> 20:27.440
like, how much risk do you take on your dependencies is really what, what the, uh, what, uh, Ryan is

20:27.440 --> 20:34.880
asking here, man. And I, I take very little. I, yeah, I, I, uh, I would agree that that's the way

20:34.880 --> 20:43.040
to go. I just had a conversation this morning about a, uh, a series of different exploits that

20:43.040 --> 20:49.600
are in different, um, repositories for, for a lot of different open source projects. We're thinking

20:49.600 --> 20:56.080
about doing like a, uh, uh, uh, an overall recap for tech snap on like, these are all open source

20:56.080 --> 21:00.080
projects that you use that have software repositories built into them that have

21:00.080 --> 21:04.560
vulnerabilities. And it's just, can I just stop real quick? Yeah. So how many times are you going

21:04.560 --> 21:09.520
to mention open SSL? Is it like one for open a cell or is it, or is it, is it chronological?

21:09.520 --> 21:14.080
How many, I mean like how many different versions and like all of it, it's just, it's really

21:14.080 --> 21:21.440
staggering. It's, it's humbling when you look at it. And I, I don't know, I don't know exactly how

21:21.440 --> 21:26.160
to tackle it because the argument is a little stale at this point. It's the same argument you

21:26.160 --> 21:30.560
could apply to Docker hub, the same argument you could apply to Ruby, the same argument you could

21:30.560 --> 21:35.600
apply to snaps or flat packs, everything, every, every development platform has some sort of

21:35.600 --> 21:39.440
package manager, right? That's why I'm trying to not say jam, but coding in Ruby this morning.

21:40.240 --> 21:46.800
Yeah. Yeah. I, I know, I know. And West put it in a really good way. He's like,

21:46.800 --> 21:51.840
right now we're still in the ascent of all of these platforms where they are trying to solve

21:51.840 --> 21:57.680
a problem. They're optimistic. They're enthusiastic. They're, they're really pushing forward and it's

21:57.680 --> 22:03.920
the ascent, but there will be a reckoning. There will be a winter where all of this comes due. And

22:05.440 --> 22:10.400
the sysadmin, I don't know, it's not even the sysadmin. I was going to say the sysadmin in me,

22:10.400 --> 22:15.600
but really it's the, maybe it's the, maybe it's the, maybe it's the sysadmin, but I don't know.

22:15.600 --> 22:20.160
Maybe it's the, maybe it's the pen tester. Maybe it was the security auditor, whatever it is. Like

22:20.160 --> 22:24.880
there's a part of me that is getting extremely anxious by all of the software that is built

22:24.880 --> 22:30.480
on what feels like, if you'll excuse the cliche, a house of cards.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.920
Yeah, I feel the same way. I wish in fact, one of us disagreed, but.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.440
Yeah, I know, right?

22:38.160 --> 22:44.960
I, I have come to the point where you gotta remember I, I've been doing this on a limited

22:44.960 --> 22:49.840
number of platforms for a long time, right? So for instance, when I didn't like what happened to ASI

22:49.840 --> 22:53.600
HTTP, which was a great networking platform on iOS back in the day, and we're going back to like

22:53.600 --> 22:59.440
2010 here, I wrote my own called MD networking. And I used that for several years until Alamo

22:59.440 --> 23:03.760
fire came out or actually wasn't even called Alamo fire. Alamo fire is the new version. It

23:03.760 --> 23:09.520
was called AF networking, but I, I really don't like to have a bunch of little dependencies,

23:10.480 --> 23:12.080
right? I just, I don't trust it.

23:12.080 --> 23:17.760
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And you get bit in the butt a few times and, you know, you develop that,

23:18.560 --> 23:23.920
that persuasion. Ryan W writes into the show. He says, hey guys, great show. I started listening

23:23.920 --> 23:29.680
a few months ago and loved the show. Finally, someone I can talk nerd with. He says, I just

23:29.680 --> 23:34.880
wanted to provide some insight on the part of Coda radio about how Red Hat employees felt

23:34.880 --> 23:37.680
let down as they didn't find out about the-

23:37.680 --> 23:38.960
Somebody said Red Hat, take a shot.

23:38.960 --> 23:45.120
I know, right? As they didn't find out about the announcement until well after the announcement

23:45.120 --> 23:53.680
was made. Well, I worked at Intel and this happens all the time. Since IBM and Red Hat are public

23:53.680 --> 24:00.000
companies on the stock market, they aren't allowed to say anything or warn their employees. You can

24:00.000 --> 24:05.760
imagine insider trading and media leaks that would be possible if everyone was formed ahead of

24:05.760 --> 24:06.880
time. Intel-

24:06.880 --> 24:10.240
I did imagine I had my Robinhood app open ready to roll. Damn it.

24:11.520 --> 24:17.120
Intel is the first public company I've worked at. So I've always felt a little let down when Intel

24:17.120 --> 24:23.280
makes a big announcement like the hardware bugs found this year or our CEO getting fired out of

24:23.280 --> 24:30.240
nowhere and product announcements that came what seemed like to me as an employee out of nowhere,

24:30.800 --> 24:35.760
et cetera, et cetera. It goes on. I think that's just life in a public company. Unfortunately,

24:35.760 --> 24:42.480
one thing that I think of, didn't Red Hat recently denounce ButterFS and then Facebook open source

24:42.480 --> 24:48.400
all of their code, which includes ButterFS, which they clearly are using, which they think is a

24:48.400 --> 24:57.360
great file system? I wonder if that was IBM's doing. And I bet both companies agreed they were

24:57.360 --> 25:02.800
in talks at that point. Just a theory. I don't know. Well, I don't think any of that about

25:02.800 --> 25:09.200
ButterFS is true. See our coverage of Project Stratus. Yeah, I don't buy that. I mean, I don't

25:09.200 --> 25:13.840
want to get into the file system thing, but- You know, I'll just say from a recent acquisition

25:13.840 --> 25:20.640
that I have some familiarity with that, yeah, you do go through the majority of the process without

25:20.640 --> 25:26.800
informing the general staff. Now, in the case of the situation that I was familiar with, the general

25:26.800 --> 25:34.160
staff had a solid 30 days, heads up, and nobody seemed to leak it. It did actually leak the morning

25:34.160 --> 25:38.880
of the announcement, which was delayed by a week because I was in the hospital, not that I have

25:38.880 --> 25:46.720
direct experience. So the company knew for a solid five weeks, like all staff knew. What kind of a

25:46.720 --> 25:52.320
JB? Yeah, I am. Yeah, we all knew. Well, I had to let you guys know, of course. I didn't want to

25:52.320 --> 25:57.120
surprise you and like- Well, I spent a month not making fun of Linux hippies. I thought I was

25:57.120 --> 26:04.480
telegraphing that. I didn't want to get fired immediately like that, geez. So there are obviously

26:04.480 --> 26:10.880
different ways of handling those kinds of announcements, and it changes as the company

26:10.880 --> 26:18.240
scales. But I'm not, I don't know, man. I feel like the Red Hat thing was still a bit rushed,

26:18.240 --> 26:23.920
like the staff is the number one asset of that company. And so if you piss them all off and they

26:23.920 --> 26:28.560
leave, you've basically devalued the company. So you've got to handle that. Yeah, I mean,

26:30.640 --> 26:39.440
you know, I have nothing nice to say about the Red Hat IBM thing. Not that this show has ever

26:39.440 --> 26:47.120
been nice, but I feel like it's almost a waste. Now why? IBM is a bad company doing bad things.

26:47.120 --> 26:53.760
Really? Really? Isn't this them? What about them seeing the light? No bullshit.

26:55.120 --> 27:00.480
I will eat my hat if domestic and high wage country Red Hat employees don't get whacked.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.560
What's your timeline here? I don't know what my timeline is. It all depends on the... See,

27:06.560 --> 27:10.240
I am not a finance guy. It all depends on the financial machinations and contracts and things

27:10.240 --> 27:19.600
like that. I just... I don't know. I knew some people who used to work for IBM. I've seen what

27:19.600 --> 27:24.960
they can do when they decide... You know, IBM is effectively a consulting company.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.520
And I have no disrespect for some of the great work they've done, Watson, things like that,

27:30.080 --> 27:34.240
but they're bread and butter straight up consulting.

27:34.240 --> 27:39.280
And sales, yeah. They're basically an offshoring shop,

27:40.000 --> 27:45.360
which if you're a long time listener, you know I'm not a big fan, though I've learned to make

27:45.360 --> 27:54.560
my peace. I will tell you... Can I take a side tangent here? Always. Always. Okay. So Disney...

27:55.840 --> 28:02.400
I live in Florida now. Disney had a very large IT and development shop down here. It was there. It

28:02.400 --> 28:08.320
was in-house. So it was Disney, whatever they called it, right? Cool. And they did what was

28:08.320 --> 28:14.800
called in the papers as pulling an IBM. They fired all the Floridian workers and offshored everything

28:15.920 --> 28:22.000
to India and the Far East. They framed it as pulling an IBM. The local news... Well,

28:22.000 --> 28:27.760
you got to remember... I'm in the South, buddy. Yikes, though. That's... Yeah.

28:27.760 --> 28:36.320
It's... And I have to say, that is not good for a tech community in any local area.

28:37.360 --> 28:43.680
So I hope IBM is as good as their press release. That's all I'm going to say on it.

28:47.040 --> 28:51.920
Wow. Wow. I don't know. I thought you'd be all on board, Mr. Business, Mr. Capitalist.

28:51.920 --> 28:55.840
I thought you'd be all on board with this. I think you should rewind to 2014 and tell

28:55.840 --> 29:01.120
me exactly how I feel about it. By the way, if you're a new listener, I urge you... What year

29:01.120 --> 29:06.240
was Swift released? I urge you to listen to that WWC episode. We should do more live shows just

29:06.240 --> 29:11.280
in case that happens. No, I don't think we should. In fact, I don't... I don't know, man. I agree

29:11.280 --> 29:16.320
in one way, but the other way, it's like a cornerstone of these shows. We should...

29:17.840 --> 29:21.920
I mean, you're Mr. Numbers today. I have to imagine that's one of our more popular episodes.

29:21.920 --> 29:25.280
You know, I don't have numbers on that one. That is a good question.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.880
I can tell you, I got a lot of interesting... And when I say interesting, I mean,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.600
you know... Career ending.

29:33.440 --> 29:37.200
Whenever you have an episode where someone can email you and say that you're a rapacious

29:37.200 --> 29:40.960
capitalist who only cares about himself, and then another one can say that you're a communist hippie

29:40.960 --> 29:45.760
who hates progress. You did a good episode right there. You hit a good mark. I think that we could

29:45.760 --> 29:52.480
all make those businesses fail. That's a two RMS... Yeah, that's a double RMS.

29:52.480 --> 29:58.000
So if you haven't heard it, say that I was a little surprised and upset by Swift.

30:00.560 --> 30:07.600
Let's just go with that. Yeah. All right. Well, bringing us back to the end of 2018,

30:08.480 --> 30:15.120
I have to ask you, what are you going to do? What are you going to do to make sure that 2019 isn't

30:15.120 --> 30:20.720
yet another year where you struggle with hardware? Because I got to be honest, I think I'm pretty

30:20.720 --> 30:27.440
much there, man. As of like three months ago, I think I landed on my ideal hardware setup.

30:27.440 --> 30:31.520
I haven't been on this show bitching about my hardware setup. And the recent discussion I had

30:31.520 --> 30:36.960
about the iPad Pro really only augments what I'm already doing. But you, on the other hand,

30:36.960 --> 30:43.120
just burned through a couple of laptops and your prospects are looking bad. I just want to say for

30:43.120 --> 30:46.400
the end of the year episode this year, I want to go through every machine I've destroyed this year.

30:46.400 --> 30:52.560
Yeah. We should have some heart music underneath. Like the end of the Hunger Games where they fire

30:52.560 --> 30:58.560
the cannons every time someone dies. Yeah. I currently do not have a laptop because of

30:58.560 --> 31:06.720
time dilation, but when you hear this, I'm almost sure I will have a MacBook Pro. So I did acquire

31:06.720 --> 31:12.800
a System76 Aurex when I got back to Florida. Thank you time dilation. And I have been reviewing it

31:12.800 --> 31:18.800
and I do not like it. It is not a bad machine. It is not appropriate for my very heavy travel

31:18.800 --> 31:21.520
schedule. All right. Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.

31:21.520 --> 31:24.080
So what's the price range for this system?

31:26.720 --> 31:29.040
According to the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

31:29.040 --> 31:32.560
Oh really? You don't want to say because you're embarrassed how expensive it is.

31:32.560 --> 31:38.320
It was, I was in MacBook Pro territory. Holy. It was. How much RAM? How much RAM?

31:38.320 --> 31:44.480
32 gigs. Oh. All right. So I could just tell you, I tweeted it out. So it's not like it's a big deal.

31:45.200 --> 31:49.680
Ah, geez. I got to go on my own Twitter. That's like, see, going on my own Twitter is like the

31:49.680 --> 31:53.520
morning you wake up with a bottle of Hendrix next to you and you're like, oh no. And then all of a

31:53.520 --> 31:58.240
sudden it's all Kara Swisher just right down the damn line. It really is. It's crazy. We're never

31:58.240 --> 32:03.040
letting that die. You and her. We just can't. Although we agreed. Uh-uh. We got along. Yeah.

32:03.040 --> 32:09.120
Recently it's been nice. I got to say. It's gotten pleasant. All right. So I have a problem here

32:09.120 --> 32:12.880
because I don't use Twitter very much. Like looking at people's feeds other than replying.

32:14.320 --> 32:19.280
I thought I posted a picture. Can I just link to that? Yes. Oh, here it is.

32:21.120 --> 32:25.840
I conveniently didn't include the price. Hold on. Chris and Mike get old on Twitter real quick.

32:25.840 --> 32:33.680
Let's see. Let me see. So it's a, yeah. How much is it? I just, I like how Coyote thinks Mike

32:33.680 --> 32:39.840
802 was me. It is not me. No, no. I like that they're fighting though. He's fighting. He's

32:39.840 --> 32:46.240
fighting like it is you. Oh, come on. Tell me the specs and let's see if I can guess it. And then

32:46.240 --> 32:50.320
you tell me how close I get. All right. I'll just read it. Okay. Papa Wesley. That doesn't matter.

32:50.320 --> 32:58.160
Right. Six a gigabyte GTX 10 60 with a 12 80 CUDA 15.6 mat 10 ADP. I did not go for the 4k

32:58.800 --> 33:05.440
4.1 I seven blah, blah, blah. 12 friends. You went big on that. Oh, did I go big, Chris? Uh,

33:05.440 --> 33:14.000
32 gigs. It was $30 off. I just want to say that, uh, 500 gig NVME $25 off, no additional M2 drive

33:14.000 --> 33:22.400
and a 1.1 terabyte 2.5 SSD. Hmm. Huh. That's tricky. So you upped the CPU and you up the

33:22.400 --> 33:28.800
storage and you compromised on the screen is what I'm hearing. Uh, actually on Linux, I,

33:28.800 --> 33:34.320
I actually prefer the, uh, the map, uh, the 10 80 rather, but I mean, from like a price standpoint,

33:35.200 --> 33:39.680
it's a compromise. Yeah. The 4ks sucks on the next, but we can keep going. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm

33:39.680 --> 33:50.480
going to guess, um, so you said 512 MVNE 32 gigs of Ram 4.2 gigahertz. I seven 15.4 inch 10 ADP

33:50.480 --> 33:56.880
display. How you didn't say, but remember prices, right? Rules here. Okay. I'm going to say,

33:56.880 --> 34:08.800
I'm going to say $2,200. How did you just configure it? No, no. I just totally $2,232.9.

34:08.800 --> 34:18.240
I brought up the receipt. Yeah. That's the sign. We buy too many computers, dude. I was like,

34:18.240 --> 34:23.760
did he just like go into the thing and build it? Yeah. That's a bad sign. That's not a good. So

34:23.760 --> 34:28.800
that's not something to be proud of. So I have no idea what's going on in the chat room,

34:28.800 --> 34:33.520
but we're just going to ignore it. So I'm going to do a quick review of the Oryx pro people who

34:33.520 --> 34:36.640
yell at me and read it every week for talking about hardware. Now that I know that you're a

34:36.640 --> 34:40.160
vast minority of listeners, which Chris should never have told me, we're going to do this all

34:40.160 --> 34:48.240
the time. Uh, it is a great machine. I actually like it a lot. Even it is not appropriate for me.

34:48.240 --> 34:54.240
And let me tell you why I am not a hundred percent developer anymore. Oh, oh, here we go.

34:54.960 --> 35:00.160
Right. I am half a sales guy because I have to travel as we know much of the chagrin of lady

35:00.160 --> 35:05.920
Angela all the time, whether I'm driving somewhere else in Florida or flying to Texas or New Jersey

35:05.920 --> 35:11.600
or Pennsylvania, wherever I'm going. Right. I need a machine that ha that is small enough that I can

35:11.600 --> 35:17.120
fit in a briefcase and has battery life. That's long enough that if I get in a bind and I don't

35:17.120 --> 35:22.800
have good access to a power outlet, I can function for at least like five or six hours. Yeah. And

35:22.800 --> 35:28.400
that is unfortunately fairly common. Like you can even get unreliable power when you're traveling,

35:28.400 --> 35:33.040
like that the whole rain, the plane may not have a plugin at all, or like you got to unplug at

35:33.040 --> 35:36.960
certain points in time or you get a seat when you're waiting to board that doesn't have a plugin.

35:38.400 --> 35:43.760
I mean, you know, last week we talked about, um, you know, my difficulties and travel with delays

35:43.760 --> 35:48.480
and whatever. This was, this is the thing that pushed me over the edge. In addition to me frying

35:48.480 --> 35:54.240
out my Gallego pro. So you, you, you kill a Gallego pro and your, your thought process is

35:54.240 --> 36:06.000
I'll go order an Oryx. Have you ever noticed that I drink a lot? I'm half kidding. That would make

36:06.000 --> 36:16.880
some sense. Yeah. So, okay. Longtime listeners know that I've had two perverse dreams pro level

36:16.880 --> 36:23.760
tablets, which cost me $40,000 and laptops as desktops, but also with the battery life of

36:23.760 --> 36:28.560
ultra books that has cost me. Actually, I think we're almost tied at this point. I think we're

36:28.560 --> 36:33.280
getting there. The laptops are getting there. Yeah. I mean, I mean, to be fair, like, so when

36:33.280 --> 36:38.000
you own a small business and you've got contractors and you've got employees, there's never really

36:38.000 --> 36:43.680
like a wasted computer. I'm not trying to give you an excuse, but I'm just the irony. I am not

36:43.680 --> 36:48.640
actually going to return the Oryx. It's just going to be given to a dev who works here. Yeah. Right.

36:48.640 --> 36:53.200
Yeah. So it's like, it's not that it's, it's not, you can't say that it's money well spent,

36:53.200 --> 36:57.360
but it's not a total loss either because now somebody else on your team has a new computer.

36:58.160 --> 37:04.720
Right. So like, that's, I'm not saying that's how I justify it, but it's a factor. It is. And also

37:04.720 --> 37:14.080
the tax write-off is a factor as well. Well, yeah. I mean, let's not go into that, but I mean,

37:15.120 --> 37:19.680
you know, Chris, this has been a rough journey for me on this whole hardware stuff. It has. Yeah.

37:19.680 --> 37:23.440
I really wanted it to be the case that I could buy one laptop

37:24.320 --> 37:27.280
that would have the expansion capabilities and do everything I need.

37:29.360 --> 37:35.360
And that's just not the case. Right. It's just wrong. Yeah. So I had to read.

37:35.360 --> 37:39.280
You're crazy. You're wrong. And the answer is right in front of you and you just don't see it.

37:39.280 --> 37:42.800
All right. Tell me what it is. No, no. I mean, I don't want to interrupt. I want to hear what

37:42.800 --> 37:46.880
you did, but then I'm going to tell you how wrong it is. I can tell you what I did. I ordered the

37:46.880 --> 37:52.960
Oryx because I was frustrated that my Gallego was dead. Sure. And, you know, I wanted a laptop.

37:52.960 --> 37:57.120
I've been happy on Linux. The other the only other real alternative for me is a MacBook,

37:57.840 --> 38:05.280
which tweet me tomorrow. I don't know. I mean, my Gallego was dead. I gave away my MacBook Pro

38:05.280 --> 38:11.440
as people listen last week show now. So what option did I have? Are you going to tell me

38:11.440 --> 38:17.280
about the USBC daisy chain dongle lifestyle? I am. Oh, get out of town. No, no, no. I am

38:17.280 --> 38:20.320
going to tell you about it. I'm going to tell you about it. And you need to listen, son.

38:20.320 --> 38:23.840
Now, I understand. OK. Yeah. It's not an intervention, though, right?

38:24.960 --> 38:30.640
No, it is. It is. OK. OK. Let me hear it then. I mean, I appreciate that both you and I are

38:30.640 --> 38:36.240
scheduled to attend a System 76 event in Denver, Colorado. And what I'm about to say, I don't I

38:36.240 --> 38:40.720
don't think I don't think. Well, I'm not. Yeah. Yeah. No, you were going to. But now that I was

38:40.720 --> 38:47.440
going to. But you can't weddings. And I don't think they appreciate any of it. No, no, no.

38:47.440 --> 38:54.640
So here's the thing. You got to you just got to wrap your head around Thunderbolt three,

38:54.640 --> 38:58.160
son. You just got it. You just got to embrace Thunderbolt three. So let me tell you something.

38:59.040 --> 39:04.240
I got the iPad pro now, and that's where I have shunted all of my electron based application

39:04.240 --> 39:09.760
workflows to the iPad where I have native applications and I have 24 hours of battery life.

39:09.760 --> 39:17.200
Then on the old laptop, I have gone with a Lenovo ThinkPad T480 that has a Thunderbolt

39:17.200 --> 39:24.320
three port and attached to that Thunderbolt three port. Brace yourself. I have an NVIDIA

39:24.320 --> 39:32.480
GPU Lenovo doc. Oh, my God. You're going external GPU. I got an external GPU, baby, with two

39:32.480 --> 39:38.720
monitors. Sick bastard. What are the specs on the GPU? Well, it's nothing. It's a GTX 1060,

39:38.720 --> 39:43.040
I think. I mean, it's not it's not like it's not a blow your face off graphics.

39:43.040 --> 39:48.240
But it means when I when I take the laptop and I unplug it from that Thunderbolt three cable,

39:48.240 --> 39:53.520
I've got Intel everything and I've got like eight to nine hours of battery life in a Linux machine.

39:54.160 --> 40:02.080
And it's a 1080p display. I give you that. But I've got Ethernet built in. I've got USB-A. I've

40:02.080 --> 40:09.120
got USB-C. I've got Thunderbolt. And I have got one of the best keyboards I've ever had in a computer

40:09.120 --> 40:16.560
ever. It is a great frickin keyboard. And whenever I come back to my office, I plug in. Bob's your

40:16.560 --> 40:21.280
uncle. I've got a GPU. I've got two extra monitors. I've got a couple of USB devices. I've got some

40:21.280 --> 40:26.640
big speakers and I'm good to go. And if I need to do something on the NVIDIA graphics, it's all

40:26.640 --> 40:32.080
built in. The NVIDIA driver just detects it. I switch over from the Intel stuff to the NVIDIA

40:32.080 --> 40:40.800
stuff. And Richard's my uncle. I'm off to work. And it it really is. I mean, it's just it's so

40:40.800 --> 40:46.320
much it's so much simpler than what you're trying to get at. You are going at this from a 2002s

40:46.320 --> 40:53.520
perspective. And in 2018, you get yourself a tablet that runs iOS, which iOS equals mainstream

40:53.520 --> 40:59.200
applications. I travel like a maniac right now. That's one of the reasons we're even recording

40:59.200 --> 41:06.160
right now is because as we record this, I'm in the air. And well, I mean, as it releases. So I

41:06.160 --> 41:12.320
book all of these flights and I book where I park my car, the lot that I park my car at. I book the

41:12.320 --> 41:17.760
rental when I get to Texas. I book the hotel. I book the flight. I book the lounge. I book

41:17.760 --> 41:24.800
the food I want to eat on the flight. All of it is done with apps, not a Web page, not a program

41:26.160 --> 41:31.760
with a Web, with a with an app that is probably a Web app inside an app, to be honest. But it is

41:31.760 --> 41:38.240
an app. And I do all of that with my little toy computer that doesn't hook up to Thunderbolt,

41:38.240 --> 41:44.160
that just does those things, it runs those proprietary service specific applications.

41:44.160 --> 41:51.120
And then on my computer, where I can run anything I want, I have a Lenovo ThinkPad T480 that is

41:51.120 --> 41:55.520
pretty powerful. It's got 32 gigs of RAM. It's got an i7 mobile processor in it.

41:55.520 --> 42:02.240
It's got a terabyte NVME drive and a 1080p screen with, like I said, one of the best keyboards I've

42:02.240 --> 42:06.960
ever used in a computer. And then if I need more than that, when I'm sitting down at my desk,

42:07.520 --> 42:13.040
I hook it up over Thunderbolt 3. I go into a dock, multiple monitors, one of them is horizontal,

42:13.040 --> 42:17.280
one of them is vertical, and I got an NVIDIA card built into the damn thing.

42:17.280 --> 42:22.080
And I'm hooked up to Ethernet. And what you're trying to do, where you're trying to put all

42:22.080 --> 42:26.240
the power in the laptop, it's never going to work, my friend. You've got to break it up.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.480
But don't you have like, wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.360
It's never going to work.

42:31.360 --> 42:34.000
No, I know it's not going to work. So my answer is tower,

42:34.800 --> 42:36.800
travel laptop with good battery life, right?

42:36.800 --> 42:38.800
Yeah, that would work. That would be great. That would also work.

42:38.800 --> 42:43.680
So it's like Linux power tower, MacBook, or MacBook Pro.

42:43.680 --> 42:44.080
Yeah.

42:44.080 --> 42:44.640
That seems like the answer.

42:44.640 --> 42:47.440
You're not including the tablet in there, though. So I think-

42:47.440 --> 42:51.360
Well, and the tablet. I mean, the tablet is, ironically, I don't mention the tablet. The

42:51.360 --> 42:54.640
tablet's what I use probably most of the time, right? If I'm tapping at an email, whatever.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.240
Right. Or booking a flight.

42:56.960 --> 43:01.120
But every once in a while, I need to like make a build on the fly or like SSH. Although,

43:01.120 --> 43:06.240
ISSH we talked about last week. So things are changing. I will give you that. I just don't

43:06.240 --> 43:08.720
feel like I'm there yet for the iPad to be my travel.

43:08.720 --> 43:13.280
No, no, absolutely not. But I think trying to buy something like the Oryx Pro, it's just-

43:14.320 --> 43:20.000
It was the wrong thought process for me. Now, if you just like want a laptop to move around

43:20.000 --> 43:23.920
rooms, but you basically work at home or you work in an office, I actually think it's a great

43:23.920 --> 43:32.160
dev state. Compiling, spoiler alert, we're doing a follow-up product to Alice. Compiling that on it

43:32.160 --> 43:39.840
was really, really, really fast, but it doesn't have good battery life. At least not. And it does

43:39.840 --> 43:44.480
have a clever thing where you can switch from Intel to the Nvidia card, which does improve

43:44.480 --> 43:48.800
your battery life, but it's not enough for someone who travels like you and I do, I feel like.

43:48.800 --> 43:53.680
Yeah. If you're moving from one room to another room, if you're doing a 30-minute meeting with

43:53.680 --> 43:58.880
your laptop, it's great for that. If you have a power cord at your desk at work and you have a

43:58.880 --> 44:04.320
power cord at your desk at home and you're moving your laptop between work and home, it's good. It's

44:04.320 --> 44:09.840
great. It's great for that. I say that as I have an Oryx and a Bonobo out in the other room right

44:09.840 --> 44:16.400
now and they're both hooked up to power. This is one of the weird situations where the Oryx

44:16.400 --> 44:22.800
is a great machine for the people who work for me, but not for me. Because I'm the only guy who

44:22.800 --> 44:28.960
actually goes on the road into the sales right now. Yeah. I mean, for me, I feel like you're

44:28.960 --> 44:35.760
still not quite... I'm not hearing the gospel. You're not wrapping your head around the good

44:35.760 --> 44:42.320
word of Thunderbolt 3. Well, so the thing is, is you invest in one dock and then you have multiple

44:42.320 --> 44:49.600
machines that take advantage of that singular investment. So not that I emailed the Apple rep

44:49.600 --> 44:56.080
that works with me during recordings, but I asked him to spec out and quote out a 15-inch Mac Pro

44:56.080 --> 45:03.360
with a Radeon card. Is it that you're telling me that I should go... And I prefer the 13-inch form

45:03.360 --> 45:08.160
factor for any laptop, frankly. In fact, the Gallardo... When you're in a hotel room, when

45:08.160 --> 45:12.240
you're on an airplane, when do you need a video card? Have you ever needed a video card in those

45:12.240 --> 45:16.240
particular instances? Well, there was that one time me and you were in that hotel room that we

45:16.240 --> 45:23.280
don't talk about. Yeah. That thing is GPU accelerated for Intel as well. I was... Wow.

45:25.200 --> 45:31.680
Jeez. Hey, all right. Hey, first-person VR virtual porn is extremely GPU intensive.

45:32.720 --> 45:35.040
It's true. We've established that we've never actually met, so...

45:36.880 --> 45:40.960
Actually, have we said that on air? We did on air. We did on air on the last show.

45:40.960 --> 45:43.520
Well, I thought we did. That might've been pre-show for all I know.

45:43.520 --> 45:48.560
Oh, geez. I know. That's why people got to show up over at jblive.tv and listen.

45:48.560 --> 45:54.720
No. You actually make a tremendously money-saving point here. When I am traveling,

45:54.720 --> 46:00.400
I am effectively a sales guy. I need to be able to run the software, but I don't necessarily

46:00.400 --> 46:06.560
need to be able to build everything. You're in ration mode, in a way. You're just surviving.

46:06.560 --> 46:13.120
Am I a MacBook Air customer? Well, no. You're an Intel video customer. Think about that,

46:13.120 --> 46:19.200
because you can take a machine that is basic graphics with a good processor and a good amount

46:19.200 --> 46:23.920
of RAM, and then when you get home, you plug it in over Thunderbolt 3, you got a nice GPU,

46:23.920 --> 46:29.920
you're good to go. And it's working really good on Linux. I don't have a lot of experience with

46:29.920 --> 46:33.680
Windows or Mac OS, but on Linux... It's terrible. It's terrible on Windows.

46:35.680 --> 46:38.640
The only tip I give you on Linux is to make things really smooth is

46:38.640 --> 46:44.000
is plug in the dock when your laptop is powered off and boot up that way.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.680
So you don't... I mean, this is nothing to do with code radio, but it's just a tools episode.

46:48.320 --> 46:52.480
You don't experience any latency with GPUs over USB Thunderbolt?

46:52.480 --> 46:53.040
Well, no, it's not.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.080
USB-C Thunderbolt.

46:54.080 --> 47:00.800
So Thunderbolt 3 is a PCI connection. So the video card is on essentially like a PCI 4X

47:01.360 --> 47:06.240
lane, which granted isn't 16X, but it's still better than what...

47:06.240 --> 47:10.560
I thought it had like less throughput than a regular PCI Express.

47:10.560 --> 47:16.480
It does, but it's still on the PCI bus. So it might be 2X or 4X depending on the laptop,

47:16.480 --> 47:20.960
but it's still better than what the integrated graphics is.

47:22.480 --> 47:27.600
It's nice. It even accelerates just the built-in screen. So even if I didn't have external

47:27.600 --> 47:33.280
monitors, my built-in screen gets the graphics. It's doing round trip. There's enough bandwidth

47:33.280 --> 47:38.080
that it can send the stuff to the GPU and the dock and then send the results back.

47:38.080 --> 47:43.200
And then the Intel card must be doing some sort of buffer pass and it's just dumping

47:43.200 --> 47:48.880
it on the screen. And I am able... Even on my built-in screen, I can take advantage of external

47:48.880 --> 47:49.920
graphics.

47:49.920 --> 47:56.240
So the specific use case I was thinking about and leaking from the top five here,

47:56.240 --> 48:02.160
compiling ML.net on a laptop on the road, if I need to change something.

48:02.160 --> 48:07.920
I guess you could always bring... So in the case of the Lenovo graphics dock, it is the

48:07.920 --> 48:14.400
same size of an average Thunderbolt 3 dock. It's pretty small, but there's some huge docks,

48:14.400 --> 48:15.600
like Blackmagic makes one.

48:15.600 --> 48:21.920
The pain of doing that on the Galego was... I mean, it was significant. Because the Galego,

48:21.920 --> 48:28.400
like you were saying, it's an i7, but it's an Intel i7. It was a serious process.

48:28.400 --> 48:30.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:30.320 --> 48:35.120
But on the Oryx, I mean, this is where I would be positive on the Oryx. It was lickety-split.

48:35.120 --> 48:39.680
Right. That was the idea, right? Is you take advantage of the built-in. So I could... This

48:39.680 --> 48:46.560
graphics GPU dock that I have for my ThinkPad, it would take up as much space in my bag as

48:46.560 --> 48:51.280
an audio interface. I mean, it's no big deal. It's totally packable.

48:51.280 --> 48:52.960
That's what you're saying.

48:52.960 --> 48:56.400
I don't think you need to, right? I mean, I don't really think you need to. If you go

48:56.400 --> 49:00.000
back to your desktop idea, you could also just remote desktop into a machine that has

49:00.000 --> 49:09.840
a great built-in GPU. But then you need good remote connectivity. Which, I don't know, man,

49:09.840 --> 49:11.120
that's tricky, like when you're doing like a...

49:11.120 --> 49:13.760
Well, I always carry a MiFi, so it's like not...

49:13.760 --> 49:18.160
Yeah, but it matters more like, okay, the demo is up, you got to do the demo, and you

49:18.160 --> 49:23.360
got a few minutes. There's sometimes where it's really, really, really, really nice to

49:23.360 --> 49:27.600
have that processing local, especially if you're on a deadline, if you're about to give

49:27.600 --> 49:30.800
a demo. That's where having the local processing really matters.

49:30.800 --> 49:34.880
I mean, once or twice a year, I get into these situations where I'm doing a demo, and there's

49:34.880 --> 49:38.880
an error, and I notice it the night before the demo, and I want to fix it, recompile

49:38.880 --> 49:38.880
the whole thing.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.640
But the night before, you could do remote desktop.

49:41.600 --> 49:42.080
Right.

49:42.080 --> 49:47.280
So yeah, that might be a solution that works for you. You got to embrace it. You got to

49:47.280 --> 49:49.920
think about it. You got to change the way you're thinking about this, because this isn't

49:49.920 --> 49:53.120
going to... You can't go through 2019 like this. You can't do it.

49:53.840 --> 49:57.360
This is a coder intervention. Somebody bang suggested.

49:57.360 --> 49:58.000
You got to.

49:58.000 --> 49:58.640
All right.

49:58.640 --> 49:59.280
Yeah.

49:59.280 --> 50:04.480
All right. Let's be positive. How about we go to the GitHub top programming languages

50:04.480 --> 50:05.200
chart?

50:05.200 --> 50:07.600
Oh, yeah. Where is this now?

50:07.600 --> 50:09.200
The link from the show notes, 334.

50:10.160 --> 50:13.600
I'll tell you what, you're talking about... Are you talking about the DigitalOcean survey

50:13.600 --> 50:14.640
that they did?

50:14.640 --> 50:15.760
I'm talking about the GitHub one.

50:15.760 --> 50:19.120
No, there's no GitHub one linked in the show notes.

50:19.120 --> 50:19.600
Yeah, there is.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.280
No, there's not.

50:21.280 --> 50:22.160
I'm looking at it.

50:22.160 --> 50:22.560
No.

50:22.560 --> 50:23.680
You're not in the right doc, buddy.

50:23.680 --> 50:26.320
No, I'm in 334. What are you talking about?

50:26.320 --> 50:27.520
I'm in 334.

50:27.520 --> 50:30.160
Yeah. Yeah, I don't see you here. You're in...

50:30.160 --> 50:31.120
I don't see you here.

50:33.920 --> 50:37.040
This is the part of the show where Mike live slacks Chris the doc.

50:37.760 --> 50:42.160
You got to give us credit though. For 334 episodes, we've actually never had that problem.

50:42.160 --> 50:44.320
We've been working on a doc this whole time.

50:44.320 --> 50:49.200
This whole thing, really, this is how you can tell how closely we follow the script on this show.

50:49.200 --> 50:52.240
Yeah. That would be the doc that I just sent you.

50:52.240 --> 50:54.960
A little sauce has been revealed, but it's for the better, I think.

50:54.960 --> 50:56.720
I think the audience should know. Well, they should know.

50:56.720 --> 51:01.600
Well, anyway, while Chris opens the doc, so the top three fastest growing languages

51:02.160 --> 51:07.040
by contributors as of September 30th, 2018. Number one, guess.

51:07.040 --> 51:09.120
In fact, it's good you didn't see the doc, Chris. Guess.

51:09.120 --> 51:09.840
Oh, yeah, you're right.

51:09.840 --> 51:12.160
I would normally say, if this was like three years ago-

51:12.160 --> 51:14.880
It's not Rust. I may help you. It's not Rust.

51:14.880 --> 51:17.440
No, I would have said that last year. I would have said that last year.

51:17.440 --> 51:17.760
Okay.

51:17.760 --> 51:21.200
But if this was three years ago, I would say JavaScript. Sure.

51:21.200 --> 51:23.600
Nope. Not even top 10.

51:23.600 --> 51:26.000
If this was last year, I would say Rust.

51:28.400 --> 51:31.840
This year, I got two contenders in mind. And I don't feel-

51:31.840 --> 51:33.440
Tell me the two before you make a pick.

51:33.440 --> 51:35.760
All right. I don't feel strong about either one of them.

51:35.760 --> 51:40.560
It's Go and Swift.

51:40.560 --> 51:41.760
Go is in the top 10. Swift is not even.

51:41.760 --> 51:43.360
Really? Really?

51:45.360 --> 51:45.920
Kotlin.

51:46.480 --> 51:48.320
No. Really?

51:48.320 --> 51:53.120
Absolutely. According to GitHub, it has 2.6 times the contributors over last year.

51:53.920 --> 51:56.720
Kotlin coming in for the win by a big margin.

51:56.720 --> 52:01.840
Kotlin coming in hard. Before that, number two is HCL, which is a specialty thing.

52:01.840 --> 52:06.480
Sure. That we don't cover here.

52:06.480 --> 52:09.600
No. TypeScript. Pretty popular though.

52:09.600 --> 52:10.880
Fucking TypeScript. Yeah.

52:10.880 --> 52:15.120
I mean, I'm sorry. Linuxing TypeScript. Ah, geez.

52:15.120 --> 52:18.240
PowerShell, though, number four, and then Rust at number fricking five.

52:18.240 --> 52:21.520
All right. I have a bone to pick with number four.

52:21.520 --> 52:21.840
Oh, yeah?

52:22.560 --> 52:25.600
PowerShell scripts are effectively C-sharp scripts. That's-

52:25.600 --> 52:26.560
Yeah. Fair enough.

52:26.560 --> 52:27.520
It's, yeah.

52:27.520 --> 52:28.000
Hello.

52:28.000 --> 52:28.720
And number five-

52:28.720 --> 52:33.280
I mean, if you're counting PowerShell scripts, then you better count Bash scripts.

52:34.880 --> 52:35.840
As what? C?

52:35.840 --> 52:38.720
If you were counting Bash, Bash would be number one on this list.

52:38.720 --> 52:42.080
Oh, sure. All right. Fair enough. Yeah. I mean, their list is a little weird.

52:42.080 --> 52:42.320
Yeah.

52:43.200 --> 52:50.960
What I thought was really interesting here is though, top programming languages by contributors,

52:50.960 --> 52:53.680
right? So the list we just did was top by growth.

52:55.280 --> 52:57.360
Right? Who had the biggest growth year over year.

52:57.360 --> 52:57.600
Yeah.

52:57.600 --> 53:02.320
This is absolute top. Give me your number one. And you had it right last time.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.200
Oh, JavaScript.

53:03.920 --> 53:06.320
Dominant. Dominant. Yeah.

53:07.040 --> 53:07.600
Number two.

53:08.240 --> 53:08.720
Java.

53:09.920 --> 53:16.560
Damn. Number three. Number three, we had a switch. We actually had a switcheroo here.

53:16.560 --> 53:17.520
The current number three.

53:18.720 --> 53:19.280
TypeScript?

53:20.320 --> 53:22.320
Python. But who did it dethrone?

53:23.600 --> 53:24.080
PHP.

53:24.080 --> 53:32.720
PHP. Yes. Savage. All right. The current number... Holy shit. Current number... This

53:32.720 --> 53:38.640
is a very confusing chart. Current number five. And we'll stop at number five. Number

53:38.640 --> 53:41.040
six is C sharp. So it's not C sharp. Number five.

53:43.600 --> 53:46.080
It's either PHP or TypeScript.

53:47.120 --> 53:48.160
C++.

53:48.160 --> 53:50.080
No. Oh, I didn't even get close.

53:50.080 --> 53:54.400
And I attribute that to IoT. I think there's a lot of C++... There's been some sort of

53:54.400 --> 53:55.040
renaissance.

53:55.600 --> 53:58.240
Okay. Yeah, I could see that. Yeah. That makes sense.

53:58.240 --> 54:00.560
TypeScript is number seven?

54:01.760 --> 54:02.160
Okay.

54:02.160 --> 54:03.280
And Objective-C.

54:03.280 --> 54:03.680
Yeah.

54:03.680 --> 54:04.720
Objective-C.

54:04.720 --> 54:07.280
Oh, yeah? How's Objective-C doing? Good, right?

54:07.280 --> 54:07.920
Things have been better.

54:07.920 --> 54:09.280
Solid. It's doing real good.

54:09.280 --> 54:09.600
Oh.

54:10.240 --> 54:11.920
You know, we've hit some hard times.

54:13.760 --> 54:17.520
Yeah. It gets even worse when you look at people that are contributing to the projects.

54:17.520 --> 54:20.160
Like, obviously, Objective-C is not even on the radar.

54:20.160 --> 54:25.120
It's so much worse. Objective-C has the only... All it has is legacy now, right?

54:25.120 --> 54:25.520
Yeah.

54:26.240 --> 54:28.640
Yeah. All right. And we'll do the last one.

54:28.640 --> 54:29.200
Okay.

54:29.200 --> 54:34.560
Top programming languages by repos created from 2008 to 2018.

54:36.240 --> 54:37.360
Give me your number one.

54:37.360 --> 54:40.640
So from 2008, it's got to be JavaScript.

54:40.640 --> 54:41.920
Yes, JavaScript. By a mile.

54:41.920 --> 54:42.800
Yeah, yeah.

54:42.800 --> 54:43.120
Next.

54:43.120 --> 54:53.440
Next is going to be... Next is going to be a gap, right? Because, like, nothing compares to

54:53.440 --> 54:54.000
JavaScript.

54:55.040 --> 54:56.960
There's the Grand Canyon between one and two.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.000
Is there? Yeah, okay. Okay.

54:58.000 --> 54:58.720
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

55:01.120 --> 55:04.640
You know, I'm going to say Google made the right call. I'm going to say it's Java.

55:05.520 --> 55:06.240
It is Java.

55:07.920 --> 55:11.680
Of course it's Java. They've had a good decade, really.

55:11.680 --> 55:18.160
Yeah. And then going off this chart, it looks like after that, there is essentially a gulf.

55:18.800 --> 55:24.400
After that is Python. And then way, way after that is PHP and Ruby.

55:25.040 --> 55:28.240
Didn't really expect to see much else there.

55:28.240 --> 55:31.280
But I don't know. We'll link to it in the show notes if you want to check it out.

55:31.280 --> 55:34.720
Coder.show slash three, three, four.

55:35.520 --> 55:38.880
Kotlin, though, is really the standout performer, isn't it? That's the kind of takeaway.

55:38.880 --> 55:44.880
Yeah. Yeah. For new repos created, Kotlin's definitely very quickly gaining mindshare,

55:44.880 --> 55:45.920
is how I would put it.

55:45.920 --> 55:51.520
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what to make of it. Because I can't help but think about

55:51.520 --> 55:56.800
Kotlin with the context of Fuchsia. And Fuchsia is this potentially looming

55:56.800 --> 56:02.880
total replacement for Android. And then would the Java apps be anything more than just a

56:02.880 --> 56:06.720
supported runtime? Would there be a totally new way to create applications? There's so

56:06.720 --> 56:07.440
many questions.

56:07.440 --> 56:13.600
Yeah. So I think of Kotlin more as a way to clean up legacy Java, like Spring development

56:13.600 --> 56:14.400
and things like that.

56:14.400 --> 56:14.720
Right.

56:14.720 --> 56:18.960
Make it a little easier to deal with. As you know, Chris, a couple years ago, or is it

56:18.960 --> 56:23.760
one year, year and a half, something like that, two years, I had a project. I was working,

56:23.760 --> 56:29.760
I think, with California or something like that, where I shipped a Spring app. And it

56:29.760 --> 56:33.520
was an old Spring app. The way to update it was to actually switch it to Kotlin. And this

56:33.520 --> 56:40.320
was when Kotlin just hit 1.0. To make it easier to deal with, easier to reason with, and just

56:40.320 --> 56:43.840
writing tests against it was a lot easier. This is a large enterprise scale application.

56:47.600 --> 56:50.000
And? You just leave me hanging?

56:51.600 --> 56:52.640
I can't tell you what it did.

56:52.640 --> 56:55.520
Oh, really? I'm like, okay, okay.

56:56.640 --> 57:01.520
I can tell you that rewriting legacy Java code into Kotlin made life easier for everybody.

57:01.520 --> 57:06.800
I can tell you that the Kotlin code was actually more performing because they were on Java 1.4.

57:06.800 --> 57:07.600
Oh, really?

57:08.640 --> 57:15.200
So, but we were able to, by leveraging Kotlin's ability to pull in the name of Java Jars,

57:15.200 --> 57:18.640
we were able to still leverage some of the proprietary libraries they built.

57:18.640 --> 57:23.200
Hmm. Hmm. You secret agent. You mysterious man.

57:23.200 --> 57:27.200
No, that's not me. No, no, no, no. That is Alan Jude. I want to make this perfectly clear.

57:27.200 --> 57:27.520
Oh, really?

57:27.520 --> 57:29.520
And all I have to say is Putin 2020.

57:29.520 --> 57:35.600
Yeah, I agree. I'm on board Putin 2020 and Putin Jude. Putin Jude.

57:35.600 --> 57:40.000
You know, this might be why my TSA pre-check has not been approved yet. Now that you told

57:40.000 --> 57:44.160
me about the listener numbers, what are the odds that there's not a TSA guy that says,

57:44.160 --> 57:48.000
I don't know about this guy. Maybe we should make him take his shoes off and open his back.

57:49.520 --> 57:51.680
Just in case for some Russian propaganda.

57:51.680 --> 57:55.360
You never know, Mr. Dominic. In fact, if you have to run from the law,

57:55.360 --> 57:59.680
there's only one place people should follow you, and that's probably besides coder.show

57:59.680 --> 58:01.280
slash subscribe, but also.

58:02.640 --> 58:03.280
At Dominic.

58:03.280 --> 58:07.200
Yeah, there you go. There you go. You got it. You got it. I'm at Chris Elias, and those

58:07.200 --> 58:13.120
adventures, like I talked about, are all linked and described at coder.show. That's the main

58:13.120 --> 58:18.560
resource in this episode. Coder.show slash three, three, four. Thanks so much for tuning

58:18.560 --> 58:23.280
this week's episode of the Coder Radio Program. We'd love to get your contact at our feedback

58:23.280 --> 58:27.360
page. I don't know, you do the math on that. And we'd love to have you join us live, jblive.tv,

58:27.360 --> 58:31.680
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for that lifetime. Thanks so much for joining

58:31.680 --> 58:53.680
us. See you right back here next week.
