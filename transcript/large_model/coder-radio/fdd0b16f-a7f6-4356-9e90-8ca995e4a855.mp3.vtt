00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 462 for April 18th, 2022.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Hey, good luck and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
Taking a pragmatic look as they are in the business, the software development, and the world of technology.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
My name is Chris and our hoster with the most-er is Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Hello, hello, hello. How are you all?

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello. You know what? Today's a big day for me. I'm wearing suspenders.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
That's so classy.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
I love it, dude. I look like such a boss. It's ridiculous. It's the best.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
That's right. You get those workers back on the railroad where they belong.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
All I gotta do, right, if they're not listening, I just snap them.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Snap them?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Yeah, right up against the boobies.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
You need a Charlie Chaplin hat, though.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Complete the ensemble.

01:00.000 --> 01:09.000
I mean, it is literally the best thing I have done for my wardrobe in the last 20 years. It's fire, dude. It's so great.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
KOTOR Radio, where you come for depressed old men missing the 90s and suspenders.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm writing this down right now. KOTOR Suspenders Swag.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
You know what it's like, dude? It's like my pants have their own anti-grav units now.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Because you don't have the sensation of a belt. I'm a guy with a bit of a belly, too.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
I really feel a belt sometimes, especially a big buckle.

01:32.000 --> 01:40.000
I don't have any of the restraining, always-there feeling of the belt, but all of the advantages of the suspenders.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
So it's like my pants just float, dude.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
You know what else? No more accidental crackage. You know what I'm talking about, right?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
That's gone now. That's how old Chris did things.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
New Chris, his pants float on their own.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
So I'm just jotting this down. KOTOR Swag Suspenders.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
If anybody out there works with a big suspenders distributor, contact me, Chris, at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
You know what? He didn't lead us wrong with the robe people, I'm just saying.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Otherwise than that, I got locked out of my Google account. Has this happened to you?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Locked out? No.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
Serious health issues and getting locked out of my Google account rank as some of my top anxiety-inducing stressors.

02:21.000 --> 02:30.000
And so I'm over at Alex's house, and he's got this tricked-out, side-loaded Android app on his TV called Block Ads or whatever.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
And I'm not a big fan of ad blockers at all.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
But I wanted to see what it was doing, and I wanted to see if it targeted the J.B. shows.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
And I thought, okay, let's give this a go because YouTube has gotten real bad.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
And it just does YouTube ads.

02:43.000 --> 02:54.000
It's a community-contributed database where people mark the self-promos and the swag pitches and the hidden embedded ads and the use my Patreon stuff.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
You can choose from all of that, which this is just going to devastate the YouTube ad market if this thing ever gets popular.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
But it won't because I installed it in my Chrome browser to check it out to see what all the different categories were and whatnot.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
And then Google flagged my account as suspicious, logged me out of every account I have, which is a lot.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Because every show has a Google Apps account for its inbox because we have a Google Apps backend.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
So I got logged out of every show.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I got logged out of my personal account.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I got logged out of my primary account.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Everything.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
And so then like all of the apps that I used that signed in with Google, they also all got bollocks.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
They all got screwed up.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
They all got logged out.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
And then because it's Google and they write horrible UIs, I ended up getting stuck in these loops where I get signed in,

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
but then forced to reset my password and then get signed in and forced to reset my password.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
And I would go through like this wizard and the wizard UI was horrible.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And I probably did that for two or three hours.

03:50.000 --> 04:00.000
And it just kept cycling me through the entire security process until I came back to Washington and I uninstalled that extension.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
And then the final time I logged in, it all stuck.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
But I probably went for three or four days with no access to my inbox while I was traveling back home for three days.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
It was three days.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
So no access to my inbox, no access to my YouTube channel stuff.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
I had to have Wes because Wes also has access.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I had to have Wes do stuff for the J.B.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Channel for me through his access.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
I mean, it was just a total F and having separate accounts to do this stuff like I separated out like the J.B.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
Channel, the Jupiter Broadcasting YouTube channel for my personal account many years ago.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
Having that separation did not matter because all of those accounts were signed into my Web browser at the time.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Oh, and of course, it was Chrome, right?

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
So they were able to do this extra deep reach into my system because it was Chrome, because I was signing in Chrome to all those profiles.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
It signed them all out for me to protect me.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
And then it sent me through days of loops to protect me.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
You know what the most frustrating thing is?

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
Is every damn time I like tell this story to anybody who's a techie, they always go, well, you ought to just get rid of Google.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
You ought to just leave Google.

05:03.000 --> 05:12.000
Man, you know, when you have a Google Apps as your business back end and you have YouTube as a as a content producer and you've got to publish things on YouTube, like you just like you're stuck, man.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
You're stuck. They've got you by the short hairs.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
So you think they saw the application you tried to sideload and just went.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Maybe because it was like it was like a Chrome extension.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Plus I was at a different IP while I was at Alex's house.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah, that I could see because that would be why it worked in Seattle.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
But all the other guys didn't have that problem.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Alex and Brent are there. They didn't have that. You know, it had to be the combo or something.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
But man, did it suck.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
You know, it really made me think about how it really as I build stuff.

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
I know we talk about this all the time, but as I build stuff that I use for the business going forward, I've got to think about it in a way that it's self hostable.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Like it is a huge wake up call and it's not such an easy story.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
But, you know, maybe I just reduce my exposure to just YouTube or something like it made me realize there's further steps I could take.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
But it also made me realize that I'm very grateful that a lot of the infrastructure we've deployed since J.B.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
went independent again has been self-hosted.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
You know, like the docs editor we use now, we self-host that our pastebin we use to capture our emails.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
We self-host that even the more recent stuff like the Bitcoin node for the boost.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Like that's all self-hosted now.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
All of that, I think, is probably the way I'm just going to take things as much as I can in the future.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And some of these services are just they're just too centralized.

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
But the ones I can, I'm just going to go independent where I can, where it makes sense, where I can actually manage to do it.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
And in that spirit, we got some boost to start the show out with.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Boost user 77 sent in 5000 sats and says, I can commiserate with Mike.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
My car's ECU also decided to stop injecting fuel a few weeks ago.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
Now, I wasn't driving at the time, but I did end up getting stranded hours from home on top of the repairs.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
I had to pay for four nights of hotels and the diagnosis and a missed week of work.

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
Another anecdote, it took three adults in about 10 minutes to start my washing machine that the landlord just upgraded, quote unquote.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
I had to unplug and reset its computer and all of it just so it could play its stupid pretty music with an LCD screen.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Why do these objects have to be smarter than us?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah, that sucks. That's bad.

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
Also, there is a story about a Tesla driver that got stuck going 83 miles per hour down a California highway, at least he alleges.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
His Model 3 computer froze up while in interstate 10.

07:29.000 --> 07:39.000
He claims that he noticed it started to get hot in the car and that a weird scent started coming out and that the brakes seemed like they were operational, but it just kept going.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
He was nervous someone would slam into him.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
That's just terrible.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
We've stumbled onto a bit of a theme here.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
It started with the Mazdas that got locked onto the NPR station.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Then your car's computer took a crap.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Then user 77's car's computer took a crap.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Then this Tesla story about the car computer taking a crap.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Are you sensing a theme?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
You know, I just got my car back today.

07:59.000 --> 08:11.000
And in addition to the warranty repair, $1400 later, the whole fuel pump had to be completely replaced, which they claim had nothing to do with the warranty repair.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
You know, the chip regulating the fuel pumping, nothing at all.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah, I didn't run the pump over.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
No, I didn't run it too hard or whatever.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
Yeah, I think this stuff is a little, what's the British saying, too clever by half?

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah, I like what Wes says in the chat room is that we turn cars into computers before we make computers not suck.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Yep, exactly.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
That's one of my rants to my wife.

08:34.000 --> 08:44.000
Every now and then when something doesn't go right, you know, I look over and I go, you know, over 35 years I've been using computers and for 30 years at least I've been promised that this was going to get better.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
This stuff still isn't necessarily any better.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
CB boosted in with 40,000 sats.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Actually, boost.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
Hey guys, I liked your recent discussion around VR.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
There's a game I think you'd enjoy called, I think it's Encodia, E-N-C-O-D-Y-A.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
It's on Steam.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
And it's a game that has a take on how VR might impact our culture.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
I played it last year and said that, well, it was actually pretty touching. So fair warning, it may hit you in the feels.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
But I've been listening to the show for years.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I hope it never changes.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Green bubbles for life.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
All right, so there's a game to check out if you're interested in maybe commentary on where VR could go, Encodia.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And that's on Steam.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Jacob tweeted the show.

09:31.000 --> 09:39.000
Hey guys, considering Apple's recent changes to Mac OS, like disabling or crippling kernel extensions by default, switching from Bash to ZSH,

09:39.000 --> 09:47.000
would it be fair to say that Linux, or maybe even Windows with WSL, is closer to a true Unix system than Mac OS?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Heresy, or do you agree?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I would say BSD is closer.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah, I think it depends on what you're looking for here, right?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah, I read this question.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
I think it's an interesting kind of academic exercise.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
I'm not sure what the value is in the argument.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah, really.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
I think about the things that have like hosed my various machines, including my Linux machine.

10:08.000 --> 10:15.000
It's always like, oh, well, your kernel version doesn't have this weird binary blob from Nvidia or whatever, right?

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
Oh, you're on a Mac and this program you use that's vital to you has a kernel extension that Apple doesn't like, right?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
It's like, I don't know.

10:25.000 --> 10:37.000
I guess, though, again, the Unix philosophy, the OG Unix philosophy, I'm not sure how they would feel about the just frankly, the binary blobs in Linux right now.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
I think you're right.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
It is kind of an academic exercise because if you think about deploying software, developing software, building software, testing software,

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
you're going to run that in an environment that is as close to production as possible.

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
So, you know, you're looking at maybe Docker desktop or you're you're looking at a VM that's going to be running Linux or if you're on Windows,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
you're going to be using WSL.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
And so I think it's sort of it doesn't matter because unless you're deploying for Mac OS, it doesn't it doesn't really matter.

11:05.000 --> 11:15.000
And even if you were, say, deploying specifically for Ubuntu, you would probably still end up developing in an isolated environment on Ubuntu,

11:15.000 --> 11:23.000
not actually on the host Ubuntu system, because your host Ubuntu system is likely changing because you should be installing security updates.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
It's not a static thing you can target.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And you also need something that's portable.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Think about it as a luxury of choice.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
And it's a transition I have absolutely observed in our audience.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
And, you know, the numbers in my, you know, I could I could throw numbers out there and say this percent or that percent.

11:40.000 --> 11:48.000
But I can tell you when we do these meetups, people come to the studio or we were in North Carolina or when we were in Denver.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
The Jupiter Broadcasting audience has diversified their desktop a lot, especially since the M1 hardware came out.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
A lot of what I thought would be an issue for Linux users, I think it panned out.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
The M1 landed those savvy little jerks over at Apple.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I don't even know if they did this. They didn't do this, I'm sure.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
But they nailed the tail end of the millennial generation.

12:10.000 --> 12:20.000
You know, people my age, late 30s, early 40s, jobs turned into something a little more serious that demands more of your mental powers.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Or you just maybe have less mental powers to spare, perhaps.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
You know, you got kids that have a certain age. They have they're starting to get some activity.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
You know, it's like there's just so many things going on in life and you start to kind of reevaluate what you're spending your time on.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
And I cannot tell you how many people have told me, yeah, I just don't want to mess with my computer when I get home.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
And I just I SSH into my Linode or I have a VM on my box or I have Docker desktop on my system.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And that's how I build the software.

12:47.000 --> 13:02.000
And what I have realized is there are exponentially more users that connect to Linux boxes from other operating systems than there are users running Linux on their desktop.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
And it's just the reality of the desktop environment now.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And so like Mike says, it just doesn't matter.

13:07.000 --> 13:15.000
It's kind of academic because ultimately you're going to be running inside whatever most closely resembles your production environment in most cases.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
But Mac dude writes in 18 longtime listener was hoping for some advice.

13:18.000 --> 13:26.000
I'm currently a junior developer in a Linux shop, and so therefore I need to access a Linux OS when I'm developing at home with my Intel Mac.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
I just used VMS. That's not really possible anymore.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
For starters, VMware Fusion seems to suck on the MacBook Pro M1.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
And second, I often have to mess with assembly.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
So I'd like to remain on X86 platform.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
I have a desktop that I don't use that I could just remote into and work from.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
And I was kind of hoping maybe you could give me an OS recommendation for that.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
I started with Fedora 35, but I couldn't get XRDP or VNC to work through Gwalk.

13:51.000 --> 13:57.000
I successfully installed RHEL 8.5, but as a smart Docker without installing older versions and disabling the firewall.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Can you guys just recommend a solid OS for development?

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
Something Linux based, something that maybe I could access through SSH or remote desktop.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
I would like to access the UI from Gwalk from time to time.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
Is it weird to recommend just like an Ubuntu base or something like that?

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
The 2204 is supposedly shipping this week, perhaps the day after this episode drops.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Maybe that's the way to go.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Yeah, I mean, GNOME 42 is looking pretty good.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
I've only read some stuff on it from, you know, a few like Omegi Ubuntu places like that.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
But, you know, on my Linux machine, I run POP.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
I would probably stick with an Ubuntu base, like Chris is saying.

14:36.000 --> 14:47.000
I mean, if you don't have any visual preferences for KDE, you know, I don't think anybody could fault you for just going stock Ubuntu 2204, 2204 rather.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Yeah, it's going to be out in a few days.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
And, you know, GNOME 42 is just a solid release.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
This week's Linux Unplugged, we reviewed Fedora 36 and Ubuntu and talk a lot about GNOME 42.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
One of the things that didn't come up in that episode, but we have talked about in previous Linux Unplugged.

15:03.000 --> 15:13.000
So go to notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com and search for RDP because GNOME 42 is baking in an RDP server.

15:13.000 --> 15:21.000
So you can run an RDP server that has Mudder that you connect to and you use whatever RDP client you like.

15:21.000 --> 15:27.000
And my testing, I'll have to be honest with you, the Microsoft RDP client actually performed the best.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
But you could use any RDP client.

15:29.000 --> 15:37.000
And then you get a desktop session inside the RDP client that is being drawn and managed by Mudder.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
It's great. And I have not turned it on since like the first time West and I experimented with this.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
So I don't actually remember all the steps.

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
But my understanding is, is that in GNOME 42, there's actually a UI exposed now to turn that on.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
The capability has existed since GNOME 41, but the UI bits weren't there.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
And now the UI bits, I believe, are there. I have not tested that part myself.

16:01.000 --> 16:09.000
But that's what I would do, MacDude, is I would set up Ubuntu 2204 and I would leave it for five years.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
That's why I'm recommending 2204.

16:11.000 --> 16:18.000
I, out of these two releases that are coming out relatively at the same time, Fedora 36 and Ubuntu 2204,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
personally like Fedora 36 a little more, personally.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
But you're not going to want to reload this thing every nine months, right?

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Or not reload it, but maybe do an upgrade. You could. And it would work, I bet.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
I bet it would do really well. The Fedora upgrades have been solid.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
So don't totally discount it. But the 2204, man, you're just going to set it and forget it for like eight years if you want, right?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
And GNOME 42 is going to be great.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Let us know how it codes.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
All right. So I didn't want to use this listener's name because we've all been there.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
So I felt like this was a problem that represented all of us.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
But he's been a listener for eight years, a software developer.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
He's been listening while his career has taken all the turns and all that kind of stuff.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
And he said, over the past three months, I've had problems with anxiety, panic attacks and depression.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
It's been pretty bad at times. And hearing a familiar voice, the humor and of course the content of Coda Radio,

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
especially when I can't sleep, has helped me out and helped me amend.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
It's in times of world problems. It's sometimes nice to get away from it all.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
So keep up the great work, much respect and thanks for all your hard work.

17:14.000 --> 17:22.000
And I wanted to bring this in here because I wrote back to them and I want to suggest to anyone else who's kind of going through hard times right now.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
And I understand, like, you know, we've just been through a couple of years of really rough stuff.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
And, you know, we don't really know where things are going economically.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
We just don't know what the next few years are going to look like.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
And there is a community out there for you.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
If you just take some time, I know we're all really busy.

17:39.000 --> 17:46.000
But if you set aside a little bit of time and you join us on a Sunday and you get in the mumble room, for example,

17:46.000 --> 17:53.000
what you find is a bunch of kindred spirits that think and like the same things you do and they just want to talk about that stuff.

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
They don't necessarily don't need to talk about the war in Ukraine or recessions or any of that kind of stuff.

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
They just they're glad you're there and they just want to talk or just attending a live stream can be a bit of a mood lift

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
because there's an energy to it and it's free and it's available to you.

18:08.000 --> 18:15.000
And we've all struggled with that. So I will link you to Linux Unplugged dot com slash mumble for the mumble server info.

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
Also on Tuesdays, a bi-weekly soon, I'm going to start recording office hours, which is just a podcast.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
That's sort of like a newsletter and podcast form going on with the network, helping coordinate meetups,

18:28.000 --> 18:34.000
giving away stats, talking about projects JB is working on. We have a whole bunch of projects this summer.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
We've got a road trip coming up, all that kind of stuff, community stuff.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
And I'll have the mumble room going. I'll be answering questions, anything people want to ask, anything people want to throw at me.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
And it's another opportunity to come and join and hang out. And, you know, I'm not a very social person.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
I'm not necessarily somebody who's likely to take one of those offers up myself.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
But I can tell you every time I've done it, I've always come out on the other side. Really great. Really glad that I did.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
So if you're having a tough time, come hang out with your community. We are here for you.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
We're going to, you know, we're going to circle the wagons as times get tough and we're going to be together as a community.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
Also consider our meetup page. We do have a West Coast meetup planned or we are working.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
We're beginning to plan it. You know, we just had one on the East Coast in the summer.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
We had one in Denver. We're going to keep trying to do these things.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
We're going to try to encourage the community to do more of them.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
So probably the place to start would be Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash meetup.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
And then if you'd like to participate in the office hours podcast or if you're interested in what I'll be talking about over there,

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
it's going to be office hours dot hair dot hair.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
Yeah. Yeah. I wonder why I actually went for dot show first, you know, because a lot of our lot of our stuff.

19:37.000 --> 19:43.000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was taken. So then I thought, OK, well, dot FM that invokes podcast, right?

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
But it was taken. So then I thought dot audio. But they were all taken except for like dot limo and dot hair.

19:49.000 --> 19:58.000
There's no limo. And I was a tough call, you know, but I felt dot hair better represented, you know, me.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah. I see.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
Yeah. So office hours dot hair will be like the the newsletter in a podcast.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
I'll probably do it biweekly, so it won't be it won't be happening a lot.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
And if you're in the all shows feed, you'll get it.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
Yeah. And then to enter the rider, you know, it's been a bad two years.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
All right. Just wait if I give you listen to more J.B. shows.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
You know, everything's tough right now. I would say stay the hell off of Twitter.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
Yeah. It's nothing good can come of it. Also, take the week off comments everywhere.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Don't read the comments section. Yeah. Don't read the comments.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
It helps. Linode dot com slash coder.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
Go there to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the show.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting. It's the developers cloud.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
You got to try it for your next project. It's what I use to build everything.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
Just recently, I deployed my largest Linode rig ever.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
I might have mentioned it to you. It's 48 cores and 96 gigs of RAM.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I wanted to go all the way with this project.

21:00.000 --> 21:07.000
We're working on to bring our matrix server up to a fully like multi-thousand user capable system.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
And the nice thing about Linode is the dashboard made it really easy to kind of step this system up.

21:12.000 --> 21:20.000
Two years ago, we started I don't know. I think it was maybe like one step up from the five dollar a month Linode.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
And as the user kind of reached like three, four or five hundred people, I went in.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
I did the resize option. I had a little more capacity.

21:28.000 --> 21:34.000
And then as we added like another couple of thousand people, I resized it again.

21:34.000 --> 21:40.000
And did a really big leap. And it's like I never had to reinstall anything, never had to reconfigure the disk.

21:40.000 --> 21:47.000
It's so nice because right before we left to go to Raleigh, North Carolina, we implemented a bunch of generic workers.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
And these workers can take advantage of multiple CPU cores.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
And so right before we left, so that way the system would just run great.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
And it has been. I turned that sucker up. I turned it up to 11.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
If you're a performance, Linode is so great because you can really dial this stuff in.

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
And their pricing is 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the hyperscalers that are really just trying to lock in their esoteric platform to begin with.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
And Linode's got 11 data centers around the world.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
So, you know, you're going to find something near you or your customers that's going to work great.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
And they've been doing this for almost 19 years.

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
So they have everything from the support, the documentation, the UI, the API.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
All of that is so dialed in.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
And they have a ton of different Linux distros.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
So whatever your base distro is, you can make that work.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
They've got bare metal systems.

22:32.000 --> 22:40.000
They have really, really powerful object storage that I can't believe how fast it is that we use for a ton of our back end production storage.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I mean, the list goes on and on.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
You really should go try it for yourself.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
And that's why the hundred dollars, I think, is just a win win scenario.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
It's a great way to support the show, but it's also a great opportunity for you to go try this platform and really put it to the test with that one hundred dollars.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
And they know that's what you're going to do.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
It's a vote of confidence from Linode that you're going to like this.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
Go try it. I don't need to tell you any more about it.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
Go get started yourself right now at Linode.com slash Coder.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
That's Linode.com slash Coder.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
You get that hundred dollars on a new account and you support the show.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Linode.com slash Coder.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
This is glorious.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
This is glorious.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Glorious like Marie Antoinette glorious.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Yes.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
And I love how Apple just immediately pounced.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
Like none of this like just holding back and being quiet and being reserved.

23:30.000 --> 23:38.000
No, they immediately called out Meta's hypocrisy in planning for nearly 50 percent commission on Metaverse purchases.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
Also, subheadline, the Metaverse is officially dead with this headline.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
This is ridiculous. A 50 percent cut.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Please. It's forty seven point five to be clear.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah. Oh, yes.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
The IRS is pleased with your with your down to the to the to the point accuracy.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
Oh, don't even get dude. Don't don't even say the IRS's name right now.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
It hurts so bad.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
Tell me about it.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
This is the part where we just start whimpering on the air.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
I mean, it is there. Why is there?

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Oh, it sucks to be a small business.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Anyways, moving on.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
Just real quick. When I'm owed a refund, it takes I still haven't gotten it.

24:21.000 --> 24:27.000
It's been months when I have to pay. I don't pay in 30 days. That'll be a minimum of four hundred dollar fine.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
Yeah. And if you need an extension, you better take your best guess of paying what you can.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
And you better not be low. Yeah.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
You better not be low.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Wonderful, wonderful people.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
So tax man over at Facebook or Meta, I guess.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Mark, they are boning this up so bad.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Ben Thompson really made me think about this and he's absolutely right.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
They are bifurcated in their strategy.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
They are trying to be the hardware platform, the software platform.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
They are trying to use generic Android while trying to create their own VROS.

24:59.000 --> 25:09.000
They're trying to use Samsung's ARM platform that's already out in the market while also running a team that's trying to create their own SOC, spending billions and billions of dollars and five years of time.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
And they're trying to do everything at once.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
They did kill their own VROS and now they're focusing on an Android based to one.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
They could be making that a general VROS that any VR maker could use.

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
They get their commission from the app store or they focus on being a hardware vendor like Nintendo.

25:30.000 --> 25:42.000
And they get a commission on the hardware purchase, maybe a small commission in the app store, but they don't charge you for both shipping on the hardware and shipping through their app store, especially when right now they're pretty much the only vendor.

25:42.000 --> 25:50.000
I mean, this entire thing is a ludicrous strategy that has been bifurcated from the beginning that is going to go nowhere.

25:50.000 --> 25:58.000
And even though this is like the whole focus of the company now, it's clear to me as day and I'll put links in the show notes that I think help illustrate this.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
It's clear to me as day they are going to fail badly at this strategy.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Yeah, this is a nonstarter.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
People are screaming about 30 percent on iOS.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Forty seven point five percent.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Facebook in particular was screaming.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
Yeah, it just goes to show you that these companies screaming about Apple and I'll bring up Epic here, right?

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Yep.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
They're also a little jelly.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
You know what I mean?

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
And I think we've all been guilty of this when we bitch about like the bigger player.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
It's sometimes sometimes we have good points.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Fair enough.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
A lot of the time we also like if we were that player, we would be very happy with ourselves.

26:34.000 --> 26:42.000
I read this article and I went into a despair pit where I just hugged my failure.

26:42.000 --> 26:53.000
Because is it going to be possible for like our kids to open software businesses or tech businesses and not just pay like insane taxes to some big platform vendor?

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
Not if there isn't some sort of big push for some sort of decentralization.

26:57.000 --> 27:11.000
I was also a bit sad because my hope here was that Facebook would push the technology forward and actually build a platform that got enough attention by getting enough users.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
That better things and alternatives would be built.

27:15.000 --> 27:24.000
And we'd end up with a really nice, healthy, competitive, maybe even somewhat decentralized sort of metaverse ecosystem.

27:24.000 --> 27:31.000
If such a thing were ever to materialize because VR has sort of flopped like 3D televisions have flopped a couple of times.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
And we've seen VR bubbles come and go.

27:34.000 --> 27:40.000
It seems like if meta blows this, we're going to have to wait another decade before anyone's willing to give this a go.

27:40.000 --> 27:47.000
And they've all it's already a foregone conclusion that they've blown it because they cannot pick a singular focus and execute on a singular vision.

27:47.000 --> 27:55.000
They're trying multiple strategies at once and they're tacking a 47.5 percent commission on top of digital asset purchases.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Pure madness.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
I mean, it's it's it's dead. They've just killed. They've killed. They've killed it.

28:01.000 --> 28:11.000
I don't even understand how you get out of the pitch meeting one just like with this idea of being the winning idea and two with your job.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Right.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
I don't because all right, can I fry some bacon and we can hammer me on the prediction show at the end of the year if I'm wrong?

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
Oh, yeah. If we could ever remember. Yeah, we could do that. I mean, I suppose.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
Don't worry. Egon's always waiting for us.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Oh, yeah, I suppose. OK, get your notes ready, Egon.

28:26.000 --> 28:33.000
So here's what's going to happen. Right. Facebook is going to have all the crappy free stuff that minds your data, much like it does now.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
And I'm sorry, Metta, that minds your data. And, you know, great.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
That's going to be, you know, the regular people VR solution.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
And then Apple is going to come out with whatever beautiful fitness focused product they come out with.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
And that's going to be the, you know, Lululemon crowd fitness focused.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
That's it. That's it, baby. You could totally start with fitness focused.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
Make it work with the watch. Make it work with Apple Fitness.

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
You know, I have been doing Apple Fitness. I just switched from I was using an app.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
I think it's called Map My Ride because I like cycling. This is neither here nor there.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
I'm trying to be less fat and Apple Fitness because it's built it.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
It's the classic Apple kind of shady advantage because we're literally built into the OS.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
It doesn't allow me to forget to like track something as soon as it realizes I'm on the bike.

29:19.000 --> 29:26.000
The watch is like you seem to have been on the bike for five minutes, you know, and it can tell the difference between an outdoor.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
It's it's pretty good. And it's also and it notices when you kind of stop and say, oh, you seem to stop.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Should I stop tracking now? And that's nice, too.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
You know, that Apple, whatever it is, what is it, the family plan, the 15 bucks or whatever.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
I don't know what it is, but everybody in my house has Apple Music.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
We have Apple TVs. We have home pods. Damn it, Chris.

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
I did listen to the show you recorded without me, the clip show.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
A whole home pod segment, huh? I know. I couldn't believe it.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
Remember how we used to talk about home pods all the time? I use mine every day. It's fine.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It's boring, but it's fine. It just works.

29:58.000 --> 30:04.000
It is awesome because they support Dolby surround sound, so they actually work great as surround sound speakers.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
I actually know. OK, bless me. Talks for I have sent again.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
I may have set them up in a stereo setup. It's amazing, isn't it?

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
It's an incredible sound. I may now own four home pods, big ones or minis.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
I don't have any minutes. I'm not I'm not playing games.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
The big ones are the best. The mini is like it's like a voice.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
If you need a voice assistant puck, then the mini is OK to be super clear. This is two different rooms, right?

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Have you looked into like speakers that good? Like you're going to spend a grand now.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
It sucks. Apple has to make a big speaker again.

30:36.000 --> 30:43.000
I went down this dark rabbit hole of like wanting to do audio visual stuff for my my living room to have like a better, you know,

30:43.000 --> 30:51.000
because I like to watch movies and some someone on the Internet won't name anybody pointed out screen tearing from streaming.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So now I've been watching Blu-rays again. We're 4K Ultra Blu-rays.

30:55.000 --> 31:01.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, and I'm like, I need a soundbar. This is this is how this madness start.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
Have you shopped for a soundbar recently? No, not recently. I have considered a soundbar, though.

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
It's a sad Lion King level elephant graveyard of defeated companies.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
So I've decided that eventually Apple will make a soundbar and I'm just going by that.

31:16.000 --> 31:24.000
Yeah, they probably will. You know, they do have like a soundbar manufacturer that they recommend right now and it supports AirPlay.

31:24.000 --> 31:34.000
See, this is the thing is if you got the iOS ecosystem, AirPlay is the secret little detail that Apple doesn't really promote much.

31:34.000 --> 31:42.000
It's the blue bubbles for your ears. It's so great, man, because like if I'm playing a podcast or if I'm watching TV or whatever,

31:42.000 --> 31:48.000
or if there's music playing on the HomePod, it automatically updates all of my devices with play controls.

31:48.000 --> 31:54.000
So when I wake the screen of my iPhone, I have the playback controls automatically for my TV even.

31:54.000 --> 32:00.000
So think about like, have you ever lost your damn remote and you just want to pause the damn TV or go back 15 seconds?

32:00.000 --> 32:10.000
Well, all I have to do is raise my wrist and I have the playback controls on my watch automatically because the AirPlay service has detected an AirPlay event and it updates the display.

32:10.000 --> 32:19.000
Or it's on my phone or it's I can pause it via the HomePods. And it all happens without me ever touching a damn config file.

32:19.000 --> 32:27.000
It's so great. It's all just via DNS broadcast. Anyways, it's a great ecosystem and it's a shame it doesn't get the recognition it deserves.

32:27.000 --> 32:33.000
And I wish it was an open ecosystem because I'd love to have all of my devices participate. What it is, what it is.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
Anyways, Metaverse is dead. That's fine, I guess. That didn't take too long.

32:38.000 --> 32:45.000
Not a huge loss, maybe best overall, maybe it's better for society. But I was very impressed with the virtual workspace capabilities.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
So was I.

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
That really for me, especially in a tiny workspace where I had family and stuff going on.

32:51.000 --> 32:56.000
I just put that on and I was in a serene work environment. It was pretty special.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and you support the show.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
Tailscale has changed how I do everything now. Maybe it was this trip I just went on.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
I don't know. It's just it changes how I think about everything now, like as an example.

33:15.000 --> 33:22.000
I have been experimenting with different Nix builds, seeing if maybe this is the direction I want to take some of my local infrastructure.

33:22.000 --> 33:28.000
And I spun up a Nix OS system on a VM here in the studio so that way I could also do a little livestream with it.

33:28.000 --> 33:34.000
But not only is it behind its own NAT in the VM environment, but it's also behind the studio firewall.

33:34.000 --> 33:41.000
Within probably 25 seconds, I had tail scale installed in Nix and then I had it connected to my tail scale network.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
And now I'm SSHing from home. I'm SSHing from my laptop right next to the machine that's running the VM.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
It doesn't matter. I just use the tail scale IP because I'm on that flat network.

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
It's so quick to get started and it uses WireGuard's noise protocol for your encryption.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
So you get the security of WireGuard with the simplicity of tail scale that's helping you manage all of that.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
It's a zero config VPN. It installs on any device in minutes.

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
It manages the firewall rules as you need. And you can put a DNS server in that network.

34:09.000 --> 34:15.000
And it just does magic with DNS. The devices all connect directly to each other in a mesh network.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
I have it running on everything. My Arch x86 servers, my Raspberry Pi is running Ubuntu.

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
My OpenSUSE Tumbleweed boxes, my iOS devices, my VMs running Nix.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
It's awesome. And because it integrates with my single sign on system.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
It works with my two factor and the authentication I'm already using there.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
And the VPNs are always on and they work with every OS I use.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
And it has a GUI based ACL editor. So it's just like the perfect tool.

34:43.000 --> 34:50.000
I didn't even really realize I needed. Every now and then there have been these tools that come along that change my workflow.

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
Like collaborative text editing. Like Markdown and note taking there.

34:55.000 --> 35:03.000
Maybe like Dropbox and file syncing. Tailscale is in that tier of change my workflow forever for the better.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
Solving so many little edge cases all in one package.

35:06.000 --> 35:15.000

It's changed everything for me, including how I support family and friends.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
It's so awesome. Go try it. Support the show. Free up to 20 devices.

35:25.000 --> 35:31.000

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
We got an email in from Ethan.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
And he wanted to hear our thoughts on Moxie Marlin Spike's take on Web 3 technology.

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
And he wrote a blog post back in January.

35:44.000 --> 35:57.000
Moxie did. And he wrote all about like what he sees as the shortcomings of Web 3 NFTs and some of these so-called decentralized technologies.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
And decentralized wallets like MetaMask and whatnot.

36:01.000 --> 36:07.000
And it's a pretty, pretty astute and thorough critique.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
You know, he really calls out how NFTs are really just URLs to something sitting on storage.

36:11.000 --> 36:21.000
That could be rug pulled at any point and about how a lot of these are fairly clunky at a code level right now and that they've gotten away with the excuses of it's just early days forever.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
And they keep recreating some of these wheels over and over again.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
It's pretty brutal.

36:27.000 --> 36:42.000
And then also this week, Jack Dorsey's first tweet, which sold as an NFT for 48 million dollars originally, has just ended the bidding round with a top bid of 280 dollars.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
Yikes. Are we on the other end of the Web 3 hype cycle or is this maybe the beginning of the hype cycle deflation?

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
Not if and Andreessen Horowitz has a damn thing to say about it now.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
No kidding, actually. Seriously, right?

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
They will shove that down our throats, no matter what we say.

36:58.000 --> 37:07.000
If there is a bit of an economic pullback, there is going to be a lot of bloodletting in this crypto hype bubble.

37:07.000 --> 37:15.000
There is so much crap and junk that I think it totally legitimizes people that think that crypto is a scam.

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
I think it totally legitimizes a lot of their concerns because I think 98 percent of it is a scam.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
It's so much junk.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
You know, you look at it. Here's a couple of red flags.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Does it have a central founder?

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
How are the original coins or tokens distributed?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
Is that still highly centralized, how it's held?

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Those are all red flags with these projects.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
Has the project delivered on their roadmap?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Have they executed on their goals?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Have they had downtime?

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
All of those are red flags in so many of these crypto projects.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Oh, I can think of a bunch more.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Why is your coin different from every other coin?

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
I mean, that would be my first question, right?

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
They're all trying.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
You know, like the ones we talked about recently, Cordana, Solana, Ethereum.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
They're trying to come up with their value adds that they have that are all unique.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Moxie, which is kind of funny.

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
So Moxie does this blog post about cryptocurrencies and Web3.

38:08.000 --> 38:14.000
And then like a week later, they do an update to Signal, which includes Mobilecoin, which is a shit coin itself.

38:14.000 --> 38:23.000
So a bit of hypocrisy in Moxie's take here, because Mobilecoin is a great example of something that is centralized.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
It is really not a like long term project.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
It's got a ton of red flags itself.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Can you fire up the griddle again?

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
I always can, man.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
All right.

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
Now, you got to give me 18 months on this one.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Okay.

38:39.000 --> 38:48.000
I think the US, so sorry, my European homies, the US is going to hit an economic downturn within 18 months.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
And we're going to see a massacre of, quote unquote, Web3 companies.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
This is my thought, too.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
Beyond that, I mean, I'm going to consider this a separate prediction.

38:57.000 --> 39:03.000
The current inflated wages for junior developers are going to dramatically drop.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
Well, they're going to go back to where they were, let's say, in 2019.

39:07.000 --> 39:13.000
But I think you're still going to have a lot of inflationary pressure, which is going to still put pressure on wage increases.

39:13.000 --> 39:19.000
Yeah, but if you have a bunch of it's going to be like it's not going to be as bad as the 2000 crash, the tech crash.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
But if you have a lot of like I love you guys.

39:22.000 --> 39:29.000
You kids are great, but you do not deserve seventy thousand dollars out of a no name college to be a junior developer.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
I am literally facing a problem because I just I they're not worth it.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
Right. I usually they they need to be trained.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
It's not that they're bad people. They need experience.

39:39.000 --> 39:44.000
But right now, particularly maybe I'm feeling my Tampa humidity heat here.

39:44.000 --> 39:53.000
The market is so overheated that if you can like get a B like any like non known university down here,

39:53.000 --> 40:00.000
you can walk in seventy five grand or seventy grand to seventy five grand, which is nuts for a junior person.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
And I'm I'm I'm experienced this problem, but I'm also talking to friends in the industry down here.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
They're having this issue where loyal employees have been with them for years and are like,

40:10.000 --> 40:17.000
did you just hire that twenty three year old to make basically like what I make?

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
And he knows nothing. And he's I always have to like help him or her.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
It's it's a whole mess. It's it's not anybody's fault.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Well, listen to unfilter. It's a lot of people's fault.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
Yeah, there's a lot of people involved. It is not the young people looking for these jobs as fault.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
It is not the grumpy employer's fault for not wanting to hire them.

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
You know what it feels like to me? You ever been to one of those parties, Chris, where, you know,

40:40.000 --> 40:45.000
maybe when you were single, you know, you're you're having a couple of drinks, you're dancing.

40:45.000 --> 40:51.000
Dance partner looks good. You're having a good time. And then you like wake up in a in a Wawa bathroom.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
This might be very specific, but that sounds a little specific.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
And then you realize, well, your dance partner maybe wasn't so good looking.

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
Maybe that wasn't really a nightclub that may have in fact been the gas station area of the Wawa.

41:05.000 --> 41:13.000
Right. All these things come to pass when you basically sober up and realize companies have to make money.

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
Right. Like your Excel spreadsheet needs to be mostly black, not red.

41:18.000 --> 41:24.000
I know this is an insane thing for like public companies get away with it, but this is just not going to be sustainable.

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
This party is going to have to end and it's going to end with I'm afraid to say it,

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
but I think a lot of these young folks taking these high paying jobs are not talking about, you know,

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
people going to Stanford or MIT. Fine. You guys are great. Go on. Go forth and conquer.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
I'm talking about like out of community college, out of no name private college.

41:41.000 --> 41:47.000
They're going to end up in a situation where in two years from now they'll be taking a ten thousand dollar pay cut,

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
but they will have situated their lives and their credit portfolio in terms of car payments,

41:52.000 --> 41:57.000
mortgages, lease agreements, things like that at that seventy seventy five rate.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
And they will be, for lack of a better word, forked.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
So the punch bowl essentially is being taken out of the party. The punch bowl is spiked and the punch bowls being removed.

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
What I'm what I mean by that is easy free money for those closest to the faucet,

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000
those that were taking money and putting it into assets over the last couple of years, specifically the last year or so.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
They've been just getting money like crazy from the Fed. That's coming to an end. It's done.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
And so there's going to be probably a bit of a realignment from that.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
Oh, yeah. The Fed is the bartender at my theoretical Wawa party.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
Right. Like it is not like we can you can dunk on the VCs, but like they're just doing what they do.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
They're trying to get theirs. Right. They got to do something with all that money.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
Right. Like literally they're like, are you wearing a hoodie?

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Did you say crypto to me? Here's two million dollars. Get out of my office.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.000
And so I think, you know, that that party, the music has stopped.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
Well, I think there's still some dancing, you know, there's there is.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
But that's because these institutions are ginormous.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
They're huge. And they have to wait for like big meetings.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
And it just takes time for this alignment to happen.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
But I think you're right. I mean, the problem is, is I don't think the costs are going to go down.

43:03.000 --> 43:13.000
And so my I'll pick you back on your 18 months is I think in 18 months, what could very well possibly happen is 60, 70, 80 percent of all of these Web three tokens

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
and crypto currencies are gone. Oh, for sure.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
And you essentially have some stable coins, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the remaining survivors.

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
And I'm extremely confident the Bitcoin will be the remaining survivor because it's been online continuously for 13 years.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
And it is always, always around, even if there isn't a bunch of money from Wall Street to go into it.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
So the price may drop out, but it's going to be there.

43:35.000 --> 43:41.000
And I would imagine Ethereum just because of the momentum there and the development platform and the fact that there's thousands

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
and thousands of developers now working on it, it's still going to continue.

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
Yeah. Ethereum has a kind of platform thing going on, too. Right. So Ethereum could be safe.

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
But, you know, it's funny because I know demographically we have a lot of super like junior enthusiast devs that listen.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
Right. I think that you told me that years ago. Who knows if it's still true, but I think it's true.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
Now they're all old seasoned professionals now. I don't know.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
Angrily installing SUSE. That's what they're doing.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah, we do. We do have folks out there. We have, of course, it's the whole spectrum.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
But there's definitely people early in that cycle that are listening to the podcast looking for tips.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
Maybe I'm just hanging out with you too much and I'm getting old and grumpy.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
But I see this crazy shit going on, especially in a place like Tampa.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
Tampa's lovely. Tampa Tech's great. Hand on my heart. Right.

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
But I don't know. Some of these valuations seem a little wacky.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
Seriously. Like that don't make a lot of sense, guys.

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
Some software companies or platforms are getting, you know, 30 billion dollars.

44:36.000 --> 44:41.000
Right. With no product. And then Linode sells for under a bill.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
You know, it's 990 million or something like that.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
But Linode is a company that generates like it makes money.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
It's a value company. It would be it would be considered, you know, like a value business.

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
It produces revenue. It's been around for 19 years. It's got a very loyal customer base.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
Right. They they serve a very specific part of the market that isn't really super served anymore.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
And like it was 990 million dollars.

45:06.000 --> 45:12.000
Meanwhile, you know, a crypto exchange platform is like valued at 20 billion.

45:12.000 --> 45:18.000
And like the guy that runs Binance is like one of the richest men in the world now on paper.

45:18.000 --> 45:25.000
It's totally gotten nuts. And it's because the money has been just pumping.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
I don't know the numbers exactly. And this is probably outside my field.

45:29.000 --> 45:34.000
But, you know, it's something it's something that's just if you go look into it, I think it's shocking.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
And I'll just leave it at that. Like if you go research how much money has been printed,

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
how many U.S. dollars have been created in the last two years, go Google search that.

45:42.000 --> 45:52.000
It's shocking. And you can see that the printing of that money overlays perfectly with the S&P 500 growth.

45:52.000 --> 45:58.000
It's wild. The two charts go up exactly at the same time because the money went into assets and stocks.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
And including cryptocurrency.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
And someone in the chat room is making a good point. I understand like rent. Trust me, I'm a renter.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
Real estate. Again, it's another area that the money went into.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
Rent has gone up insanely since I've been down here.

46:11.000 --> 46:17.000
I'm not saying that like I'm not trying to be Ebony's Scrooge here and say, you know, to hell with these kids.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
Don't pay them, whatever. I'm just saying it's not realistic.

46:20.000 --> 46:28.000
And I'm hoping that when this crash comes that some of these, sorry Blackstone,

46:28.000 --> 46:34.000
but people who bought up all these houses and screwed everybody else who should have been able to buy them, get theirs, right?

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
Like, you know, this guy's talking about the Tampa area. Somebody's struggling at 55K.

46:38.000 --> 46:43.000
Well, you know what? When I moved here, $150,000 to $200,000 bought you a decent house.

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
Now it's $400,000. That's nothing to do with real economics.

46:48.000 --> 46:58.000
That is companies like Blackstone and just other private equity speculators buying up all the houses, renting them out for $16,000 to $2,200 a month.

46:58.000 --> 47:05.000
Plus insane fees. Like if you have a dog, that dog costs you $50 a month forever for some reason.

47:05.000 --> 47:11.000
Makes no sense. There are predators in the market that are also doing bad things.

47:11.000 --> 47:19.000
60 Minutes did an interview with one of these bankers, and I don't remember which company, if it was BlackRock or one of the other ones, but there's several in the market.

47:19.000 --> 47:28.000
And they're buying up homes much over the asking rate. In some months, it's like 30% of all home sales have gone to these commercial bank companies.

47:28.000 --> 47:34.000
And 60 Minutes did the interview, so you could go Google like 60 Minutes banks buying homes. I don't know.

47:34.000 --> 47:45.000
Anyways, what the guy said is that the millennial generation just wants a turnkey home, and so they're giving everyone the opportunity to rent the American dream.

47:45.000 --> 47:53.000
So they own a company called Invitational Homes. It's my landlord. I can tell you, and has been for a while, I can tell you for a fact they are not turnkey homes.

47:53.000 --> 48:03.000
In fact, when I came to my most recent house, I had to have a very long, very arduous conversation with the poor superintendent that they hire.

48:03.000 --> 48:11.000
Not for like a little neighborhood, but for a county. To say, hey man, did you notice the toilet's not working?

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
One guy?

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
One dude.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
God.

48:15.000 --> 48:24.000
He's like on his iPad, like scrambling. I'm like, I'm not trying to bust you, but you know, I know that he's like, no, you need to tell us now or else they'll want to see it was you.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
I'm going to call bulls**t on that. I'm sorry, but shenanigans. I don't buy it.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
It's horrible. And I've gotten emails from listeners when we brought up things like this on the air before.

48:33.000 --> 48:39.000
And it's like stories constantly of it took us forever. We finally found a home that works for our family.

48:39.000 --> 48:46.000
We offered 510 over asking and a bank came in and bought it out from underneath us and offered 30 over asking price.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
And it's just numbers like that regular folks just can't compete with.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Welcome to one filter show.

48:51.000 --> 49:00.000
Yeah, I mean, it's all very unsustainable and especially when you run a small business, you have to like try to figure out how to do this.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
Like I can't just go around and raise our rates all the time.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Like I can do it occasionally.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
Give it a bell. Bell it.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
You don't have the pricing power of the larger companies.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Yes, that's just it.

49:13.000 --> 49:23.000
And so it it really stings and it really is a headwind that is hard to even calculate because they're not being honest with us about inflation.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
They're not being honest with us about the entire situation.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
Nobody really knows. Probably it's probably the problem is.

49:28.000 --> 49:35.000
And so you just kind of have to navigate on instinct and try to pay attention and figure these things out on your own.

49:35.000 --> 49:42.000
And it's a treacherous time to run a small business that is based on sales and consulting.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
It's tricky.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
And hopefully navigatable, but we shall see.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Perhaps it won't be that rough.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Perhaps the seas will be calmer than we expect.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
Well, you can always call into office hours and get your group therapy session.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
That's true.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Office hours dot hair. Very true.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
Dot hair. God damn it.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
And, you know, it's part of why we also started the membership programs.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
So that way we could still it maybe perhaps if sales drop off.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Right. We still have the support of our audience.

50:07.000 --> 50:12.000

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send people this week?

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
You know what? I might run a blog post.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Go to Dominic Ham dot com.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Hmm. I like it.
