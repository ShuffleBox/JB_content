00:00.000 --> 00:16.240
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 418 for June 14th, 2021.

00:16.240 --> 00:20.240
Hello friend and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.240 --> 00:24.600
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.600
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

00:26.600 --> 00:32.300
A Cloud Guru now has the Cloud Playground, Azure, AWS, and Google's Cloud Sandboxes

00:32.300 --> 00:35.220
on ACG's credit card, not yours.

00:39.680 --> 00:44.800
My name is Chris and helping me sort through this world of technology, it is our host,

00:44.800 --> 00:45.800
Mr. Dominic.

00:45.800 --> 00:46.800
Hello, Mike.

00:46.800 --> 00:47.800
Hello.

00:47.800 --> 00:48.800
Hello, handsome.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.800
How are you doing over there?

00:49.800 --> 00:50.800
I am great.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.760
You know, I am luxuriating my AirPods Max as usual.

00:53.760 --> 00:56.360
Oh, with your spatial audio?

00:56.360 --> 00:58.320
I'm hearing every angle of you, Chris.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.400
Are you actually on the AirPods Max right now?

01:00.400 --> 01:05.400
I am because the venerable headphones you sent me years ago have finally crapped out.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.040
And how do they, how does it work for this job, for this particular task?

01:09.040 --> 01:10.840
It just sounds like regular headphones.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.800
I got to admit, I'm a sucker for the kind of the music gimmicks.

01:13.800 --> 01:18.040
I was the guy who got big into DVD audio back in the day when that was...

01:18.040 --> 01:19.040
Oh no.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.040
Oh yeah.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.040
It sounded amazing.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.040
Screw CDs.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.040
DVD audio, man.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.040
That's right.

01:24.040 --> 01:29.720
I was the guy that has a ridiculous amount of gigs of flax of his favorite tracks on

01:29.720 --> 01:34.640
his Plex server and he streams it using Plex amp to his phone so that way he can have high

01:34.640 --> 01:36.400
quality audio on the go.

01:36.400 --> 01:41.900
So you know, when any kind of large presence music service starts talking about lossless

01:41.900 --> 01:47.120
audio and spatial audio in the case of Apple, I actually perk up a little bit because I

01:47.120 --> 01:48.120
got to admit something, man.

01:48.120 --> 01:53.840
I can sometimes, I'm actually ashamed to say because it's kind of embarrassing, but I can

01:53.840 --> 01:57.440
actually get a little teary eyed sometimes when I'm hearing like just gorgeous music,

01:57.440 --> 01:59.220
you know, something really sounding good.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.560
Like it just gets me right in the damn feels.

02:02.560 --> 02:09.440
And so I'm into the music gimmicks as long as it sounds good because I do have a pretty

02:09.440 --> 02:10.440
critical ear.

02:10.440 --> 02:14.080
I would be one of those things where I feel like I'd buy those AirPod Maxes and be expecting

02:14.080 --> 02:18.320
the world and put them on and get kind of disappointed that they weren't as great as

02:18.320 --> 02:19.320
I expected.

02:19.320 --> 02:24.520
So I've been going through the Apple music spatial audio playlist, you know, as one does

02:24.520 --> 02:26.240
while you're working on coding, right?

02:26.240 --> 02:28.560
You listen to music.

02:28.560 --> 02:34.240
I have to say it's, it's really a mixed bag.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.160
It's not a straight improvement.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.160
Go figure, right?

02:37.160 --> 02:43.360
See, I'm not enough of an audio guy to really understand why, but a lot of the nineties

02:43.360 --> 02:47.980
rock stuff that I would be listening to is a really just awful.

02:47.980 --> 02:50.240
The few that have been spatial audio fide, right?

02:50.240 --> 02:54.360
It's like maybe they had to go back to original masters that just weren't that great or something.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.360
I guess.

02:55.360 --> 02:59.440
But then if you listen to anything like super new, like especially like pop, right?

02:59.440 --> 03:00.440
It's actually pretty good.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.440
Right?

03:01.440 --> 03:04.200
Anything that's like overproduced, you know, Katy Perry, that kind of thing.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.960
You're in good shape.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.960
I don't know.

03:06.960 --> 03:10.680
It's like, I mean, I like it overall, but definitely not like like your green day is

03:10.680 --> 03:11.680
not coming out.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.680
Great.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.880
And then one of the things, you know, that's going to be hit and miss is how good is the

03:14.880 --> 03:15.880
original audio?

03:15.880 --> 03:19.520
It's the positive is that they have to go back to original source.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.040
And so sometimes it just sounds incredible, but the negative can be if what they're going

03:23.040 --> 03:24.160
back to, isn't that great?

03:24.160 --> 03:25.840
You know, garbage in garbage out.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.840
True.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.480
It'd be the problem.

03:28.480 --> 03:35.560
Well while we're talking about kind of expensive things that touch our bods, I am embarrassingly

03:35.560 --> 03:37.120
into my launch now.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.120
Yup.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.120
Same.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.280
Didn't know if it'd take like this, but here's how I knew I was really liking this new keyboard.

03:42.280 --> 03:46.040
So the system 76 launch, this is like my week and a half point with it.

03:46.040 --> 03:49.160
You know, I think maybe I'm almost at two weeks right now.

03:49.160 --> 03:53.380
And I actually miss not using it when I'm not in the studio.

03:53.380 --> 03:59.260
And when I get back in the studio and start using it again, it's a joy to return to.

03:59.260 --> 04:00.260
And it's like, Oh, look at me.

04:00.260 --> 04:01.680
I'm typing fast again.

04:01.680 --> 04:05.400
And honestly, that's the benchmark as far as I'm concerned.

04:05.400 --> 04:11.040
This is the favorite, my favorite right here, my, my, probably my favorite all time keyboard.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.000
Yeah, I love it.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I have one too.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.880
I think we have the same switches, right?

04:15.880 --> 04:16.880
Yup.

04:16.880 --> 04:17.880
Yup.

04:17.880 --> 04:18.880
Non-sponsored.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.880
Both of you and I paid for our keyboards.

04:19.880 --> 04:20.880
Yes.

04:20.880 --> 04:21.880
Much to my chagrin.

04:21.880 --> 04:24.640
Wouldn't that be great getting free keyboards.

04:24.640 --> 04:28.480
But nope, we bought them and we, you know, we paid for them with our own hard earned

04:28.480 --> 04:30.800
dollars and we just really liked them.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.400
And God, it's pretty cool.

04:32.400 --> 04:36.680
And so I, here it is and you know, cause I feel like a keyboard like this, you know,

04:36.680 --> 04:39.840
your first impressions after a week, that's one thing.

04:39.840 --> 04:43.960
But then, you know, going into using it for a couple of weeks and then longterm, that's

04:43.960 --> 04:44.960
really what's going to matter.

04:44.960 --> 04:49.080
So I'll check back in after a few months have passed or maybe just from time to time, we'll

04:49.080 --> 04:54.800
check back in because it's also part of that longevity that's, it's going to really matter.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.080
Before we go too far into the show, I want to mention that our friends over at a Cloud

04:58.080 --> 05:03.160
Guru have a free course on Podman containers this month.

05:03.160 --> 05:08.080
Now Podman is an alternative to Docker that's getting a lot more adoption.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.320
It's a OCI container standard now.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.800
And why not take this time to learn about Podman?

05:13.800 --> 05:18.620
It gets a lot of buzz and it offers a lot of benefits like no demon required to actually

05:18.620 --> 05:19.880
run Podman.

05:19.880 --> 05:24.800
So ACG has hands-on with Podman containers on Linux free for the month of June.

05:24.800 --> 05:29.180
And in that course you'll learn what containers are and how to use them, how to manage containers

05:29.180 --> 05:33.400
and specifically how to manage them using Podman, Podman's tools, how it interacts with

05:33.400 --> 05:38.300
Kubernetes and system D and how to manage a lot of them in cockpit, which is a graphical

05:38.300 --> 05:41.760
front end, a web-based graphical front end.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.380
That which is extremely handy to manage your Podman containers.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.820
So we'll have a link in the show notes.

05:45.820 --> 05:50.240
The URL is kind of long, but you could also just search for hands-on with Podman containers.

05:50.240 --> 05:54.240
And that can be a great way to get started with not just containers in general, but the

05:54.240 --> 05:56.520
up and coming kind of like Docker alternative really.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.920
That's pretty nice.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.280
So Podman is something I suggest you check out.

06:00.280 --> 06:03.280
We'll have a link to that in the show notes, but in the meantime, let's get to our email

06:03.280 --> 06:04.640
emails.

06:04.640 --> 06:10.080
Listener Alex wrote in to scare the out of me all over again.

06:10.080 --> 06:14.320
He writes, Hey guys, a few episodes ago, I think you and Chris were lamenting all of

06:14.320 --> 06:19.560
the existential attacks on the Linux desktop for programmers and power users out there.

06:19.560 --> 06:23.220
I know you and Mike can both appreciate a good CLI tool and being able to automate tasks

06:23.220 --> 06:26.720
via bash and other scripting methods, even the ability to audit or trust code that you

06:26.720 --> 06:28.420
compile yourself.

06:28.420 --> 06:32.800
And this is the moment reading this email, Mike, that I thought this is the moment he's

06:32.800 --> 06:36.000
going to talk about why Linux is great because of bash and scripting.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.560
Like I was getting myself all built up for like a pro Linux email.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.360
I liked that he set you up for a fall.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.520
He really did.

06:43.520 --> 06:48.480
He says, I, like Mike, really can't be bothered to get into the weeds of my computing devices

06:48.480 --> 06:50.000
anymore.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.740
Referencing the busy dad thing from last week, since I wrote in a while about a while ago

06:55.740 --> 07:00.200
about my 2020 MacBook Pro all decked out with 32 gigs of RAM.

07:00.200 --> 07:04.640
Well, it's been a little while and now I have to say I'm super impressed with how this Intel

07:04.640 --> 07:05.700
Mac has performed.

07:05.700 --> 07:09.920
Even running Docker, Firefox, Google Hangouts, all of it at the same time, it doesn't really

07:09.920 --> 07:10.920
get that warm.

07:10.920 --> 07:14.960
I mean, yeah, it gets a little warm, but the fans seem to manage it just fine and don't

07:14.960 --> 07:15.960
scream at me.

07:15.960 --> 07:16.960
I love the build quality.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.560
The keyboard's great now and the display is fantastic.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.320
The disc is screaming fast, et cetera, et cetera.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.360
And honestly, Mac OS mostly stays out of the way.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.680
It looks nice and I like how most things are integrated.

07:27.680 --> 07:32.040
I spend most of my day in Slack with a browser open, usually on full screen on another monitor

07:32.040 --> 07:35.520
and then Vim open on my main monitor in my terminal in front of me.

07:35.520 --> 07:39.840
I use brew to install the GNU core utilities, which I use all the flags I learned from my

07:39.840 --> 07:44.800
Linux day with GNU user land, mostly installed the terminal, a browser and a really high

07:44.800 --> 07:47.400
end laptop with an amazing trackpad and keyboard.

07:47.400 --> 07:52.120
I really don't see any reason to run Linux on the desktop.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.800
I love, love the show and I'm, I'm glad to be a supporter, so keep up the amazing work

07:55.800 --> 07:59.640
and let's do another round of robes just to troll Mike.

07:59.640 --> 08:03.560
Now he's what he's touched on here doesn't, he didn't even bring up the M one performance

08:03.560 --> 08:05.200
and the battery life.

08:05.200 --> 08:10.280
What he's touched on here, uh, I think is a core concern that I have had that I kind

08:10.280 --> 08:15.320
of started to sort of swallow and put away, but it really does bubble that.

08:15.320 --> 08:19.960
And I think what, what, and if I'm being completely honest with you, why it bothers me is I have

08:19.960 --> 08:25.480
been on, on this quest to get Linux desktop adopted and then just to adopt Linux desktop

08:25.480 --> 08:28.440
myself for nearly 20 years.

08:28.440 --> 08:33.960
And we are, we are so closer than ever with laptop vendors getting on board and all of

08:33.960 --> 08:37.980
that, that it just kills me.

08:37.980 --> 08:44.440
It kills me deeply from like a personal quest standpoint to see all of this momentum being

08:44.440 --> 08:45.440
lost.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.880
And I can't really dispute anything that Alex says in his email.

08:48.880 --> 08:53.060
No, I mean, as he points out, I obviously agree with him, right?

08:53.060 --> 08:57.040
When I read his email, the thing that jumped out to me was the same thing, like, wow, there

08:57.040 --> 09:00.760
really was momentum and definitely seems to have been blunted quite a bit.

09:00.760 --> 09:06.600
And I think, you know, I've been guilty of this too, but the M one is not the answer.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.600
It's not the number 42, right?

09:07.600 --> 09:10.160
It's not the answer to life, reality and happiness.

09:10.160 --> 09:15.660
Um, although it is certainly substantial because this has been going on for a bit.

09:15.660 --> 09:22.960
So I'll tell you mine, but where do you, when do you think desktop Linux kind of fumbled

09:22.960 --> 09:23.960
the ball a little bit?

09:23.960 --> 09:28.160
I'm not saying it's over, whatever, but for me it was the Wayland transition.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.160
Really?

09:29.160 --> 09:35.240
Because I remember I was more, much more into it back then and it just seemed like so much

09:35.240 --> 09:39.000
energy was going into what was effectively a pissing contest.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.560
And I kind of feel like it didn't get anywhere.

09:42.560 --> 09:47.800
Maybe that's wrong, maybe that's my perceptions being like, whatever, I'm yeah, it's a, it's

09:47.800 --> 09:50.560
a, I agree that it's a, it's still, it's still rolling out.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.160
It's a very slow, it's a much different transition.

09:53.160 --> 09:58.320
You know, when, when Mac OS transitioned to a desktop compositor that uses metal, they

09:58.320 --> 09:59.640
did it in a single release.

09:59.640 --> 10:04.280
Linux is literally going to take a decade to transition to Wayland, but it is, it is

10:04.280 --> 10:05.280
almost done.

10:05.280 --> 10:10.680
I can't really tell you which one's better or worse, honestly, but, um, I kind of am

10:10.680 --> 10:14.600
of the opinion that it hasn't fully happened yet.

10:14.600 --> 10:19.360
Which is why I think I'm still kind of in crisis mode and not morning mode.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.440
I think that it's happening right now.

10:22.440 --> 10:31.260
I think we are in 2021 and 2020 is this momentum just hit a wall moment where I think a couple

10:31.260 --> 10:34.440
of things are coming together.

10:34.440 --> 10:41.840
For one, a lot of us who started using Linux in the nineties and in the early aughts are

10:41.840 --> 10:47.720
just getting older and have more complex lives with more priorities.

10:47.720 --> 10:52.880
And when those priorities are like other small humans that depend on you, that, that kind

10:52.880 --> 10:57.800
of stuff just transcends what can give about the computer stuff.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.400
It just, it transcends any of that kind of thing.

11:00.400 --> 11:05.760
And so people's priorities, large groups of people who were the original must adopt Linux

11:05.760 --> 11:10.080
crew, I think a lot of their priorities have shifted.

11:10.080 --> 11:16.520
And then I think on top of that, you have this onslaught of everyone kind of moving

11:16.520 --> 11:24.960
over to mobile, even, even really high end techie geeks do a lot more today on mobile

11:24.960 --> 11:26.000
than they ever did.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.620
And absolutely a bunch of average users who can now even just completely askew having

11:31.620 --> 11:36.040
a laptop or a computer and do everything on their phone, all of this adoption of using

11:36.040 --> 11:41.340
mobile for notes and your information and your pictures, I think it pushes people towards

11:41.340 --> 11:45.080
a platform that inherently works better with those devices.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.680
You know, it's really nice that if you take a note on your phone as an average user or

11:48.680 --> 11:53.000
even just somebody who doesn't want to have to fuss with sync thing or next cloud, it's

11:53.000 --> 11:57.200
really nice to take a note on your phone and have that note sync to your desktop.

11:57.200 --> 12:01.840
And that times a hundred of those little tiny features I think has created this natural

12:01.840 --> 12:05.500
slide towards these desktops again.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.960
And then you combine that with the kind of people's priorities changing and you combine

12:08.960 --> 12:14.780
that now with the M1 that comes in and says, Oh, also during this horrible chip shortage

12:14.780 --> 12:20.080
where you can't even buy a fricking GPU for your 10th gen Intel desktop.

12:20.080 --> 12:24.180
And in my case, a seventh gen Intel desktop, like I can't even like do the old PC thing

12:24.180 --> 12:27.600
where I could update a few components and at least extend the life like I can't even

12:27.600 --> 12:28.720
do that anymore.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.900
And Apple comes along with their platform that says, here's the performance.

12:32.900 --> 12:36.840
By the way, if you look at the leaks, we're talking 40 core CPUs and just like our next

12:36.840 --> 12:37.840
iteration.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.000
And you look at that performance story, you look at that transition, you look at that

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
battery life.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.200
And I think those three pillars of what I define as a wall have come together and Linux

12:48.200 --> 12:50.520
desktop momentum is smacking into it.

12:50.520 --> 12:54.360
So you mentioned the whole like dad aspect of things.

12:54.360 --> 12:59.800
Is there some possibility that we are over reading something because of our age relative

12:59.800 --> 13:04.380
to like where we were when we were deep, deep into it?

13:04.380 --> 13:06.740
And it probably applies more to me, but think about it.

13:06.740 --> 13:10.640
The people we mostly spend time with talk to online, you know, look forward to seeing

13:10.640 --> 13:16.500
a convention, stuff like that or in, I mean, I can't speak for you, but at least the ones

13:16.500 --> 13:22.280
I deal with, you know, more regularly are kind of in a similar place as I am, right?

13:22.280 --> 13:27.800
Their parents, they're a little older or they're kind of like, you know, they're just not recompiling

13:27.800 --> 13:30.640
their desktop environment, right?

13:30.640 --> 13:35.240
They're not writing at a good home extension and they want to change their goddamn background.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.800
I think what it might be is a little bit of both.

13:37.800 --> 13:42.780
Yes, it's where we're sitting at now, we're seeing it different because of our experiences,

13:42.780 --> 13:48.620
but also I think we are open to another way of seeing a same old problem all of a sudden.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.620
Like we're now seeing it with a different perspective and realizing there's more people

13:52.620 --> 13:56.100
on this side of the line than it initially seemed.

13:56.100 --> 14:01.440
But I will say it really does depend on your perspective because like, um, he calls himself

14:01.440 --> 14:06.520
X Apple user, Mike, he wrote in again and he said, uh, as a dad of two little ones,

14:06.520 --> 14:12.040
the way I look at it, cause he runs a SAS company during the day, uh, I don't have the

14:12.040 --> 14:16.580
time or energy to have a computer that I can't fix myself, right?

14:16.580 --> 14:17.800
He flips it around in his head.

14:17.800 --> 14:21.580
He says to me, to me, I don't have time to go down to the damn Apple store that's two

14:21.580 --> 14:24.120
hours away and then give them my computer for four days.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.480
I need to be able to fix it today.

14:25.480 --> 14:29.160
And if they spill something in there or they break something, I got to fix it.

14:29.160 --> 14:32.600
What kind of moron would spill things in a $2,000 laptop?

14:32.600 --> 14:33.600
Oh wait.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.560
I mean, I totally agree with him.

14:35.560 --> 14:41.800
Like for me, it's, it is, it's like, you got to plan the day you're going to go down into,

14:41.800 --> 14:44.840
into the mall to, to go to the Apple store because it's quite a ways.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.720
Um, or like if it's another vendor, I got to mail them the laptop.

14:48.720 --> 14:53.800
So he says the power of being able to repair his own machine means that it's not really

14:53.800 --> 14:58.500
about hackers and tweaking it and overclocking it and making it totally elite.

14:58.500 --> 15:04.140
It's just about not having enough time and energy to depend on these other groups to

15:04.140 --> 15:06.920
fix it when you could just fix it yourself quickly.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.280
If you know what you're doing and you have a couple of spare parts.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.920
Um, he says, I won't buy a computer.

15:11.920 --> 15:17.080
I can't open up and rescue if I need to, I'm going to, I'm going to make that as he says,

15:17.080 --> 15:21.160
it's his goal as long as humanly possible, which means the M one will never sit on his

15:21.160 --> 15:23.540
desk despite all its glory.

15:23.540 --> 15:27.860
And I think it's just two compromises because I think what your answer would be if I were

15:27.860 --> 15:32.660
to speak for you for a moment is if you couldn't repair that Mac book and it was going to take

15:32.660 --> 15:37.780
them five days to repair it, you'd buy another Mac book and either return it once they repaired

15:37.780 --> 15:43.280
it or you within give the repaired one to a staffer and keep the new Mac book for yourself

15:43.280 --> 15:44.280
and problem solved.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.600
Well, I've only done that like a million times, right?

15:46.600 --> 15:47.600
Yeah.

15:47.600 --> 15:51.000
So you just have a totally, it's a, it's a different way of solving problems.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.800
And it's one that Apple loves you're, you're a great customer that way.

15:54.800 --> 15:58.480
Listen, the genius bar is really a sales opportunity for them when I'm there.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.200
So yeah, yeah, really.

16:00.200 --> 16:04.680
Um, but I totally, I totally connect with that perspective as well.

16:04.680 --> 16:08.000
Um, don't like talking about this topic anymore.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I got to be honest.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.400
I mean, I want people to keep writing it and sharing their thoughts because as somebody

16:12.400 --> 16:16.480
who has to comment on this stuff, this show helps give me different perspective and I

16:16.480 --> 16:17.520
totally appreciate that.

16:17.520 --> 16:21.600
So coder.show slash contact at the same time, I have a little mini crisis.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.000
Jordan writes in with something I can solve.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.320
He says, as a fellow RVer, I've been wondering what you're using for internet.

16:28.320 --> 16:36.160
I'm using a mobile hotspot, um, with a contract I got through the family motorhome association,

16:36.160 --> 16:41.080
but since the T-Mobile merger has happened, my speeds have dropped to almost unusable.

16:41.080 --> 16:46.280
I wanted to follow up because I have talked about trying to get work grade internet on

16:46.280 --> 16:47.280
the road.

16:47.280 --> 16:50.160
And I know that's something that some of our listeners are trying to do, you know, trying

16:50.160 --> 16:54.140
to do, um, some sort of remote work and you want, or maybe not remote learning and you

16:54.140 --> 16:55.360
want something really solid.

16:55.360 --> 17:02.240
So I thought I'd do, um, about a six month followup to this system that I have gone with.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.120
And I'm not saying this is for everybody.

17:04.120 --> 17:09.600
I think the system I'm about to tell you is it's for people who like to mess with computers

17:09.600 --> 17:16.360
and you want your connection to be very solid, industrial grade, you know, like something

17:16.360 --> 17:23.040
that could support many family members that could support remote video sessions that is

17:23.040 --> 17:25.760
going to be a little bit of a premium setup.

17:25.760 --> 17:29.400
I went with a bundle that I'll have linked in the show notes from an online site called

17:29.400 --> 17:32.680
mobile must have, and it's their ultimate road warrior bundle.

17:32.680 --> 17:43.320
And it's a external antenna with an internal router that has four SIM slots and is crazy

17:43.320 --> 17:49.200
fast, crazy fast, way more robust than any MiFi has ever been built.

17:49.200 --> 17:55.440
And it has ethernet ports and it can be DC powered and the antenna is external.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.560
It is a really great antenna.

17:57.560 --> 18:02.360
It is a cat 12 cellular antenna with seven different antennas in there.

18:02.360 --> 18:07.180
It can do multiple connections, MIMO connections to the tower.

18:07.180 --> 18:13.520
So you can have multiple data pipes to towers when they're nearby and all of it comes together

18:13.520 --> 18:15.320
to offer really solid internet.

18:15.320 --> 18:19.280
And then you pop a couple of SIM cards or one SIM card, whatever you're comfortable

18:19.280 --> 18:20.720
with, into the router.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.720
The router is a pet wave.

18:21.720 --> 18:25.320
I have the max transit duo and it's incredible.

18:25.320 --> 18:29.580
It's the kind of thing they put in buses and trains to provide internet when going down

18:29.580 --> 18:31.140
the tracks.

18:31.140 --> 18:34.200
And so it can support, you know, 200, 300 people.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.260
I'm just using it with my family.

18:36.260 --> 18:41.120
And I have in there, I have a Verizon SIM and an AT&T SIM.

18:41.120 --> 18:45.600
And then I have a backup Ting SIM and Google Fi SIM.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.040
The Ting SIM and the Google Fi SIM are my backup SIMs because they're charged based

18:49.040 --> 18:50.040
on usage.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.140
And it works really well.

18:51.140 --> 18:52.140
It works very well.

18:52.140 --> 18:53.140
It was expensive.

18:53.140 --> 19:00.520
It was $1,200 to get it all done, but it is a bulletproof remote wireless setup.

19:00.520 --> 19:03.400
So if you're in a rig, you're going about, you want really solid internet, you want to

19:03.400 --> 19:04.920
be able to do video calls.

19:04.920 --> 19:09.280
Mike and I have recorded the show over it multiple times and it works really solid.

19:09.280 --> 19:12.520
It's going to depend on your signal overall, but you can totally do it.

19:12.520 --> 19:17.280
So I'll put, I'll put a link to the bundle I got and I'll put a link to a mobile internet

19:17.280 --> 19:21.880
resource center article on picking different data plans because man, is that a pain in

19:21.880 --> 19:22.880
the ass.

19:22.880 --> 19:23.880
That is the worst part.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.200
It is really bad out there.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.200
Carriers are the worst.

19:27.200 --> 19:31.240
And then these, these, these third parties that resell the data packages are so fly by

19:31.240 --> 19:32.240
night.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.240
It's so bad.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.240
Ugh.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.240
Oh yeah.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.240
Don't even get me.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.480
Oh, I won't, I won't.

19:37.480 --> 19:44.440
But I do want to talk about stripe identity, but first lino.com slash coder.

19:44.440 --> 19:49.480
Go there and check out Linode and get $100 in credit for 60 days on a new account.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.980
And you support the show.

19:50.980 --> 19:55.920
We got a note into the show today from somebody who tried Linode compared to AWS, just the

19:55.920 --> 20:00.640
$5 Linode too, 100% this came in just today.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.360
They tried out Linode and compared it to their AWS set up.

20:04.360 --> 20:11.780
And Linode was clearly, clearly faster and Linode is often 30 to 50% cheaper than AWS.

20:11.780 --> 20:18.040
They are the world's largest independent cloud provider and their systems are screaming fast.

20:18.040 --> 20:22.640
They have 11 data centers around the world, super fast SSDs on each one of them.

20:22.640 --> 20:27.080
They're dedicated CPU rigs have AMD epic processors that are total screamers.

20:27.080 --> 20:32.560
They really dominate and it's all managed with a very simple cloud dashboard.

20:32.560 --> 20:36.580
If you're a total noob and you're really just building something so that way you can deploy

20:36.580 --> 20:39.460
and run your application, they're going to get you through that.

20:39.460 --> 20:43.360
But if you really know what you're doing, that simple interface doesn't mean it's limited.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.900
You get access to the power features.

20:44.900 --> 20:48.760
You can deploy your own rig and build it from the ground up, or you can just do the one

20:48.760 --> 20:49.900
click deployment.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.080
And that's something I just messed with recently.

20:52.080 --> 20:58.160
I was building a quick file transfer box for friends of the show, I'll just say friends

20:58.160 --> 21:01.200
of the show who are putting on an online event and we're helping them do some of the management

21:01.200 --> 21:02.200
for it.

21:02.200 --> 21:06.400
I'm using Linode in the process to help with the streaming and to help with the file storage.

21:06.400 --> 21:11.240
I spun up a Debian Linode using their one click Docker deployment.

21:11.240 --> 21:15.480
And then the idea is it's Debian 10 with Docker with the right sources that we're getting

21:15.480 --> 21:17.920
the current versions and tools and all that kind of stuff.

21:17.920 --> 21:21.520
I got that deployed and I had the application installed in just minutes and they were up

21:21.520 --> 21:22.520
and using it.

21:22.520 --> 21:27.400
Actually, not even kidding, it just took longer for my DNS provider to update the DNS and it

21:27.400 --> 21:31.760
took me to get the whole stack up and running and the link set off to the guys to start

21:31.760 --> 21:32.960
using it.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.520
That's the magic of using Linode and I deployed it to their Texas data center because it's

21:36.520 --> 21:38.440
nice and centralized.

21:38.440 --> 21:41.440
But like I said earlier, you got 11 data centers to choose from.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.520
And then one of the things that I do, which is like my little hack for all of our things

21:44.520 --> 21:50.840
we have deployed now, whenever I can, I use Linode's S3 object storage as my backend storage.

21:50.840 --> 21:56.960
I'll do a small economical disk on my Linode and then anything that's just kind of growing

21:56.960 --> 22:03.320
exponentially like next cloud or matrix storage or this new file repository I set up for them,

22:03.320 --> 22:06.120
that I use Linode's S3 compatible object storage.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.880
I just put that all on object storage and grow it as I need it and trim it as I need

22:09.880 --> 22:10.880
to.

22:10.880 --> 22:14.320
Linode provides virtual servers that make it easy and affordable for you to host anything

22:14.320 --> 22:15.400
in the cloud.

22:15.400 --> 22:19.600
If you're a gamer, a developer, or maybe somebody who just wants to learn, they've got something

22:19.600 --> 22:20.600
for you.

22:20.600 --> 22:27.440
You can get $100 and support the show when you go to linode.com slash coder.

22:27.440 --> 22:33.560
Stripe made news with Stripe Identity, a self-serve tool that companies can use to verify customers

22:33.560 --> 22:35.880
and users identities with Stripe.

22:35.880 --> 22:41.120
Stripe manages the data storage in an encrypted format and they say they use computer vision

22:41.120 --> 22:46.760
and machine learning to read and match up government IDs with live selfies.

22:46.760 --> 22:50.840
And they say for the end user, like the developer that's deploying it, the entire thing can

22:50.840 --> 22:54.520
work in as little as 15 seconds.

22:54.520 --> 23:00.640
The service is launching this week in beta and in 30 countries eventually.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.560
No word on the cost.

23:02.560 --> 23:08.620
It will be charged per transaction, but Stripe is not talking about those fees at this moment.

23:08.620 --> 23:10.640
What do you think of Stripe Identity?

23:10.640 --> 23:14.560
You know, it's interesting how efficient it is.

23:14.560 --> 23:19.880
Although I'm not sure I would ever want to, as a user, have this in an app I use.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.520
So I did some digging.

23:21.520 --> 23:25.880
The third party developer will get access to the actual images you're sending.

23:25.880 --> 23:29.960
So it's not just like Stripe does like, you know, like they do with the credit card chargers

23:29.960 --> 23:32.620
where it's just like an up or down approved.

23:32.620 --> 23:38.580
This is, they get it and they get the like the picture of your driver's license or whatever.

23:38.580 --> 23:43.080
That makes me a little not a fan of that.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.080
Not a fan of that.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.080
No, I guess.

23:45.080 --> 23:52.200
Well, I guess the alternative would be, you know, let's say it's for sake of argument,

23:52.200 --> 23:55.160
it's like a crypto exchange, because I know, you know, when you buy Coinbase, they make

23:55.160 --> 23:57.320
you verify your identity and that kind of stuff.

23:57.320 --> 24:01.760
Would you rather that each one of these crypto exchanges rolls their own identity management

24:01.760 --> 24:06.240
system because they have to get your identity to follow the federal laws?

24:06.240 --> 24:07.240
The banking laws.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.240
Yeah.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.240
Yeah.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.480
See, I guess that's what it is, right?

24:11.480 --> 24:15.000
I rather Stripe.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.200
I guess you're right.

24:16.200 --> 24:21.440
I trust Stripe more than I trust random crypto, you know, contractor building some website

24:21.440 --> 24:22.440
somewhere.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.440
Yes.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.440
It's not ideal.

24:24.440 --> 24:25.440
No.

24:25.440 --> 24:30.160
What's wild, right, is because Stripe is sort of their brand is built on protecting the

24:30.160 --> 24:31.560
credit card information.

24:31.560 --> 24:35.560
Like the developer or the end user of the Stripe API, they never see the credit card

24:35.560 --> 24:36.560
info.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.800
They don't have to worry about PCI level compliance.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.840
Like Stripe manages all of that.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.880
And so, like, you can't get the info out of Stripe as a developer.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.840
But with this, you can.

24:46.840 --> 24:50.200
And it's boy, that just doesn't seem right.

24:50.200 --> 24:54.280
And I guess Stripe is so they're going to put limitations on what the secret key can

24:54.280 --> 24:55.600
get access to.

24:55.600 --> 25:01.620
But even then, in that scenario, it's dependent on the developer using the API to determine

25:01.620 --> 25:02.960
how much they store.

25:02.960 --> 25:07.560
Like they still just decide, well, we won't pull the information, even though we could.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.240
Like, that's not really much of a fix.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.240
Well, right.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.320
And now it becomes, well, what if the developers, like, key got out?

25:13.320 --> 25:18.800
Does that mean any user whose ID is in this Stripe system, a malicious attacker could

25:18.800 --> 25:24.040
in theory just, like, make the API calls pretending to be the developer and get all their information?

25:24.040 --> 25:25.040
Yeah.

25:25.040 --> 25:28.320
I mean, it sounds like possibly, indeed.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.320
But still.

25:29.320 --> 25:32.560
Still better than them implementing their own app with some sort of SQL back end that

25:32.560 --> 25:33.560
you'd-

25:33.560 --> 25:34.560
Absolutely.

25:34.560 --> 25:35.560
Yeah.

25:35.560 --> 25:36.840
And putting everything in an S3 bucket that's set to public.

25:36.840 --> 25:41.240
But again, nothing stops them from using this and then still putting everything in an S3

25:41.240 --> 25:42.240
bucket.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:43.240 --> 25:46.760
Well, and I've seen it argued potentially that due to the compliance issues, like if

25:46.760 --> 25:51.620
the feds ever came knocking on, say, like this Coinbase alternative, they themselves

25:51.620 --> 25:54.080
are supposed to have a copy of the IDs.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.920
So it could be some compliance thing there.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.200
But I don't know.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.080
Maybe we'll see some evolution on this.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.240
Stripe does seem to be listening.

26:00.240 --> 26:04.260
Like they're in the hacker news comments, people that are all fired up about this.

26:04.260 --> 26:09.200
From a tech standpoint, though, interesting that they're using computer vision and machine

26:09.200 --> 26:11.780
learning to take a selfie.

26:11.780 --> 26:12.780
You take a selfie.

26:12.780 --> 26:16.860
That's how it works on this app is you take a selfie and then their back end matches it

26:16.860 --> 26:22.080
to government IDs based on the metrics that they can pull, the biometrics they can pull

26:22.080 --> 26:24.160
from points on your face.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.160
From the images.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.160
Yeah.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.160
That's impressive.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.160
That's pretty wild.

26:28.160 --> 26:34.000
They have a decent demo of it on their website that kind of shows you how it works with animation.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I am impressed by that.

26:36.000 --> 26:41.520
And I looked into kind of try to get a sense of what else was happening in this space.

26:41.520 --> 26:46.220
And it kind of seems like it's a bit of a crap show.

26:46.220 --> 26:51.040
There's several small startups that are trying to offer stuff like this.

26:51.040 --> 26:55.000
There's some banks that are promising like pie in the sky blockchain solutions, but they

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
actually haven't delivered anything.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.600
And then there's a bunch of people rolling their own solutions for ID verification.

27:01.600 --> 27:06.400
And it just seems like it was just this huge market potential that's just been sitting

27:06.400 --> 27:14.120
there that Stripe is very obviously well positioned to grab and start offering identity services.

27:14.120 --> 27:17.840
There's going to be just even more uses for that online for better or for worse over the

27:17.840 --> 27:19.120
years.

27:19.120 --> 27:23.880
And one more thing that sure would be nice if Apple let you use Stripe in your app payment

27:23.880 --> 27:24.880
process.

27:24.880 --> 27:29.700
Maybe you'll have to use Apple payment for the payment processing and then Stripe identity

27:29.700 --> 27:31.600
for the identity management part of it.

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
It's just going to be a mess.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.080
Oh, you know, I wonder if Apple would allow that at all.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.080
I know.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.080
I know.

27:37.080 --> 27:44.160
Yeah, it's it's it does make you wonder because this is Stripe is this is all they do, right?

27:44.160 --> 27:49.200
They're wholly focused on these kinds of things where payment in the app store is.

27:49.200 --> 27:53.360
Well, the app store is, you know, what is it like a 10, 11 billion dollar business?

27:53.360 --> 27:55.040
It's like a side hustle for Apple.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.120
And it's just not their core focus.

27:57.120 --> 28:01.840
I suppose with Apple Pay, maybe a bit more could be underselling it a bit.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.560
But I just Stripe just they're hungry for it.

28:03.560 --> 28:07.000
I guess I think I think I actually ultimately like this.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.960
It's better than all the crap alternatives.

28:08.960 --> 28:15.320
That's just the pure pragmatism of it is where I come down on it is that I like it better

28:15.320 --> 28:17.800
than anything else that's out there right now.

28:17.800 --> 28:21.960
And Stripe seems like a company well positioned to pull it off the user convenience.

28:21.960 --> 28:27.100
The user experience of going going through and verifying your identity has been such

28:27.100 --> 28:31.680
a crappy experience where you're trying to take a horrible picture of your driver's license

28:31.680 --> 28:33.920
here in the States or whatever, and there's a reflection on it.

28:33.920 --> 28:34.920
It can't get it quite right.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.840
And so you get denied just because of that.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.660
And it's extremely frustrating.

28:38.660 --> 28:42.840
And they're offering something that everybody knows how to take a selfie.

28:42.840 --> 28:45.480
It's built on a brand that people already trust.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.520
And they've already got customers like Discord that are actively using it for their verified

28:49.520 --> 28:51.040
bot program today.

28:51.040 --> 28:55.580
So it's going to be it's in beta and it's by the time you're using their embed code

28:55.580 --> 29:00.000
to build this into your project, this is going to be pretty well tested.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.080
You know, that might be the ultimate thing about it is that it's going to be so frickin

29:03.080 --> 29:06.600
simple now for developers to use this that it's just going to get an option.

29:06.600 --> 29:10.520
You're just going to drop it in your app and it's good to go.

29:10.520 --> 29:14.160
I mean, even, you know, JB has a Stripe account for like some of our garage sale stuff.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.000
It's just Stripe is just so universal now.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.600
Oh, yeah, no, we have a Stripe account, too.

29:17.600 --> 29:21.840
I mean, I think everybody does at this point.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.080
Datadog.com slash Coderadio.

29:24.080 --> 29:27.320

29:31.720 --> 29:33.700
on with your entire stack?

29:33.700 --> 29:34.700
Datadog does it all.

29:34.700 --> 29:39.720
And Datadog has this continuous profile that automatically collects information across your

29:39.720 --> 29:41.940

Even with all the care and love and time, it's still free thanks to your support and

31:02.080 --> 31:07.120
Datadogs at datadog.com slash Coderadio.

31:07.120 --> 31:11.400
So a couple of just really basic things that we learned after WWDC.

31:11.400 --> 31:16.680
Number one is Mac OS 12 is getting serious virtualization.

31:16.680 --> 31:24.200
Apple has been slow cooking a fork of FreeBSD's Beehive for a while and now they're adding

31:24.200 --> 31:25.480
Vert IO support.

31:25.480 --> 31:33.520
Now Vert IO support means this is a legitimate VM solution that perhaps could tie in hardware

31:33.520 --> 31:40.960
devices like eGPUs, physical disks, network cards that can be allocated to your virtual

31:40.960 --> 31:42.480
machines.

31:42.480 --> 31:47.160
And the virtualization framework in Mac OS 12 is also getting a DFU mode for dealing

31:47.160 --> 31:52.920
with Apple Silicon Macs as guests, importing USB devices directly to the guest system and

31:52.920 --> 31:54.520
a bunch of other stuff.

31:54.520 --> 32:01.820
So virtualization in Mac OS 12 is going to be nearly on par with virtualization on a

32:01.820 --> 32:02.820
Linux desktop.

32:02.820 --> 32:07.200
I think KVM and the Linux desktop still has it built or still has it beat I should say.

32:07.200 --> 32:13.480
But in terms of raw functionality, Mac OS 12 is going to be more on par now.

32:13.480 --> 32:18.000
And they may even put it over the top if some great front ends like something from Parallels

32:18.000 --> 32:21.120
or VMware gets built on top of that.

32:21.120 --> 32:25.920
But as of right now, this is all just framework stuff that isn't necessarily exposed via anything

32:25.920 --> 32:26.920
in the Mac OS UI.

32:26.920 --> 32:30.680
So it's there, but I don't know if you're going to use it.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.080
I wouldn't be surprised if Parallels adopts this pretty quickly, right?

32:33.080 --> 32:39.480
I mean, this is a pretty common use case, virtualizing Windows, virtualizing other systems.

32:39.480 --> 32:44.520
I virtualize Linux on my Mac, I virtualize Windows.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.880
Anything that makes that better, I'm down for.

32:46.880 --> 32:50.640
Yeah, especially if you can start passing through hardware devices so the VM just sees

32:50.640 --> 32:52.720
them directly attached to them.

32:52.720 --> 32:53.720
That's nice.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.360
And that's the big thing that they're adding.

32:55.360 --> 32:59.300
A couple of other just small things that I just think are noteworthy and Apple didn't

32:59.300 --> 33:04.280
think they were worth touching on during the keynote, but I think a lot of people disagree.

33:04.280 --> 33:08.160
That is that some of the new features that they announced just simply don't work on Intel

33:08.160 --> 33:09.160
Macs.

33:09.160 --> 33:14.060
So the process of, if we were wondering how long it would take Apple to kind of slowly

33:14.060 --> 33:19.440
abandon the Intel Macs in little steps, it begins with Mac OS 12 in a pretty significant

33:19.440 --> 33:20.440
way.

33:20.440 --> 33:25.620
I guess any kind of real feature that got introduced at WWDC that depends on the neural

33:25.620 --> 33:32.120
engine in the A-series and M1-series CPUs just isn't happening on the Intel chip.

33:32.120 --> 33:39.920
So continuous dictation, on-device Siri dictation, some features in their maps program, live

33:39.920 --> 33:45.040
text analysis, portrait mode for FaceTime, that stuff doesn't work on the Intel Macs.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.440
Sorry, your FaceTime calls still look like crap.

33:47.440 --> 33:53.560
Do you see, you know, do you see like, it seems a little soon, Mike, seems a little

33:53.560 --> 33:55.760
soon if you ask me.

33:55.760 --> 33:59.540
Seems like they could just throw that, that stuff could, I mean, obviously what do I know?

33:59.540 --> 34:02.000
But there's gotta be another way to do it on CPU, right?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
It must be.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.920
Yeah, but why, why, why invest the effort?

34:05.920 --> 34:08.320
Because they're still selling Intel machines, you know?

34:08.320 --> 34:12.960
Yeah, but they're not going to sell them for, the people buying the big Intel machines now

34:12.960 --> 34:14.840
are by our pros, right?

34:14.840 --> 34:16.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:16.320 --> 34:19.720
They're, and you know, they don't care about a lot of this stuff.

34:19.720 --> 34:20.720
So.

34:20.720 --> 34:21.720
I suppose you're right.

34:21.720 --> 34:22.920
I think this makes sense.

34:22.920 --> 34:23.920
Yeah.

34:23.920 --> 34:24.920
Why invest the effort?

34:24.920 --> 34:31.000
I just, it stinks, you know, cause some people have 2020 and 2019 edition Mac books that

34:31.000 --> 34:35.760
just aren't going to get better FaceTime video or they're not going to get continuous dictation

34:35.760 --> 34:38.200
and so I don't know, it's just, it sort of stinks to see it happen already.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.920
I'm sure Apple has a solution to that.

34:40.920 --> 34:41.920
Yeah, buy an M1.

34:41.920 --> 34:42.920
Yeah, buy an M1.

34:42.920 --> 34:43.920
I mean.

34:43.920 --> 34:44.920
Yeah.

34:44.920 --> 34:45.920
Yeah, that's true.

34:45.920 --> 34:46.920
That's true.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.200
Well, I suppose that could be it.

34:49.200 --> 34:50.200
That could be.

34:50.200 --> 34:54.120
You know, I just wanted to see, this is just an example of something that doesn't happen

34:54.120 --> 34:57.400
over here in Linux land, you know, these, of course we don't have these features to

34:57.400 --> 34:58.400
begin with.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.400
There's that.

34:59.400 --> 35:04.560
So, you know, and somebody pointed out on Twitter, it's like, well, what would you have

35:04.560 --> 35:05.560
them do?

35:05.560 --> 35:09.320
Would you have them just not include these features on the M1 Macs?

35:09.320 --> 35:13.720
Because the Intel Macs can't do it, like they're inheriting this stuff because they've done

35:13.720 --> 35:18.320
the leg, the heavy lifting, all the legwork on the iOS side and now the Mac just gets

35:18.320 --> 35:22.040
to take advantage of it because it has the APIs and it has the chips.

35:22.040 --> 35:26.440
But what should they just disable it because the Intel Macs can't do it?

35:26.440 --> 35:27.760
That doesn't make sense either, I guess.

35:27.760 --> 35:28.760
Yeah, no.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.840
But you know what you can have on your Linux desktop?

35:30.840 --> 35:32.280
Oh, I do know.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.280
Tell me.

35:33.280 --> 35:34.800
Clippy and Visual Studio.

35:34.800 --> 35:40.600
A Visual Studio code, that is, I think, but yeah.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.600
Of course.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.600
Yeah.

35:42.600 --> 35:48.640
A Visual Studio code now with Clippy, it will show you your mistakes in real time.

35:48.640 --> 35:53.600
And I mean, I don't know really, I don't really know how development won't change forever

35:53.600 --> 35:54.600
with this.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.200
Finally, the guiding hand of Clippy in VS Code.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.200
That's great.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.200
That's great.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.200
So I assume you installed this.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.200
Of course.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.720
It's amazing.

36:03.720 --> 36:07.960
I actually I was reading because I don't know why actually, I don't actually know what my

36:07.960 --> 36:13.120
excuse is, but I was reading their issue tracker for this here app.

36:13.120 --> 36:17.240
And I guess it cuts off some of the last like letter of advice that it gives you.

36:17.240 --> 36:22.760
So not only is it obnoxious in the way that Clippy always was, but now it also doesn't

36:22.760 --> 36:28.180
give you complete advice, which is like salt in the wound and somehow perfect.

36:28.180 --> 36:32.600
It just mocks you as you're coding, which I'm here for.

36:32.600 --> 36:37.920
And it takes up an enormous, enormous amount of screen real estate, too, as well.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.360
Yes, it does.

36:39.360 --> 36:44.600
And you can tell it was never really a graphic that was designed to be blown up to that size

36:44.600 --> 36:48.360
that it takes because it's it's rough.

36:48.360 --> 36:52.400
It's like a JPEG from the 90s that just gets blown up onto a high res screen and it just

36:52.400 --> 36:54.400
looks real rough.

36:54.400 --> 37:02.600
It is honestly, I mean, the first issue, issue number one on the VSCode Clippy GitHub is

37:02.600 --> 37:07.100
please no, that is the entire issue.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.760
We should make one that says please yes.

37:08.760 --> 37:12.400
Somebody in the audience go over there and encourage encourage this individual because

37:12.400 --> 37:14.760
they're making development better.

37:14.760 --> 37:16.000
Everybody needs Clippy.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
You know what the problem here?

37:17.000 --> 37:18.720
It's a lack of branding, right?

37:18.720 --> 37:23.400
We need to be we need to be dropping machine learning and artificial intelligence assisted

37:23.400 --> 37:26.520
development into the description of this thing.

37:26.520 --> 37:29.400
And I think people would be on board with this.

37:29.400 --> 37:32.040
I just think it's just a lack of a lack of help.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.040
So I may fork this.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.040
Oh, OK.

37:35.040 --> 37:40.680
Because there is another helpful spirit that I think the Coder Radio audience would really

37:40.680 --> 37:44.780
appreciate in their Visual Studio code sessions.

37:44.780 --> 37:46.640
Someone who will give you advice on your code.

37:46.640 --> 37:47.640
Oh, yeah.

37:47.640 --> 37:48.640
OK, sure.

37:48.640 --> 37:49.640
Me say yeah.

37:49.640 --> 37:52.720
Yeah, yeah, that's what we need.

37:52.720 --> 37:53.840
Yeah, yeah.

37:53.840 --> 37:56.800
And Disney sues me in five, four, three.

37:56.800 --> 38:01.780
You know, we haven't mentioned it, but notepad plus plus has recently had a big release and

38:01.780 --> 38:04.280
Sublime Text four is out as well.

38:04.280 --> 38:07.240
I used to be a Sublime Text user, weren't you as well?

38:07.240 --> 38:08.240
I was.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.240
Yeah.

38:09.240 --> 38:14.120
Were you tempted at all to, you know, check out an old X after the release or have you

38:14.120 --> 38:17.000
remained firm in your commitment to VSCode?

38:17.000 --> 38:21.260
I downloaded it, but I'm so deep into VSCode now that yeah, I don't know.

38:21.260 --> 38:24.140
I mean, I'm using that damn Pylance plugin from Microsoft.

38:24.140 --> 38:25.320
That's just awesome.

38:25.320 --> 38:26.320
You're hooked now.

38:26.320 --> 38:27.320
I'm hooked.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.320
Yeah, yeah.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.320
I thought about it, too.

38:29.320 --> 38:30.320
I thought about it.

38:30.320 --> 38:35.320
But honestly, VSCode is doing everything I need and it's free.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.840
Well, and the extension library is crazy.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.120
Yeah, that too.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.120
That too.

38:40.120 --> 38:44.520
You know, I was just working on a Docker compose file and it's just like, hey, why don't you

38:44.520 --> 38:46.320
install the Docker support and stuff?

38:46.320 --> 38:47.320
And I'm like, oh, OK.

38:47.320 --> 38:48.880
Yeah, I should do that on this box.

38:48.880 --> 38:52.840
And I just and then everything's all all my YAML file gets all syntax highlighted all

38:52.840 --> 38:57.680
of a sudden and everything's looking all great and it's just just so it's so quick to just

38:57.680 --> 39:02.400
bust through a file even on a remote server and then get right back to what I was doing.

39:02.400 --> 39:09.640
I would I feel like I should give Sublime Text a go because I find the idea of a development

39:09.640 --> 39:14.880
shop or a single developer making a full time living by selling a text editor kind of a

39:14.880 --> 39:20.960
romantic notion, the idea, right, that somebody could just sort of have this this independent

39:20.960 --> 39:25.320
gig where they work for themselves and their whole thing is they make a text editor.

39:25.320 --> 39:26.320
Maybe it's a couple of people.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.320
I don't know.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.320
I don't know how it works over there.

39:28.320 --> 39:33.280
And they make a living by selling a text editor that people pay for like software used to

39:33.280 --> 39:34.280
work.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.920
Like, I find that entire notion romantic, even if it's closed source.

39:36.920 --> 39:40.060
So I'm compelled to try it out.

39:40.060 --> 39:43.560
And yet I just got too much going on these days.

39:43.560 --> 39:44.560
Yeah.

39:44.560 --> 39:47.680
I mean, I used to use an editor called Chocolate on the Mac.

39:47.680 --> 39:48.680
Oh, yeah.

39:48.680 --> 39:49.680
Oh, yeah.

39:49.680 --> 39:50.680
I remember Chocolate.

39:50.680 --> 39:51.680
Yeah.

39:51.680 --> 39:52.680
That hasn't been updated in four thousand years.

39:52.680 --> 39:53.680
I sort of feel like this code is murdered.

39:53.680 --> 39:59.040
I mean, I know people will write in Sublime users and I get it.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.040
I know.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.040
Maybe I will try it out.

40:01.040 --> 40:02.840
But maybe there's a space for both.

40:02.840 --> 40:03.840
Maybe.

40:03.840 --> 40:04.840
I'm not sure.

40:04.840 --> 40:05.840
Oh, there's not.

40:05.840 --> 40:06.840
No.

40:06.840 --> 40:10.800
No, not from not from one person, if that's what you mean, because why why are you going

40:10.800 --> 40:12.560
to flip editors all the time?

40:12.560 --> 40:16.800
Neil is reminding me and we also had an email into the show that the Sublime folks have

40:16.800 --> 40:20.240
a really nice get editor now.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.240
Yeah.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.240
Sublime Merge.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.240
Yeah.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.240
Sublime Merge.

40:24.240 --> 40:25.240
Thank you.

40:25.240 --> 40:26.240
That was we got an email into the show.

40:26.240 --> 40:29.200
They're like, you should have these guys sponsor you because this is some really good

40:29.200 --> 40:30.200
software.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.200
So that's it.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.200
Sublime Merge dot com.

40:32.200 --> 40:33.200
I'll put a link to the show notes in that.

40:33.200 --> 40:37.720
But our email was loving it, you know, it's good stuff.

40:37.720 --> 40:38.720
So I will.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.720
I'll put a link to that.

40:39.720 --> 40:41.440
And that is, you know, it's definitely something I should check out.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.800
I've been also debating if I should use GitHub projects or not.

40:44.800 --> 40:49.000
So if anybody has any experience with that, I what the hell's a GitHub project?

40:49.000 --> 40:53.120
It's like their own Trello that you can but you can track the issues back to where you

40:53.120 --> 40:57.200
can track projects back to issues and commits, which is kind of a neat idea.

40:57.200 --> 41:00.720
Having like I could see like having an issues conversation around a project entry.

41:00.720 --> 41:04.760
I kind of like it, but it also seems like a lot of extra overhead when I just need a

41:04.760 --> 41:08.020
list of projects and be able to communicate them with people and bang them out.

41:08.020 --> 41:11.840
Kind of like three or four things I'm working on them like probably should put down and

41:11.840 --> 41:13.480
start sharing with people.

41:13.480 --> 41:15.640
But I'm just feeling a resistance to Trello.

41:15.640 --> 41:21.820
I just don't really I feel like I've tinkered with Trello as a toy so much more than I actually

41:21.820 --> 41:23.840
have as a tool to use.

41:23.840 --> 41:28.040
And I'm Wes is trying to talk me into just making a plain text list.

41:28.040 --> 41:29.440
I'm kind of considering doing it.

41:29.440 --> 41:32.640
No, I'm heavy Trello user, but I'm looking at this GitHub project thing.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.880
That's pretty interesting.

41:34.880 --> 41:35.880
It is right.

41:35.880 --> 41:41.800
If anybody has any experiences with it or any other newer project management tools that

41:41.800 --> 41:46.640
actually are quick to use, easy for other people to adopt and just get your ideas out

41:46.640 --> 41:47.640
and you get going.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.440
You don't have to futz around with it.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.440
I'd love to know.

41:50.440 --> 41:51.880
Coder dot show slash contact.

41:51.880 --> 41:52.960
Let us know.

41:52.960 --> 41:58.000
I am tempted to try out GitHub projects, but I also feel like maybe it's too much tool

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
for what I need.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.240
Fussing about the tools again and not actually doing the work.

42:02.240 --> 42:03.240
That doesn't sound like me.

42:03.240 --> 42:09.440
Never, never, never, never, never, never.

42:09.440 --> 42:11.040
Thank you to the QA team out there.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.040
Thank you very much.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.040
You get the Coderly report.

42:13.040 --> 42:15.420
You support the show, which we really appreciate.

42:15.420 --> 42:17.520
And of course you get the limited ad feed.

42:17.520 --> 42:19.280
Nice tight show with just less ads.

42:19.280 --> 42:24.340
We just want to say thank you to our QA team out there and you can become a member at Coder

42:24.340 --> 42:26.280
QA dot co.

42:26.280 --> 42:28.160
You can find Mr. Dominic on Twitter.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.880
He's at Dumanoku and his company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.560
And Mike, is there anything else you want to mention this week?

42:33.560 --> 42:34.560
Nope.

42:34.560 --> 42:41.560
Just follow me on Twitter and send in your your sublime text love poetry to Coder dot

42:41.560 --> 42:42.560
show.

42:42.560 --> 42:47.080
Coder dot show slash contact or I think Coder at Jupiter broadcasting dot com works too.

42:47.080 --> 42:51.040
If you just want to do it like old school email style, you know, don't have to fuzz

42:51.040 --> 42:52.240
with the web page.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.360
You can do that too.

42:53.360 --> 42:55.120
I'm on the Twitters at Chris Last.

42:55.120 --> 42:57.160
The podcast network is at Jupiter signal.

42:57.160 --> 43:00.240
And this here podcast is at Coder radio show.

43:00.240 --> 43:04.120
Links to what we talked about today are at Coder dot show slash 418.

43:04.120 --> 43:10.520
You'll also find our contact form over there, our RSS feed, our back catalog.

43:10.520 --> 43:13.400
I don't know, probably dead links.

43:13.400 --> 43:14.400
It's a website.

43:14.400 --> 43:17.640
Yeah, it's probably over there.

43:17.640 --> 43:21.320
We do the show live on Mondays, 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern, and it's a lot of fun.

43:21.320 --> 43:23.880
We'd love to have you join us over at jblive.tv.

43:23.880 --> 43:33.760
Thanks for being here and we'll see you next week.
