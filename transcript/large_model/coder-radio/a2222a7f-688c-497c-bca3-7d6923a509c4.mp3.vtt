00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 452 for February 7th, 2022.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.240
Hey y'all, come on in now, this is Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:19.240 --> 00:25.140
pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.140 --> 00:29.920
My name is Chris, and joining me with his trucker hat, oh, hang on, it's our host, Chris

00:29.920 --> 00:30.920
D'Onofrio.

00:30.920 --> 00:31.920
Mr. Dominic.

00:31.920 --> 00:35.800
See, this is what happens, people miss the live stream, they don't even know what I'm

00:35.800 --> 00:39.080
talking, I mean, they get probably part of the joke, but they don't get the full, you

00:39.080 --> 00:43.400
know, the full illustrious Mike Dominic, you know, the full flavor Mike Dominic.

00:43.400 --> 00:48.800
Switch your Tim Hortons to decaf and calm the hell down, all right?

00:48.800 --> 00:49.800
Tim Hortons.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.720
Hey man, you know I live in Starbucks land.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.720
You know that.

00:53.720 --> 00:54.720
You're so prudish.

00:54.720 --> 00:55.720
I live in the land of Starbucks.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.380
I don't drink Starbucks.

00:57.380 --> 00:58.380
Coffee radio.

00:58.380 --> 01:01.920
I've been holding this back for two months.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.080
Ask me what brand of coffee is in my pantry right now.

01:04.080 --> 01:07.720
Hey Mike, what brand of coffee is in your pantry right now?

01:07.720 --> 01:10.600
Great value, otherwise known as Walmart.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.920
Which is probably Folgers, let's be honest.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.360
Right, it's fine.

01:14.360 --> 01:18.600
I've gotten to the point of coffee addiction where I just need so much.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.640
I feel like meth heads go through a similar process.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.920
This is why I just go for the pills.

01:22.920 --> 01:27.400
I just get the caffeine pills, and then I drink something bubbly with it, so that way

01:27.400 --> 01:31.960
I can slam the caffeine into my intestinal system as fast as possible, and that system

01:31.960 --> 01:32.960
works.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.240
There was a point in my wayward youth where I chewed espresso beans.

01:36.240 --> 01:39.260
Surprisingly hard to get out of your teeth if you have caps.

01:39.260 --> 01:43.360
This is what a man who has sleep apnea for 11 years and didn't get it taken care of tried

01:43.360 --> 01:44.360
to do.

01:44.360 --> 01:49.120
I discovered that Air Force pilots have this type of caffeinated gum that they get to chew.

01:49.120 --> 01:50.120
Not good for you.

01:50.120 --> 01:54.920
So of course, I tracked that down, and I ordered like a box of it, and just started going to

01:54.920 --> 01:59.360
town on it, and then ended up getting a hole in one of my molars, so then I quit doing

01:59.360 --> 02:00.360
that.

02:00.360 --> 02:03.640
At what point did you start seeing Russian fighter jets around your house?

02:03.640 --> 02:04.640
Were you like, whoa?

02:04.640 --> 02:08.120
Yeah, actually they were just geese, but I thought they were Russian fighter jets until

02:08.120 --> 02:09.120
then.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.120
Of course, they're not real.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.120
Right, yeah.

02:11.120 --> 02:16.600
Oh man, I tell you what, the Steam Deck FOMO is getting real.

02:16.600 --> 02:17.960
The reviews are out there.

02:17.960 --> 02:22.240
The videos are dropping, and I want one now.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.320
Did I ask you, are you getting a Steam Deck?

02:24.320 --> 02:26.320
I think I pre-ordered two.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.920
So there's something about like they're going to email you, and you've got to confirm your

02:29.920 --> 02:31.560
order?

02:31.560 --> 02:34.160
What kind of messed up system is this?

02:34.160 --> 02:37.080
That is preemptively giving me anxiety, and I don't even think it's till like the end

02:37.080 --> 02:40.940
of the month, and I'm already stressing about this email that might come in, and you have

02:40.940 --> 02:46.520
like 72 hours, or 48 hours, or five minutes, you've got like five minutes to respond to

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
this email.

02:47.520 --> 02:48.520
That's probably what it is, probably one minute.

02:48.520 --> 02:52.120
You've got one minute to respond to this email, and if you don't respond to this email within

02:52.120 --> 02:55.560
like 30 seconds, then you don't get your deck.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.480
And also, I thought I already paid for it.

02:58.480 --> 02:59.480
You did not.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.540
I did not, right?

03:00.540 --> 03:05.620
But I kind of mentally thought I had, and then I went and looked and realized I hadn't.

03:05.620 --> 03:10.480
So that sucks, because I thought I already spent that money.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.600
So now I'm like preparing myself for like, okay.

03:13.600 --> 03:20.700
Since the deck was announced, my entire mindset about money has changed, and now I don't want

03:20.700 --> 03:21.700
to spend any.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.680
I don't like spending money on anything.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.440
I've gone from let's buy to I don't want to spend money.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.240
Now I feel bad about buying the deck.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.720
I feel like the deck is a good purchase though.

03:32.720 --> 03:33.720
Yeah.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.720
Yeah.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.720
I actually think it could be.

03:35.720 --> 03:41.520
I was thinking about it like for people out there that don't have a Linux desktop machine

03:41.520 --> 03:43.520
with a graphics card.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.840
Maybe they're on a Mac or a Windows machine for day to day.

03:46.840 --> 03:53.480
Now they can get this deck, and they can keep using their work setup that gets the job done

03:53.480 --> 03:59.200
for them, and also experience how far Linux gaming has come.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.960
For us geeks out there, that's also really great.

04:01.960 --> 04:06.000
And I also realized the other thing that's going to be fantastic about it is it means

04:06.000 --> 04:07.720
I can mess my systems up.

04:07.720 --> 04:13.400
I can screw with different stuff, and I'll always have a working gaming machine now.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.400
Yeah.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
I think it's going to be good.

04:15.400 --> 04:20.400
I have been deep into my Switch, but it would be nice to be able to play some AAA games.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.160
Presumably the Steam Deck is more powerful than the Switch.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.680
It's a powerful deck, if you will.

04:24.680 --> 04:25.680
Oh yeah.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.680
For sure.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.680
Yeah.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.680
I think it's going to be fine, right?

04:28.680 --> 04:32.360
Put yourself in the mindset of you and me when we were flying and traveling and staying

04:32.360 --> 04:33.360
in hotels.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.360
That's so far.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.360
Right?

04:35.360 --> 04:37.440
And this is a little PC that you could take with you in your bag.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.440
Okay.

04:38.440 --> 04:43.320
But is Steam going to complain about like DRM and authentication and stuff if you have

04:43.320 --> 04:44.320
no connection?

04:44.320 --> 04:48.960
I think that's going to work exactly how it works now with Steam games, because that's

04:48.960 --> 04:50.560
all the same.

04:50.560 --> 04:54.680
But you are going to get a plasma desktop, an Arch-based plasma desktop that they're

04:54.680 --> 04:56.260
going to give you access to.

04:56.260 --> 05:02.680
And if you plug in a second screen, you can do dual monitors using the screen of the Deck

05:02.680 --> 05:03.980
and whatever monitor you brought.

05:03.980 --> 05:05.480
I think that's pretty great.

05:05.480 --> 05:08.800
One assumes, though, that you don't have to, right?

05:08.800 --> 05:13.640
If you want to treat this as a console and just plug it into a monitor to play the games

05:13.640 --> 05:15.280
with the controller.

05:15.280 --> 05:20.960
Like if your hotel room monitor had or TV screen had a working in HDMI, you could totally

05:20.960 --> 05:21.960
do that.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.560
That just seems really cool.

05:23.560 --> 05:28.320
I mean, how do the specs compare to like, I don't know, like a last gen, like an Xbox

05:28.320 --> 05:30.800
Xbone or a PS4?

05:30.800 --> 05:34.920
I don't know because I'm not familiar with the specs of those consoles, but it's a step

05:34.920 --> 05:42.480
above what I think a lot of AMD gaming laptops are today with an integrated GPU.

05:42.480 --> 05:47.480
So it doesn't have a dedicated external GPU necessarily, but it has the latest and greatest

05:47.480 --> 05:51.600
AMD APUs, which is looking really great.

05:51.600 --> 05:58.560
Plus Valve continues to do a lot of work on the back end to get the drivers in good shape.

05:58.560 --> 06:02.880
So the performance, they've really managed to eke out every little bit of performance

06:02.880 --> 06:05.900
for the Linux driver for the AMD GPU.

06:05.900 --> 06:11.560
So you got a brand new iteration on that GPU, plus a really good driver stack for it in

06:11.560 --> 06:12.560
the back.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.480
So this is where I bought one because I like to light money on fire.

06:15.480 --> 06:19.360
Like the Witcher 3 is a game I want to play and I have it on the Switch, but I'm told

06:19.360 --> 06:23.200
that the Swift is just kind of a nerfed version of it.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.200
Oh, sure.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.200
Yeah.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.840
Will this be able to play the Witcher 3 and all of its...

06:26.840 --> 06:27.840
I believe so.

06:27.840 --> 06:28.840
Yeah.

06:28.840 --> 06:29.840
Hmm.

06:29.840 --> 06:30.840
Okay.

06:30.840 --> 06:31.840
Yeah.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.240
And because it's also the other thing that has in its favor, decent GPU, really.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.560
And it's a 720p screen.

06:35.560 --> 06:40.240
Now the reviews are saying it's a great screen, but it's not a crazy high res.

06:40.240 --> 06:47.240
So you can really kind of push the graphics because it's not trying to do like a 1080p

06:47.240 --> 06:49.440
or 4K resolution.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.520
We will see.

06:50.520 --> 06:54.360
Who knows how it'll actually go, but I'm keeping an eye out for that email.

06:54.360 --> 06:59.860
And speaking of email, we are still getting a lot of emails about the blue versus green

06:59.860 --> 07:02.640
bubble situation, unbelievably.

07:02.640 --> 07:07.920
And I don't know if you caught this, Mike, but last week Google announced it was rolling

07:07.920 --> 07:12.880
out an update for Google messages that supports the iMessage reactions.

07:12.880 --> 07:17.440
So it now displays them appropriately in Google messages.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.920
I still don't get it, but sure.

07:19.920 --> 07:20.920
Okay.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.180
This is outrageous.

07:23.180 --> 07:26.520
This is fucking outrageous.

07:26.520 --> 07:31.720
So this entire discussion, the premise has been Apple is the bully.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.640
Apple is the bad guy.

07:33.640 --> 07:41.140
Apple is making green bubble folks feel like they are less when a huge part of the problem

07:41.140 --> 07:47.000
could have been solved by Google all along on their own platform with their own update.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.480
Are you kidding me?

07:48.480 --> 07:52.920
Well, I mean, you know how Google feels about maintaining platforms.

07:52.920 --> 07:58.680
I just, I can't believe that this was a thing that Google could have done all along and

07:58.680 --> 08:00.820
they just now got to it.

08:00.820 --> 08:06.720
That is so extremely user hostile and yet that's not how this gets covered at all.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.720
And nobody's talking about that.

08:08.720 --> 08:13.160
Everyone's celebrating now that Google messages now supports iPhone reactions and they actually

08:13.160 --> 08:14.920
mapped RCS reactions now.

08:14.920 --> 08:21.840
And yes, I acknowledge this is not the entire problem, but this is a big part of the problem

08:21.840 --> 08:28.000
and it indicates that Google had the ability to solve it all fricking along.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.440
And I can't even, especially when they were on Twitter shaming Apple and calling them

08:32.440 --> 08:39.800
bullies for this situation, the official Android account called Apple bullies for this.

08:39.800 --> 08:41.720
But does this really solve the whole problem, right?

08:41.720 --> 08:44.120
Cause you still have like the group messaging kerfuffle.

08:44.120 --> 08:48.200
Yeah, it's not perfect, but now in group messages, when people do the reaction, they'll display

08:48.200 --> 08:51.480
properly on the Android side.

08:51.480 --> 09:01.920
It doesn't solve all of them, but it's outrageous that again, Google just, I cannot properly

09:01.920 --> 09:07.400
convey how bad Google has screwed this up from all of their different messaging applications,

09:07.400 --> 09:11.320
from the way they screwed the pooch with the carriers initially, all of it.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.880
And it's all been user hostile.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.740
It's been all extremely user hostile from the very beginning.

09:16.740 --> 09:21.660
And yet somehow they don't end up getting any of the criticism in this situation.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.580
And I know I come across here and now here's Chris again, I'm like the guy that defends

09:24.580 --> 09:26.920
Facebook and defends Apple.

09:26.920 --> 09:32.340
So I sound like I'm like, you know, pro Apple, but I'm really just trying to advocate for

09:32.340 --> 09:37.260
common sense and having a little bit of balance looking at these things.

09:37.260 --> 09:39.180
Absolutely Apple could do more.

09:39.180 --> 09:43.560
Absolutely it'd be like minimum for Apple to support RCS.

09:43.560 --> 09:48.580
And then I think even just maybe like slightly above minimum would be for them to release

09:48.580 --> 09:50.000
iMessage for Android.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.760
Like that seems like that would be a fairly reasonable thing to do.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.800
I grant you there's things that could be done on both sides, but this has to be looked at

09:57.800 --> 10:02.000
from what Google could be doing to help their own users.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.380
And then we never, ever, ever hold Google accountable for that kind of stuff.

10:06.380 --> 10:10.200
With apologies to the listeners who wrote in, I definitely like feel bad if people are

10:10.200 --> 10:14.540
upset about the whole green bubble thing and they're being pushed around if they're younger,

10:14.540 --> 10:15.540
especially.

10:15.540 --> 10:19.500
But I don't know, Apple made a messaging system, right?

10:19.500 --> 10:23.200
They don't have to open it to other people if they don't want to.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.800
And they clearly don't want to.

10:25.800 --> 10:32.040
Google decided to not update their messaging app because they're Google and that's how

10:32.040 --> 10:33.040
they roll.

10:33.040 --> 10:37.480
I mean, it's great that they fixed the emoji problem, I guess.

10:37.480 --> 10:41.200
I don't see the remedy, like you said, it'd be reasonable for Apple to put iMessage on

10:41.200 --> 10:42.200
Android.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.320
I think that would be crazy.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.320
Why would they do that?

10:45.320 --> 10:47.520
Lock-in is a valid business model.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.880
I'm not saying it's a nice model, but it's certainly legal.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.980
I agree they don't have motivation, but I could see the argument that they've probably

10:54.980 --> 10:59.520
gotten most of the value out of that iMessage lock-in effect, that network effect.

10:59.520 --> 11:04.700
If you just look at the dominance and market penetration of the iPhone, which again, isn't

11:04.700 --> 11:08.920
the market leader, but they've done a good job creating a network effect.

11:08.920 --> 11:12.480
But don't you think maybe the bulk benefit of that has kind of faded now?

11:12.480 --> 11:18.200
And while it's still a benefit, it's not the strong ecosystem lock-in that it was, say,

11:18.200 --> 11:20.280
a few years ago, I would presume.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.200
You've pretty much reached everybody at this point who's going to go iPhone except for

11:23.200 --> 11:24.520
the slow trickle of switchers.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.620
Yeah, but the benefit is the moat, right?

11:27.620 --> 11:32.680
And in fact, one of the emails released in the Epic trial, the case they're talking about,

11:32.680 --> 11:37.080
they were talking about in those emails was parents who have kids that are getting them

11:37.080 --> 11:41.600
their first smartphone, getting them to buy the more expensive iPhone rather than take

11:41.600 --> 11:42.600
the carrier-free Android.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.800
And I know like with the SEs, there might be a free iPhone depending on the promotion,

11:45.800 --> 11:47.360
but usually there's not.

11:47.360 --> 11:51.240
iMessage is a big way to handle that, a big form of lock-in.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.240
That's a fair point.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.840
Yeah, it is a good moat.

11:53.840 --> 11:54.840
It's a moat, right.

11:54.840 --> 11:55.840
It's a defensive action.

11:55.840 --> 12:01.680
That, along with AirPods and Apple Watch and the App Store, they're all part of that moat.

12:01.680 --> 12:06.120
Yeah, and I guess I feel like they have enough moats that they could afford to open that

12:06.120 --> 12:11.720
up a little bit because then if you're looking at it from a services standpoint, if iMessage

12:11.720 --> 12:15.360
ever starts to play into services, you could see why they'd want to open it up a little

12:15.360 --> 12:17.640
bit like they've done with Apple TV.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.620
But until that point, you're right.

12:20.620 --> 12:26.340
There's no business motivation and Apple won't do things for their users unless it's also

12:26.340 --> 12:27.340
good for Apple.

12:27.340 --> 12:33.520
If it benefits users and it benefits Apple, they'll do it, but it has to benefit them

12:33.520 --> 12:34.520
too.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.520
I don't know.

12:35.520 --> 12:36.520
Maybe that's how you keep things sustainable.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.880
So it's a thing now.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.960
Android's rolling out iMessage reactions.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.600
Steve writes in, and I think Steve's looking for a Python niche.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.080
So I thought, okay, let's see if we can't help them out here, provide a little Coder

12:47.080 --> 12:48.080
Radio wisdom.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.080
We love answering your questions.

12:49.080 --> 12:52.120
You go to coder.show slash contact to send them in.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.600
We got a bunch of emails because I put the word out there that we wanted them.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.600
So thank you, everybody.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.600
We'll do a batch today.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.400
We'll do a batch next week.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.880
Steve says he's been in the Navy for 18 years and he's quickly approaching retirement.

13:03.880 --> 13:08.600
So he's been teaching himself Python through Udemy courses that he snagged on sale.

13:08.600 --> 13:13.680
He wants to get a decent headstart and so he's building a GitHub portfolio.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.120
But here's his main concern and his question.

13:16.120 --> 13:20.480
He wants to know what areas of technology within Python should he work on?

13:20.480 --> 13:24.800
Should he learn in order to land that first junior developer job?

13:24.800 --> 13:27.840
What kind of stuff are you looking for when you're hiring a junior Devon?

13:27.840 --> 13:30.100
I think he's looking for your insights there.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.860
He's worried about intangible soft skills.

13:32.860 --> 13:37.680
He's just basically worried about getting a bunch of book skills and then getting on

13:37.680 --> 13:40.680
the job and like, it turns out he doesn't know anything.

13:40.680 --> 13:44.100
He has to learn a whole bunch of stuff because it's a major life change.

13:44.100 --> 13:45.160
He's 41 years old.

13:45.160 --> 13:51.720
He's got a family to support and he just kind of wants to make sure he lands on his feet.

13:51.720 --> 13:55.040
So I think he's seeking your advice, your insights for what you might be looking for

13:55.040 --> 13:57.520
in a junior Dev, specifically focusing on Python.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.520
Yeah, cool.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.520
So awesome.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.520
First of all, 18 years in the Navy.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.520
That's awesome and nice work.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.240
I mean, you've got a lot of it already, right?

14:04.240 --> 14:09.480
Because, you know, if you have a GitHub and you're doing a Udemy course, that's great.

14:09.480 --> 14:14.880
I would say right now the big things and I wish maybe I should say big, but the common

14:14.880 --> 14:19.880
things that people are looking for, you know, some sort of API or web development framework

14:19.880 --> 14:23.400
like Django is big or fast API.

14:23.400 --> 14:30.880
I'm partial to that one, but Flask is certainly more popular as is Django, but really just

14:30.880 --> 14:33.880
basic knowing how the frameworks work.

14:33.880 --> 14:38.080
If you are thinking of doing a full stack web thing, Jinja or rather Jinja 2, which

14:38.080 --> 14:41.440
is the kind of templating front end engine, it's going to be important.

14:41.440 --> 14:45.360
The challenge with this question is that Python does so many things now, right?

14:45.360 --> 14:50.880
You could do like Python IoT, you could do Python TensorFlow for machine learning.

14:50.880 --> 14:54.920
I mean, hell, a bunch of, a lot of people just run their DevOps scripts in Python.

14:54.920 --> 14:59.000
So I'm assuming you mean kind of the more common case, which is like web development,

14:59.000 --> 15:00.760
server side application development.

15:00.760 --> 15:06.440
I would definitely look at, you know, understand how async code works, pick up one of the web

15:06.440 --> 15:10.320
frameworks, whether it's Django, Flask or fast API, it doesn't really matter.

15:10.320 --> 15:15.040
I'd encourage you to actually take a look at fast API.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.640
It's a little newer, a little smaller.

15:17.640 --> 15:22.120
But I, in a lot of ways, and I'm going to get some crap for this, I think it is Flask,

15:22.120 --> 15:26.400
but significantly better, kind of makes up for some of the mistakes, well, not mistakes,

15:26.400 --> 15:29.800
but some of the legacy baggage that Flask has.

15:29.800 --> 15:30.800
Inappropriate?

15:30.800 --> 15:31.800
Yeah.

15:31.800 --> 15:35.160
But a big one is going to be the Jinja 2 stuff, like I mentioned, because it doesn't matter

15:35.160 --> 15:38.240
if you're a backend developer, at some point, somebody is going to want an admin page that

15:38.240 --> 15:40.960
doesn't look like garbage.

15:40.960 --> 15:41.960
And know your tools, right?

15:41.960 --> 15:46.240
If you, you know, know how to use the debugger and VS code, that's super helpful.

15:46.240 --> 15:50.280
I'm a little excited about Fleet coming out from Jeparins, but it is not out yet.

15:50.280 --> 15:56.800
And those goddamn Russian bastards won't send me a beta invite.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.280
So I can't really recommend that.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.140
Perhaps it's because you call them bastards, comrade.

16:02.140 --> 16:07.520
Maybe it is because I file bug, bug about font scaling on Ubuntu, but he did not like

16:07.520 --> 16:08.520
this bug.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.520
We don't have bug.

16:09.520 --> 16:10.520
We have feature.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.240
And they said, it is not our fault.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.820
It is Ubuntu's fault.

16:13.820 --> 16:17.400
And they were right to their credit, and they were correct.

16:17.400 --> 16:21.080
And I understand that they're not actually from Russia, but I'm American, and if it was

16:21.080 --> 16:25.360
the Soviet Union, it still is, ooh, ooh, ooh, too soon.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.160
I don't, yeah, man, you're, you're on the right track.

16:27.160 --> 16:32.120
I would just say, don't worry, don't get like crazy about, you know, I have to know this

16:32.120 --> 16:33.120
framework.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.120
Yeah.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.760
You're going to go somewhere and buy, you know, ironically, they could be a Jeparins

16:36.760 --> 16:37.760
shop, right?

16:37.760 --> 16:42.200
They could hand you pie charm and that might just be where you, what it is and that's fine.

16:42.200 --> 16:46.640
Steve points out, you know, he's got like the, how to work in an office skill.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.480
He's got that kind of like ability.

16:49.480 --> 16:53.000
So what you're really just looking for, Steve, is a way to demonstrate your capability to

16:53.000 --> 16:55.040
learn that stuff.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.040
That's what I'd be looking for.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.840
If I were interviewing you and you were 41 years old and you had a resume that demonstrated

16:59.840 --> 17:04.560
you were a competent worker, I would assume that you had all of those kinds of soft skills

17:04.560 --> 17:07.640
and then it would really be a matter of, okay, could he get up to speed on what our stack

17:07.640 --> 17:08.840
is?

17:08.840 --> 17:12.800
Because even if you go, you go one direction and they go a different direction, or even

17:12.800 --> 17:16.920
if you happen to just pick the exact same stack that they're using, there's still going

17:16.920 --> 17:19.480
to be a lot of unique aspects to it.

17:19.480 --> 17:23.080
There's always something you'll have to learn at every job.

17:23.080 --> 17:27.160
A lot you're going to have to figure out, legacies, decisions, technical debt, that

17:27.160 --> 17:28.160
kind of stuff.

17:28.160 --> 17:32.280
So what I'd be looking for is to see if I felt like you had the ability to pick that

17:32.280 --> 17:33.280
stuff up.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.300
So that's what I think you're going to be looking for to demonstrate and I think you

17:36.300 --> 17:38.240
are on the right course.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.960
Colin wrote in, and Colin kind of is thinking along the same lines.

17:41.960 --> 17:45.040
He says, I have some college experience, so I think he's a little bit on a younger end

17:45.040 --> 17:49.240
of the spectrum, with computer science, but I never finished my degree and my primary

17:49.240 --> 17:53.220
coding experience comes from passing both my Python certified entry level programming

17:53.220 --> 17:57.760
course and the Python certified associate programmer.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.400
So here's my question, you guys.

17:59.400 --> 18:03.600
How helpful do you find these certifications when it comes towards working in everyday

18:03.600 --> 18:06.400
businesses like on a day job, day to day job?

18:06.400 --> 18:10.720
My main concern is that even though I have these certs, I'm going to start my job and

18:10.720 --> 18:13.920
find myself unprepared to do the work that they're asking of me.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.620
This is my first job professionally writing code.

18:16.620 --> 18:21.640
My primary goal is to make a good enough impression with the team and in the hopes that they'll

18:21.640 --> 18:25.480
retain me after a temporary position and I can go full time.

18:25.480 --> 18:30.680
So he's concerned, okay, I've got these certs, they're decent Python entry level programmer

18:30.680 --> 18:35.680
and Python certified associate programmer, but he's wondering, does this really mean

18:35.680 --> 18:37.680
he's ready for the day to day job?

18:37.680 --> 18:41.440
Does having this cert, learning that stuff, is he actually ready?

18:41.440 --> 18:45.840
Yeah, so I am not personally familiar with these specific certifications.

18:45.840 --> 18:51.040
I would say if the exam was challenging, then it probably does test something and that's

18:51.040 --> 18:52.600
good.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.200
The fact that you're asking if you're ready probably means that you are.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.360
I know it's an old cliche, but the Dunning-Kruger effect, right?

18:59.360 --> 19:04.040
If you're smart enough to know or you're knowledgeable enough to know there's things you're not maybe

19:04.040 --> 19:08.200
super strong in or super comfortable in, then you probably know more than you think you

19:08.200 --> 19:09.200
do.

19:09.200 --> 19:14.960
And just the fact that you presumably on your own sat down for those exams means I'm sure

19:14.960 --> 19:17.000
you would pick up whatever you need to learn.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.520
And I would almost kind of what we talked about with Steve.

19:20.520 --> 19:24.280
If you don't know how to write like a PyTest test, now's the time, right?

19:24.280 --> 19:31.080
If you don't know how to make server to server REST calls using HTTPX, I would recommend

19:31.080 --> 19:32.080
HTTPX.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.520
You got to learn the async stuff, right?

19:33.520 --> 19:35.920
That's kind of where things are going.

19:35.920 --> 19:41.280
It seems like you are in the right direction and I would not be shocked, barring reasons

19:41.280 --> 19:44.920
that your employer, if they just make you permanent.

19:44.920 --> 19:45.920
Good for you.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.640
I think he's thinking along the right lines.

19:48.640 --> 19:51.120
That's a good indication right there.

19:51.120 --> 19:56.880
Really quickly, Trader Brew and Adrian Stein wrote in via telegram asking for an update

19:56.880 --> 19:59.520
on the launch keyboard that I have since it's been a few months.

19:59.520 --> 20:03.200
I don't know if you have any thoughts, any updates on your launch keyboard over there.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.200
It's been pretty good over here.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.480
I mean, it's great.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.960
I switched to the blue keycaps.

20:06.960 --> 20:07.960
Oh, you did.

20:07.960 --> 20:08.960
Okay.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.600
We had a meet up here in the studio a couple of weeks ago and the people that came in the

20:12.600 --> 20:15.920
studio, everybody knew this was the launch keyboard.

20:15.920 --> 20:19.520
Like they all recognized it and most people said it looks better in person than it does

20:19.520 --> 20:20.520
on the website.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.520
So, there's that.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.520
I don't know.

20:22.520 --> 20:26.480
I guess people had a bad impression of the photo on the website, but they think it looks

20:26.480 --> 20:27.480
better in person.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.600
I am very, very happy with it.

20:29.600 --> 20:33.240
And if I could afford it, I'd probably have one at every computer and if they ever make

20:33.240 --> 20:35.520
a cheaper version, I'll probably pick another one of those up.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.040
I really like it a lot.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.560
It makes kind of the perfect addition to the studio.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.720
It's still great to type on.

20:41.720 --> 20:44.320
I do like also split ergonomic keyboards.

20:44.320 --> 20:48.800
So if they ever made it like a launch split, I'd probably pick that up too.

20:48.800 --> 20:49.800
Really?

20:49.800 --> 20:50.800
Yeah.

20:50.800 --> 20:51.800
Yeah.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.800
I find that helps with the RSI if I can reposition it.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.720
And the other thing I like to do with the split keyboards is I like to split them far

20:56.720 --> 21:01.080
enough that I can put like a laptop in between the keyboard or a plate.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.080
Nice.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.080
Yeah, it's great.

21:03.080 --> 21:06.320
Get a lot of keyboard action going there.

21:06.320 --> 21:11.260
So I still give it a buy, which I paid for this with my own hard earned money and I still

21:11.260 --> 21:12.960
give it a buy recommendation.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.760
The launch keyboard has been solid.

21:14.760 --> 21:20.480
It feels like a tank and continues to perform.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.960
Linode.com slash coder.

21:21.960 --> 21:25.240
Go there to get $100 on your account right now.

21:25.240 --> 21:29.280
Go there and get $100 in 60 day credit and support the show.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.800
Linode is fast and reliable cloud hosting.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.560
You got to try it for your next project.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.840
Maybe something you want to research, maybe something you want to deploy into production.

21:36.840 --> 21:37.840
It's what we use.

21:37.840 --> 21:43.840
You know, Linode has been essential actually and I love to see them doing upgrade after

21:43.840 --> 21:44.840
upgrade.

21:44.840 --> 21:49.040
Really, I thought, you know, one a year maybe is what we're going to see.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.240
No, no, they just never stop.

21:50.240 --> 21:54.520
They just literally are always rolling through the infrastructure, making improvements.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.240
My favorite right now is the PCIe MVME storage.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.740
It's a game changer for certain kinds of application.

21:59.740 --> 22:02.720
Even like our matrix server could make a huge difference.

22:02.720 --> 22:07.020
So if that's something that might be appealing to you, having really high IOPS for maybe

22:07.020 --> 22:11.900
particular application might be worth going and checking out Linode.

22:11.900 --> 22:17.280
Go talk to their support, which is great, 24-7, 365 support, phone, ticket, email, whatever

22:17.280 --> 22:18.280
you prefer.

22:18.280 --> 22:19.280
They're going to work with you.

22:19.280 --> 22:22.320
They'll even help you figure out if that MVME storage is right for you.

22:22.320 --> 22:26.200
You know, Linode is 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers that have these crazy

22:26.200 --> 22:28.280
platforms that they just want to lock you into.

22:28.280 --> 22:33.040
And when I want to try out an idea, I suppose in the past I may have gone through the hassle

22:33.040 --> 22:37.440
of doing a VM on my local machine, but that just feels silly now.

22:37.440 --> 22:41.440
I can spin up a Linode machine in seconds, especially if I'm taking advantage of the

22:41.440 --> 22:43.000
command line client.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.260
That's really the way to go.

22:44.260 --> 22:47.920
On my system, I have the Uake drop down terminal, I don't know if you remember Quake, but there's

22:47.920 --> 22:48.920
that drop down terminal.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.120
I have that on my plasma desktop.

22:51.120 --> 22:56.560
I hit the tilde key, that thing slides down, and I can fire off Linode API commands like

22:56.560 --> 22:58.960
nobody's business because I always have it in one of the tabs.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.680
I usually have several tabs and it's always there, in part because that's how we'll also

23:02.680 --> 23:05.800
toss files to each other, is we'll use Linode's object storage.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.920
Throw it up there, market public, send each other a link, it's really useful for that

23:08.920 --> 23:09.920
kind of stuff.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.560
I'll always take a snapshot on Linode before I do a major upgrade.

23:12.560 --> 23:17.280
A couple of days ago, it was time to upgrade the OS on our matrix server.

23:17.280 --> 23:21.600
And I started to go through the process and I realized, no, not a great idea, I should

23:21.600 --> 23:22.600
do a backup.

23:22.600 --> 23:27.200
So what I've done there is I'll put the Linode command line client on the Linode machine

23:27.200 --> 23:30.800
that I'm going to take care of, like that week it was the matrix server.

23:30.800 --> 23:35.680
And I'll just run it locally on that machine before I do an upgrade, and you can just have

23:35.680 --> 23:39.000
the command line client initiate snapshot process.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.440
It's so cool, I'll be like, oh, right, nope, cancel the update, run the Linode command

23:42.440 --> 23:46.640
line to initiate a snapshot, wait a few seconds, then run the upgrade, and the snapshots are

23:46.640 --> 23:47.640
super fast.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.260
They got 11 data centers around the world, so there's going to be something close to

23:50.260 --> 23:51.260
you or your clients.

23:51.260 --> 23:54.400
You know, they've been doing this for almost 19 years now.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.480
So they figured it out and they just keep getting better and better.

23:56.480 --> 24:00.380
They didn't have to take a bunch of VC funding, so they don't have like these crazy, crazy

24:00.380 --> 24:04.240
like higher goals and all this kinds of stuff, they just stay focused on building the best

24:04.240 --> 24:06.580
product and the market rewards them.

24:06.580 --> 24:09.960
Go see it for yourself, support the show, and get $100.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.440
It's linode.com slash coder.

24:12.440 --> 24:17.920
Go there to get $100 for 60 days on a new account, and support the show, linode.com

24:17.920 --> 24:22.200
slash coder.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.840
We got some crazy stuff going down in Swift town.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.240
They're integrating Objective C, oh wait, no.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.240
They already did that.

24:28.240 --> 24:32.200
Yeah, I was just going to try to trigger you somehow.

24:32.200 --> 24:38.480
But no, actually, so we're looking like a serious, serious commitment to interoperability

24:38.480 --> 24:39.660
with C++.

24:39.660 --> 24:44.680
Like the foundation is adding like a whole wing to the group to make sure that they maintain

24:44.680 --> 24:45.680
compatibility.

24:45.680 --> 24:46.680
What are your thoughts on this?

24:46.680 --> 24:48.200
This is a super pragmatic.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.280
I think it's the right thing to do.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.440
They're making an entire work group focused on this.

24:52.440 --> 25:01.600
You know, they want to import C++ APIs directly, which yeah, handle C++ standard lib types

25:01.600 --> 25:03.200
negatively.

25:03.200 --> 25:06.320
Swift is, oh my God, I'm going to throw up.

25:06.320 --> 25:07.680
Swift is a nice language.

25:07.680 --> 25:08.680
I have been writing some-

25:08.680 --> 25:09.680
I'm sorry, what was that?

25:09.680 --> 25:10.680
It's fine.

25:10.680 --> 25:11.680
It's fine.

25:11.680 --> 25:14.520
Could you imagine if I could time travel, play this clip?

25:14.520 --> 25:15.520
It's fine.

25:15.520 --> 25:19.560
You know, but you don't need to rewrite stuff.

25:19.560 --> 25:24.440
And sometimes, you know, see, I saying that, I just like blew my mind out now.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.160
I don't believe you.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.160
That's younger you.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.080
That's younger you not believing present you.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.420
You know what?

25:30.420 --> 25:33.920
It's like one of those really bad episodes of Star Trek where like old spot comes back

25:33.920 --> 25:35.760
and it's like, you all suck.

25:35.760 --> 25:36.760
Let me save the day.

25:36.760 --> 25:37.760
Yeah.

25:37.760 --> 25:43.240
Let me save you young Captain Kirk from JJ Abrams.

25:43.240 --> 25:46.760
You could static library your way to glory before, but this is just a very practical

25:46.760 --> 25:52.860
thing to do because despite what Linus will tell you, C++ is not a bad language.

25:52.860 --> 25:57.640
It is just suffering from being used for everything.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.400
And there's a lot of code written in it.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.760
And you might want to use that code, huh?

26:00.760 --> 26:06.100
If you want to join the new wing of the Swift working group, you need to be prepared to

26:06.100 --> 26:11.640
dedicate 50 minutes per week that you can use to discuss interoperability issues.

26:11.640 --> 26:15.520
And you have to actively participate in the work related to Swift and C++ interoperability.

26:15.520 --> 26:22.960
You got to either make code, write docs, review PRs, or at least provide design input if you

26:22.960 --> 26:25.740
want to have a seat in the wing.

26:25.740 --> 26:31.000
Or if you want to perhaps be less commercially successful, but more morally righteous, the

26:31.000 --> 26:32.600
new step is still around.

26:32.600 --> 26:35.400
What do you think this kind of means long-term for Swift?

26:35.400 --> 26:42.200
Like not this, but this style of decision, this pragmatic style of decision.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.920
So now let's take the time machine back, right?

26:44.920 --> 26:49.320
Apple and the Swift team, I will give them credit.

26:49.320 --> 26:52.420
How can I put this without starting a flame war?

26:52.420 --> 26:58.720
Apple said Swift would be a true open source project, and it basically is, which I'm very

26:58.720 --> 26:59.720
impressed with.

26:59.720 --> 27:00.720
Yeah.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.720
Okay.

27:01.720 --> 27:07.440
However, they certainly have failed in being significant in server development.

27:07.440 --> 27:10.960
Long time wishers will know I used to financially support the Vapor project, which is still

27:10.960 --> 27:15.640
around and still good, but commercially not super viable, at least not with the type of

27:15.640 --> 27:16.640
customers I deal with.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.480
And that was a server side, right?

27:18.480 --> 27:23.160
Server side, like a Sinatra or a Flask for Swift.

27:23.160 --> 27:30.120
IBM had a deal with Apple to make server side Swift a thing, and that was an interesting

27:30.120 --> 27:32.080
choice by both parties.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.320
That did not work out.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.280
So when you say, what does this mean for the future of Swift?

27:37.280 --> 27:40.760
Well, I think it's a very nice language to work in.

27:40.760 --> 27:49.960
If you are doing iOS or Mac development, and I don't understand why you would use it otherwise,

27:49.960 --> 27:55.000
other than, you know, I use Objective-C sometimes for things that I probably don't need to.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.120
Of course, if you like the language and it just makes you happy, sure.

27:58.120 --> 28:01.240
But from a practical perspective, no, right?

28:01.240 --> 28:05.240
Like I certainly don't think I could sell an end customer on a Swift web service or

28:05.240 --> 28:09.560
a Swift, you know, piece of server side software, unless they're A, either the type of customer

28:09.560 --> 28:11.960
who doesn't care, right?

28:11.960 --> 28:16.980
Or B, I'm not even sure I would want to do that, now that I think about it, because it's

28:16.980 --> 28:22.520
just not that huge of an ecosystem compared to, say, your Python, Ruby,.NET, Java, so

28:22.520 --> 28:23.680
on and so forth.

28:23.680 --> 28:28.940
It does seem, though, like it's a decision that a project that's operating like an autonomous

28:28.940 --> 28:31.880
open source project would make, and that's fascinating.

28:31.880 --> 28:36.600
Well, you know, for those people out there that are working that ecosystem, this is probably

28:36.600 --> 28:37.600
great for them.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.960
I will say, just like one more thing, right?

28:38.960 --> 28:44.280
If you read the Swift forums, the developers are very sincere, right?

28:44.280 --> 28:45.280
They love Swift.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.240
They care a lot about Swift, and they want to be writing Swift.

28:48.240 --> 28:52.100
So we are beyond the point where Swift is going to, like, die.

28:52.100 --> 28:58.460
You know, we joke around about my love of Objective-C. I think Swift is going to have,

28:58.460 --> 29:02.920
you know, in 10, 15 years, there is going to be a guy named Mike, not me, but a different

29:02.920 --> 29:06.960
Mike, right, who's like, oh, they're canceling, they're changing my Swift into whatever the

29:06.960 --> 29:07.960
new thing is.

29:07.960 --> 29:10.160
And he's going to be a pain in the ass about it.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.160
It's funny.

29:11.160 --> 29:16.120
We got an email that I lost, because I'm an idiot, about PHP this week.

29:16.120 --> 29:19.120
And the guy was asking me, do I really hate PHP?

29:19.120 --> 29:22.520
I apologize that I don't remember your name, because I somehow, I don't know what I did

29:22.520 --> 29:23.720
to the email.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.980
Most of that's trolling, right?

29:24.980 --> 29:30.400
But PHP at the time, let's say the early aughts, was basically a dumpster fire because of the

29:30.400 --> 29:31.880
type of people writing it.

29:31.880 --> 29:35.800
It was always, and I was working in startup land, so it was, you know, hackity hack, hack,

29:35.800 --> 29:36.800
hack.

29:36.800 --> 29:37.800
You know, but it's matured, right?

29:37.800 --> 29:38.800
It still exists.

29:38.800 --> 29:39.800
Laravel's gotten really good.

29:39.800 --> 29:44.600
Facebook, the evil, evil Facebook, has done a lot to make PHP better via the hip hop DM

29:44.600 --> 29:46.500
and other things.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.440
That's kind of what Swift is like.

29:48.440 --> 29:51.600
There are passionate PHP open source developers.

29:51.600 --> 29:54.080
There is a big company supporting PHP.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.880
I mean, PHP is a little bigger than Swift, right?

29:55.880 --> 29:56.880
A lot bigger.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.680
I'm going to tell you right now, anybody who still thinks Apple's going to change their

30:00.680 --> 30:03.320
mind on Swift is smoking crack.

30:03.320 --> 30:04.320
The fight's over.

30:04.320 --> 30:09.800
But it doesn't mean that Swift is just an Apple language.

30:09.800 --> 30:15.480
If you enjoy writing it, you can certainly write command line applications for Unix.

30:15.480 --> 30:19.920
I think they actually have Windows support, although I don't know why you would do that.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.440
You could write server side applications.

30:21.440 --> 30:25.920
It's just, again, it would be like me trying to sell someone on like an Objective C web

30:25.920 --> 30:26.920
service.

30:26.920 --> 30:27.920
You could do it.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.760
I don't know who's buying that that knows they're buying it.

30:30.760 --> 30:31.760
Yeah, right.

30:31.760 --> 30:32.760
So more power to them.

30:32.760 --> 30:33.760
I say good.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.960
I'm glad they're actually thinking this way.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.400
Well, speaking of Facebook, also known as Metta, not while I'm alive, boy, they had

30:39.400 --> 30:40.400
a rough week.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.680
Oh, my gosh.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.000
Did you did you see their stock last week?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.580
Did I see they dropped like their crypto is what it was.

30:46.580 --> 30:48.120
That's oh, my God.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.720
Let me explain to you what happened.

30:49.720 --> 30:50.720
I saw it.

30:50.720 --> 30:51.720
I took off my shirt.

30:51.720 --> 30:52.720
I whipped out the Vaseline.

30:52.720 --> 30:53.720
Never mind.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.380
Where were we going with this?

30:55.380 --> 30:57.040
You always have as nearby.

30:57.040 --> 31:02.320
Here's my theory on Facebook is they announced in their earnings report that Apple's iOS

31:02.320 --> 31:07.240
privacy change with, you know, the first party tracking stuff.

31:07.240 --> 31:12.520
It's going to cost Facebook ten billion dollars in 2022.

31:12.520 --> 31:15.400
On top of that, a ten billion dollars.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.800
So that tells you right there.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.160
That's how much your information is worth.

31:20.160 --> 31:24.440
If you're an iOS user to Facebook, all of y'all ten billion dollars.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.240
So it's a big market.

31:26.240 --> 31:31.840
And then at the same time, they also announced that they blew ten billion dollars trying

31:31.840 --> 31:35.200
to build the metaverse so far seems awfully fast.

31:35.200 --> 31:36.480
That's rough, man.

31:36.480 --> 31:40.720
That's well, that also includes like new Oculus headset development and stuff like that.

31:40.720 --> 31:41.720
So I guess.

31:41.720 --> 31:42.720
OK, hardware is expensive.

31:42.720 --> 31:43.720
Yeah.

31:43.720 --> 31:44.720
Yeah.

31:44.720 --> 31:49.840
But still, Wall Street sees you blew ten billion on on this and you're going to lose ten billion

31:49.840 --> 31:51.920
on that.

31:51.920 --> 31:57.080
And your and your new user signups are down.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.680
Stock price crashes.

31:58.680 --> 32:03.040
And I think it's just as simple as that is this is why I think they're so desperate on

32:03.040 --> 32:09.520
this whole meta angle is they know that their Facebook ad revenue is going to go down.

32:09.520 --> 32:14.040
They're at war with every major legacy media company that's ever existed over it.

32:14.040 --> 32:16.640
And you know, one major political party in the United States.

32:16.640 --> 32:21.080
But hey, whatever they took it on the nose so bad over the elections.

32:21.080 --> 32:25.320
Go Google how much money actually was spent on on ads on Facebook for the election.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.320
It's fascinating.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.600
It's a bit of a straw man.

32:27.600 --> 32:31.120
But you know, so this just that's rough.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.800
So you and I had like a disagreement here.

32:32.800 --> 32:33.800
Yeah.

32:33.800 --> 32:38.460
I mean, I'm not saying they're committing accounting fraud because they're not right.

32:38.460 --> 32:41.020
But remember my space barely?

32:41.020 --> 32:43.200
Is this not just the way of things?

32:43.200 --> 32:45.240
Because like, I'm a dad, you're a dad.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.000
We're both pretty boring now.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.280
Maybe I'm speaking out of turn, but I'm pretty boring.

32:49.280 --> 32:50.280
Yeah.

32:50.280 --> 32:54.560
You know, my primarily use Facebook because one, if you have a business and you don't

32:54.560 --> 32:59.360
have a Facebook, weird local business organizations think you're not real, which is a whole nother

32:59.360 --> 33:00.360
problem.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.360
Yep.

33:01.360 --> 33:06.840
But basically, to share pictures of my son with my aunties back in New Jersey, ironically,

33:06.840 --> 33:11.660
the green bubble problem did hit me several times, but a picture wouldn't load correctly

33:11.660 --> 33:14.160
to the to like the two ants that have Android.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.200
Oh, it comes home.

33:16.200 --> 33:19.480
I once offered to buy one of them an iPhone just so I could avoid that problem.

33:19.480 --> 33:23.320
So maybe I should back down on the green bubble thing.

33:23.320 --> 33:26.160
I don't know, like, you know what?

33:26.160 --> 33:30.560
I'm aware of teenagers when lives in my house.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.400
They don't use Facebook.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.320
They use what's the Chinese one?

33:34.320 --> 33:35.320
Oh, yeah.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.240
The tick tock, tick tock, right.

33:37.240 --> 33:41.960
And Snapchat, which I honestly thought was out of business.

33:41.960 --> 33:42.960
It is tick tock.

33:42.960 --> 33:43.960
It's tick tock, right?

33:43.960 --> 33:46.040
That's the that's the one where they're always dancing and crap, right?

33:46.040 --> 33:47.040
Yeah.

33:47.040 --> 33:51.360
And Zuckerberg, I think I guess it had an all hands meeting and they he instructed the

33:51.360 --> 33:56.520
team a whole whole wide company like your all of company focus should be on quick video

33:56.520 --> 34:01.520
because tech talks eating us alive and that seems like a super sound decision for him

34:01.520 --> 34:02.520
to make.

34:02.520 --> 34:03.520
Right.

34:03.520 --> 34:04.520
Like, I don't know.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.800
I feel like this is kind of the cycle we've seen of these platforms.

34:06.800 --> 34:09.160
I mean, LiveJournal was a thing back in the day.

34:09.160 --> 34:13.720
Tumblr was until Yahoo bought it because Yahoo is cursed by the pharaohs to never be successful

34:13.720 --> 34:14.720
at anything.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.120
So you have to sell yourself to Verizon.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.180
You know what it is, because they made the deal with those early BSD guys.

34:19.180 --> 34:20.180
The devil.

34:20.180 --> 34:21.180
Yes.

34:21.180 --> 34:22.180
Right.

34:22.180 --> 34:23.180
I wish we could.

34:23.180 --> 34:31.160
OK, our younger listeners, let's say if you're below 25, 30, are you using Facebook to share

34:31.160 --> 34:36.000
content or consume content with your peer group?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.400
I'm not talking about aunties.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.400
I'm not right.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.400
I'm talking about.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.480
Hey, bro, let's go chug some.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.100
I don't know how kids talk today.

34:43.100 --> 34:46.320
They have to have a Facebook account if they want to log into their Oculus.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.320
Oh, really?

34:47.320 --> 34:48.320
Do you really?

34:48.320 --> 34:49.320
Yeah.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.320
Yeah.

34:50.320 --> 34:53.280
If you want to get hooked to a fake, you got to have a Facebook account to use the Oculus.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.360
That's one way to juice numbers, I guess.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.360
I know.

34:56.360 --> 35:00.800
And their numbers are still down, even though the Oculus had like its best year ever.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.320
I feel like that makes it worse.

35:02.320 --> 35:03.880
It does, dude.

35:03.880 --> 35:04.880
It's rough, man.

35:04.880 --> 35:05.880
All right.

35:05.880 --> 35:06.880
So I don't know.

35:06.880 --> 35:07.880
I'm being long winded.

35:07.880 --> 35:10.200
But I feel like this is just the natural cycle and Facebook's not cool for the kids anymore.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.200
You're right.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.440
The only thing that's different here is that people pretend to like that Facebook wasn't

35:13.440 --> 35:15.200
going to be part of the cycle.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.780
Like, I guess they just figured it's going to be king forever and not that it's dying,

35:18.780 --> 35:22.440
but I'm sure it is natural for something else like TikTok to come along.

35:22.440 --> 35:25.320
I just want to say one more thing, right?

35:25.320 --> 35:30.280
On Facebook, the content that gets serviced to me the most is liberal auntie and Trumpy

35:30.280 --> 35:36.160
auntie going at it because that's like all Facebook is.

35:36.160 --> 35:40.600
My relatives my age or older just yelling at each other.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.480
One's got her MSNBC clip ready.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.920
One's got her Fox News.

35:45.920 --> 35:50.480
You know, for me, it's actually been so it's been so liberating when I go see family and

35:50.480 --> 35:53.800
they tell me about something and I can always just say, you know, I don't use Facebook.

35:53.800 --> 35:54.800
So I didn't see that.

35:54.800 --> 35:55.800
I'm sorry.

35:55.800 --> 35:56.800
Oh, it's so great.

35:56.800 --> 35:57.800
It's like a superpower.

35:57.800 --> 36:02.560
I'm so jealous right now.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.360

37:14.200 --> 37:20.600
Speaking of Apple, bane of Facebook's existence, they have put the details out there for this

37:20.600 --> 37:23.000
dating app situation in the Netherlands.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.960
So it looks like after you pay 3% to your payment processor, if you're lucky, it's low

37:26.960 --> 37:27.960
at 3%.

37:27.960 --> 37:34.640
You're lucky for 3% and you pay 27% to Apple, which you still have to pay, you're right

37:34.640 --> 37:38.680
back at 30% buddy.

37:38.680 --> 37:39.680
Yeah.

37:39.680 --> 37:44.920
Only to punish you, Apple forces you to create a separate app that's only available in the

37:44.920 --> 37:45.920
Netherlands.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.680
It cannot also do any in app purchases.

37:48.680 --> 37:51.080
It must display a scary sheet.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.080
It's bad.

37:52.080 --> 37:58.720
That says that this isn't using Apple's secure system and it also restricts how you can link

37:58.720 --> 38:04.340
out to your website, even though that's always been a problem and you have to submit monthly

38:04.340 --> 38:08.200
reports to Apple on every external transaction.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.980
And that is my favorite.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.960
And they have the right to audit you.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.680
So Apple is the IRS now too.

38:13.680 --> 38:14.680
Well, it's the EU.

38:14.680 --> 38:17.680
By the way, you know who actually wrote the Apple policy for this?

38:17.680 --> 38:19.620
Oh no, I don't.

38:19.620 --> 38:23.040
They contracted out to Victoria Nuland.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.040
You got her.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.040
I get her every time.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.040
That's amazing.

38:26.040 --> 38:31.680
Do you have it like on a sticky note, like on your screen or something, or are you just

38:31.680 --> 38:32.680
remembering?

38:32.680 --> 38:33.680
Wow.

38:33.680 --> 38:38.920
Any time my kid does something stupid, I just put on my headphones, my AirPod Max, because

38:38.920 --> 38:43.480
I pay my Apple tax and I listen to a glorious clip that somebody sent me.

38:43.480 --> 38:44.960
Somebody will not be named.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.880
Man, that's amazing.

38:46.880 --> 38:49.480
The commission that's like doing this is called the ACM.

38:49.480 --> 38:54.360
They said they're going to continue to find Apple five million euros per week up to a

38:54.360 --> 38:55.880
maximum of 50 million.

38:55.880 --> 38:58.400
That's less than they spend on vodka for lunch, but keep going.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.400
Yeah.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.520
I mean, if it's only going to go up to 50, why would Apple even bother?

39:01.520 --> 39:02.520
Just pay the 50.

39:02.520 --> 39:08.480
I mean, I feel like it's not even a fine if it's just kind of a tax at this point.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.000
Apple's so rich they don't care.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Okay.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Did you did the page?

39:12.000 --> 39:14.520
Yeah, the little tear sheet that make you put up.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.840
I know this is an audio show.

39:16.840 --> 39:22.640
If you're driving when you get home or to work, wherever you're going, you have to read

39:22.640 --> 39:25.680
the page and the tear sheet that make you put up.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.360
It's horrible.

39:27.360 --> 39:31.440
This app does not support the app store's private and secure payment system, implying

39:31.440 --> 39:34.720
that your app is not private or secure.

39:34.720 --> 39:39.880
I mean, it's like they just threw the finger up and we're like, here you go.

39:39.880 --> 39:40.880
I don't know.

39:40.880 --> 39:41.880
I love this.

39:41.880 --> 39:48.200
The thing I like about this is because I'm a Twitter troll and I really enjoy I don't

39:48.200 --> 39:51.640
know if you've been paying attention, but all the Apple fanboys heads are exploding

39:51.640 --> 39:56.880
because they just realized that while Apple is super happy to put up like the disadvantaged

39:56.880 --> 40:02.080
people who made an iPhone app and got out of poverty, they're really just a company

40:02.080 --> 40:05.080
trying to make lots of money.

40:05.080 --> 40:06.080
I'm for that.

40:06.080 --> 40:07.080
I think that's okay.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.080
Yeah.

40:08.080 --> 40:12.620
I just don't like the hypocrisy of being like, oh, look at all the different peoples and

40:12.620 --> 40:14.960
oh my God, this kid made an app.

40:14.960 --> 40:20.480
The whole video section of WWDC where they play that heartwarming intro video.

40:20.480 --> 40:24.560
Let's get rid of that and show me your goddamn, I don't think it's called the K1 if they're

40:24.560 --> 40:26.400
a C-corp, but whatever.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.800
I want to see a PNL, right?

40:28.800 --> 40:29.800
That's what I want.

40:29.800 --> 40:30.800
Yeah.

40:30.800 --> 40:34.960
But like kids running in the field during golden hour makes me feel great about Apple.

40:34.960 --> 40:35.960
Come on.

40:35.960 --> 40:36.960
If you're stupid.

40:36.960 --> 40:37.960
I don't know.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.440
This is so great.

40:39.440 --> 40:43.080
When you go through the documentation and we'll have a link to the support page at Apple's

40:43.080 --> 40:51.040
website where you can read about this, when you go through it all, it just reeks with

40:51.040 --> 40:53.160
disdain for having to even do this.

40:53.160 --> 41:00.560
Apple just clearly is dragging their feet and they are making it as painful as possible.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.840
They are being vindictive.

41:01.840 --> 41:06.880
They are a nearly $2 trillion company that is being petulant.

41:06.880 --> 41:07.880
I love it.

41:07.880 --> 41:08.880
Over this.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.800
I'm here for it.

41:10.800 --> 41:11.800
This is the right response.

41:11.800 --> 41:17.320
In fact, this is, I mean, people say that Apple went downhill from Steve Jobs.

41:17.320 --> 41:20.120
This is restrained from what he would have done.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.120
That's true.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.120
Yeah.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.480
Is that the Netherlands?

41:23.480 --> 41:24.480
Is that like a state?

41:24.480 --> 41:26.560
I just feel like I don't care.

41:26.560 --> 41:33.520
You know, I have to say in the last couple of months I have noticed Microsoft and Apple

41:33.520 --> 41:35.760
are getting very aggressive again.

41:35.760 --> 41:41.300
Like it came out that Microsoft been like the puppet master behind Epic secretly backing

41:41.300 --> 41:42.800
people to sue Apple.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.800
Yeah.

41:43.800 --> 41:48.040
And Microsoft playing hard licensing games in other countries like that don't speak English

41:48.040 --> 41:51.180
natively so it doesn't get reported on a lot, but they're over there playing hardball right

41:51.180 --> 41:52.840
now in a way they haven't done in years.

41:52.840 --> 41:57.820
There's a lot going on these days that these, these sleeping giants really feel like they're

41:57.820 --> 42:00.520
waking up and starting to throw their weight around.

42:00.520 --> 42:02.880
There's almost a weird generational story here, right?

42:02.880 --> 42:08.080
Where Apple just kneecap the Facebook, right?

42:08.080 --> 42:09.080
And it's back.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.080
You know what?

42:10.080 --> 42:14.320
Uncle Tim and uncle Satya have been calm for a little while.

42:14.320 --> 42:16.000
Now they're not playing anymore.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.160
Google continues to cancel services like it's going out of style.

42:20.160 --> 42:24.280
I mean, I feel like Microsoft, we're, we're going back to the nineties, right?

42:24.280 --> 42:27.080
Microsoft and Apple are just going to be the big dogs.

42:27.080 --> 42:29.800
Speaking of Google, you knew it was coming.

42:29.800 --> 42:32.240
It still hurts for me to say it though.

42:32.240 --> 42:37.300
It looks like Google is starting to wrap up Stadia, at least the consumer facing part

42:37.300 --> 42:38.320
of it.

42:38.320 --> 42:43.280
This has been reported everywhere, but a new report claims that Google is trying to salvage

42:43.280 --> 42:49.400
what's left of Stadia by not focusing on consumer video games, but instead looking to make deals

42:49.400 --> 42:54.920
with companies like Peloton to create quote, playable experiences and quote, online demos.

42:54.920 --> 42:55.920
Sure.

42:55.920 --> 42:56.920
That's not going to work.

42:56.920 --> 43:03.320
And according to the report, it's like a small crew of people that don't have a lot of power

43:03.320 --> 43:08.480
inside Google that are scrambling every day to keep it available to consumers, to keep

43:08.480 --> 43:09.760
it going.

43:09.760 --> 43:13.340
They say, quote, there are folks who still believe in the dream of playing stuff like

43:13.340 --> 43:16.180
cyberpunk 2077 on your phone.

43:16.180 --> 43:21.240
But one person who spoke to Business Insider estimated that only 20% of the focus now is

43:21.240 --> 43:23.260
on the gaming side of Stadia.

43:23.260 --> 43:27.360
But do you know who really does believe you should be able to play cyberpunk on your phone?

43:27.360 --> 43:28.360
Who?

43:28.360 --> 43:29.360
Microsoft.

43:29.360 --> 43:30.360
That's true.

43:30.360 --> 43:31.360
Go to Microsoft.

43:31.360 --> 43:32.360
What are you guys doing?

43:32.360 --> 43:33.360
Yeah.

43:33.360 --> 43:36.120
I mean, as a Linux user, the thing I liked about Stadia is that it's all Linux on the

43:36.120 --> 43:37.120
back end.

43:37.120 --> 43:40.600
So for the game developers to use Stadia, their game needed to work on Linux.

43:40.600 --> 43:41.600
So was Azure.

43:41.600 --> 43:42.600
I don't know though.

43:42.600 --> 43:44.040
The Xbox ones, I don't know what they're using.

43:44.040 --> 43:45.040
I don't know.

43:45.040 --> 43:46.360
I mean, bitch, it's a hodgepodge.

43:46.360 --> 43:47.360
I bet you it's Windows.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.360
Yeah, I bet.

43:48.360 --> 43:51.560
I mean, I could even see they have some Xbox boards or something, right?

43:51.560 --> 43:52.560
Something sitting on a rack.

43:52.560 --> 43:53.560
Yeah, why not?

43:53.560 --> 43:54.560
Why not just rack them up?

43:54.560 --> 43:55.560
True.

43:55.560 --> 43:56.560
Yeah.

43:56.560 --> 43:57.560
I mean, you're right.

43:57.560 --> 44:01.880
Google is, just as Microsoft is getting its game together, as we've just seen with the

44:01.880 --> 44:06.880
acquisition of Blizzard Activision, Microsoft is really getting their streaming game.

44:06.880 --> 44:08.240
They have so many titles.

44:08.240 --> 44:13.240
They are so the Disney Plus now of video game streaming, but they haven't executed yet.

44:13.240 --> 44:14.840
They haven't brought it all together.

44:14.840 --> 44:17.480
And there's no guarantee Microsoft will.

44:17.480 --> 44:21.440
They have good momentum, but they screw this kind of stuff up all the time.

44:21.440 --> 44:22.440
I don't know, man.

44:22.440 --> 44:27.300
I just was playing Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, which is a slave's flattery to the classic

44:27.300 --> 44:29.680
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 from the arcade.

44:29.680 --> 44:30.680
In their stream setup?

44:30.680 --> 44:32.240
Yeah, in Chrome on my Mac.

44:32.240 --> 44:33.240
Oh, okay.

44:33.240 --> 44:37.720
You know, I got stuck on a very, very dumb recursion bug that I definitely didn't write

44:37.720 --> 44:38.720
myself.

44:38.720 --> 44:41.680
Yeah, it was me.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.400
And I just popped open Chrome.

44:43.400 --> 44:48.440
I can do it in Safari, but it seems to work better in Chrome for reasons.

44:48.440 --> 44:55.400
Plugged in an Xbox 360 controller that I still have because, yay, wired is easier than Bluetooth.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.600
And yeah, I played a couple rounds.

44:57.600 --> 45:01.560
It was, I mean, I mean, I don't know why we're doing game reviews now, but we are.

45:01.560 --> 45:05.880
I feel like the old version was better, but it has nothing to do with the streaming service,

45:05.880 --> 45:06.880
right?

45:06.880 --> 45:10.920
It's a fighting game, which requires pretty good latency.

45:10.920 --> 45:17.480
Granted, I do have Fios, so that might make this a bit easier for a lot of folks listening.

45:17.480 --> 45:21.280
So like you, I pre-ordered the Steam Deck, and I'm wondering why I'm spending another

45:21.280 --> 45:23.200
like $500, $600.

45:23.200 --> 45:28.480
The thing about the streaming service is they, I feel like they still have a lot of skepticism,

45:28.480 --> 45:29.480
but I've been really happy.

45:29.480 --> 45:30.480
I've tried Stadia.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.720
I've tried GeForce streaming now.

45:32.720 --> 45:36.800
And I did try the Microsoft one, but when I signed up for the beta, they didn't yet

45:36.800 --> 45:39.140
have web browser streaming yet.

45:39.140 --> 45:40.600
So I didn't get to try that.

45:40.600 --> 45:42.160
It's funny.

45:42.160 --> 45:47.800
So the one weakness is Microsoft accounts are just as dumb as Google accounts.

45:47.800 --> 45:52.640
And I have to have like an instance of Chrome that is only my, that Microsoft account, because

45:52.640 --> 45:54.600
my personal is my gaming one.

45:54.600 --> 45:55.600
But I don't know, man.

45:55.600 --> 46:03.280
I think, I feel like this is in fact the future if the FCC can ever get, you know, fiber optics

46:03.280 --> 46:04.280
everywhere.

46:04.280 --> 46:05.640
Well, you can actually do it over Starlink.

46:05.640 --> 46:07.640
I've done this game streaming over Starlink.

46:07.640 --> 46:08.960
How much does that cost?

46:08.960 --> 46:10.720
Starlink is 99 bucks a month.

46:10.720 --> 46:11.720
That's not horrible.

46:11.720 --> 46:12.720
No.

46:12.720 --> 46:13.720
And I'm getting like 200 megabits.

46:13.720 --> 46:14.720
It's not bad.

46:14.720 --> 46:15.720
Ooh, really?

46:15.720 --> 46:16.720
Yeah.

46:16.720 --> 46:20.520
The trick is if you have any obstructions, then your latency and your connection goes

46:20.520 --> 46:22.760
down and then it's not so great.

46:22.760 --> 46:26.960
What if you live in basically a prehistoric landscape?

46:26.960 --> 46:29.560
Do you have a clear shot to the sky?

46:29.560 --> 46:31.360
When the pterodactyls aren't flying?

46:31.360 --> 46:32.360
Yes.

46:32.360 --> 46:38.440
In fact, they just announced Starlink Pro, which is fricking 550 bucks a month, but you

46:38.440 --> 46:43.720
get 500 megabits down and even lower latency because it's a dish with even more points

46:43.720 --> 46:44.720
of contact.

46:44.720 --> 46:45.720
It's a dish?

46:45.720 --> 46:46.720
Starlink, yeah.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.920
It connects up to their low orbit satellites.

46:48.920 --> 46:51.680
So we have a R&D budget, right?

46:51.680 --> 46:52.680
Right.

46:52.680 --> 46:53.680
Of course.

46:53.680 --> 46:54.680
Of course.

46:54.680 --> 46:55.680
I need two different connections.

46:55.680 --> 46:58.800
I mean, so far we've just been spending it on these crypto developers who are supposedly

46:58.800 --> 47:02.280
billing us a cryptocurrency, but I don't know, it's been two years and they haven't released

47:02.280 --> 47:03.280
anything yet.

47:03.280 --> 47:05.440
By the way, where is my Jar Jar NFT people?

47:05.440 --> 47:06.440
I know.

47:06.440 --> 47:07.440
I know.

47:07.440 --> 47:10.520
I know you guys, but nothing and smoke and mirrors.

47:10.520 --> 47:11.920
So you were a Stadia user.

47:11.920 --> 47:15.120
Are you going to jump ship to xCloud or whatever it's called?

47:15.120 --> 47:16.120
I think so.

47:16.120 --> 47:19.880
After seeing this, I, you know, and I, you always knew it was sad, too.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.240
And this is a real problem, I think, for Google.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.440
When they launched it, I knew they were going to kill it.

47:24.440 --> 47:25.440
Google Wave.

47:25.440 --> 47:26.440
Yep.

47:26.440 --> 47:27.440
You knew they're going to wave it.

47:27.440 --> 47:32.120
And I only bought one game and I bought that game when I got a gift card.

47:32.120 --> 47:33.120
Oh, that's right.

47:33.120 --> 47:35.240
Oh, God, you had to buy the games.

47:35.240 --> 47:37.000
Oh, it sucks.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.520
And who's going to who's going to go buy $60 games a pop when, you know, Google is just

47:40.520 --> 47:42.640
going to kill this thing.

47:42.640 --> 47:46.260
So I'd never really invested in it, even though I think it is the best of the experiences

47:46.260 --> 47:47.260
so far.

47:47.260 --> 47:53.680
I think you should download edge because apparently it's better and give give the xCloud a shot.

47:53.680 --> 47:54.680
I've been meaning to.

47:54.680 --> 47:55.680
So I will.

47:55.680 --> 48:00.000
Yeah, I was just sad to see it go because I loved the idea that game developers were,

48:00.000 --> 48:04.080
you know, it was one more pressure point to get game developers to get their games working

48:04.080 --> 48:05.080
on Linux.

48:05.080 --> 48:10.640
Ultimately, what I love about these streaming services is I can just stop caring about the

48:10.640 --> 48:13.560
GPU in my hardware, in my laptop or in my desktop.

48:13.560 --> 48:18.120
I mean, I still like having it in a desktop, but in a laptop, you don't have to make that

48:18.120 --> 48:24.600
decision of do I want to compromise battery life and and heat, but have a GPU?

48:24.600 --> 48:29.360
Or do I want to have good battery life and low heat, but never be able to game like that's

48:29.360 --> 48:31.560
just or like, do I want to get a Mac?

48:31.560 --> 48:38.080
But there's no games for the M1 platform except for the arcade, like now that just totally

48:38.080 --> 48:42.840
abstracts that whole decision, your platform, your architecture, it's all abstracted away

48:42.840 --> 48:47.540
and you just stream the game from Microsoft's servers and they will be upgrading GPUs for

48:47.540 --> 48:50.160
years and you don't have to worry about it.

48:50.160 --> 48:54.180
Microsoft is not getting a lot of fanfare for this, but I actually just tried it this

48:54.180 --> 49:01.600
week streaming a Windows desktop via Azure is significantly better than the alternatives.

49:01.600 --> 49:04.860
Yeah, because they're probably using RDP, right, which is pretty robust.

49:04.860 --> 49:08.760
I have no idea what they're using and they have little presets.

49:08.760 --> 49:14.520
I had a visual studio set up, I had to install my own weird libraries, but I was rocking

49:14.520 --> 49:18.280
in the free world and you can pay more or less depending on what you need.

49:18.280 --> 49:22.780
But yeah, interesting if you're if you're living that M1 life and you need Windows for

49:22.780 --> 49:25.720
stuff as I do, that's something.

49:25.720 --> 49:31.720
The other streaming thing is we do a lot of negativity on indie development on the show

49:31.720 --> 49:33.720
instead of love.

49:33.720 --> 49:38.260
Indie devs are like, I feel like I'm that last Japanese soldier who didn't realize the

49:38.260 --> 49:41.340
war was lost, kind of crying.

49:41.340 --> 49:44.640
It's me and the rogue Amoeba dude and you to a point.

49:44.640 --> 49:45.640
Indie game development.

49:45.640 --> 49:50.200
I mean, eventually it's going to be bad because we're consolidating everything, but look at

49:50.200 --> 49:54.400
what's happened to independent film production, particularly documentary production because

49:54.400 --> 49:59.240
of Netflix and Disney Plus and other services who are smaller, right?

49:59.240 --> 50:00.240
Right.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.240
What has happened?

50:01.240 --> 50:05.760
There is so much more opportunity to produce more films for smaller budgets, but with smaller

50:05.760 --> 50:12.520
scopes and for unknown actors, for unknown directors, unknown playwrights, or I'm sorry,

50:12.520 --> 50:13.520
screen playwrights.

50:13.520 --> 50:14.520
Right, right.

50:14.520 --> 50:17.240
So you could say the same for YouTube and podcasting as well, but I see what you're

50:17.240 --> 50:22.680
saying like Netflix flip, flips the bill or fits what's what Netflix flips the bill fits

50:22.680 --> 50:23.680
the bill.

50:23.680 --> 50:24.680
What's that?

50:24.680 --> 50:25.680
I think it's fits, fits the bill, but I write the checks.

50:25.680 --> 50:26.680
Yeah.

50:26.680 --> 50:27.680
I would argue one podcasting.

50:27.680 --> 50:31.040
I don't even want to touch the Spotify thing cause I don't know what the hell they're doing,

50:31.040 --> 50:35.600
but I feel like the YouTube is, is like the bad version of this though.

50:35.600 --> 50:36.600
Right?

50:36.600 --> 50:39.360
Like I don't know anybody who does YouTube creation that doesn't feel like they're in

50:39.360 --> 50:41.880
a horrible abusive relationship with YouTube.

50:41.880 --> 50:42.880
Yeah.

50:42.880 --> 50:45.160
And if you are someone who likes it, tell me.

50:45.160 --> 50:46.720
No, they're not out there.

50:46.720 --> 50:47.720
They're not.

50:47.720 --> 50:48.720
I don't think they exist.

50:48.720 --> 50:49.720
No, it's a machine.

50:49.720 --> 50:50.720
Right.

50:50.720 --> 50:51.960
And I sponsor people who do YouTube stuff.

50:51.960 --> 50:57.680
So I, and just based on like how willing, how easy it is to buy sponsorships, by the

50:57.680 --> 51:02.520
way, if you own a small business, forget about Facebook, find some independent creators that

51:02.520 --> 51:07.600
talk to people that you want to talk to you like Jupiter broadcasting, buy some ads, seriously.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.160
It's the way to go.

51:09.160 --> 51:13.000
I've never been more bullish on indie game development.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.280
Now I'm, I'm actually writing a game myself.

51:16.280 --> 51:17.840
I call it Newlands quest.

51:17.840 --> 51:19.400
Oh my gosh.

51:19.400 --> 51:20.400
Really?

51:20.400 --> 51:21.400
This looks exciting.

51:21.400 --> 51:23.040
I got the perfect intro song for you too.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.040
I bet you do.

51:24.040 --> 51:25.040
There you go.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.040
You just play that in there, you know?

51:26.040 --> 51:27.040
Yeah.

51:27.040 --> 51:43.800
And you know, I've got a great voiceover from Nigel Farage, weirdly not available in the

51:43.800 --> 51:44.800
EU.

51:44.800 --> 51:50.400
But kidding aside, seriously, if you are thinking of making an indie game, and I know that iPad

51:50.400 --> 51:54.460
money is, is, is, is the, is tempting as hell.

51:54.460 --> 51:55.460
Think about it.

51:55.460 --> 51:59.560
Just think about what if you thought about Linux as a native platform that your game

51:59.560 --> 52:04.720
ran on, not to be installed as an RPM or a Deb, Debian package, right?

52:04.720 --> 52:11.300
To run in a cloud environment, I Azure or whatever the Amazon Luna, is it, they call

52:11.300 --> 52:12.300
it Luna?

52:12.300 --> 52:13.300
Yes.

52:13.300 --> 52:14.300
I think you're right.

52:14.300 --> 52:22.040
Because that's, you know what, you hit, you target one platform really well and you're

52:22.040 --> 52:23.040
everywhere.

52:23.040 --> 52:24.600
I mean, I've, I've even done the experiment.

52:24.600 --> 52:29.360
I think there's problems with it, but I've taken my iPad, Bluetooth it in a controller

52:29.360 --> 52:30.880
and played X cloud on that.

52:30.880 --> 52:33.680
I did that with the G force now streaming.

52:33.680 --> 52:34.680
It does work pretty good.

52:34.680 --> 52:35.680
Well, all right.

52:35.680 --> 52:37.560
Should we stop talking about gaming now?

52:37.560 --> 52:38.560
Yes.

52:38.560 --> 52:39.560
With apologies to Brussels.

52:39.560 --> 52:43.000
Also, I want to mention that Coderly is out for our members.

52:43.000 --> 52:48.960
So if you are a member at coderqa.co or at Jupiter.party, the Coderly report is out.

52:48.960 --> 52:49.960
It's just in your feeds.

52:49.960 --> 52:53.360
It's also available in the members download area if you want to log in and just grab it

52:53.360 --> 52:54.580
that way.

52:54.580 --> 52:57.520
But if you become a member and subscribe to one of our member feeds, you get it.

52:57.520 --> 53:02.240
Plus, you also get every episode of Coder Radio ad free and you're supporting the show.

53:02.240 --> 53:05.600
So thank you to our members out there, Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send

53:05.600 --> 53:06.600
the people this week?

53:06.600 --> 53:07.600
Yeah, sure.

53:07.600 --> 53:13.000
My name is Dominic M.com and if you are a Python developer in Florida, you should call

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
me.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
Nice.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
Nice.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.600
The secret, the superpower, superpower right there.

53:17.600 --> 53:19.440
You just got to figure out how to track them down.

53:19.440 --> 53:22.280
But we always, of course, have links in the show notes.

53:22.280 --> 53:24.620
I'm on the Twitter too at Chris LAS.

53:24.620 --> 53:30.160
We also have the telegram group for the network at Jupiter broadcasting.com telegram.

53:30.160 --> 53:35.040
And in fact, there is even a Coder Radio feedback matrix chat.

53:35.040 --> 53:36.040
God, there is.

53:36.040 --> 53:37.040
Yeah.

53:37.040 --> 53:39.720
It's super big, but I'm starting to watch it so that way if somebody leaves something

53:39.720 --> 53:42.240
in there, I can, you know, loop it into the show for us.

53:42.240 --> 53:44.200
Got my eyes on it.

53:44.200 --> 53:45.200
That's over there, too.

53:45.200 --> 53:46.560
We'd love to have you join us live.

53:46.560 --> 53:51.440
We do the show Monday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern, and then it's usually out for download

53:51.440 --> 53:56.480
about Wednesday midday, and you can subscribe at Coder.show slash subscribe.

53:56.480 --> 54:01.760
And last but not least, we'd love to get your feedback at Coder.show slash contact.

54:01.760 --> 54:02.760
Thanks for joining us.

54:02.760 --> 54:12.960
We'll see you right back here next week.
