00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 475 for July 18th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,840
Oh, hey there, good buddy. Welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,200
pragmatic look at the art and the business, the software development, and the world of

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,280
technology.

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,640
My name is Chris, and joining us right there from his tactical podcasting station, it's

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,520
our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,280
Mama Mia. There's a put in a lean on the castle because I keep losing the princess.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,000
You know, eventually, you gotta take some responsibility there. Like, you just put some

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
security in.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,680
Who do I got to help me? An imaginary mushroom in my brother who says he sees ghosts everywhere.

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,920
I'm all alone, and Bowser breathes the fire. Like a pepper.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,860
Just to mention, not to mention, you're constantly out there breaking bricks with your bare hands,

13
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,860
so I can imagine.

14
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,820
Yes, like Apollo, like my Madam Vin Diesel.

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,120
I've had a really good week, you know, and I think it's all thanks to your Twitter feed.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,160
I have no recollection. Madam Senator, I don't know.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,600
No, it's really, it's positive. You know, so here I am the other day. In fact, I just

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,280
sort of, I captured this and I thought, let's share it on the show because it's just so

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:28,520
great. So a tweet comes out from Mr. Dominic on July 15th at 10 a.m. and it just says simply,

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,480
living more or less purely in desktop Linux these days. I'm finding a lot to love, but

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,880
do wish the community didn't have to rely so heavily on electron.

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,760
And you know, you mentioned elementary OS a little bit there. I thought, oh, this is

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,840
great. He's having a great time with Linux.

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,960
So I thought, I'll just check in now this morning just to see how things are going.

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,600
So I'm sure you've tweeted later. Oh yeah. In fact, the very next tweet on July 15th

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,680
at 6 p.m. in the evening, it looks like you're buying a MacBook Pro the very same day. The

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,760
day you tweet about how great desktop Linux is, a mere half a day later, you buy a MacBook

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Pro.

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,280
On the advice of my attorney, I respectfully decline to answer this question as it may

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,400
very obviously incriminate me.

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,240
So you're supposed to get it tomorrow too.

32
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,680
I already got it. In fact, they screwed up my weekend plans because FedEx was like, yo

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,800
dawg, you need to be here to sign for this and we'll be there in three hours. Ding, ding.

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,600
There was less than eight hours between the two tweets. What happened in that eight hours?

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,280
Well, we can blame Nilay Patel for this one.

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,360
Oh, I always do. Was it the beard or what was it?

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:41,080
It was the Verge's posting about a sale on that specific MacBook Pro. And me, I don't

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:47,200
want to dunk too hard on the good folks at Ionic, but their deployment tools, their cloud

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,160
deployment solution is not very good. And I had to hand me down my MacBook Air. So I

40
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,720
was like, hmm, now I won't use the iMac out of Pure. Just you're disgusting.

41
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,440
Oh, you're so shameful.

42
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,880
Intel. Oh, oh, yeah, but this is an M1. You didn't go for the M2.

43
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,320
Well, if you look at it, so that's a great point. But if you look at the M2, the M1,

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,440
it's really not worth it for what I'm doing. I did, however, this is actually the largest

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,880
laptop I've ever purchased for myself.

46
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,160
Yeah, it's 16 inches, it's a big lunch tray.

47
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,240
It's a big boy. It's big and dark and speaking for a pre-show topic.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,320
Beautiful. It's just beautiful.

49
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,880
You know what? Space gray is beautiful.

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:41,240
I have the 16 inch as well with the max CPU in there. And I still don't feel like I've

51
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,200
ever put that thing to its maximum. So I'm sure as far as workload goes, the M1 is fine.

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,640
I'm just surprised you weren't drawn, tempted by the maybe the new M2 Air or something like

53
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
that.

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,440
I was tempted, but I was dissuaded by the price and the 250 bucks off of this was tempting.

55
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,360
Also the screen, I wanted to hear what the hype was about this whatever blah, blah, blah

56
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
fancy fancy screen.

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Yeah, right. It's got that XDR or whatever laptop display.

58
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:15,480
It's pretty. It's very nice. So I have not completely betrayed Linux, but doing a little

59
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,120
havesy havesies here.

60
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,800
Yeah. You spend some time with your Linux family, then you sneak off on the weekends

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,760
and go spend time with your Mac family.

62
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,720
Well, like every good Republican congressman, I get to the airport, I tap my foot a couple

63
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,720
of times. If you get that joke, you've been listening to a lot of unfiltered several years

64
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,080
ago, like a lot. Or you happen to be a Republican congressman who goes to the airport quite

65
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
a bit.

66
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,440
Deep ref. So Richard writes in because he's struggling to with a similar problem only

67
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,240
on the other side of the fence. He says, I recently bought a gaming laptop with a GeForce

68
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,920
RTX 3080 TI to do machine and deep learnings. It came with Windows 11, which means I also

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,800
have WSLG. That's WSL with graphical apps. And it was really simple, I got to say, to

70
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,800
get Ubuntu 2204 set up a couple of commands. And I have Firefox and Chrome with audio.

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,880
NVIDIA has special instructions for CUDA pass through back to Windows. And I have TensorFlow

72
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,480
set up with the Jupyter Notebooks and the JupyterLab working.

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,400
I'm thinking of all of this as I hear you review the HP Dev1 laptop running Linux.

74
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,360
And I wonder if a Windows 11 machine would be a sufficient, if not even better Linux

75
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,560
machine for most people. Not for a Chris type that uses specialized avian podcasting software,

76
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,120
but maybe for like Mike's hypothetical web developer type running Git, Node, Python and

77
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,760
other software in WSL and not ever having to worry about driver issues. Even more so

78
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,320
for a developer at large, maybe a developer in the enterprise where everyone runs the

79
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,160
Microsoft suite of Office and Team Software. I'm even writing this in Linux and Chrome

80
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,240
running under WSL.

81
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,880
So do you think a Windows 11 machine is a viable alternative for devs that need Linux

82
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
software?

83
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,800
Yeah, right. I mean, I think we've talked about this before. You know, we're in such

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,960
a state with the three major, the three families of the, you know, the major families of desktop

85
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,240
operating systems that they're all good now, right? Mac is good. Mac, if you never want

86
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,040
to charge it and it has infinite battery life and it's beautiful, it's good. Linux, if you

87
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:22,600
want customability and to have your dev machine very much match your servers in a very likely

88
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,360
way, great. Windows, if you have to do some.NET and do a booting, it's a pain in the

89
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
ass.

90
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,880
And I, you know, we could do a couple of shows on WSL and WSL too. It's really good. Like

91
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,760
I know everybody likes to make fun of Windows and the fact that the registry still exists

92
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:47,640
is terrible, but Windows 11 is fine. Not my cup of tea, but that's purely down to reference.

93
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,520
That's what it's getting to. It's getting to what environment works better for you?

94
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,720
What tooling works better with your workflow? And undoubtedly, probably should have said

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,680
this first, what do you have the most experience with? What are you the most comfortable with?

96
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,860
What it means is whatever your answer is to those things, there's just less and less downside

97
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,560
now to whichever one you choose. And it also kind of means all the silly religious wars

98
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,000
that were fought over desktop operating systems in the past have essentially been made irrelevant

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,520
as they've all just sort of normalized. Thanks web technology and Linux. And you know, for

100
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,600
some of us, that experience is Linux desktop. Some of it's the Mac, some of it's Windows

101
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
and sometimes it's all of them.

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Some of us, you know, we swing based on who's the highest bidder that night.

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,600
Yeah. Neo Vim's got a big buddy in Aden. He writes in, I don't think Neo Vim gets enough

104
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,520
love. I don't think Vim would be making the changes it is today if Neo Vim hadn't come

105
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,920
along. Why Neo Vim? Well, they cleaned up the code base. It's larger and more distributed

106
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,200
development team is definitely better and it has better defaults and abilities for modern

107
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,120
systems. And now that Vim script nine is out, I'd be interested in your take on the rewriting

108
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,680
of the Vim script engine versus just using Lua await, which is the direction Neo Vim

109
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,680
took. I prefer the Lua choice as it's more widely applicable than Vim script and is going

110
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,480
to have a wider development base in the longterm for the language itself. He's getting deep

111
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,320
into the Vim ecosystem here.

112
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,920
Yeah, that's that's good. I mean, I have not personally ever used Neo Vim in any significant

113
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:30,560
way. I think I installed it like twice, but yeah, you're probably right that competition,

114
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,360
right? The thing we don't have in American, the telco, for example, makes everybody better.

115
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
So Neo Vim comes out, Vim gets better.

116
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,100
Yeah. Yeah. That sort of was my take too. It's like, yeah, it makes sense. I'm not super

117
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,560
passionate about this topic. Don't have many thoughts on it, but the logic checks out.

118
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,000
Can I take a side, but related tangent here?

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You know, those are my favorite.

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,960
You know, I decided to tweet that I was interested in looking at Zed. And thank you guys for

121
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:02,000
all the invite codes, but I only needed one. Still, thank you. And you know what? I feel

122
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,520
like I was concerned that VSCode was going to just butcher the editor field for a while.

123
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,760
I don't know. Zed's pretty cool. I've been trying it out for a couple of days. It's a,

124
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,440
it's definite. One, it feels snappy as hell, probably because it's written in Rust. And

125
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,960
it reminds me a lot of maybe a potential Tex-Mate successor, which I'm not sure if that's what

126
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:28,200
they're really going for or not. But I'm sorry, I mean Tex-Mate 2. Yes. Don't yell at me.

127
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,320
I don't know. Does anybody who listens to the show actually know what Tex-Mate was?

128
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,280
No? I'm old? Okay, great. In the eight days of the leopard and the snow leopard, it was

129
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:44,400
the de facto developer editor on Mac. In fact, I'm pretty sure most editors were using Tex-Mate

130
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,760
themes. They just write in packages for a very long time. Yeah. Yeah, Monodevelop used

131
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,000
to. That's a whole different era, man. That was a different time. And you paid 70 bucks

132
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:06,200
for that, baby. Yeah, you did. And you did it happily. Gary's got a lead that will take

133
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,360
no questions, as my lead only knows one set of rules, and those are the US Air Force rules.

134
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,320
I like to ask why a project of ours was denied or maybe why I'm filling out a spreadsheet

135
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,520
that's listing our commits for the third time. He hates questions. He's a no questions kind

136
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:26,640
of guy. Just do what I say. Any tips or resources for working with a no questions allowed development

137
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,840
lead? Ooh, that's rough. Yeah, that just sucks, dude. Also, why do you have a spreadsheet

138
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,200
of your commits? Because that's maybe how the lead likes to review them. I don't know.

139
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,340
I mean, git log, it's right. There's nothing worse than when you're taking information

140
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,640
out of one system and just transposing it to another system just so a lead can review

141
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,280
it. Frustrating. Also, if you just like Gary, go on my GitHub. It's just Dominic M like

142
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,440
everything else is except for my Twitter, which is weird. But I have a little terminal

143
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,320
script. It's called Get Pretty Print. Your manager might love it. He may be happy, but

144
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,880
your lead might love it. I don't know. I mean, I've met guys like this. I don't tend to love

145
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,360
working with them because in kind of cray cray, I used to know a guy who would count

146
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,200
the number of commits. So you every and the developers learned real quick. Here's what

147
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:27,920
you do. One file, one commit every time. Oh, God. Yep. So yeah, that's uh, I don't know,

148
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,440
Gary, you gotta you gotta roll with the punches and maybe see if you can, you know, maybe

149
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,280
it's time for a change. Yeah, I was thinking that he said Air Force and I thought maybe

150
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,920
he can't just easily change. That could be tricky. Right. He might be in. Yeah. Mm hmm.

151
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,200
Mm hmm. I wonder. Keep us posted. Let us know how that goes and what your choices are. And

152
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,880
if anybody has any tips, feel free to boost them in or email them into coder dot show

153
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,600
slash contact. Gosh, that's a bad situation where you got a bad lead and you're kind of

154
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,640
stuck there. I feel for you. Now, speaking of being stuck somewhere, if you're stuck

155
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:05,600
in London, what I did there, the London meetup is nigh six p.m. local time, August 5th, Jupiter

156
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,360
broadcasting dot com slash meetup for details on that. Alex from self hosted will be there.

157
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,600
There's already one hundred and four attendees on the meetup. It's going to be outdoors.

158
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,420
So that way there's fresh air. That's going to be a hell of an event. I hear Boris Johnson

159
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,760
is coming. So that's going to be a freaking rager. Yeah, he's got a little more free time

160
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,080
now. So he's going to show up. But still, just as much vodka as you'd expect. Now we

161
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,840
do have the initial dates up for our West Coast tour that's coming up. Linode is making

162
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:40,600
it possible for JB to go down and do a West Coast road tour and get a very special tour

163
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,880
of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. And we'll do a series of meetups in southern

164
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,400
Oregon, in Sacramento, in southern California and in Portland. And those will be although

165
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,760
I don't see the Portland one on there yet. Those meetups are all getting listed at meetup

166
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,440
dot com slash Jupiter broadcasting. And we'd love to we'd love to meet up with you. There

167
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,200
it is. There's the Portland meetup. So we'll have them all there just so you know the dates

168
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:13,680
just in case you're in the area. We're going to be in southern Oregon on the 20th of September.

169
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,920
These are all September. We'll be in Sacramento on the 23rd and we'll be in the Pasadena area

170
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,520
on the 30th and then we'll be in Portland on October 7th on our way back up. So if you

171
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,000
are on anywhere near those places, do come out and say hi to us. It's it's it's a who

172
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,380
knows who knows how many opportunities we'll have like this. And so it's a great chance.

173
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:41,080
We also have a matrix group, a West Coast crew matrix group set up where you can chat

174
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,920
with us, get details, coordinate with other people in your area. I'll have a link to the

175
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,560
matrix room for that in the show notes, as well as a link to the meetup page in the show

176
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,760
notes. But if you're in the West Coast area, come out and say holler, come say hi to us.

177
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,920
Maybe we'll have like a cardboard cut out of you, Mike. You know, you're just like standing

178
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,760
there next to me with a big smile or maybe like in your robe with a cigar and a martini,

179
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,280
just like a cardboard cut out version of you. Yeah, that would work. I mean, why don't we

180
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,920
all put our oculus is on and I can just be there. I think that's probably a good plan.

181
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,080
Although I'm not sure the martini glass and the oculus are going to work well together.

182
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:21,200
Smack, smack, clink, clink. There's only one way to find out above an open laptop, of course.

183
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:28,120
Too soon, man. Too soon. Linode dot com slash coder. Go there to get one hundred dollars

184
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,880
and 60 day credit on a new account. And it's a great way to support the show while you

185
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:38,000
get to try something great out. Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting. Should try it

186
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,160
for your next project, maybe the next thing you're building or the next thing you want

187
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,800
to learn about, especially now that Linode has Kali Linux as a deployment option in their

188
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,240
marketplace. It makes it super quick to try something like Kali out and learn a little

189
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,400
bit about cybersecurity, but also test your own systems. It's a real legitimate tool.

190
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,400
I love the upgrades that I have seen land over at Linode over the last couple of years.

191
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,600
The rollout of their MVME storage, the rollout of the AMD epic processors, more features

192
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,560
like database as a service. They started with one database and now they've added multiple

193
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,960
databases. Hello, Postgres. Thank you very much, Linode. If you're a performance hound,

194
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,520
you're going to love Linode. If you're a budget hound, you're going to love Linode. If you're

195
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,000
a hound, you probably don't know what Linode is, but you get what I'm saying. Linode has

196
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,840
been doing this for nearly 19 years. And over that time, they have had to refine it to stay

197
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,500
competitive. They've really built something special here. So that's why they want to give

198
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,480
you one hundred dollars. I think they know that if you try it and compare it to what

199
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,560
else is out there, not only will you see that it's a great service with a beautiful interface,

200
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,280
but it's also a better value than the hyperscalers that want to lock you into their crazy esoteric

201
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,280
platform. And we live in this world now where they're constantly trying to abstract away

202
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,560
all these services into individual things that they can charge you for. Linode is how

203
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,720
we've built everything in the last couple of years because we can go there, we can build

204
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,760
our infrastructure and it runs great. And if we ever need it, and I hear this from the

205
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,000
audience all the time, if you ever need it, Linode has the absolute best service in the

206
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,720
business. Their model is different than the hyperscalers, so they can offer you actual

207
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,640
human support. That really matters. Go try it. Go see why we've been talking about it

208
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,000
and go see why they're still sponsoring because Coder Radio listeners like you are still trying

209
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,680
it out and discovering it's the best out there. It's really great. We've got a whole crew

210
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,640
of Linode users out there now. Go become one of them and get that $100 and support the

211
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:39,840
show. Linode.com slash Coder.

212
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,000
Let's talk about declarative UIs because I love it when you get declarative and I have

213
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,040
been hearing some buzz around Flutter recently. Brand new app just dropped that I want to

214
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,720
try out. I got declarative on the mind and I think you do too.

215
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,080
I do, I do. I do declare. What's the new app?

216
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,440
Of course you're going to put me on the spot. It was a Bitcoin app, of course.

217
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,320
Of course it was. All right. We should just talk about what declarative UIs are. Basically,

218
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:13,160
it's back in the olden days of I guess the 90s and early aughts. Actually, I don't know,

219
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,800
for a while. UIs were basically object oriented. You had a button. The whole thing was like

220
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:25,480
... The metaphor was like, it's an actual button in your car or whatever. Yay. If you're

221
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,640
familiar with skeuomorphism at all, that was a design language that was supposed to make

222
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,560
things look like actual things. We had a lot of leather iOS apps for a long time. It's

223
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:39,200
very... Wachowski Brothers, Keanu Reeves in 1999, we were having a good time in black

224
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
leather.

225
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Yeah.

226
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Now, because the world is in a fallen state, we have multiple screen sizes. If you've ever

227
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,240
done old school iOS development, that becomes increasingly hard. We have declarative UI.

228
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,240
What does that mean? I do declare what my content is and what the data is and how I

229
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,520
expect it to be broadly structured. A lot of this declarative UI stuff will look very

230
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:13,280
like XML-y, kind of like a document adjacent. Chris, if you'll read us how Flutter explains

231
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,520
because the wizards at Google are like the techno mages. They know.

232
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,360
Yeah, they do. They say that this... They have an introduction, which we will link in

233
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,960
the show notes. They say, frameworks from Win32 to the web to Android and iOS typically

234
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,720
use an imperative style of UI programming. This must be the style you're most familiar

235
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,440
with where you manually construct a full functional UI entity, such as a UI view or equivalent,

236
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,800
and later mutate it using methods and setters when the UI changes. I think I just understood

237
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,920
it less by reading that.

238
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,360
Well, no. That's the old way, right? Let's just say... I'm going to just iOS it up to

239
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:56,520
torture everybody. All right. Let's say I have Jar Jar view, and then on Jar Jar view,

240
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,080
I have... I think it's... What is it? ViewDidLoad? That might be a view controller, but I'm going

241
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,720
to call it ViewDidLoad. Then I would go Jar Jar view.background equals blah, blah, blah,

242
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:12,160
color hash. Jar Jar view.title equals blah, blah, blah, my title. Literally, imperatively,

243
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,600
line by line by line, I'm telling the view based on the loading trigger what it should

244
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,940
look like manually.

245
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,440
Then that view is my class Jar Jar view. I go into a view controller or some other type

246
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:31,280
of container, and I'm like, okay, put the Jar Jar view on view controller did load,

247
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,560
which is actually also called ViewDidLoad because I think I got the view one wrong.

248
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,040
It's been a long time. Back in the day, we would literally denote the pixels, right?

249
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:46,600
Like 20 pixels from the top, 10 from the left, 10 from the right, and whatever below it.

250
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,120
That's the imperative style. That's... Back in my day, me and Decker Cain were doing that,

251
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,520
but Google, the heroes, they are... I'm going to continue the quote. In order to lighten

252
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,840
the burden on developers from having to program how to transition between various UI states,

253
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,800
it's a me and Mario, but I slipped a little bit there. I turned into a Boo from the quickie

254
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,800
bar. That was not good. By contrast, less developers crowd the current UI state and

255
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:17,360
leaves the transitioning to the framework. Okay. We basically have... Think of SwiftUI.

256
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,320
I know it's super popular with Ionit audience. Let's just genericize it, right? You have

257
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,040
a view. You lay out roughly what you want. I want a table view. I have this item. Map

258
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:34,440
it to the properties of this data structure, which could be some sort of object or it could

259
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:41,120
just be like a hash, whatever. Lay it out. You're not telling it pixels. You're not imperatively

260
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,120
saying do this, this, this, then this. You're giving it the structure and the data that

261
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,920
you want, and it's basically Voltroning itself up. The advantage of this, wide declarative

262
00:20:51,920 --> 00:21:02,520
UI, is that in theory, in theory, it's less manual crappy imperative coding work. Arguable,

263
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:09,120
but okay. You get something called two-way data binding in most platforms that do this,

264
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,120
which if you're familiar with Angular is like the magical thing where you don't have to

265
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,520
do... Because remember, let's go back to my old iOS app. If we have a text field in

266
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,760
that Jar Jar view and someone types fork you Jar Jar, well, to actually get that back into

267
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,680
the backing data model, I have to go Jar Jar.message equals fork you Jar Jar. With this kind of

268
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,520
thing, it just automatically will do the two-way binding, assuming you know what you're doing

269
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,080
and you're in a platform that does that, which most of them do now.

270
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,960
The problem is the same problem we always have with this kind of stuff. That little

271
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,720
like promise it'll basically look good on all your devices is basically not true. Having

272
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,840
said that, I don't think this is bad at all, but this is like the Java dream that me and

273
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,880
Duke cry every night over as we cuddle in our sun t-shirts, blankets.

274
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
There it is.

275
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,840
Write once, run everywhere just doesn't really work. Granted, now that a lot of front-end

276
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,920
development has transitioned to like HTML5, which I don't even think is a term we should

277
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:21,360
use anymore because that's old. That's 2012 talking. Let's just call it modern web. It's

278
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,280
less about the actual platform you're on and more about the screen size and the screen

279
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:32,280
aspect ratio and resolution, which I mean, I will say like I'm doing a bit of Angular

280
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:40,760
backed by Ionic or Ionic or however you want to say that. It's sane. If I put it on an

281
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,880
iPad versus a phone, it looks okay for the most part, but it is a little things you end

282
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,120
up wanting to change it anyway. That's my long winded explanation of why you should

283
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,360
look into declarative UI, but it's partially a lie.

284
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,280
I feel like there's an elephant in the room with this stuff too, and that is you've seen

285
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,640
a lot of apps that come out where the developer, maybe rightfully so, just doesn't want to

286
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:14,120
invest time or money or resources into UI development. This can be a way where you can

287
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:21,520
essentially ship minimum viable UI that actually survives platform updates frequently as well,

288
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
but not all of them.

289
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:29,680
So okay, let's get crazy. Let's talk about Swift UI. So for about a year, I've wanted

290
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,240
this little prototype news reading app because I used to be an extremely heavy pocket user

291
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,800
as anybody who's followed me on Twitter for longer than two years will know, but I'm just

292
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,800
less and less inclined to use it. I kind of prototyped something up in Swift UI, just

293
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:50,960
the UI side and like basic internal data, no server backend yet. And as long as I kept

294
00:23:50,960 --> 00:24:00,840
it to Apple's controls, it was really, really nice. I mean, I kind of get why Marco always

295
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:07,460
uses Apple's controls now, because you know what? I could like magically implement dark

296
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:14,800
mode. As long as I followed the HIG. The beautiful thing is I'm the customer for this app, so

297
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,360
there's no one who's like, we need our special branding, special kind of like, God forbid

298
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,560
whatever drawer they want made that doesn't exist in iOS.

299
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,560
Users are the worst part about writing software.

300
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:31,200
I really think every user who complains about the color blue, and I'm carrying the spoon

301
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,740
from roughly 10 years ago now, should have to work in the God damn terminal.

302
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,760
That's right.

303
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,720
Not warp and not tabby. You know, we're installing Ubuntu 910. I'll give them 910.

304
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,960
No fish shell.

305
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,760
No fish. And I'm going to bust the auto complete on you. I'm going to mess with your Bash RC.

306
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:57,440
There you go. That'll show them. That'll show them. No, it's really, it's really nice. It's

307
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,440
definitely opinionated. It's got some fee fees. But if you're willing to tolerate its

308
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,280
fee fees, it's a lot like my six year old, honestly. Like he, we play Mario soccer or

309
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,900
Mario strikers, which is, should be called Mario soccer, but it's not. And he believes

310
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,240
the way to win is to nuke me with red shells. And unfortunately that seems to be working.

311
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,360
I hate the shells. I hate the shell. I wish I could turn it off and make it like FIFA

312
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,660
and be like, all right buddy, let's go. I know the challenge with Swift UI in particular

313
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,960
is the minute you have to import UI kit, which I actually have an old blog post when I was

314
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,360
trying this out last year, it works, but Oh baby, you got to wrap that in some Swift UI

315
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,040
goodness. And some of your old school delegate callbacks might be mad at you. Oh, and of

316
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,000
course the biggest problem with Swift UI is the Swift part. Cause it's not objective C.

317
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:56,400
Yes, I had to get it in. Um, but I would encourage you, I mean, I would suggest, and this really

318
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,640
hurts me every time I do that. If you are a young budding, you know, glamorous or strapping

319
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,560
or whatever wannabe iOS developer, leave the objective seat to the old guys and just pay

320
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,320
us a lot of money to do like the three hours you need to fix your stuff. Go ahead and go

321
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:20,480
straight into Swift UI. Oh, and it works across Mac OS and, uh, iOS. Oh, and it works on the

322
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,520
watch now, which is super interesting. What's super bad about it is that you're, you need

323
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,120
a beastly laptop because it reloads constantly. They'll solve that for you for a price. Yeah.

324
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:38,320
$2,500 or 2250. If you listen to me, I Patel, you know, with your kid, you might be able

325
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,400
to get an educational discount, right? Can't, can't you as a parent, I've actually never

326
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,800
tried this myself, but there's educational discounts too. I mean, not to give even more

327
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,840
excuses to buy max, but something to look into. So, you know, the small business discount

328
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,360
used to be really good, but that I think that's the same as the education. It's not like 7%.

329
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,840
Ah, I do know the educational discount has gotten less. The, the literal best buy. We

330
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,120
hate Amazon. We're competing with them. Prime day sale was more than both my business discount

331
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,360
and, uh, yeah, my fiance is actually taking some classes so she could, she has it through

332
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,960
her school. It was about a hundred bucks cheaper just to go at best buys. Like, you know, we

333
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,000
hate Amazon sale, which I'm pretty sure is why they did that. Hey man, works for me.

334
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,240
Yeah. Competition again, here's looking at you Comcast. So you know what I'm surprised

335
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,200
hasn't really come up at all is react. I mean, where does this fit? Because I hate it. Oh,

336
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,000
thank you for life. Yeah. I mean, okay. All right. Well, there you go. No, react native

337
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,600
react native is actually, I would say the pure flood. Okay. So we should, we should

338
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,800
compare the three, the three we put in the doc flutter, Swift UI and react native Swift

339
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,400
UI. I would say it's the most bastard eyes of these declarative UI frameworks right now.

340
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,360
That's partially because they just have a huge transition they've got to make, right?

341
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,520
And you've got to be able to mix your UI kit code in there and UI kits as imperative as

342
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:05,280
they come. It's view did load bam dot background color. Let's do it. React native. I mean,

343
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:11,620
comes from react.js, right? It's its own thing. Same with flutter and they're, they're real

344
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:19,640
deep in this declarative UI stuff where their whole pitch, both them and flutter is to write

345
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,580
your code. You can have some rules for different device sizes, but you know what your data

346
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:30,480
driven your functionality driven everything. We, we used to call this reactive programming,

347
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,640
which is kind of a different thing too, but most people doing reactive programming, we're

348
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,560
also doing declarative UIs as kind of a byproduct. And they, they kind of go together really

349
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,760
hand in hand, right? Cause it's less about, you know, you manually typing the code and

350
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:53,320
it's more, um, you know, the object backing your view changes. The view automatically

351
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,520
changes. So yeah, I mean if I would say if you just like have never heard of this concept

352
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:05,760
before you had to pick one unless you're just that aspiring, you know, iOS developer, I

353
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,960
would say take a peek at flutter or react native first. There are the, the purest implementations

354
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
of this.

355
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,440
All right. We have links in the show notes and of course you can always check the back

356
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,680
catalog using tags, keywords. In fact, if you go to notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com,

357
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:31,640
you can search for our previous coverage on react on Swift and on flutter all there. So

358
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,200
good stuff, especially as I think flutter is, um, I think I'm beginning to change my

359
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,800
mind on flutter. I think we're going to see outside of Google adoption more and more.

360
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,840
You've got several projects happening at canonical. They're really close to their flutter based

361
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:53,600
installer and there's this Bitcoin lightning wallet that is using flutter specifically

362
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,320
because they want to target iOS, Android, and the desktop.

363
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:02,480
Yeah. I think from where when we first covered flutter, um, and when actually a couple of

364
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,160
years ago I interviewed the guy at the time who I think like ran flutter or something.

365
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,560
He goes big shot and flutter. It's a, it's become really impressive. I don't know. I'm

366
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,160
still clinging to my angular, which maybe we'll talk about the current state of angular

367
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:23,040
slash ionic next week or a week after. But that's, uh, partially because I'm doing more

368
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:42,400
pure webby stuff and dart scares me.

369
00:30:42,400 --> 00:31:05,360
In

370
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,100
multiple different providers that could be across physical systems, virtual systems,

371
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,860
mobile devices.

372
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,560
It's fantastic.

373
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,080
And you'll be impressed with how quick it is to get started.

374
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,140
If you're a business, it'll work with your single sign on provider that includes two

375
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,280
factor.

376
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,140
And for me, the best part is, is every device now is accessible to me when I'm at work,

377
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,820
when I'm on the road, when I'm at a friend's house, like anywhere I can get either with

378
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,040
my mobile device or my laptops.

379
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,520
They all just have tail scale and it's really intelligent about how it routes the traffic.

380
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,660
So you're not just like dumping all your internet traffic into your tail scale network.

381
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,120
It's intelligent about that.

382
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
It works with DNS too.

383
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,000
So if you want to throw a DNS machine in your tail scale network, you can start resolving

384
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
names.

385
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It has ACL support.

386
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It has sharing support.

387
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,280
If you want to share one node or maybe just one port on a node with a friend, I do that

388
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,400
with my buddy Alex devices connect so quickly and transparently.

389
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,220
Once it's up, it's always on.

390
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,120
That means it's always available and then you can start building around that.

391
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,800
They're always on VPNs that get up and going in just minutes.

392
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,520
So go try it for yourself for free for up to 20 machines.

393
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,880
Go to tailscale.com slash coder.

394
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,440
You go there, you support the show, you try out one of the best things that's come around

395
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,760
in years and you get it for free up to 20 devices.

396
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:23,120
That's tailscale.com slash coder.

397
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,000
I wanted to document something that I thought was interesting happening in the tech industry.

398
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,160
Do you remember it was a bit ago, it seems like 10 years ago, thanks to the last couple

399
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,920
of years, but it actually wasn't.

400
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:43,740
It was 2020 and 2021 when America's greatest cyber hack occurred, SolarWinds software was

401
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,780
compromised and then all of the different government and large institution and enterprises

402
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:54,320
that use the SolarWinds software, a lot of them got compromised as a result and it turned

403
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,040
out it was some really poor practices.

404
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,560
I believe with the way software updates were being distributed and checked and it was just

405
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:10,160
this devastating attack and SolarWinds as a brand was essentially nuked from the sky

406
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,560
and just drilled into the ground.

407
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,880
Do you recall all of this?

408
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Oh yeah.

409
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:22,960
So it's interesting to watch as the tech media begins the process of repairing the brand

410
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,800
and I wanted to capture this so that way our audience could be aware of how this cycle

411
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
works.

412
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,840
Here's the general cycle.

413
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,000
Large company and institution in the tech industry becomes well known, well established,

414
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,080
brand equity is high, has a very embarrassing event, goes quiet for a year to two years

415
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,480
and then begins working on a sustained campaign to bring its brand back.

416
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,680
It generally starts with smaller media outlets, local if it's in the business tech cross section

417
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,120
and then it kind of grows out from there.

418
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,560
The headline reads, why SolarWinds just may be one of the most secure software companies

419
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:09,560
in the tech universe by Jill at SC Media.

420
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,640
I'm guessing SC Media looks like they focus on cyber security and other things.

421
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,640
Yeah, of course.

422
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:23,440
And she writes her opening sentence, a house gets burglarized, the owners buy a fancy alarm

423
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,840
system, a hurricane knocks a house down, it gets rebuilt, bigger and stronger.

424
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,840
Indeed there are a slew of analogies that could be applied to SolarWinds which just

425
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:39,760
might now be among the most secure software companies in the tech universe.

426
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,280
And you can kind of probably get a vibe for where it goes from here.

427
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,360
But I'm closing the door on a few business opportunities because SolarWinds is actually

428
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:55,600
a surprisingly large company and they actually own quite a few sub-brands that are interested

429
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,300
in buying podcast advertising, but it shouldn't be able to work like this.

430
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,380
They screwed up fundamentally.

431
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:08,880
As a brand they should be dead, it should be sold off, it should be done.

432
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,080
Instead this industry pleasing media is going to write these soft pieces about them because

433
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,000
you know it's just tech, who cares, it doesn't hurt anybody.

434
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,160
And they'll pump the brand and they'll pump the brand until they're back and they're bigger

435
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,120
than ever and they're making billions of dollars again like they didn't make some sort of massive

436
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,520
fundamental mistake that exposed millions of people's private information.

437
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,680
And I find the process frustrating and so I just kind of wanted to document it here

438
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,360
so we could see the cycle in the show so we could all be aware of how they do this and

439
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,720
how their coverage isn't like regular media coverage.

440
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,440
Oh they don't take it seriously.

441
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,360
Right they don't, but I don't think the journalists, if you can call them that, they don't take

442
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,380
it seriously either because it's not life and death stuff, it's not political scandals,

443
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,380
it's tech stuff.

444
00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:00,120
We can even look at some of our, or my, more beloved tech sites and they've all weirdly

445
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:06,600
turned into like navel-gazing pseudo reporting on the media itself site, which I get, you

446
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:13,160
know Facebook decided to do crazy crap, but sometimes you just want a good old-fashioned

447
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,520
hey man there's a new laptop out, you know, or like there's this weird gadget.

448
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,160
You know where this is going to take us, right?

449
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,440
My pet peeve.

450
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,520
Large accounting consultancies realizing there's a bunch of little companies in a small metro,

451
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,160
let's call it Tampa, and deciding that they are going to systematically rip that like

452
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,440
basically just cut prices and go into every mid to somewhat large business to put those

453
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,520
companies out of business.

454
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:52,660
By hiring just massive offshore teams or a couple good coaches and in the past a lot

455
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:57,600
of H1Bs, but I don't, somehow that seems less and less a thing, or at least maybe in Florida

456
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
it's less of a thing.

457
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
I don't know.

458
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,520
In New York I used to see it all the time, but it's really like I'm not going to name

459
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:10,400
names because I used to have a relative that worked at one of these, but these guys need

460
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:17,160
to see more growth and they can't handle little ratatouille over here having even a piece

461
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
of the bread.

462
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Right?

463
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,160
No baguette for you.

464
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Can I fry a little bacon?

465
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,600
It has felt like the last few years there has been decision after decision and policy

466
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:34,320
after policy or strategy after strategy that is just absolutely crushing the small business.

467
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:42,800
Like it started with the lockdowns which universally advantaged large companies like your box stores

468
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,360
and disadvantaged small businesses, but we're also seeing it with the supply chain shortages

469
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,620
now.

470
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,120
Large businesses like Amazon and Walmart can actually afford to just fly their own jet

471
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,600
planes and their own boats, but small businesses like the mom and pop hardware store near where

472
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,020
I live can't get access to the same things.

473
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,840
That's not one person or decision disadvantaging them, it's just a series.

474
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,960
It's a structural disadvantage.

475
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,880
On top of that, you have things like Blackwater that's going out and buying up real estate

476
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,080
that's not only taking it from homeowners, but they're also buying up commercial real

477
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,000
estate and offices that now drive the price.

478
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yes, they're my landlord.

479
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

480
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yes, that's right.

481
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,880
But you get my point.

482
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,120
It seems like this is getting gnawed at from several different directions.

483
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,920
Maybe it's just that there's all of these giant institutions now and because these giant

484
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,480
institutions are so big, they just suck up all of the resources around them.

485
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
Well, this is the thing.

486
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,440
This is what the Chinese have right.

487
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,320
It turns out mercantilism was flawed, but fundamentally correct.

488
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,760
There is just a limited amount of resources in a given area, and there is no such thing.

489
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,760
I'll give you an example.

490
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,680
COVID is definitely a part of this too, and I think they were able to use COVID to their

491
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
advantage.

492
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,560
There used to be five or six, and let's call it the Tampa Hillsborough County area, moderately

493
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:13,720
small to medium size, bigger than the Mad Botter, or around that small, businessy, indie

494
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,560
sized dev shops doing dev or dev-adjacent things.

495
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,960
A couple of them put on their hipster glasses and plaid and said they were design shops,

496
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
whatever.

497
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
Same thing.

498
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,340
Now there's, to my knowledge, three of us left.

499
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:33,440
That barely counts because one of them just decided to offshore a bunch of their stuff.

500
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,200
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

501
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,120
It's me, and I'll plug them source though.

502
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:43,600
They're good, but they're also half in Australia, I think.

503
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,720
The way the survivors survived was by niching down super hard.

504
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,220
We do the automation stuff with Alice, and we do software for basically enterprise, line

505
00:39:55,220 --> 00:40:02,440
of business, run your business, get your analytics for your internal, whether it's your farm

506
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,560
or you're repairing jet engines, those are basically our two big areas right now.

507
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,000
Or you're a small business, want to automate some of your stuff, integrate multiple services,

508
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,040
go to alice.dev, we can do that for you, very affordably.

509
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,360
The other guys, they focus on cruise ships.

510
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,840
SourceTode, they just all in on cruise ships.

511
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:26,280
If you are a Russian oligarch and your yacht has not been seized, go talk to Greg over

512
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
at SourceTode.

513
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,520
He can hook you up, although I don't think he will, but he could.

514
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,520
This is the thing.

515
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,760
See, this is the thing.

516
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,120
You have them sucking up the resources, right?

517
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,720
You're making it harder and harder for these niche businesses to exist, which means... I

518
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,080
think that's a whole other conversation, actually, but going back to the SolarWinds piece, this

519
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,080
is why I think SolarWinds should just go away.

520
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,840
It should be broken up into all its subsidiaries, all of its individual pieces, and it should

521
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,680
be a dozen small little businesses, and we should be hitting the reset button from time

522
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,760
to time to help keep this ecosystem healthy.

523
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,320
But instead, we have this press coverage and this brand repair that they engage in, and

524
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:13,720
I'm not even claiming that SC Media or SC Magazine was paid for this or that it's a

525
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
native advertisement.

526
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,320
It could be, but I actually think the way the incentive system works, because getting

527
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:26,280
access to these CEOs and getting connections is what keeps these types of outlets going,

528
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,320
they have to kind of do this stuff.

529
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,600
It's the incentive structure.

530
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,320
In order for them to get somebody at SolarWinds in the future to pick up the phone, they got

531
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,240
to kind of engage in this sort of stuff.

532
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,120
It's not even a malicious thing.

533
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:45,040
I occasionally write book reviews, and I used to do the Manning Press, the early access

534
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,040
books.

535
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,920
They'd send to Dev, and they'd be like, hey, free book if you want to write a review.

536
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,920
But they're always like PDFs.

537
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,880
I used to get those too back in the old days.

538
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,600
Back in the day, they don't do that anymore.

539
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,000
And I would occasionally review them.

540
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,720
Well, that was a mistake.

541
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,360
It's like every Monday, my email box is deluged with, and it's always like a random crap.

542
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
I know.

543
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,800
I was willing to do a few like Linux on topic ones, and then all of a sudden it was just

544
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
unbelievable.

545
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
It's because, again, the incentive structure.

546
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,160
Okay, so going back to this, and this is why I really think this matters, is the SC media

547
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,760
doesn't even have to be doing anything malicious.

548
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,000
The incentive structure of advertised based media is such that the reader is just not

549
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
the customer.

550
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,040
So it's not in their interest to get you the most accurate information.

551
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,640
It's not a malicious thing.

552
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,920
The tech industry and the advertisers in that tech ecosystem are the customer.

553
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,200
You guys have heard it a million times.

554
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,840
If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.

555
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,260
It's true in media too.

556
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:48,920
And side note, this is why memberships are a big deal for our show.

557
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:54,240
This is why the boosts are a big deal for our show, because it means our largest customer,

558
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,680
our most important customer as a business, is our audience.

559
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,280
You're our customer that gives us the leeway to work with other advertisers and pick the

560
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,440
right ones.

561
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,120
But it doesn't mean we have to, right?

562
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,920
We have choice in the matter.

563
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,160
That's the difference.

564
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,000
You are the customer.

565
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,960
But in the case of SC media, you're not the customer.

566
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,200
I want to read this email that came into the show a couple hours before the show.

567
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:23,480
Hello, my name is Monica, and I'm an outreach assistant at ZZB Agency, a small company representing

568
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,760
a handful of real money gambling and betting related clients.

569
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,320
While looking for potential partners for a content marketing campaign, I stumbled upon

570
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,480
Jupiter Broadcasting and found that it would probably be of interest to our partners.

571
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:42,120
So allow me to ask you, are you open to publishing paid articles with do follow real money gambling

572
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,880
or betting related links in their text on their website?

573
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,280
I think she's saying links that go to the gambling website.

574
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,640
I'm well aware that the fact that this business is in general pretty sensitive and that any

575
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,560
collaboration in this area would involve higher rates than usual if you're open to working

576
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,200
with my partners of this type.

577
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Please let us know.

578
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,360
You're asking price for a paid article with one live link in its body.

579
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,440
Please include the price of creating the article as well.

580
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,760
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

581
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,480
Best regards, Monica came in this morning.

582
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,480
Comes in all the time.

583
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,680
I actually got three this morning to office hours.

584
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,680
It's a brand new show.

585
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,000
I got three like this.

586
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,160
That's like extra shady.

587
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,160
I know.

588
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,880
I just need to pay you a little more and you know, keep it a secret.

589
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,880
Don't say anything.

590
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,680
The implication is don't put like a sponsored content thing under it.

591
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,680
Yeah.

592
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,680
Yeah.

593
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,160
That kind of stuff comes into shows like ours all the time.

594
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,200
And if you weren't the customer, eventually a business has to survive, right?

595
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,760
And eventually you just the right kind of offer, maybe it's not that one, but the right

596
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,760
kind of offer comes in.

597
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,240
It's a little shady, but you're willing to do it because the money's good.

598
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,240
And pretty soon it just becomes a standard practice of business.

599
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,720
It's not even considered immoral anymore.

600
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,260
It's just the business you're doing.

601
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,280
And that is what happens in the tech press.

602
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,180
All of the tech press is like this.

603
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,180
It's bad.

604
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,180
It's all like this.

605
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,180
Right.

606
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,360
And I mean, there's exceptions for sure.

607
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,320
When I say all, I guess I'm really talking about all the big ones, like Mike's favorite,

608
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,880
The Verge, a few others.

609
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,200
Hey, OK, you know what, though?

610
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,680
The Verge at least says when they're doing it, they put that they put that big sponsored

611
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,680
banner.

612
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,680
Right.

613
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,920
And then I just don't click on it.

614
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,760
But that's still there's still that problem.

615
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,480
And I think it's one of the things that our show does not suffer from in some shows that

616
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,520
you and I listen to do suffer from.

617
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,240
There is that problem where if you want to maintain a relationship with individuals in

618
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,560
a company, sources and whatnot, there's just certain things you won't say or there's just

619
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,120
certain things you'll interpret a certain way because.

620
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,600
You're incentivized to do it that way, right?

621
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,600
It's just human nature.

622
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,600
You know what I mean?

623
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:50,680
And that just, I think, is a really rampant problem in tech because it's it's a close

624
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,040
community and because it's not high stakes compared to other types of news coverage.

625
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,920
I think it allows for those kinds of relationships to form more.

626
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,560
I don't know for sure, but based on my 15 years of kind of watching all of it, I sure

627
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,040
seem to observe observe that kind of behavior in that practice an awful lot to think it's

628
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,560
just at this point pretty widespread.

629
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,640
And so you see it in things like this brand repair campaign.

630
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:20,880
If you go search SolarWinds on Google News, you would think the largest cyber attack in

631
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,280
US history, which is what it was called over and over and over again, it even has its own.

632
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,660
They gave it a name.

633
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:32,280
You would think that if you looked on news.google.com for SolarWinds, maybe the largest cyber compromise

634
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,640
that's ever happened in US history might show up.

635
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,680
Instead what you will see is 20 or 30 spin articles that are part of a sustained campaign

636
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,680
that's been going on right up until their earnings are announced in just a few days.

637
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:53,220
To spin the brand as this recovery brand and Google News just surfaces what everybody's

638
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,440
reporting and that's what you know, all these different little no name outlets are all publishing

639
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,440
and it begins to create this noise and it just all the surfaces now in the feeds and

640
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,520
I thought to be an interesting for us to be able to watch it happen in real time.

641
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,520
That's really all.

642
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,520
We're a little sad.

643
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,400
Yeah, or perhaps could be a little sad.

644
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,000
But at least it's good to know that's how these things go down so we can invent new

645
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,720
thought technologies to process the information like that sounds great.

646
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:27,080
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

647
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,080
All right, we got some boosts.

648
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:36,720
Trev dev boosted in with some leet sats 1337 five days ago, Mike, you can use ZSH and a

649
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:42,960
completion plug in, by the way, like you could spell PG SQL correctly once and then if you

650
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,840
use control E, it'll complete repetitive queries for you automatically.

651
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,360
I mean, sure, these fangled new terminals offer a lots of stuff, but very little for

652
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,680
a dude just trying to write some Python and also please don't feed the animals while visiting

653
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,680
the zoo.

654
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,680
That's right.

655
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,480
Not sure why you would ZSH plug in at love, I guess.

656
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,560
So yeah, probably shouldn't do that.

657
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:08,240
Tim Apple boosted in with a row of ducks, two thousand two hundred and twenty two sats.

658
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,240
I'm a duck.

659
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:15,320
The UK duck loaded with talent when you read that letter from Lenart and you said 2014.

660
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
I couldn't believe it.

661
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,320
It seemed just like it was the other day.

662
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,320
What a ride.

663
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,320
Also, people are still bitching about system D all these years later.

664
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,120
Microsoft has one thing right, though.

665
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,120
Oh, wait.

666
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,120
Forgot what it was.

667
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:34,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

668
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:41,520
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

669
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,520
regarding V.S.

670
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,920
Code and Microsoft spying on you.

671
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,720
You can just turn off the telemetry.

672
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,280
That's what we do.

673
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,600
Fair.

674
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:55,320
I actually like I was saying last week and I'm surprised nobody said anything about this.

675
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,960
I leave it on on purposeful.

676
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,960
So you want to rep Linux.

677
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,960
Yeah, that's right.

678
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,960
I want to rep the Linux.

679
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,040
I'm curious if anybody else does that.

680
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,520
But nobody else boosted in.

681
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,240
I do it for edge, actually, but I turn it off on Mac because they don't need to see

682
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,240
that.

683
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,240
There's enough Macs out there.

684
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,000
I'm a closeted Mac.

685
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,840
Bros and Wing boosted in with LeetSats.

686
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,920
Mike and Chris, I have a dream.

687
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,760
I want to be in my car on my hour long commute listening to Jupiter broadcasting when something

688
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,920
interesting is talked about on the show and I have a thought.

689
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:32,560
I just want to pause the podcast and say into the air, Siri, boost in Dakota Radio, save

690
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:38,040
blah, blah, blah with X amount of sats without ever having to leave Apple CarPlay.

691
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,040
What do you think?

692
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,880
Is that going to be possible in the future?

693
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,880
I wonder.

694
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,880
I wonder.

695
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,000
No, because aren't sats a proxy for money?

696
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,200
Yes, but Fountain App is an iOS app that already lets you boost in and Castamatic, too.

697
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,600
So there's there's there's podcast apps that let you do it so you don't buy the sats in

698
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
the app.

699
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,600
That's, I think.

700
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,800
Oh, OK.

701
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,840
So it's like if you buy like e-bucks or v-bucks, whatever it was, right.

702
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,000
So you like to use something like Strike or Blue Wallet to buy the sats, which are in

703
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,280
iOS, but they've been approved as like Strike is like a legit.

704
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,280
Payments app.

705
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,280
Well, then, yeah, you could probably do it, then.

706
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,800
Yeah, I would think so, because Fountain is working on a CarPlay app.

707
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,520
If the boost features in there, I'm not sure, but that could be pretty neat.

708
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,520
You can mine Bitcoin on the road as one does.

709
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,640
I've thought about that when I'm going down the road in the RV, I've got solar.

710
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,480
I've got a really big generator or alternator in that thing.

711
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,680
I have got more power than I know what to do with when I'm going down the road.

712
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,680
So why not?

713
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,680
Why not?

714
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:44,760
Sir, license registration officer, I'm so close to a fiftieth of a Bitcoin right now.

715
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,080
Yeah, I don't want to stop now.

716
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,600
I might get some Bitcoin dust.

717
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,600
I don't want to stop.

718
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,600
Oh, man.

719
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,600
All right.

720
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,920
So the Golden Dragon boosted in with another row of ducks.

721
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,920
Thank you very much.

722
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,920
And here's something for your trouble.

723
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,800
So the great show, guys.

724
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,640
How would I go about learning how to set up a hosted service for my own that I can use

725
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,820
outside my home and attach a domain name to it?

726
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,600
You listen to self-hosted.

727
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,600
That's a good start.

728
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,440
I think Golden Dragon probably does.

729
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,680
I was thinking, too, there's some good Leno guides on this.

730
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:22,260
And what you really want is you get a DNS name, you register your domain name, and then

731
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:27,320
you get like a guide for Leno that tells you how to point that domain name to your Leno.

732
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,400
There's several ways to do that, including just changing the name servers, actually moving

733
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,400
them and all that.

734
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,400
You'll have to do some reading on that.

735
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,400
Golden Dragon.

736
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,000
And you probably want to put Cloudflare in front of that.

737
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah, absolutely.

738
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
That's what I'm doing these days.

739
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I'm putting Cloud.

740
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I'm.

741
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Yep.

742
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So that's those Russian bots.

743
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Don't care.

744
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
They're going to keep hitting every port they can find.

745
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,760
Golden Dragon kept it going with a triple boost, one thousand one hundred and eleven

746
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,760
sats.

747
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:57,120
He says, which version of Carolina barbecue are you guys into?

748
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,520
I went several years ago and had eastern northern Carolina style was very impressed.

749
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,000
Hold on.

750
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Hold on.

751
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Yes, there's more than one version.

752
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,740
Oh, my God.

753
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,020
You got to be kidding me.

754
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:13,760
So them or Emacs or Golden Dragon go, you know, can I say something controversial here?

755
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,760
I don't know for sure.

756
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,680
I'd be willing to try this somehow.

757
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:22,040
I think the Carolinans go on about their barbecue because they're just far enough away from

758
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,120
Austin to eat real barbecue.

759
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,880
And so they think they've got great barbecue because they've got good sauces.

760
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,960
Right.

761
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:35,780
But but great Texas barbecue starts with meat that is incredible.

762
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:43,260
And then they custom design a sauce that complements the specific flavor attributes of that meat.

763
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,360
And the two when they go together, change your life.

764
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,280
And I've been hanging out with the Linux Academy and tell people too much.

765
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,600
I'm telling you, Carolina barbecue is amazing.

766
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,920
No, no, I'm telling you, it might be good.

767
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,920
Right.

768
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,920
I mean, it might be like really good.

769
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,920
Right.

770
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,440
But if you get the right barbecue in Austin, Texas, it will change your life.

771
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,000
It'll change your life.

772
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
You will not.

773
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You will leave the barbecue place.

774
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Not.

775
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Why can't we love them both?

776
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Life changing.

777
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
That's right.

778
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Maybe I'm wrong.

779
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm willing to I'm willing to try it.

780
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I'm willing to experiment.

781
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,080
I'm willing to sacrifice that if I have to travel to Texas and the Carolinas to put this

782
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,080
to rest.

783
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,080
By God, I will.

784
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,560
You know what I had for dinner yesterday?

785
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,600
Did you have barbecue?

786
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,920
Mango habanero ribs homemade.

787
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,840
They were fantastic.

788
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,840
All off the bone.

789
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,280
Oh, I didn't make them, but they were great.

790
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,280
All right.

791
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,280
All right.

792
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,540
Splurk boosts in with seven hundred and seventy seven sets.

793
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,540
Great podcast.

794
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,240
I really appreciate your perspectives on the industry.

795
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:45,080
I just wanted to comment on the software conservancy issue we talked about last week, how they're

796
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,840
raising a big stink about GitHub.

797
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:52,580
It seems to me that the SFC and the FSF are actually anti freedom.

798
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:56,880
They simply just don't have patience for devs or companies who want to make a living off

799
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,880
GPL code.

800
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:02,600
They feel more like a religious cult than an altruistic organization.

801
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,440
Microsoft might not be the best open source player, but they are putting money and time

802
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:14,240
into open source and in my humble opinion, that's way more valuable than naming and shaming.

803
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,240
Wow.

804
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:20,840
Now, I feel like he's not giving the FSC and the Free Software Foundation credit for everything

805
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:25,520
they have accomplished, the projects they've supported, the infrastructure they provide.

806
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,280
But I think what Splurk does touch on is the overall vibe that the broader community who

807
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,920
doesn't follow all the nuances and developments is getting.

808
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,600
And I think it's a problem for those organizations because I think it makes them less effective

809
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,600
in messaging.

810
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,600
I don't know.

811
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:46,220
I'd give them a little more credit that I keep seeing this get back in my day, an easy

812
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:51,680
way to get a laugh out of really any dev conference or especially Linux oriented ones was to dunk

813
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,680
on Microsoft.

814
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:58,760
And I feel like just because of how age and time work, many of the people who now run

815
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:05,480
these organizations have a lot of that old like Microsoft is evil bias.

816
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,920
And I'm kind of like, well, they're all evil, right?

817
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,600
Look at what happened to our beautiful son.

818
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,640
It's dead.

819
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,740
And Red Hat is now joined IBM.

820
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:18,400
So I, you know, I would rather a little bit of a little bit of demon blood and they survive.

821
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,960
I think what you're touching on there, I could expand on just a bit by saying with IBM buying

822
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,680
Red Hat and the changes we've seen in the tech industry and honestly also listening

823
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,840
to some of those older clips.

824
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:34,340
So we just recorded the Coderly for our members and we played some old clips, predictions

825
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:38,560
and whatnot that we made from like 2014 and 15.

826
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,720
And after hearing that, after doing that episode and then reflecting on stuff, I'm like, none

827
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,680
of these companies really hold up over the long time.

828
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:53,440
Like if anybody gets too brand loyal or really anything that's too centralized eventually

829
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,900
will disappoint you.

830
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,400
That's essentially what it is.

831
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:03,760
And Linux was a great thing because it's such a decentralized spread out thing that it's

832
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,360
not like one company, there's no Linux CEO, there's no like one company that is running

833
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,360
Linux.

834
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,440
I mean, there's the Linux Foundation now.

835
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,920
Perhaps that'll be a problem at some point as it gets more and more centralized.

836
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,480
But thank you, Slurk, that's some interesting stuff to ponder.

837
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,240
I love the boosts that make us think.

838
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,240
I love all the boosts.

839
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,960
Thank you everybody who does that.

840
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,280
Again, we, of course, we've done this for forever.

841
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,280
We're always, we do this because we enjoy doing the show, we want to make something

842
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,280
for you guys.

843
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,440
So you guys really are our customer.

844
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,400
And what's great about the boosts, what's great about the memberships is it aligns the

845
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,680
business that way too.

846
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,000
So we also, just to wrap it up, we've got a couple of thank you boosts.

847
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,840
200 SATs were streamed from user 6594.

848
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:49,560
We got an additional 222 SATs from Golden Dragon with an early thanks for the show and

849
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,040
saying that his Python journey has been quite the trip.

850
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,720
Golden Dragon on fire, on fire this week with the boost.

851
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,760
Some of, really a big bulk of the support this week's episode came from Golden Dragon

852
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,320
and he's in the live stream right now too.

853
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,920
So like fist bump Golden Dragon.

854
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,240
He's a coder completist.

855
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,640
He probably has a robe.

856
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,640
You're right.

857
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,160
If he doesn't, he should be first on the list.

858
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,280
He is officially a coder completist.

859
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,760
There we go.

860
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,160
Egon's going to have to share some of the wine.

861
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:25,080
We also got 475 thank you SATs for a next episode boost coming from KPOVAC in also in

862
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,480
the chat room right now.

863
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:32,680
And we got a thousand SATs from X thumbs X who says plus one on the coder cocktail swag

864
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,080
idea.

865
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,800
Cocktail glass for the win.

866
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,800
We got to get on that.

867
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,800
We got to get a swag.

868
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:44,320
We got to get on the other side of it, have a laptop just like sparking out a complete

869
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,320
set.

870
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,800
If you'd like to be a member, we would appreciate it.

871
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,320
It's a great way to support the show.

872
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,440
You get the coderly report that we release once a quarter, a little extra episode and

873
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,320
you get an ad free version of the show and in the future, probably towards the end of

874
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:03,600
the year or so you'll get a live version if you'd like a totally unedited, unscripted,

875
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,420
whatever, whatever they call it behind the scenes.

876
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,000
That's what I'm looking for.

877
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:16,120
You can, I advise you though, the drew edited version, much better sound, much better pacing.

878
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,200
Drew does magic really.

879
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,520
So we'll always keep the ad free feed around too so that way members can benefit from that

880
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,620
work he does.

881
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,080
You can sign up at coder QA dot co for that.

882
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,000
Keep an eye out members for the coderly report.

883
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,440
It'll be coming out soon.

884
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,160
We don't have a specific date yet, but cause we just sort of slip it into the work queue

885
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,080
as we have it, but it'll be out soon.

886
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,280
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send the people this week?

887
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,160
Go to Alice.dev if you want some automation goodness.

888
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,160
Who doesn't?

889
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,160
That's right.

890
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,160
That's right.

891
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,160
Alice.dev for that.

892
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,720
You can find the show on Twitter at Coder Radio Show and the whole network where announcements

893
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,080
for all the shows come out and stuffs.

894
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,480
That's at Jupiter signal.

895
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,000
And if you've made it this far, a little pro tip.

896
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,520
We're working on a brand new website.

897
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:09,680
You've got a designer eye or if you're a Hugo expert, go check out Jupiter broadcasting.net.

898
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,560
It's an MVP right now, but we're working on a static site that's generated by GitHub actions

899
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,560
and then auto publishes.

900
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,600
It's going to be awesome.

901
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,000
We have a matrix room where we're discussing that and we have issues on our GitHub if you'd

902
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
like to peruse that.

903
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
We'd love your input.

904
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
This is nice.

905
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,240
Thank you.

906
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,000
