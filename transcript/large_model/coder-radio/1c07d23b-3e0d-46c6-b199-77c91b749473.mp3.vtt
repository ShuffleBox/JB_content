00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 383 for October 12th, 2020.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello, friends, and welcome in to KOTOR Radio,

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
and the world of technology.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Looking to make a high-paying career move?

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
No better place to start than a certification.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
ACG has helped more than 2 million people skill up on the cloud.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
AWS Azure, Google Cloud, exam preps, you're covered.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Go to cloudguru.com.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
My name is Chris, and joining me, like our man that we've snuck down to Florida

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
to monitor all the strange ones, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Hello, Mike.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Hang on, let me rip my shirt off and do a keg stand.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
That's the only way they won't find me out.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I hope you have a Superman shirt underneath that.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
You just paint the S on your chest, actually, in Florida.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah, well, I think you got to commit.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Go tattoo. I mean, why not?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Then you're always ready, you know? You're always ready with that.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Just have to go for it, right? Yeah.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Have you had a good weekend in a week since we've gathered here today?

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Because, you know, we record on a Monday, so it's like a whole lifetime goes by.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah, time does move differently in Florida, much like hell.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
I'm kidding.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Oh, geez.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Sort of.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah, no, things have been pretty interesting.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
I have been tooling around VIM, which I think we're going to talk about.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Oh, yeah, we're going to get there. Yeah, we're going to get there.

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
And, you know, apparently a blood war that I thought had ended rages, rages on.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Indeed, a blood war that we have covered for a while.

01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
Maybe it's worth mentioning if you're listening to this when it's released, which is all of you, for the most part.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Yes, there was an Apple event, and yes, it's the day before we actually record.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
So, no, we don't have many thoughts on it.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
If there is something worth talking about for this show, I'm sure we'll cover it in a future episode.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
But there's plenty of plenty of places to get coverage on the announcements.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
I think if you're looking for Apple podcasts, that might be the easiest thing to find.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah, and if you're looking for news about Apple, boy, you could pretty much just fall into it.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
So but if there's some interesting nugget in there, I think we'll pull it out and talk about it.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
We, you know, we don't expect a whole lot yet, but who knows?

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
So let's start with the feedback. What do you say? You ready for the feedback?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I really hope you didn't offend any SUSE users again.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
One last SUSE one. Sebastian writes in with what I what I expect to be the last note from the Lizards.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
He says, Hello, Chris and Michael. I probably laughed harder.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
That's great. I probably laughed harder during show 381 than contractually permitted.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
To be honest, I work at a German public IT company and I would like to second what a listener wrote in.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
We deploy different Linux distributions in our data centers, but for historic reasons, the standard is SUSE.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
So it gets used quite a lot. And I can confirm that having a certified OS for use in a critical environment does play its part here,

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
which is why we also have a bunch of hellish sap on SUSE machines.

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
My soul grows colder and the cozy feeling of being at home on the command line vanishes.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
Every time I log into an operating system that would not survive a magic wand roundup, things are just subtly different.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
The package repos contain practically nothing beyond the absolute basics.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
And don't get me started on the Windows Wizards for Linux, a.k.a. Yast.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
We were actually evaluating Rancher as a Kubernetes platform before SUSE acquired it.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
And now I just hope they don't break it.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
The ups and downs of SUSE as a company and the ever changing fate of OpenSUSE did not help their cause either.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
OK, that's critical, but he does kind of wrap it up with a bow.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Nevertheless, Chris bravely finished his lizard rant on a positive note.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
So let me add that if you are German based and strive to work on a Linux distribution for a living,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
SUSE is still your best and really only chance.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
There are a lot of capable engineers at the company and they still ship products that are a little odd but working.

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
After all, the kinds of folks I call my admin colleagues managed to get a huge SUSE based infrastructure working really smoothly.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
And Zipper has a small number of functions that I'd like to see an apt one day.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
So that's fair enough. He says, thanks so much and greetings from Germany, Sebastian.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
You know, I think that's probably we've said everything on this.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
And it's funny because here we, you know, normally here our hot take would be, oh, the operating system doesn't really matter anymore.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
It's all about containers in the web.

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
And yet for four weeks we have been talking about the operating system and why it matters.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
And then all of the passion that still is around that topic.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
So I think the operating system might matter still. That's my take.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
I think the important thing is we're wrapping up all the SUSE talk with someone at an IT, at an ISP, he said.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Yeah, I think so. Well, he said he's in a public IT company.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Public IT company in, of course, Germany. So we've come full circle.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
We thought it was Germany only.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
And as I have been told privately at least a dozen times now, again, thank you, Chris.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
You're welcome.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
People do use SUSE in the United States and they don't like any sass about that.

05:26.000 --> 05:33.000
That's the great thing is Chris runs his mouth on the show and then Mike ends up hearing about it in meetings.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Yeah, that's good natured, but yep.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
And all the SUSE people came out of the woodwork.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
Yeah, it was just like, did we put the lizard signal up like in Gotham where all of a sudden just bam, they're there.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I think it's a smell thing. I think I think lizards have a good sense of smell.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Oh, God. You know what, though?

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
This gentleman is not the only person to message me about Rancher OS.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh, they were trying to backdoor me into SUSE again. See how they did that because it doesn't say SUSE on it.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
Right. Oh, yeah, that's a it's like the cereal brand will have a generic brand and then they have like the name brand cereal.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It's like their container or whatever thing you can do.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Mm hmm. Yeah.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
OK, you feel I feel complete. I mean, if people still need to send it in.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
I mean, we don't get to say when the war is over, you know, they could keep the airstrikes can continue, but we'll see what happens.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Well, we're good. So Jonathan Meeks writes back in.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
He says, I have a theory about a gray matter developer.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
So, you know, we have the black matter developers.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
He wants to propose the gray matter developer.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Hey, Chris and Mike, glad to hear the show's back.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
I've missed it. Thanks for the shout out recently in 382.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I think I might be a gray matter developer, he writes.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
I work at a major home improvement retailer and we're making strides towards a startup mentality.

06:45.000 --> 06:55.000
I develop in Java, but we are on the latest LTS and debating on jumping into the six month release cycle to get access to some really awesome features in the language.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
Since day one of my job, we've been developing software that runs on the cloud instead of on individual servers.

07:01.000 --> 07:11.000
And in my mind, a gray matter developer is someone who develops for the enterprise, but tries to bring the innovation collaboration mentality and whatnot to the enterprise development process.

07:11.000 --> 07:19.000
We might be constrained in some ways, but we are given more flexibility to choose the tools instead of being locked in on a particular language or framework.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
In my mind, the dark matter developer would be someone who is locked into a language.

07:23.000 --> 07:37.000
Maybe they're told you have to use Java 8 by the higher ups, where a gray matter developer could be someone who can use Java with a minimum version set to the latest LTS or make some other nuanced choices along with other popular frameworks.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
They have the understanding that they're on the hook for support, of course.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Anyways, I thought maybe it's a random thought.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
Maybe there's a gray matter developer out there who works in enterprise, but has a little more flexibility on the tools they choose.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Do you buy it? I don't know if I buy it.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
I don't think the distinction is strong enough, to be honest with you.

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
I don't think saying someone works at a corporate development job is necessarily akin to saying they don't get to pick what tools they use.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
And that's really what defines the dark matter developers.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Someone who is working at a corporation writing tools for that corporation.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
It's a valuable position, but it's not like writing front end websites for Amazon.com.

08:12.000 --> 08:20.000
It's a steady paced nine to five development job with different levels of support requirements and criticalness and different tools they use.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
But the concept is it's somebody's day job and it's not something that we talk about in the tech press.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
It doesn't get a lot of gloss and glamour.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah, I mean, I think I mostly agree with you.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
I think he does make a point that there is maybe it's not binary, right?

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
Like, yeah, maybe there's like, you know, Sour on the Black, Sour on the White and Gandalf the Gray somewhere in the middle there.

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah, but although Sour on the White is problematic for lots of reasons there, because spoilers for things from the 40s or 50s.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
Or to make an analogy to good and evil Spock from the mirror universe, you know, evil Spock is still kind of good Spock in some ways.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
It's a gray area.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Right. What if you have like half a goatee?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Right. Yeah, right.

08:57.000 --> 09:06.000
I mean, yeah, there's definitely going to be some gradations of like, oh, you work at giant outsourcing IT shop and you are writing Java 8 until the day you die.

09:06.000 --> 09:16.000
Godspeed or you're working at some crazy little company where we just do like Skunk Works projects all the time just to keep ourselves sharp.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
I think there's probably stuff in the middle of that.

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
Having said that, I think the pure dark matter developer, you know, Scott Hanselman coined that phrase years ago.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
And the idea was that it is not just at the time he was kind of, you know, digging on the Ruby people a little bit.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
It's not just the cool hipsters with gold MacBooks sitting under a tree writing beautiful Ruby code, right?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Right.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It's people who, you know, wear a white T-shirt tucked in.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
They get to wear jeans on Friday.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
And, you know, they're sitting, goddammit, they're sitting with Visual Basic.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
That's how their granddaddy did it.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
That's how they're doing it.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Or something.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Right.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I feel like if we attribute the tools, then I don't know.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Well, I'm teasing about Visual Basic.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Some very conservative technology.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Right.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Probably Java or.Net of some sort.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Yep.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
So, I take the point.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
I mean, I wish we actually heard more from people in the dark matter world.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
But I guess then they wouldn't be dark matter people anymore.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
It's sort of like how we never hear from 99% of the audience.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Right.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
You know, what we hear from is between 1 and 5% at most.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Because I would, too.

10:21.000 --> 10:28.000
I would like to basically build a little understanding from the audience of what the average workload is.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
And I want to know all kinds of things, too.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Like, do you work from home now?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Is it more common to work from home?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Were you commuting into work before all the COVID stuff?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
And has that changed?

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Like, I'm curious about what operating systems they let you use and all of it.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
I just, you know, I would love to have, if you're just in a corporate development job,

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
working a regular job, getting, you know, a paycheck and all of that.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Look at that 9-2-5.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Maybe you even have health benefits.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
I'm not sure how that works.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
I don't know what that is.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
What is that?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I hope you have health benefits.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
I do not.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Oh, man.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Actually, I do.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
I have Obamacare.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
But the deductibles, who, baby?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Yeah.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
I have an idea.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Yeah.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Obviously, we've been doing this for, like, eight years.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
No, has it only been eight years?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Maybe it's more.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I think it's more than that.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
You know, the SUSE people, we didn't hear from them for all that time until you, you know, insulted them.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
So why don't we once a week pick a technology group and just be, like, really mean to them?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
You know who are probably developers?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
All those dark matter developers.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
They probably don't know shit about current trends, and they probably...

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
There you go.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
I like it.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
I like it.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
That's just how we have to solicit it.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
That really is so true.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
God, if that isn't how the internet works.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
All right.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
You write in before we have to get mean, okay?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
You've been warned out there.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Don't force them.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
All right.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
So Dinesh writes in.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Kind of speaking of the corporate developer thing, he says, thanks for the show.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I've only started listening since the reboot.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
And get this, he says he's gutted that he didn't discover it earlier.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
How about that?

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
He says, I would have been wiser with my tech choices.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Well, there is some of that.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
We make mistakes, so you don't have to.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
That's true.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
He says, I listen to you guys talk about rust in the latest code of radio.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
And one thing that struck out to me is when Chris mentioned about corporate development

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
and being a slow ship to turn.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
I've been working at my current job for more than two years now, and I couldn't agree more with Chris.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
It becomes frustrating at times.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
I recently have been flirting with the idea of stepping away and working as a freelancer.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
I would like to know what you guys think about working as a freelance developer

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
and if the global market has enough space to employ such a kind of service provider.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
Once again, thanks a lot for the show and wishing JB all of the best with an indie future.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
So Dinesh comes in with what is essentially a perennial question on the show is,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
can market sustain developer?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And I want to go indie.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I've done the corporate thing and I want to go indie.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Dinesh is somebody who is indie.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I got to say, think about it really hard.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
This has got to be my standard advice now, I think on the show.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
But I'm not trying to stop you from what you're doing because if you got an idea

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
and you think you can pull it off, you should go for it because you only live once.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
However, humans always see the grass greener on the other side of the fence.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
So here's what I've just been thinking about the last couple of days is,

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
this is so much harder than I remember running my own business.

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
I mean, it's a good kind of hard and like the victories are juicier and sweeter

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
and the defeats are more, for me at least, I can tuck and roll a little bit easier.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
I don't know.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
There's something about when I'm in the driver's seat and if I scraped the fender,

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
I get less mad than if somebody is borrowing my car and they scraped the fender.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
And then all of a sudden I'm like, oh, how could you do something like that?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
How could you have been so careless?

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
It's like that when I own and run my own business.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
If I scratched the fender, well, okay, that's on me.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
But if my boss is driving the car and they scratched the fender,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
then my boss is an idiot.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
I hate working for a company.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
I don't like knowing, you know, so there are advantages and disadvantages,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
but I will tell you this, Dinesh.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
It's harder than I thought and I've done it before.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
So think about that.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Think about how the mind can play tricks on you.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
I've done this job before and it's harder than I remember.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
And there's like a lot of nice things about just knowing a paycheck's coming in

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
and having health insurance and building up a retirement fund

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
and having free time to explore your own projects.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
There's a lot of nice things about having a jobby job.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
There's a lot of nice things about working for yourself, too,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
and I don't want to dissuade you,

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
but I do feel a bit of a responsibility as somebody who's two,

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
three months into going independent again after a few years of not being independent.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
It's a big commitment.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
And to answer your question, if the market can sustain something like this,

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
I'll give my quick answer to that and then I'll turn it over to you, Mike.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
And that simply is if you have a different enough product that somebody needs,

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
you'll find a market for it.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
So, you know, there's the elephant in the room of COVID, right?

14:57.000 --> 15:04.000
The things I would say if you wanted to be a freelance dev in 2019 are just not viable right now, right?

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
I would say definitely take some time, go to conferences, network,

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
try to hook up with either larger dev shops or people that will give you maybe not the best rate you would get,

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
but, you know, consistent work to fill out those fallow periods,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
because especially when you start, those are going to exist.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
Don't waste time tinkering with, like, nonsense.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
You got to get stuff done.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
You have to be very efficient as a freelancer relative to, you know, whatever.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Like, if you know SUSE, then I'm not even kidding, right?

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Like, if SUSE Server is your thing, then don't even worry about it.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Just work on SUSE Server, right?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Ubuntu is your desktop OS of choice.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Don't feel like you have to, like, go buy a Mac and vice versa.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
You got to just – I guess because you don't have the safety net, like Chris is saying,

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
you really don't have the luxury of just, like, tooling around for the sake of, like, you know, tooling around, right?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah, well said.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
In the past, I would have, again, recommended that you go to a bunch of conferences,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
maybe even try to pick up a side freelance gig and see how you like it,

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
but over the years, I don't actually think that's too viable anymore.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
So my question to you would be absolutely if you want to go do it, do it,

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
but do you have a way to get that first customer to book you?

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
And you're not going to book 40 hours a week, so let's say 20 to 30 a week.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
That doesn't mean you're not working more than that, but it just means you're billing at 20 to 30 a week.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
Do you have that first customer, someone like right off the top of your head that you could call right now

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
and pitch them and be relatively confident that they would be able to, you know, work out a contract with you?

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Yeah, that is a great point.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
When I decided to go independent again, I first brainstormed about who I would like to have as sponsors,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
and those are my clients, right?

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
And in my mind, I thought, you know, System76 and Linode.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
Like, I knew immediately that those would be the people that if I had my first choice who I'd want to work with.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
And I knew once I started to have a conversation with them that things were going in the right direction,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I was like, okay, this is going to work.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Now, you can take that and kind of translate that to your field of work.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
If you have somebody that you think you could probably call up or email and start working with them,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
then that really is probably step one.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
Start getting paid and figure that out, figure out invoicing, figure out all that.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
To Mike's point, be ruthless with your time.

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
You know, I talked to a guy one time who was just convinced he was really a competent Ubuntu administrator,

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
but he was convinced that to go independent, he needed to go get Red Hat certified.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
And he burned three months doing that and spent money and a lot of stress and energy.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I don't really think it changed the game for him much.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I mean, he was now qualified for a different system.

17:45.000 --> 17:52.000
But in the end, you just have to focus on what you're good at and be willing to be a little ruthless

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
and think about it in terms of survival.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
It really is about survival.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
And you'll have the luxury to think about it differently once you have things rolling,

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
income is coming in, maybe you've even staffed up a little bit.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
That's when you have the luxury to start thinking about it from a more higher level,

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
entrepreneurial, grandiose vision level.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
But at the moment, you have to execute.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
And do keep us updated on how it goes, Dinesh.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Even if you decide not to, I'd love to know your rationale or reason for that too,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
or if you decide to pursue it and how it goes.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
We'd love to follow your journey.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
And not to be too doom and gloom.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
It's certainly possible to do, and if you feel passionate about it

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
and you have a good idea of ways forward, by all means, charge.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Linode.com slash coder.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Go there to get a 60-day, $100 credit towards your new account.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
They're my hosting provider.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I've known about Linode forever.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
They've been around since 2003.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
They got started three years before AWS got started.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
And I followed them at community events like Linux Fest Northwest,

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
which they're sponsors of and have helped to make it possible.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
But they're great.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
They provide easy access virtual servers

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
so you can host anything you want in the cloud.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Maybe you just want storage.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
They have S3-compatible object storage.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Or maybe you want to host your website or a portfolio.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Linode can help you there too.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Linode.com slash coder.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
I started using Linode a couple of years ago when I had sold Jupiter Broadcasting.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I wanted to keep my personal stuff separate.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
You know, separation between church and state sort of thing.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
And I started using Linode and realized how great they were.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
And I watched them over the last couple of years just get better and better.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
And now how perfect is it?

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
Here we are bringing Jupiter Broadcasting independent again.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
And we get to work with a company like Linode to make it possible.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Linode.com slash coder.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Go there, support the show, and get a $100 60-day credit.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
And you're also supporting a sponsor that's making it possible

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
for us to go independent again.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Unlike entry-level hosting services that lock you into their platform,

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Linode gives you full back-end access to customize and control your server

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
to fit your needs.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I love their new Cloud Manager UI.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I mean, new to me.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
It's been around for a little while now.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
But when I first started using Linode, I was watching them make some of these

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
upgrades and improvements that now blow everyone away.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Enterprise-grade hardware, next-generation network,

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
and 11 data centers around the world.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
And as you know, Linode costs 30 to 50% less than major cloud providers

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
like AWS or Azure.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
And they've been around longer than Azure.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
They're the largest independent cloud provider, period.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Fully independent, and they're awesome.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
This last weekend, I decided I'd set up a Minecraft server.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
One-click deployment for a Minecraft server.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
It's pretty simple, but you can build it up from scratch

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
to anything that runs on Linux will run on Linode.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
So go to Linode.com slash coder.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
Get that $100 day credit for 60 days and support the show.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Linode.com slash coder.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I learned something new today.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
I learned, or at least was reminded about the traveling salesman problem,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
which I think maybe I'd heard you mention to me once before,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
but had completely forgotten.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
And now it appears there's been a significant breakthrough.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
As one of the scientists put it, her career is now complete.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Well, there you go.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
What else can you say to that?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
So I kind of looked into this.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
The traveling salesman is an optimization problem at the core of it, right?

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
It's a handful of foundational problems that theoretical computer scientists

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
then can use to see how efficient they are at solving a problem computationally.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
For example, the traveling salesman is like routing to cities

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
and trying to make the most efficient routes.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Yeah, so traveling sales problem,

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
it's one of these old computer science problems,

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
something that really like math nerds who might program in Julia

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
would really get excited about.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
There are potentially some practical uses for this breakthrough

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
if they can, you know, make it more than a basically academic paper, right?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Not to downplay it, it's pretty awesome, it's pretty great.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
And it suggests there is more runway to optimizations

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
than perhaps previously thought.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Exactly.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
So it suggests there's more headroom without going into like crazy quantum computing

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
and like stuff like that.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Like there's more computer science algorithmic work that can be done.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
And doesn't that make us all happy?

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
Thrills me, Mike, it thrills me.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
So Hayden Barnes wrote a post titled,

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
No, Microsoft is not rebasing Windows to Linux.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
He says, I have a unique perspective on Microsoft's Linux involvement.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
I helped deliver Ubuntu on the Windows subsystem for Linux

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
in my day job at Canonical.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
I also get briefings on Microsoft products as an MVP.

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
I am deeply skeptical of the notion that Microsoft is going to shift the core

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
of the Windows operating system to the Linux kernel

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
for both product and engineering reasons.

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
And then he proceeds to slay the idea with tons of reasonable rational reasons

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
that Microsoft would never rebase Windows on Linux.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
Not to point out that it's clearly just got all of the pieces of clickbait

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
for tech articles too, which should immediately make one skeptical.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
Well, I know one draft that I'm deleting. Thanks, Hayden.

23:07.000 --> 23:14.000
You know, he makes a point in here that I thought was like interesting.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
I don't know.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Maybe it's not telling, but to me it seemed particularly telling.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
He says, one of the reasons it's unclear if Windows user space

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
could even be rebased from NT to the Linux kernel

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
and maintain some compatibility that Windows is known for.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
So get this, the NT kernel has 400 documented syscalls

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
plus about 1700 documented Win32 API calls.

23:36.000 --> 23:43.000
Linux has 313 syscalls on AMD64. Total.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Part of the reason Microsoft switched from a syscall translation layer

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
with WSL1 to a virtualized kernel with WSL2

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
is because re-implementing all of these crazy calls

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
and non-standard ways developers had to exploit the Linux API

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
was, as he puts it, a pain in the ass.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
So they just said, nope, we're going to do it with a virtual machine.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
Also, he points out, and I agree, Microsoft has doubled down on Windows.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
I feel like Windows 10 has gotten more attention from Microsoft

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
than we've seen in a while.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Okay, so I like Hayden. I know he's a great guy.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
If you don't know, he works for Chronicle.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
Focus listening on the Windows, WSL, Ubuntu stuff.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Right, great.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
You guys both seem to think they've doubled down on Windows 10,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
and I guess I missed it.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Oh, really? You don't see it?

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
Other than Paul Therot, I don't really read any deep Windows people.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
And he's a touch cranky, we could say.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I don't know. I feel like if you look at it,

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
they've kept good with the promise of continually updating Windows.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
They've created the different rings that you can subscribe to

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
to get improvements faster.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
And through that, they have landed new stuff

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
from new versions of DirectX to a whole new version,

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
replacing an Explorer with Edge,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
and WSL itself has been delivered this way.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
To me, when I sit down to use Windows 10,

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
it feels like an operating system that is maintained.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
It's recent, it's still getting active work is being done on it,

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
and there's usually a ton of shit in the Microsoft update and all of that.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
And I get the sense that Microsoft is still investing

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
in using Windows 10 very heavily now.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
Compared to a Linux distribution, it's a ghost town

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
in terms of updates and new things coming in and community involvement,

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
but from a corporate desktop platform,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
it seems like it's still very active to me.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
I guess it seems from the outside,

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
because honestly, I haven't installed Windows 10

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
since WSL 2 was released.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Or actually, when it was in preview.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
And now we're getting somewhere. There we go.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Yeah, okay. Maybe if I had to daily drive it from time to time,

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I wouldn't have this opinion.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Well, because the story we didn't put in the notes here

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
is their new GitHub code spaces, right?

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
Which is effectively VS code in the cloud, but super nice.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Yeah, yeah, right.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
I feel like they're doing more and more to maybe not abstract,

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
but kind of deprioritize the actual desktop.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
Well, see, this is where, again, I think I line up with Hayden.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
He writes, they recognize a more diverse set of operating systems

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
and platforms are powering the computing devices we use,

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
which now includes Android, Ubuntu, iOS, Mac OS,

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
the Echo, Chrome OS, and ARM, not just even x86.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Microsoft has shown that it's able to adapt

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
by making relevant products and services available on those platforms

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
while simultaneously keeping their own platform competitive,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
mostly, I would say.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
And then that's not my addition.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
And then he also points out how they've been driving some innovation

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
in the Android ecosystem even.

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
And I think what you have is a non-bomber Microsoft

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
that is willing to make money from all platforms

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
and is accepted that they missed the mark on mobile,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
and as a result, there's a billion devices out there

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
that don't run their software, don't run their operating system,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
and they've pivoted.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
You know, it's cliche to say Saatchi and Adela has changed things,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
but when you look at the changes throughout the entire stack

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
of the organization, it seems like they have very readily adapted

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
to an environment where they don't have to dominate the desktop

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
and the browser to be competitive, quote unquote.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Yeah, and I think at this point, Saatchi has been there long enough

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
that you can actually say that he really did change things.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
You think?

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Yeah, it's been a couple years, right?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
It's been a few.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
It's been a few.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
Yeah, so I think they are just getting better at playing

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
in everyone's playground.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
I know this has been my hobby horse for the last month,

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
but you mentioned ARM, so you did this yourself.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Okay.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
They all need to know that the Klingon predators from Cupertino

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
are about to decloak on their faces, and with 20 hours of battery life,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
blow them out of the water.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
So I actually agree with you.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
I bet you Microsoft is wise enough to be like,

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
we have to be able to, within a couple months,

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
say that Windows 10 can get on ARM Mac-like performance.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
I know people don't love this take, but I firmly believe that,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
you know what, Apple Silicon is going to be a home run for them.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
Well, and look at how they've stepped up to the plate on,

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
I can speak to iOS, Android, maybe is different, but on iOS,

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
the Outlook app and the Office apps are good.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
They're like really good.

28:27.000 --> 28:33.000
I was surprised I had a client that I was doing several weeks' worth of work for,

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
so they just wanted me in their Teams, Microsoft Teams chat

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
for their meetings and their chat and file transfer,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
and I was really kind of hesitant.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
I didn't want to have to, you know, have yet another chat program

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
and use a Microsoft app that was going to be a substandard app and all of that,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
and you know what, I was really impressed.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
I was like, they actually tried.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
They wrote it like it was a first-class platform,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
and that change in mentality has been a big,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
it's a big shift from where they were, say,

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
in the heydays of the late 90s and early 2000s.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
Look, you have all the Windows OEMs, right?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Let's put them in an ancient town.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
I don't know, let's maybe call it Shaka.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Let's put them in the town of Shaka.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
They have this wall called Intel, and Shaka, the walls are falling.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
I'm telling you, days are numbered.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
Like whoever doesn't catch up is just getting blown away,

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
and it doesn't matter if you're Windows or Linux or what,

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
you're getting hammered because top-of-the-line performance

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
and possibly 20-hour battery life, you have to have an answer,

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
and you're right.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Maybe it may in fact be that we get some super-duper surface,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
and like all these under-the-hood changes

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
that you and Hayden are talking about in Windows 10,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
it makes a ton of sense to me, so yeah, you're right, I'm wrong,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
that they probably are going to do it.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
I think the reason, besides the fact that it's fantastic clickbait,

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
that this rumor keeps percolating,

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
and the same reason why the rumor keeps percolating

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
that Microsoft is going to acquire Canonical

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
is because there is some logic at the core of it.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
It just kind of makes sense in a way.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
Because when I do use Windows, bless its little soul,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
it feels like something from the 90s to me.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
What soul? Ooh, too much.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
It just seems old.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
It seems like it's based on an old technology platform,

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
and I think one of the most under-accredited things

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
that Microsoft suffers from, I guess,

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
is people don't give them enough credit

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
for how in some unbelievable fashion

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
they've managed to drag this code base

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
from the NT days to where we are now.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
And I'm sure they've replaced large sections of it,

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
but still so much technical debt.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
I mean, that must be what a large portion of the team focuses on,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
is just resolving technical debt constantly.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
So let me defend some technical debt here,

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
and this is going to be a mite confession time.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
I have been, for the last several months,

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
aggressively recommending Surface Go tablets to customers.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Aggressively, you say?

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
Because many of my customers now have needs

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
that involve basically automating processes

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
and involve, like, weird hardware dongles, right?

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
Like, things like scales, sensors, all kinds of weird stuff.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Proximity sensors in one case.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
All over USB.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Some over USB. Some over serial bus.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
No.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Hey-oh, oh, yeah.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Jeez, that brings me back.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Morty, we're going back.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Wow.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
And there is one operating system that stands alone

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
in terms of whatever crap we're going to order from overseas,

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
there's going to be a driver,

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
and if there's not, the random Windows generic drivers

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
are good enough that you can at least get the data off the serial port, right?

31:53.000 --> 31:58.000
Yep, and there will likely be some really horribly designed application

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
that that weird hardware comes with that only works on Windows

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
and may have to have administrative privileges and all of that,

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
but it only works on Windows.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
Well, and for our purposes, we're actually writing compatibility

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
with this hardware directly into custom applications

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
we're making for our clients.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
So it's like we're going all the way down,

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
in many cases importing, like, com libraries to do this stuff.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
But they still support those com libraries.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
I just want to say that, right?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Like, it's still there.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Yeah, and that's one of the biggest arguments for,

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
or I should say against, this rebasing,

32:29.000 --> 32:35.000
is that it would undermine one of the huge values

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
that it brings the enterprise space, is that level of compatibility,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
which one day will have to go away.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
I mean, ultimately, that's why I say the argument does make some sense

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
because all of these are extremely valid reasons in 2020,

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
but what about 2040?

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I mean, I know that seems like forever away,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
but it's just as far away into the future

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
as my history with Windows goes into the past, right?

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
It's not, I mean, it's within the realm of my lifetime.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
There's just, I can't see it conceivable that there's still

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
a Windows desktop operating system running off an NT base.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
It just doesn't seem conceivable in that time.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
But can't you see some sort of like, you know, WNTL

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
or whatever you want to call it, some sort of system, right,

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
where they're basically just virtualizing a little NT kernel?

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
Of course, I mean, because CPU architectures could be different,

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
it's going to be virtualized.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
And that's when, so when Hayden makes a lot of these arguments,

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
if you keep in the back of your mind, well, a really modern hypervisor

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
with direct hardware access that is even more capable

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
than something like what we see with WSL2 or KVM at its best,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
something that's even maybe built in with CPU support

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
like Apple's doing with their virtualization on the Mac platform.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
And now imagine that 20 plus years down the road, right?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
That could be just super high performance.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I mean, it could be virtualization in a sense,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
but nothing like we think of it today.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
And when those kinds of technologies are available,

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
it just seems preposterous to think that they wouldn't take advantage of it.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
So if they were going to do something like that,

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
would they create a brand new operating system from scratch

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
with its own kernel and all of that?

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Or would that be the time to switch?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
It almost gets back to the CPU architecture stuff

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
because I have sort of been on the bandwagon

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
that like ARM is going to take over the world.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
But what if it doesn't?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Yeah.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
And somehow we see an explosion in like, you know,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Chris Lattner, I forgot the name of the firm he's working at,

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
but he's the guy who invented Swift or from Apple.

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
He's working with some company that's making like custom risk architectures for people.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
And we could possibly, you know, this is not my argument,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
but I've heard it before,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
be in a world where there's like an explosion

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
in like bespoke custom architectures for really optimized devices.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Yeah.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
I don't believe that for like business reasons of, you know,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
scale and things have to make sense.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
Well, except for, you know, the Mac becomes a type of use case.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
The phone is a type of use case,

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
a desktop tower that's running risk processes or open power PC processors.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
The thing, the argument I would give against ARM fully taking over.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I can absolutely see why it is,

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
why it is winning super hard in vertical solutions.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
I really, it really makes a lot of sense on a vertical solution,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
like what Apple or Samsung does.

35:10.000 --> 35:15.000
But zooming out from there, ARM has been around for 20 plus years

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
and it really still hasn't managed to replace x86.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
And I think part of the reason for that is,

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
it's still very complicated.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Like just look at the Linux support

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
and how when you want to boot Linux on an ARM small board computer,

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
you really need to get a kernel that supports that GPU

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
and that boot method on that particular SBC.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
And you can't just take Ubuntu 18.04

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
and boot it on a Pine 64 or Rock Pro 64

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
and then go boot it on a Raspberry Pi 3.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
It just, it doesn't work like that.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
The developers have to put special effort into ensuring compatibility

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
with each one of those SBCs.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
And it's not like that with x86.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
You don't have to download a certain kernel

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
that works with gigabyte motherboards using Ryzen processor

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
and a gigabyte motherboard using an Intel processor with an Nvidia GPU.

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
You don't have to get an ISO that slices and dices it all the way down like that

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
because it's become a general compute platform.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
ARM hasn't really reached that yet

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
because each implementation is to its own in a sense

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
because people are licensing and then building a system around that.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
And what we have is a whole lot of fragmentation.

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
And you wonder if a totally open system like RISC or OpenPowerPC

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
wouldn't be a little bit more akin to that general computing platform.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Like it wouldn't be more of an easier transition.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
It'd be more of a horizontal move.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Just some workloads would use RISC CPU.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Some workloads would use x86.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Some would use ARM.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Some would use OpenPowerPC.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And it would not become an assume

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
that the predominant workload is run on x86.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
But it also wouldn't be ARM.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
It's going to be this multiple CPU future, I suspect.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
And then you'll have different vendors

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
who do these vertical integrations where they just nail it

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
and they just manage to eek every bit of performance out of that vertical stack.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
And then you'll have more general systems that maybe don't really nail it so much

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
but they make a good server platform or something.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
They have overall a good heat distribution, power use, and performance ratio.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
It's a multi-CPU future, Mike.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
That would actually be very interesting and incredibly complicated.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Yes. Yes, very much so.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
And you wonder where it all lands.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
And if maybe because if it gets more complicated

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
maybe it kind of ends up insuring some x86 longevity

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
just because it's a default going to work solution.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Yeah, who knows?

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
This will be one of those clips we play in a few years and we either blew it.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Or we were weirdly right.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Yeah, right. Exactly.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
Well, we actually we got to get to the main story of the day, really.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
I mean, that's really the topic that we should dig into.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
So we'll take a moment.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
I'm going to thank a Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode of the Coder Radio program.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
And they have something kind of special I want you to check out.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
They have a programming use cases course with Python.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
The best way to learn and improve as a programmer

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
is really to practice your programming skills by solving problems.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
So what a Cloud Guru has is a completely project-based course

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
that will walk you through various projects from start to finish

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
by breaking down the problems and solving them using Python.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
And along the way, you'll learn intermediate to advanced Python topics.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
And then you get to see how you apply those concepts

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
to the things you've already learned to solve different problems.

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
Learn some programming and solve some problems using Python.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
We'll have a link in the show notes to check that out.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
It's four hours of content, 31 total lessons, and five hands-on labs.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
A Cloud Guru dot com or use the link in our show notes

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
to go directly to the programming use cases with Python course.

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
And thanks to a Cloud Guru for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
So there's this tech story going on right now that proclaims

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
to hold the future of programming in its hands.

39:01.000 --> 39:07.000
And you'll find all kinds of coverage on this story

39:07.000 --> 39:12.000
from the sky is falling to there's a group out there

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
that says that you have to defend free trade

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
and Google must be punished for what they've done.

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
And of course, I'm referring to the now classic Oracle v. Google,

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
which has been going on since the start of this show

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
for a decade this thing's been going.

39:29.000 --> 39:35.000
Essentially, Oracle is contending that 37 Java APIs used in Android

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
are subject to copyright.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I can't believe this crap is still going on.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
This is the story that never dies.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
And because we've had the break

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
and because this story has been going on for a decade,

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
Mike and I thought maybe we should sort of do a bit of reset

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
to bring you up to speed.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
We're just going to tell you the stuff that matters.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
And it probably starts with something we love to talk about.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
And that's Sun Microsystems.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Thank God I got to get a handkerchief to cry into.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
So I have this really, really adorable clip

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
from the heyday of Sun Microsystems.

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
Well, that's not really true, but it was the heyday of Java

40:11.000 --> 40:17.000
about 1995, Sun Microsystems was 25 years old.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Somewhere around there.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
I may have the math wrong,

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
but I think it was 25 years into Sun Microsystems' life.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
It had already been around, yeah.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
It had been around for a while.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
That's the point I'm trying to make.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
They were feeling good, right?

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
And it's funny, Mike, they had a slogan back then.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
And this is the 90s, right?

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
And it was even before then that they came up with this.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And it was so on point.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
The network is the computer.

40:40.000 --> 40:48.000
The first 25 years at Sun have been just huge amounts

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
of innovation.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
We popularized TCPIP.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
We stunned the world with NFS.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
We delivered Spark and Solaris and Java

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
and all of the other new technologies

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
that you've seen Sun deliver.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
And we're on 6 billion devices.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
Sun started with a very simple idea,

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
which is to take open standards on the software side

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
and combine them with open standards on the hardware side,

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
which at the time was apparently quite revolutionary,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
and everybody liked it.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
So this whole notion of open systems really started

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
with Sun Microsystems 25 years ago.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
Early on in Sun's career, long before I got here,

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
was a fundamental idea that if you propagated a standard

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
across the world and literally shared it with the world,

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
you would create for yourself more opportunity for yourself

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
and for your customers and all the developers

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
who worked with both of you.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Our whole strategy of sharing open interfaces,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
open source, even open sourcing the hardware

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
is going to create just an explosion of technology.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
I think what really sets Sun apart is the idea

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
that we live so fully by the idea that you should share

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
your innovation with the world.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Sun was really the first company that defined open standards.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I think that's an interesting little bit right there

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
about how open they are and how they felt like

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
you should share your innovations with the world.

42:01.000 --> 42:07.000
So I believe around their 25-year birthday,

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
they were about three years from being sold and going defunct

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
when this clip was recorded.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Somewhere in that range.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
The chat room, Optimus Gray got the date for me.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
Sun Microsystems was founded on February 24th, 1982.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
And they recorded this, and then three years later,

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
they were gone.

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
And I think you could blame the fall of Sun Microsystems

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
on a bit of being a victim of the dot-com boom and bust.

42:37.000 --> 42:42.000
Also, the x86 market combined with Linux

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
ate a lot of their special use case lunch.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
And you heard them there.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
They were famous for NFS.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
And that's why they also were really well known for storage

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
and one of the reasons that they started

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
the ZFS file system project.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
But they also started this little thing known as Java.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
And this little thing known as Java had APIs,

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
which Google needed to re-implement in order to have Java compatibility

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
so that way they could reach a large user base quickly.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
And in doing so, they directly re-implemented some of this,

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
which Oracle contends is 37 APIs.

43:17.000 --> 43:22.000
Google contends that not only did they not need a license for this,

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
but that Sun was totally fine with them using it.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
And Sun even knew about it potentially.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
And that actually does seem to check out former Sun's CEO.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
I have a link in the show notes.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I said, yeah, they don't need to pay for a license.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
Jonathan Schwartz, which he was the CEO at the end of Sun Microsystems,

43:41.000 --> 43:46.000
he was interviewed by CNET back in 2012.

43:46.000 --> 43:51.000
And he said, as long as Google didn't use the name Java,

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
he was fine with it.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
They didn't need a license for the APIs.

43:54.000 --> 43:59.000
That's according to the CEO who was running Sun at the time Google adopted

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
and started using Java.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
So I think that's pretty noteworthy.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
But flash forward, Oracle buys Sun as times change.

44:06.000 --> 44:13.000
And some emails also came out that seemed to indicate that Android Chief

44:13.000 --> 44:18.000
Andy Rubin actually felt they did need to license the APIs

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
and that they were copywritten.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
And he wrote a couple of ideas on how they could address the issue.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
And then they never did.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
But they appear to have identified it as a potential issue that these APIs

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
may be considered copywritten.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
And they appear to have evaluated the risk and continued to proceed.

44:37.000 --> 44:42.000
Oracle got its hands on those emails, which I have linked in the show notes,

44:42.000 --> 44:48.000
and brought that to the court and has started this case that has gone back

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
and forth and back and forth.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
And I have a quick clip from Bloomberg to bring us pretty close to present.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Both Google and Oracle have won, lost, appealed.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Where are we now?

44:59.000 --> 45:04.000
Yeah, so we're on the third go-around now between appeals and trial.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
As you said, the case was filed in 2010.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
There was a trial.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
There was an appeal.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
There was another trial.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
There was an appeal.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
Now we've gotten to the point where it looks like Google may petition

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
the Supreme Court.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
They were on the losing end of the last round of appeals in which,

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
as you said, the court ruled that their use of the Java APIs was not fair use

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
and that there was no defense to the infringement and that it needs to go

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
back to the trial court to decide what damages are owed Oracle, if any.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
Well, and Google has made that appeal, and verbal arguments have been heard

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
by the Supreme Court after a delay due to COVID.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
And the consensus from the journalists attending that verbal hearing,

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
or I'm sorry, that virtual hearing because it was done like in a Zoom-type call,

45:46.000 --> 45:51.000
is that the Supreme Court seems to be seeing things Oracle's way.

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
And the fallout could be that a company could decide that another company

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
that's used their APIs is now violating copyright.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
And you could see how this could spread throughout the industry

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
like a wildfire of lawsuits.

46:04.000 --> 46:09.000
It sort of sets a precedence from the Supreme Court level that could be

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
retroactively very bad for the development community.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
So I think that brings us up to current.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Yeah, this is a mess.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
It's been going on for a decade.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
Towards the end there, Sun was cursed with an ancient gypsy curse that they

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
couldn't make money while having one of the most popular programming languages

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
in the world.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Great.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
There's a lot of history, Chris.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
I don't know how far back into like the tit for tat because this lawsuit has

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
gone through a number of phases.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
And for me, the thing that's always been the most striking and what always felt

46:40.000 --> 46:48.000
like it was going to go Oracle's way, I think it was 2012 maybe.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
They had a really damning testimony from Andy Rubin.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
He was the head of Android at the time.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
And he was getting grilled by Oracle's lawyer.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
And he was reading through that email thread we've mentioned.

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
And in there, Andy Rubin says, we probably have to license this because our guys

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
have seen this.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
There's no way we can do a clean room implementation.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
And that in being an email that Oracle had, the lawyer seized on that part

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
about how they couldn't do a clean room implementation and was able to

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
essentially get Rubin to admit that meant that they had been too inspired by

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
the Java code.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
And it kind of got them in this bad light.

47:25.000 --> 47:30.000
And since that, I really feel like since that testimony in 2012, it has been

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
lose after lose for Google.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
And the tech press has just done a really poor job of understanding what's going

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
on here because they're just so inherently pro Google.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Yeah.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
And this is a big case of emails.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
I mean, there was a couple of cases where the Sun attorneys were able to

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
examine the source code or I'm assuming engineers who work for the attorneys

47:47.000 --> 47:52.000
and find cases where they had literally copied Sun's code, leaving the comment

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
lines, you know, like the comment headers in the files.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Yeah.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
Which was not very smart.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
So what do you make of all this doom and gloom that like if Sun wins, this is

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
going to be, you know, there was that op-ed in the Wall Street Journal by the

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
general counsel from Microsoft with Google's general counsel, apologies for

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
not knowing their names, where basically Microsoft is taking Google's side,

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
you know, painting the sky is falling argument here.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I do think it would be a bad thing.

48:19.000 --> 48:25.000
I think it could open us up to a new generation of patent style lawsuits that

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
only instead of being patent law would be copyright law.

48:28.000 --> 48:34.000
However, zooming out and going to a higher level, it could also force a

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
further shift to free software and open source where this problem is solved.

48:39.000 --> 48:44.000
It's implicit in the license agreement upfront, you know, and there's no gray

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
area.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
There's no possibility you're going to get screwed by big mega corporation

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
that wants a piece.

48:49.000 --> 48:54.000
It is clear and free to navigate and it could draw more people to using more

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
free software and open source development.

48:56.000 --> 49:01.000
And I don't know, maybe you would actually be in not in their best interest

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
in the long term.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
But I could be wrong.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
See, it's funny because our experience with patent rules over the years has

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
made me think that in fact, that is exactly what will happen.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Right.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Somebody is going to run around and say, oh, well, you know, we invented

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
this method for blah, blah, blah.

49:16.000 --> 49:21.000
I wonder if it's the actual copying of the code that gets them hit because

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
you could see a way where maybe they rule narrowly and throw out a lot of

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Oracle's claims.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
This is where like lawyers can go back and forth on this all day long.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
This wouldn't be too surprising of an outcome, though, would it be a pretty

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
down the middle outcome that gets Oracle the win they want?

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
They get some money but doesn't set precedents for the rest of the industry.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Some sort of narrow ruling could happen here.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
And that would probably be at this point the most ideal outcome, because I

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
don't think you're going to have Google walk away winning this.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
It doesn't seem like it, at least.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
I guess oral arguments don't necessarily indicate the final judgment of the

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Supreme Court.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
It just doesn't look super good.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
I mean, I'm sure they're kicking themselves in the butt now because it would

49:58.000 --> 50:04.000
have been much easier to make a deal with Sun than to make a deal with Oracle.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
I mean, Google was doing good at that point.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
They had plenty of money.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
Plenty of money.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Maybe they should have bought Sun.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Wow.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
That would have been, yeah.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Yeah.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Here's a hot take on it, though.

50:15.000 --> 50:22.000
I think this is yet another devastating blow to computer users in the tech

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
industry that is being delivered to us by Google.

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
They dumped Android on us, and they used Java to make it popular.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
They undercut developers out there.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
They've done one thing after the other.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
I mean, I could also sit here, and I could rile on consumer privacy and all

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
the data collection they do.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
I could talk about the advertising market and what they've done to the

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
browser market.

50:44.000 --> 50:49.000
I could talk about how they had a great thing going with carriers, but they

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
capitulated to companies like Verizon and Sprint and let them ship their

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
crapware so that way they could compete with Apple.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
I mean, there's so many areas where you look back in modern computing

50:59.000 --> 51:05.000
history, and Google has screwed the little guy for their own gain.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
I guess I'm just not really feeling very sorry for Google right now.

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
I don't want them to lose this because I think the overall net impact on the

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
industry is bad, but they should be held accountable for putting us in this

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
position because they're going to screw all of us again.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
They never get held accountable for this.

51:24.000 --> 51:29.000
When you read ours or pretty much any of the tech coverage, they're

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
essentially trying to put all of this on the fault of Google's counsel.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
Oh, Google's counsel didn't argue very well.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
It's Google's counsel's fault for not representing the situation properly.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
That is such horse manure.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
It is such horse manure.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
It is the tech industry trying to backwards figure out how they're going to

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
problem solve for the company they've been advocating the entire time when

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
they don't have a solid case, and they actually did possibly make a wrong

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
choice.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
They made a mistake, and it's going to possibly screw all of us.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
You just see them backfilling it by blaming it on the counsel, and we'll

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
just move on.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
It'll be Oracle's the bad guy.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Oracle's the big evil company.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Larry Ellison, he's so bad.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
That'll be the coverage, and there will be no accountability for once

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
again Google screwing us.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
You have to go back to the time though, right?

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
What Google was afraid of was losing their, don't say monopoly because they

52:22.000 --> 52:27.000
don't like that, but their stranglehold on search because of iPhone, right?

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
Remember, that was the problem they were solving.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
They weren't really trying to make a great OS.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
They were trying to get an OS that's popular enough that they would retain

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
their search dominance.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
Which is why they made those undercutting deals with the carriers that let

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
them shovel their crapware on Android phones.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
Why they gave billions to Apple to put Google as the default search in mobile

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
Safari, right?

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
But there is like a kind of comedy of errors aspect to this, and I know people

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
hate it when I bring this up, but it's just so damn funny.

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
One of the things that was revealed in one of these many trials was that in a

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
set of emails, they knew that they had an easy way out.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
They're good friends at Microsoft.

53:10.000 --> 53:16.000
They could have easily just used Hot Net and C sharp and not had to pay a damn

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
thing to anybody.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
Back then, they desperately, deeply hated Microsoft.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
They hated, right.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
It was just like actual, if you look at it, like actual animosity that stopped

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
them.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Yes.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
And they kind of figured Sun were a bunch of wimps, right?

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
I'm sorry.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
And back then, you know, they thought this was the way to go.

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
There's all these developers who intimately are familiar with Java and we

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
could have a winner.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
They didn't make that decision from a performance and battery life

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
standpoint.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
And remember, it was these slow old mobile arm CPUs back then.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
So it was so much worse.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
I think particularly young people don't know how bad those first Android

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000
devices were and how unoptimized the whole Android stack was.

53:54.000 --> 53:59.000
They have done so many major improvements over the years to speed up

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
launching and real time building of these apps that it's it's a non-issue

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
now.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
But back then it was painful.

54:06.000 --> 54:12.000
You have Android devices that require double the memory and they'd have a

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
worse battery life.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Jiggity scrolling.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Yeah.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
Oh, I mean, it's still not great, but it was so bad back then.

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
And so it was clearly a move to just dominate the market at every level.

54:22.000 --> 54:26.000
And it was just to me, it seems like they decided it's a risk calculus

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
we're willing to make.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Let's proceed.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Damn the consequences.

54:31.000 --> 54:36.000
They were fundamentally right in that the reason they just kind of rolled

54:36.000 --> 54:42.000
Sun was because, again, I loved Sun, but like everybody was Steve Wozniak

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
at Sun.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
But you needed like a jerk.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
You needed someone who's like, I don't care about open source.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
I don't care about the community.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Go to hell and pay us.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
Yeah, because Sun very promptly.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Sun made nothing on this.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
A lot of the history of Java is the history of Sun building this great

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
thing that millions of developers ended up using.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
And they didn't get a goddamn thing.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
You got to remember, though, they did make a lot of money in large

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
business with some of their...

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
On Solaris, yeah.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
Solaris and even in the printing industry, like they did have some

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
fundamentals, but time changed.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
I think when the idea of Java came along, they had another cash cow.

55:20.000 --> 55:25.000
They were making good money and they saw this as part of an overall

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
strategy.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
They never really got to the point where they could just completely

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
monetize off of Java directly.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
And by the time they started trying to make efforts to do that, it was

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
just too late.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
Right.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Well, they had the Spark stations.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
Right.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
That was one of their...

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Towards the end, that was like...

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
Remember Next was their competitor?

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
Yeah.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Remember Next?

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
Another good win there.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Well, I actually think it was Jobs who coined the term, the computer is

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
the network, and then Sun adopted it and it perturbed Jobs quite a bit.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Yeah, but Spark...

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I mean, Spark stations at the time were very good.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
They were also ridiculously expensive.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
Yeah, the bank I worked for had a few of them to run all the check

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
printing and the statement printing.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
But it's neither here nor there.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
I mean, we can both be sad for Sun because a world...

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
I just want to say a world where Sun was one of the big tech players

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
today would be just like a fundamentally different world.

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
I think there's a really fundamental business lesson in this.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
See, one of the things that you touch on and other people don't really

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
mention this and I think it's an astute analysis on your part is Google

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
did a risk calculation when it was Sun Microsystems.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
And you can see from statements from the CEO and you hear it from that

56:27.000 --> 56:31.000
clip that I played, I think Google was right to assume they could

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
probably just proceed to use all that stuff and it was going to be okay.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
That was the spirit of Sun Microsystems back then.

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
But the business mistake was not considering that things change,

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
businesses sell, and new owners come rolling in.

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
You've got to protect yourself from all kinds of eventualities.

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
And if you're going to base a new mobile platform that will be a

56:53.000 --> 56:58.000
keystone aspect of your business, you need to cross the old T's and dot

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
the old I's and get something on paper that says you're good to use this.

57:02.000 --> 57:06.000
Because while I think you can just infer from just the clip I played,

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Sun was cool with it.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
When Oracle came along, that's a different business.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
They see use of their property as they see it differently.

57:14.000 --> 57:19.000
And Google screwed up in not just getting that license on paper,

57:19.000 --> 57:23.000
even if it was something from Sun that said, you know, one paragraph,

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
use it as you will like, God bless Sun Microsystems.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
That would have prevented all of this.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
And the fundamental business mistake is right in there.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
And I think all of us should take that as a lesson.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
The business you deal with today may not be the business you're dealing

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
with tomorrow, especially in the tech industry, and they didn't protect

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
themselves from what seems like, in hindsight at least, an obvious eventuality.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
One thing I don't know, has it ever come out, when Sun was on the ropes,

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
was there not anybody at Google, like have there been any emails released

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
to this effect that was saying, hey, we have this giant liability bomb.

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
And, you know, because they did still hate Microsoft because, right,

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
there was rumors that Microsoft was going to buy Sun.

58:04.000 --> 58:09.000
Like, maybe we need to go help out Uncle Scott McNeely, right?

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
I don't know, man. I haven't seen anything.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
I haven't seen anything either.

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
It's such a weird oversight to say, maybe we can't let them fall, right?

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
You're thinking about it from a Google now that's bought Motorola.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
You know, they bought Nest.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
They've done all these weird purchases and investments,

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
so it seems totally reasonable that Google would make a purchase like that.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
Yeah, because I think today they would just buy it away.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Yeah, that's how they would solve this.

58:31.000 --> 58:35.000
But Google back then was, they were pure.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Remember like the big thing about Google used to be that if they bought a company,

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
they would rebase the company's entire infrastructure on their own systems.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Which was insane.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
Those kinds of things just started going away a little bit.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
And they started lowering their standards,

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
and they started buying and then selling companies for a loss.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
And now it seems like in that hindsight, yeah, they should have just done that.

58:55.000 --> 59:00.000
It probably would cost them about what they're going to end up paying Oracle in fees.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
And God only knows once you add the lawyer costs.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
I mean, they've been fighting this for a decade.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
What kind of expense must that be?

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
And just a drain on company resources and time and energy.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
You know, it's just a case for the only one I really feel bad for is son.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I'm sorry.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Yeah, absolutely, because there's no really good guys in this.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Right.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
And I get Google was a little more scrappy at the time,

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
so it's kind of like, you know, whatever.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
You take risks when you're small.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
But remember, Chris, don't be evil.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
Yeah.

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
I mean, I know, you know, I've been talking about this forever,

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
but it feels like something significant is about to happen

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
now that it's at the Supreme Court.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
2020 may be the wildest year yet when it comes to, you know,

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
like every category has something going on in life.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
I got to tell you, if the doom and gloom projections are even half correct

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
about what this could be, it is going to be a rough time to be in ISV.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Yeah.

59:51.000 --> 59:56.000
Probably regardless, this entire case is going to be something that people study.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
Yeah.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
This is going to be something that's taught to future students.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
And if it really does have even half the outcome that the doomsdayers are saying,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
people will be trying to educate themselves on what happened.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And it'll be a moment in our life where it'll feel like everything changed,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
but it took a decade to get there.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And you see it slowly building again right now with the tech companies

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
and the talk about antitrust.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And I think it's interesting that IBM just announced their quote unquote breaking up,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
which is very much monopoly terms,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
which of course they were not really at a risk of when it comes to cloud.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
But it's just interesting that I think we're about to see the results

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
of something that's been a decade in the works,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
while something that's also going to affect the tech industry over a decade

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
is beginning to spin up right now.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
But don't you think it's kind of their fault?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I mean, all of them.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
They got a little too fat and a little too happy.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Yeah.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
And it's time for a hangover.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Yeah.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I mean, the size of the tech industry is bizarre.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I can't even comprehend how large Apple is.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
No.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
No, you really actually can't.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I mean, I think the only way I can kind of begin to wrap my head around how rich Apple is

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
is when I compare them to the wealth of nations.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Right.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
They won't be the last company that's this size.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
That will have significant ramifications.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
We'll see.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Well, I want to thank the members.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
We had our first quarterly report go out,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
and a few folks went and signed up at coderqa.co to get access to that

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
and to get access to the limited ad feed.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
It's a quarterly report that we put out.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And when you become a member, you support the show, you get access to that report

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
and to the limited ad feed at coderqa.co.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Thanks to everybody who supports us over there.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Mr. Dominic, is there any links you want to inform the people about this week or plug?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Actually, you know what?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I just had our friend Wimpy on the Mike Dominic show,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
so I think you'll all like that.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Check that out.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Oh, very good.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Very good.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Is it out?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
It's out.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Yeah, it's out.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
We should toss a link in the show notes so people can get it real easy.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
They can just go listen to that after this.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Sure.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
All right.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Well, the show is at Coder Radio Show, I think, or is it Coder Show?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Dang it.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Why don't I know this?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Coder.show.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
No, no.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I'm talking about the Twitter handle.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
This is how you know I'm just not a Twitter guy anymore.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
It's Coder Radio Show, and somebody else has it at Coder Radio,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
and they do not like it when I keep forgetting.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
That's great.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
You know, we ought to just have a campaign of accidentally aggravating them

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
until they just hand over the account.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Wow.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Yeah.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
So the site URL is – no, I kid – is coder.show,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
and you can get links to what we talked about today at coder.show slash 383.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And I think that's just about everything.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I'd love to have you join us live.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Maybe I'll mention that.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
We do this show Mondays, noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
We've got a chat room that goes along with us, and we love having you there.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.000
and we'll see you back here next week.
