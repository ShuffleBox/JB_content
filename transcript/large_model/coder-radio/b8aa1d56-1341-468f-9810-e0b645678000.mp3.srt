00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 453 for February 14th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,200
Hello everyone and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,420
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,960
My name is Chris and joining me with a gold podcasting mic, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
Hello, Mike.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,720
Hello, Chris.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,920
How are you today in beautiful Kyiv?

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,240
I like to call it Kiev.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,640
I'm old school about that.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,240
Well, there's two pronunciations.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,640
Something I learned in the breathless coverage in the wonderful Morning Joe show this morning.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
Yeah, man.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
You know what?

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,040
I've actually decided to just turn off the news for the next couple of days.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,320
I'm taking like a news diet.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,320
I can't.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,200
The love of my life, Victoria Nuland, started me on this path.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,560
Yeah, you got to make sure.

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,360
And I'm really just trying to glue this thing, Chris.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
That's all I'm trying to do.

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,800
I'm trying to glue it.

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
That would be great.

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
We could just glue this thing.

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
That would be great.

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,280
I think it's going to be a pretty fun, you know, for her, it's going to be a pretty fun

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
experience.

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
She's going to hand out sandwiches again.

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
She's going to be great.

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
So don't you worry about her.

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,760
I think she's going to be like, told you so.

31
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,680
It's the Pacific Northwest that is in absolute chaos.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,520
And if I wanted to take a news diet and I was a Mazda driver, I would have zero choice.

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,280
But to listen to the news every moment I was in my car as news of this scandal made it

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
to your shores.

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
No.

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
What's this?

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
What scandal?

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,080
A brilliant software bug has struck some Mazda drivers in the Seattle area.

39
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
Oh, yeah.

40
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,840
That listen to our local NPR affiliate.

41
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,240
Now their head units are locked into that NPR affiliate.

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
No matter what they do.

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,240
They can't.

44
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,080
This infotainment system doesn't boot up enough for them to turn it off, to change it to a

45
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,040
different channel or even see their backup camera.

46
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,000
It is always playing NPR.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,720
This programming is possible thanks to listeners like you, whether you like it or not.

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,400
You're listening to NPR.

49
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,800
You're done.

50
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,280
Welcome to the quiet storm.

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Yes.

52
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,220
Now, initially the response was now Mazda is going to take care of people, but initially

53
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,040
the response was you're going to have to go schedule it with a vendor with a service repair

54
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,920
area and you're going to have to spend fifty hundred dollars on a new head unit because

55
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,480
there's no way we can fix this problem.

56
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,400
We just have to replace the whole head unit.

57
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,720
Can you guess what kind of software bug?

58
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,000
What could have conceivably caused this?

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
The initial speculation was 5G.

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,320
I'm not kidding.

61
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:40,800
OK, so so the bug is I'm in my Mazda as one is and I am being tormented.

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,720
Now did I have to tune to the NPR station myself?

63
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Yes.

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Yeah.

65
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,520
You you had to be a listener originally for this bug to occur.

66
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,000
This sounds like a really funny hack.

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,480
Are we sure this is a bug?

68
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,640
It is a bug, but it's a ridiculous bug.

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,040
OK, don't let me tell you.

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
I'll just tell you.

71
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
You're never going to guess it.

72
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,960
Of course, the radio station uses this third party intermediary company.

73
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Oh, God.

74
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,600
That supplies metadata to the radio.

75
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,000
You know, the radio head units that show the channel name and the song you're listening

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
to.

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Like the guy's picture or the girl's picture.

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sure.

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,320
Apparently, yeah, they can do pictures now.

81
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,720
And this third party company included a JPEG that didn't have the file extension.

82
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Yes.

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
Yeah.

84
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,280
And that broke the head units forever.

85
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,080
I think that's the best.

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,440
I feel bad because it sounds super frustrating actually driving around for a few weeks with

87
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,080
like no control over your radio.

88
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,160
I don't think I'd drive the car.

89
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,800
So I'm just wondering what kind of system this Mazda head unit must be.

90
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,840
A lot of those head units are actually what is like Q and X.

91
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Are you thinking of Q and X?

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Q and X.

93
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Thank you.

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Was to say it's the cute thing, right?

95
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
Yeah.

96
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,760
The Q and X systems don't give a crap about file extensions.

97
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,960
I mean, it helps, but I've done it.

98
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
You shouldn't do it.

99
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,280
It's such an edge case.

100
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,760
You can kind of understand why they wouldn't test for it, although you can understand why

101
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,920
they should, but why maybe they didn't think of it.

102
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,720
I think it's just perfect that it's NPR.

103
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,440
I know.

104
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,320
It's like probably the most chill, frustrating radio station you could probably listen to.

105
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,800
Because if, you know, say you want some music that day or nothing.

106
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,560
You have a long trip with like a little kid and the poor little guy's got to listen to

107
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,840
like, today we have him on Quiet Storm.

108
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,320
And all the Bluetooth was dead.

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,980
Like you couldn't play anything from your phone.

110
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,220
Your phone call stuff wouldn't work.

111
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,760
I'm assuming you're just locked.

112
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,240
Like you can't plug in an iPhone.

113
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Yeah.

114
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
You're just done.

115
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Yep.

116
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,500
Daddy, can I listen to the Wreck It Ralph song, which is called Sugar Rush and is burned

117
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,640
into my very soul?

118
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,600
No, no, you cannot, my boy.

119
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,080
You're apparently listening to this book review about some lady growing turnips.

120
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,680
Or you know, the Ukraine, which perhaps you're trying to take a little bit of time from right

121
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
now.

122
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Me?

123
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
No, no.

124
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,300
So the Super Bowl was last night.

125
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,120
Very important to a lot of people.

126
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,240
I was rooting for the Bengals, Los Angeles one, saving me roughly eighteen hundred dollars.

127
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,960
I was going to buy a System 76 of the Bengals one.

128
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
I saw that.

129
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
That's hilarious.

130
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
That's great.

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,560
Because my son was mocking me for using a MacBook Air, which I find out, Chris, how

132
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,080
he got a premium fee to J.B.

133
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,720
We're going to have a little talk.

134
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,040
Let's just say we took care of him.

135
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Yeah.

136
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,640
Oh, he's already like, where's your cool computer?

137
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,920
Like, dude, you're five.

138
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
God.

139
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,600
He's like, well, OK, you know, I was on Matrix this morning talking like, stop it, kid.

140
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
What are you doing?

141
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
No.

142
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,560
And that was an exciting game if you're a sports fan, but there is no greater game.

143
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,720
I call it Newland ball.

144
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,540
I am so in on this Ukraine stuff.

145
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
Are you?

146
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,480
I have not been this excited about the news since an orange man descended.

147
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,200
What is it about it that has you so gripped?

148
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
I do notice that they're talking about it an awful lot.

149
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,680
Well, I'll tell you what it is about it.

150
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
There's two things.

151
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,600
One, any time Joe Scarborough gets on his gets the vapors, I think it's funny.

152
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,960
I actually like Joe Scarborough.

153
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Yeah.

154
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,160
You guys are both fake conservatives.

155
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,360
Oh, damn.

156
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,720
The worst part is the second time I was called a rhino today, weirdly enough, by my ex-mother-in-law.

157
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
You totally derailed me.

158
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
That was amazing.

159
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
You know what?

160
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,080
They have to put you on Fox News to just go after the apparently my people.

161
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,360
I just I just I'm impressed that you're so captivated by it, because I would imagine

162
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,720
a lot of us are just like, I mean, maybe I'm wrong.

163
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
All right.

164
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
So you know what the difference is?

165
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,440
You can see I'm not to cut you off, but just answer your question.

166
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,800
You can actually if you go back far enough to that beautiful phone call and even a little

167
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,160
before.

168
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,880
This is like watching the play, but being able to see behind the scenes to behind the

169
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,000
stage to there is that element.

170
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,560
And it's like watching something that's been playing out for for a while kind of come to

171
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
a head.

172
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
I agree.

173
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,720
I have just felt like because there's nothing I can do about it.

174
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,680
And I don't really know how it's going to directly affect me either way.

175
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,800
I just sort of just I'm just going to wait for something to happen and then pay attention.

176
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
I think I'm not sure.

177
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,640
I waffle on it.

178
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,480
I mostly just try to stay focused on work.

179
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,920
But every now and then I think about it, it freaks me out.

180
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,840
It's never going to be World War Three.

181
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,960
Not not for not no offense or Ukrainian listeners, but not over Ukraine.

182
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Sorry, guys.

183
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Yeah.

184
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
All right.

185
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Well, let's get to the emails.

186
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,200
Casey from Austria asks about the maintenance dance.

187
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,040
He says so at the mad botter, how do you structure ongoing maintenance for your client project?

188
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,880
Care is rarely finished, and even if it's feature complete and the bugs are squashed,

189
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,640
often there'll be ongoing costs for hosting backups, etc.

190
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,360
I've been self-employed as a software engineer for over a decade.

191
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,760
I've been relatively lucky that my clients usually have some kind of sysadmin or ops

192
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,560
team that could handle these ongoing costs.

193
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,000
However, recently I found my client base shifting to clients who don't really have the capacity

194
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,160
to manage the hosting themselves.

195
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,340
So I'm in a situation where I need to have a solid story for how I take care of the client

196
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,240
after the main engagement wraps up.

197
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,720
Do you sell retainer contracts?

198
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,800
Are those based on hours or something else like do you sell fixed hosted plans?

199
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,060
What would they include?

200
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,640
Any horror stories to share or any tips to pass along would be great, too.

201
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,900
Thanks and cheers from Austria.

202
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,900
That's a lot.

203
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,900
There's a lot in there.

204
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,560
Yeah, I do try to sell maintenance contracts and I almost never succeed because in truth,

205
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
it's my experience.

206
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,520
People willing to buy maintenance contracts usually want additional development, too,

207
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,480
when you end up spending a lot of time separating maintenance from development.

208
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:47,520
So yeah, we just do it, you know, as applications change over time and that requires, well,

209
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,520
changes that's poorly put.

210
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,680
For Alice, it's a license for a year, right?

211
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,240
Basically it's not really assessed, but it's getting there every day, closer and closer.

212
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,680
And just, yeah, the ongoing maintenance is part of that license fee.

213
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,200
And that's probably the closest to a pure, but part of the conditions of that are like

214
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,480
we spin up the instance, we control it, you keep your grubby hands off.

215
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,280
I kind of do get the impression from his email that he's getting asked the question because

216
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,920
he says, I need to have a solid story for how I take care of the client after main engagement

217
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
wraps up.

218
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
So maybe he is getting asked.

219
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,920
So it seems like maybe having a maintenance option is a good idea, but I don't know if

220
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,080
you need to leave the initial sale or any of that with, with that.

221
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,120
The thing that becomes complex is deciding what is a maintenance quote, you know, issue

222
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,440
that you just fixed for that flat fee and what is effectively a modification.

223
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,960
So if I were to do that, I would probably just say you buy it like a lawyer, right?

224
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,000
You buy or retain for hours.

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I've done that in the past.

226
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,240
It's fine.

227
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,840
That's definitely approached like by a four hour package.

228
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,340
It kind of depends on what you're maintaining.

229
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,480
If you're maintaining server infrastructure for them, that might be a little more straight

230
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,800
forward, you know, cause Mike's right.

231
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,180
If you're maintaining code, doing maintenance updates or fixing things or adding support

232
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,360
for new importers or something like that, that's a whole different cost structure versus

233
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,200
running a VPS that your sub license leasing to them or a system that you have in a data

234
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
center.

235
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,620
And then there that's pretty straightforward to figure out the cost for that.

236
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,880
You just look at your costs.

237
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
That almost sells itself.

238
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
If that's what they're looking for.

239
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
Yeah.

240
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,420
I mean, if it's something you control, then you should know your costs and you just do

241
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,600
some number greater than that.

242
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,280
That makes sense to make it worth it for you, right?

243
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,720
If it's just like pure custom dev where they're going to end up hosting it themselves and

244
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,140
like there are some admin on their side that is, you know, gets to pick what he or she

245
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,960
wants and how they want to go on.

246
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
That's a little trickier, right?

247
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,480
You know, the more uniform your systems are, the presumably right, one hopes the more efficient

248
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,880
you are at maintaining it.

249
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
All right.

250
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,600
Listener Mike is freaking out.

251
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,760
This is OK, I was listening to you guys talk about VR recently that was beyond gaming,

252
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,600
which is the first time I really thought about that much.

253
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,840
And then I recently had an experience at a friend's house with an Oculus 2 and I was

254
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,200
pretty impressed with how far it's come.

255
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,040
Then when I heard you guys talking about virtual meetings and maybe even using VR on the plane,

256
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,680
it really clicked for me and my mind was blown.

257
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,200
At the risk of sounding like the dad in the room, though, are you guys at all worried

258
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,200
about the possible addictive nature of VR?

259
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,720
The small amount of VR I did was so immersive, it was so honestly disorienting to come out

260
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
of it.

261
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,240
Well, I'm old enough to remember a world before smartphones and now we're all just seemingly

262
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,960
hopelessly addicted to them.

263
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,880
So what's VR going to do?

264
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,560
I'm reminded of Jeff Goldblum's quote in Jurassic Park where he says, your scientists were so

265
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,320
preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

266
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
What are your thoughts?

267
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Yeah.

268
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,840
I mean, if you've ever read your William Gibson, this is a problem, right?

269
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,640
I don't even think it's a possibility.

270
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,720
I think it's a certainty once it gets good enough, if it gets good enough.

271
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,400
And we know this because people get addicted to things like World of Warcraft.

272
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Oh, for sure.

273
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Yeah.

274
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Yeah.

275
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,540
So I think this is in a lot of ways, I just not even an opinion.

276
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,200
This is absolutely true, right?

277
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,640
People Robin Hood, the, for those who don't know the, what would you, I would call it

278
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,640
a gambling app, but I don't feel like getting sued.

279
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,200
So we'll call it an investment app.

280
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Yeah.

281
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Stocks for retail investors.

282
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,920
You know, there was a couple of young men who destroyed their lives.

283
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,640
One young man killed himself because it is addictive, right?

284
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Yeah.

285
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,560
So, you know, we have a casino not too far from the studio and I have gone in there with

286
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,280
friends on occasion and I see people who are basically just sitting there rotting away

287
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,840
on those slot machines.

288
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Yeah.

289
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,600
It's definitely a bad, it's a bad human behavior.

290
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,900
I mean, just think about it.

291
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,760
Think about like an MMO in like an Oculus five, right?

292
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,960
Like a really souped up, you know, few generations out and you feel like you're, you know, a

293
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
wizard or whatever.

294
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Flying.

295
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Oh God.

296
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
How cool would it be to fly around an open world?

297
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Yeah.

298
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,420
I mean, I, I have a buddy who has a, a home built a flight simulator that is annoyingly

299
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,760
better than mine and I can't wait to get over it.

300
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Yeah.

301
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
Yeah.

302
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,040
I was just talking to my buddy Alex about using flight Sim and VR cause he just got

303
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,420
a VR kit and he says it's just, it's blow away good.

304
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,280
Like he flew over a campground that he stayed in as a kid and he could recognize it in the

305
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
flight Sim.

306
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
I agree.

307
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,640
All these are things are problems.

308
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,120
I don't really see what VR is changing about it.

309
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,880
Like I'm sitting in front of screens, one, two, three, four, five screens right now and

310
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,560
I sat in front of four screens all morning while we worked on things this morning.

311
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:48,600
So like I already spend probably 10 hours a day in front of a screen and then sometimes

312
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,560
after I'm done with dinner and whatnot, I sit down, I turn the TV on and I watch TV

313
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
for a bit too.

314
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,560
So I'm already living that world.

315
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,980
I'm just doing it with a crappier resolution and a crappier experience, right?

316
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,080
And at least with VR, there's going to be things that get me up and moving where right

317
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,120
now all of it's done on my butt unless I electively choose to stand there and stare at a screen.

318
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,200
So I actually think in some ways VR is going to improve the situation because some of those

319
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,040
games are actually quite a workout.

320
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,560
And so there's, you know, there may be a positive aspect to it.

321
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,800
Yeah, there's going to be a lot of negatives to the right.

322
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,600
Think about the adult industry.

323
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,160
I mean, we've all seen the next generation Star Trek, right?

324
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,960
How many episodes are there about some poor bastard?

325
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
Barkley.

326
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Right.

327
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Just like in the holodeck.

328
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
He can't get it.

329
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,080
He's just like so hooked on it.

330
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,100
I mean, yeah, I suppose.

331
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,960
But the real thing's always going to be better, right?

332
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,360
Like you're always going to have a better experience eating a great meal in the real

333
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,120
world or sex or meeting somebody.

334
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,500
Like the real world thing is always going to probably because it's a touch and feel

335
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
thing as well.

336
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
I don't know.

337
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,600
You know, the more I think about it, the more I think it's really just going to be as bad

338
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
as it is now.

339
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
I really don't.

340
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,400
I mean, it's just going to look dorkier because we're going to have these things on our head.

341
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Don't worry.

342
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,900
Multi-billion dollar corporations have for a very long time been working on addicting

343
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,780
you and screwing with your dopamine already got you.

344
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,260
Have you heard of Van Heuser Bush or, you know, all the cigarette companies?

345
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,540
I'm just saying lots of things were addictive.

346
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,600
So Dinesh writes in looking for some wisdom.

347
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
He says, Hello, guys.

348
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,320
A regular listener of the show here over the past few weeks, I've been enjoying hearing

349
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,780
about Mike's experience with Python being a Python developer myself.

350
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,720
It's always interesting to see people speak the serpent language.

351
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,240
However, one thing's got me thinking, given Mike's experience with a few different languages,

352
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,560
is there a template or process which has followed that I think it means you follow to make

353
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,160
decisions about the tech to use for a specific project?

354
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,880
Or is it just about trying out new things and, hey, maybe there's a chance it works?

355
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,400
I'm curious to know about the architecture choices and how they're made.

356
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Thanks for the great content.

357
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Cheers.

358
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Yeah.

359
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,440
So it is not just about trying new things.

360
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,040
That's the easiest one to start with.

361
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:02,160
I kept getting requests for Python and we got one pretty substantial request that we

362
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
had been doing it here and there a little bit.

363
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,800
So in terms of that type of development, i.e. web applications, mostly a Ruby shop, that

364
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,160
is now all completely reversed, mostly Python and for a couple of years now.

365
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,160
I try to keep up, I guess, like I have a practice where I do like what I've talked about them

366
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
years ago.

367
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,240
CodeCata is like a little programming exercise and I think it's Coding Hero is the website.

368
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,760
But now I just there's a Reddit for it, too.

369
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,720
I just do them from.

370
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,880
I can't say that I always pick up the new thing, right?

371
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,680
I mean, when node was the new hotness, I spent probably a year here just bashing the crap

372
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,680
out of it.

373
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,640
I still stand by all of that case, like last week where I've changed my mind a bit.

374
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:49,200
Swift, right, where I understand why you would want to use Swift even over Objective C. But

375
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,560
that's mostly because Apple have become difficult about, you know, putting things in Objective

376
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
C.

377
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Why Python particularly?

378
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,600
Well, you know, that is a question, right?

379
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,520
So one of the challenges, in fact, we had a meeting on Friday is Python's not exactly

380
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
performant.

381
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,060
Neither was Ruby, but for and make sure I phrase this right.

382
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,880
Most of the time, the client, you know, development work for hire stuff.

383
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,840
They're more interested for us, at least the kind of things we do and just getting it done

384
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
at a reasonable performance.

385
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,120
And we're always speaking performance as we go.

386
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,040
Yeah, sometimes, like right now with Alice, we are hitting some some walls that I'm starting

387
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,680
to look at, you know, more like Rust, you know, Rust modules or C++ modules, because

388
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,080
straight throughput is becoming a problem.

389
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,160
You know, I won't use anything that I have to pay for, right, like any proprietary, like

390
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
weird stuff.

391
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
I don't know.

392
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
I try things that look interesting.

393
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Like I like Rust.

394
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,480
I think in the last few years, the new quote language that's excited me the most is Rust.

395
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,080
Although there's a lot of chaos over there for reasons that I still don't understand.

396
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,880
But in fact, Chris, we kind of just dropped that story completely.

397
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
The whole kerfuffle.

398
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Yeah.

399
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,720
Well, they aren't giving us much.

400
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,360
You know, there was some more departures, but they claim they were not related to the

401
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,540
recent community stuff.

402
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,540
I'm watching.

403
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
I'm watching.

404
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,680
But that group has traditionally been very tight lipped.

405
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,680
You know, you don't talk about Fight Club.

406
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,280
You don't talk about Crap Club.

407
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,040
Linode.com slash coder, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

408
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,880
And you go there to support the show.

409
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,320
Linode is fast and reliable cloud hosting.

410
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
It's how we host everything.

411
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,760
And you got to try it for your next project, especially now that Linode has been rolling

412
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:45,080
out upgrades to their storage, MVME PCIe storage, and it's crazy fast.

413
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,680
We're currently experimenting with the idea of moving our matrix database over to MVME

414
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,840
storage and the back end database for our Castablaster system, which manages all of

415
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,680
the encoding and metadata and processing of our shows up on Linode.

416
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,440
Yeah, we do all of that stuff up on Linode too.

417
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,800
Our editors submit a final flack with all of their amazing skills applied to making

418
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,520
the show sound great.

419
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,780
That goes up to a system on Linode and in it, it does all the processing from there.

420
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,040
It pushes it out to all of our different endpoints on different social media platforms and RSS

421
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,860
feeds and all of that.

422
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,160
And we're looking at our different workloads and thinking, okay, well, what should we move

423
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
over to their S3 object storage?

424
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,680
What should we move over to MVME block storage?

425
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
That's our math right now.

426
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,080
And if you're a performance hound, Linode's the way to go.

427
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,320
They've got screaming fast CPUs, screaming fast disk, and a screaming fast network interface.

428
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,720
They are their own ISP and they got 11 data centers around the world.

429
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,160
You're going to find something close to yourself or your clients.

430
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,480
And Linode's been doing this for almost 19 years and it just keeps getting better and

431
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,000
better all the time.

432
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
They got new stuff they're working on and the stuff they've rolled out, they nail it.

433
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,440
What they've learned is to focus and do things right.

434
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,560
They're not trying to lock you into some sort of crazy complex proprietary hyperscaler platform.

435
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,320
You can use industry standard tools like Terraform and Kubernetes or their straightforward API

436
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,160
or even just their beautiful dashboard.

437
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
It's all straightforward.

438
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,040
You're going to get started in no time and it's a great way to support the show.

439
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,360
If you've been thinking about doing it, now's the time.

440
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,840
It really is great.

441
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,840
Linode.com slash coder.

442
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:35,520
Big congratulations to everyone who's ever worked on.NET and all of those of you who

443
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,160
took a bet on something crazy for Microsoft.

444
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,720
It just hit 20 years.

445
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,280
.NET Framework 1.0 came out 20 years ago, February 14th, 2002.

446
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
That makes me feel old.

447
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,140
You know, I was looking up news clippings from that time.

448
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,140
It was a different time.

449
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,440
First of all, I just got to say it.

450
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
What's.NET?

451
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
I thought it was called Jsharp.

452
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
I thought it was called.NET Core.

453
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
I thought it was called Mono.

454
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,000
No, actually, you know, I was looking, I was trying to look back at the timeline because

455
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,360
that there are like big moments in all of this timeline and definitely it was in 2016

456
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,620
when Microsoft billed, when they announced the whole like Mono was coming in as part

457
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,400
of the.NET Foundation.

458
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,480
It was going under an MIT license.

459
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,720
I mean, that also followed acquisition of the Zmarion or Xamarin.

460
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,120
Yeah, I mean, that was 2016, which I remember doing the show then.

461
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
At least I seem to recall we were doing the show then.

462
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
We were.

463
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Yeah.

464
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,440
And I seem to recall having a very skeptical take on how this was all going to go because

465
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,400
we really were, that was really at the beginning of wrapping our heads around what Microsoft

466
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,080
was doing with the development community.

467
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,480
And that was really around the beginning of this big shift internally, I think, on their

468
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,120
approach to open source.

469
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
You know what?

470
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,120
I need a Decker King.

471
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
Yeah.

472
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
You want to tell us a little story?

473
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Is that what you're saying?

474
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
Oh, yeah.

475
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Stay a while and listen.

476
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
All right.

477
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,880
Our younger listeners, I am going to make some statements that you are not going to

478
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,120
believe, but here we go.

479
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
They're all true.

480
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,320
In 2002, not just Microsoft, not just Sun, and let's all pour one out and cry a little

481
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
bit.

482
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:20,560
The entire industry, more or less, and mainstream business press believed that Java was the

483
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,440
terminal point of all languages, right?

484
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,520
Java was going to take over the world.

485
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:32,540
There was a breathless email from Bill Gates freaking the hell out about Java, right?

486
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,100
That is why you have.NET.

487
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:40,560
It was originally Microsoft's answer to Java, so much so that they implemented Java and

488
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,840
called it J-Shark.

489
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,360
That didn't last too long.

490
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,480
That is some good history.

491
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
You're right.

492
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,760
In fact, when Gates freaked out about it, a lot of people freaked out about it.

493
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
It was everywhere, right?

494
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Java was going to be everywhere.

495
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,920
It was going to be in your...

496
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
What would we call them?

497
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,200
We called them Micro Edition.

498
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,840
Remember Java Micro Edition for like your, quote, what we call an IoT today?

499
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
It was in mobile.

500
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,160
Those crappy flip phones ran Java.

501
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,480
Some people, when they were young and needed the money, wrote Java.

502
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,820
They're very, very sorry.

503
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,600
Don't forget, too, about those horrendous, horrendous cable set-top boxes, that whole

504
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
industry.

505
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
DVD players.

506
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,560
Remember when this DVD and Blu-ray first shipped with Java apps on the Blu-ray player?

507
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,360
This was a seismic, like- Horrible.

508
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,920
It was like their Sputnik moment over at Microsoft, because it was truly, right?

509
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,360
Most developers at the time, your mainstream developers, a lot of them were doing either

510
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:43,320
like VBasic, not VB.net, VBasic, or C++.

511
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:51,200
And Java was such a, how would you say, less of a pain in the ass than C++, but more powerful

512
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
than...

513
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
I'll say more powerful than VBasic.

514
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,920
I know people will fight.

515
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,840
As we talk a little bit more about where.NET is today, keep the context in your head that

516
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,080
this was effectively a defensive rearguard action at Microsoft.

517
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:13,620
Because Sun, beautiful, sweet, never learned how to make any goddamn money, Sun, was so

518
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,880
threatening to them.

519
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,480
Go on, Chris.

520
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Where are we today?

521
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,660
I was just thinking, now we're in a world where you kind of exert your control through

522
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,580
open source and foundation participation.

523
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,920
Back in this era, they also started working on their Flash competitor.

524
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,200
So they were fighting this fight on multiple fronts.

525
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
And what was that called?

526
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Silver something, right?

527
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Silverlight.

528
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Silverlight.

529
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Yeah, Silverlight.

530
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,240
.NET obviously didn't turn out like Silverlight.

531
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,360
.NET turned out to be a very wise investment, but it is so fun to revisit the original motivations

532
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
there.

533
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
And now here we are.

534
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Sun is no more.

535
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,720
They have gifted us a file system and left us.

536
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,200
It'll always be too soon.

537
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
True.

538
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,800
They had some seriously cool hardware.

539
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,580
And some seriously bad businessmen.

540
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,520
But some great ponytails.

541
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,880
Maybe the ponytails didn't help.

542
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,000
I'm just saying.

543
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Especially back then.

544
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,320
You know, congratulations.NET, 20 years.

545
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,640
Yes, you helped kill one of the most interesting, you know what?

546
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
We're not going to go here.

547
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
How's Oracle now?

548
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,560
Actually, one more thing on the Microsoft thing.

549
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,100

565
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,200
Microsoft's playing 3D chess and I think Apple is still playing checkers here.

566
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,840
Microsoft not only has been pulling the strings with the Epic lawsuit, but now Microsoft has

567
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,600
published a set of principles that will guide their app store.

568
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,340
Except the one they make money on, yes.

569
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,000
In light of the process starting around the regulatory oversight of the Activision Blizzard

570
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,960
purchase, Microsoft wanted to make it clear that they are committed to an open app store.

571
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,720
One that allows game makers to make revenue directly.

572
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,100
Microsoft said, we have developed these principles in part to address our growing role and responsibilities.

573
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,680
We start the process of seeking regulatory approval in capitals around the world for

574
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,520
our acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

575
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,440
This is coming from Brad Smith.

576
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,400
And the effort is really to paint Microsoft as this open player.

577
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,520
Microsoft's strategy is really a long game here against Apple.

578
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,260
Because if they can break Apple's 30% cut of Microsoft Office and Xbox games and anything

579
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,040
Microsoft related that gets sold on the iOS app store.

580
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,680
If they can break that cut, then it's worth no profits from the Windows app store because

581
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,000
they don't make any money now anyways.

582
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,200
They're essentially offering to make no money in a platform they already make no money in

583
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,600
exchange for Apple losing everything.

584
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,400
I think it's pretty wild.

585
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
You know what?

586
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,440
If Microsoft can pull it off, maybe it's better for everybody.

587
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,800
Maybe it's a good thing.

588
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,560
But I think it's really interesting to watch them play this chess game while pretending

589
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,840
like the good guy and appealing to the regulators with promises of their open Windows store.

590
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,480
Yeah, I don't know.

591
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:17,560
I mean, you know, I'm always excited to roo over Apple on this app store stuff.

592
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:23,000
But this doesn't, this seems like weak tea to me, and I don't think this is gonna work.

593
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I don't know.

594
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I think it might.

595
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,720
At least in terms of getting the Activision Blizzard deal passed.

596
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,760
Microsoft, you know, like Dave Jones, he sent us a boost from his new podcast app.

597
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,040
And he said, what Microsoft learned from their antitrust tobacco is that they need to up

598
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,720
their DC lobbyist game.

599
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,040
So now they have one of the most effective lobbying machines in DC.

600
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,760
That's why you never hear their name mentioned in the halls of Congress anymore, despite

601
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,480
their size and behavior.

602
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,040
Like, so they figured out how to lobby, how to basically own the representatives they

603
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,360
need to own, and now how to appeal to the world, to the rest of the world regulators,

604
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,320
by claiming that, you know, we're willing to be a totally open store that doesn't need

605
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
a cut.

606
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,680
Yeah, but only where we don't make significant money, because they explicitly say the Xbox

607
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,560
is still going to be the way it is.

608
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,420
If I were Microsoft and I were talking to some lawmaker who had questions, I'd probably

609
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:21,000
have some huge number that was like derived from the sales of Office that get downloaded

610
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,920
through the store and claim that the store generates, you know, $400 million a year.

611
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,560
Add in those team subscriptions too while you're at it, right?

612
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
Yes.

613
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Yeah, right.

614
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,760
So you could see how they could cook the books to make it look like it's a pretty big sacrifice.

615
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
I mean, great.

616
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
I love it.

617
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Mud in Apple's eye, right?

618
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:43,040
But I feel like what really happened here is Apple continues to, for whatever reason,

619
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,120
be super, super petulant about this.

620
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,560
And as a guy who has been known to be petulant, I get it, but they're just not like, like

621
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,040
they just got slapped again by the Dutch authorities.

622
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,120
You know, if Jobs was alive, we'd all be saying this is Steve's fault.

623
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
This is Steve.

624
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
He's so pigheaded.

625
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,560
You know, he's so stubborn.

626
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
He's so vindictive.

627
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,000
So everybody would just claim it's Steve Jobs' personal decision.

628
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,720
But now that he's dead, people are looking for all these explanations and it just has

629
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,720
to come down to this.

630
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,040
Apple's looking at how many iPhones they sell.

631
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,680
They're looking at what the potential market size is and they're looking at the lifetime

632
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,640
of these iOS devices, especially things like the iPad and Apple TV, and they're looking

633
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,160
at the app store revenue and they're thinking this is our 50 year moneymaker here.

634
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:35,040
You know, I listen to other podcasts and a lot of them seem to be putting like the Apple

635
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,520
execs on the couch.

636
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,480
And I kind of feel like maybe that's partially fair that like, you know, it's Apple culture

637
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,580
to be kind of a jerk about things.

638
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,040
But they have to know, right, these aren't dumb people.

639
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,240
They have very fancy lawyers.

640
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,160
They have lobbyists.

641
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,880
They have to know that they're going to have to compromise.

642
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,500
And I think they're just doing the classic New Jersey style business negotiation of I'm

643
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,540
going to start at the most insane position possible.

644
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,120
And then I'm eventually going to concede at the last second and give you what I was already

645
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
going to give you anyway.

646
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Yeah.

647
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,420
And if you project the entire time, like you're in the right, you know, like it almost weakens

648
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,560
your hand if you start capitulating at all, because it sort of shows that you know you're

649
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
in the wrong.

650
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:31,280
So it's like, who is going to enforce a Congress to pass a law?

651
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,760
Maybe I don't necessarily think that's super duper likely.

652
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,580
I know they're trying.

653
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,040
How about some regulators?

654
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,880
So would that be the FTC?

655
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,220
All right, so the FTC sues them.

656
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,040
Apple's like, we're one of one of if not the richest company in the world.

657
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,040
We can do this forever.

658
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,860
Well, and there needs to be some kind of law they're breaking.

659
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,920
So there has to be something that changes that they are then in violation of.

660
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Yeah.

661
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,100
And maybe, you know, as a fake conservative, I sometimes play one on the interwebs.

662
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,900
Maybe I just don't think Mitch McConnell particularly cares about this and therefore it's not going

663
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
to happen.

664
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,900
And maybe I'm wrong.

665
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,900
Right.

666
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,520
Who knows the reason people keep saying the show is turning into like unfiltered to nobody

667
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
says that.

668
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
Do they say that?

669
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,920
I say it to myself in the mirror every morning.

670
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,360
I mean, you don't want to give people fuel.

671
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
They'll run with that.

672
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,260
I like that is because these companies are so big and powerful.

673
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:32,100
The only entities that could actually maybe stand up to them also happen to have Davies.

674
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,360
They're trillion dollar plus company.

675
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
Yeah.

676
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,200
It isn't like a bunch of like, you know, fun companies with some young folks and we're

677
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
all chillin.

678
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,780
It I love system 76 because it's nostalgia.

679
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:50,160
But when they eventually take over the world and join Microsoft Activision Blizzard, Vivendi,

680
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,540
I'll be sad to write.

681
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:58,000
It's like we yearn for just a small, genuine, independent business these days.

682
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,240
Like when I talk about Linode in the ads, I mentioned the fact that they are independent.

683
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
Yeah.

684
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,700
Like that's a huge deal, right?

685
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,040
It's not it's not very common anymore.

686
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,400
And it's a mistake I made for a bit.

687
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,640
I had to go through the process to fully appreciate the repercussions.

688
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
I hear you.

689
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,640
I mean, let's do a bacon competition for a minute.

690
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,440
How does this end in your mind, this all this app store stuff?

691
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,800
Well, it feels like Microsoft is four steps ahead of Apple, right?

692
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,240
Like Microsoft has known it was going to end up inevitably at this point.

693
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,560
And they've been getting things lined up to grease the wheels for this Activision Blizzard.

694
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,960
They've known for a year what direction Blizzard was going in, right?

695
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,600
We established that recently.

696
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
That in itself is horrific.

697
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
But yeah.

698
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
So they've been watching.

699
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,800
They've been circling Blizzard for a year while the stock dropped 50 percent in value

700
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,080
and their founder was engulfed in or their CEO was engulfed in controversy.

701
00:33:52,080 --> 00:34:01,200
And during that time, they supplied Epic with documentation and legal time to go after Apple

702
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,560
and possibly some money, too, it seems, while also planning to grease the wheels around

703
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,020
the world with the regulators.

704
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:14,520
How Apple was clever about the M1 transition, Microsoft is very clever about this Blizzard

705
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,800
Activision acquisition, right?

706
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,360
They have been laying the groundwork for at least a year, probably more.

707
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,520
I don't think I can convey how savvy this move is and how alarming it is to me that

708
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,120
Microsoft is still very dangerous.

709
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,520
You are like warming my black little heart here.

710
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
Really?

711
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,440
I am like full on nihilism here.

712
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,360
Like I don't think Apple is just making a mistake.

713
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,360
I think they know they're going to basically win because the government of the United States

714
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
barely functions.

715
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,000
Yeah, it could be.

716
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,320
They are extremely legally savvy.

717
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,040
They have a pretty strong case.

718
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,720
Like we can't really put a finger on what rule they've broken.

719
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,520
They set the terms for their own store and Epic clearly violated those terms intentionally.

720
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,880
Well, even by the most aggressive, let's say politicians, right, the political critics,

721
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,640
you know, like a Klobuchar, her remedy is to pass a new law.

722
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,840
Sure.

723
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
Can you do it?

724
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,840
Right?

725
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,680
Can you do it to the point where it is in fact, you know, it's a wolf with some teeth.

726
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Can you be a wolf warrior?

727
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,940
If you get that reference, I'm very sorry.

728
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,120
Or are you going to be like a little chihuahua that maybe nips them in the heels?

729
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:29,320
Because I just don't see a law with real teeth getting through both houses of Congress.

730
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,200
I see maybe some kind of Mickey Mouse rubber, you know, like slap on the wrist.

731
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
I don't know.

732
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,160
Like people are talking about there's some bill to do sideloading or to mandate sideloading.

733
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,640
I'd eat my hat if that happened.

734
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,640
I just it's never going to happen.

735
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,820
The issue with these bills, too, is unfortunately they're not really written by our representatives

736
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,120
or their staff.

737
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,340
They're written by industry groups and then given to our representatives.

738
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:01,520
So number one, that probably means any anti-Apple industry group is probably not as savvy as

739
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,160
Apple's team is.

740
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
But it's hard to say.

741
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,580
Their D.C. game isn't the best.

742
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,400
Or they're Microsoft's lobbyists, right?

743
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,960
That would be who would do it.

744
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,960
Right.

745
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Microsoft's lobbyists, yes.

746
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,640
Microsoft's D.C. game is clearly superior.

747
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,520
It's fascinating because, you know, Apple's had to resort to Tim Cook personally calling

748
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,160
representatives and the White House.

749
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,080
Like that's desperate.

750
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,280
Microsoft has institutionalized their D.C. engagement, right?

751
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,520
It is a active part of the company.

752
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,880
It's on the balance sheet.

753
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,280
It's something they staff for.

754
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,320
Apple is I mean, yeah, they participate in lobbyist groups.

755
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,800
Don't get me wrong, but they don't have the savvy team that Microsoft does.

756
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,640
Really you are filling me with hope and light today.

757
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,160
IBM is in a lot of trouble right now.

758
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,760
You don't necessarily hear this very often with when it comes to controversy, but it

759
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
is striking.

760
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,360
I didn't even know they were still there.

761
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,720
IBM apparently labeled older workers, quote unquote, older workers that are 50 and up

762
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,600
as dino babies.

763
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Wow.

764
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Did they hire Mike Morhaim?

765
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Is that what happened?

766
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,040
This sounds like this does sound like like a comedy almost.

767
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
I'm sorry.

768
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,160
I'm thinking might not Mike Morhaim, Bobby Kotick.

769
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,020
So documents were released in the age discrimination case that appear to show high level discussions

770
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,320
at IBM about paring down the ranks of older employees.

771
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,000
IBM executives were directly involved in discussions about the need to reduce a portion of older

772
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,720
employees at the company, sometimes referring to them as dino babies.

773
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,240
And they've released a trove of documents in federal district court on Friday.

774
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,240
Jesus Christ.

775
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
I know.

776
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,800
Here's a quote.

777
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,320
We've discussed the fact that our millennial population trails our competitors.

778
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,200
This is one email from an executive at the time.

779
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,360
It goes on to say, the data below is very sensitive not to be shared.

780
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,440
But I wanted to make sure you have it.

781
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,960
You'll see while Accenture is seventy two percent millennials, we are at forty two percent

782
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,680
with a wide range of mini units following well below that average, speaking to the need

783
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,600
to hire early professionals, which I guess early professionals was a company's term for

784
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,280
somebody who is like new, didn't have much experience.

785
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
I see.

786
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,180
The problem is, is they needed to, quote, accelerate change by inviting the dino babies

787
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,180
to leave.

788
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,000
It's Blade Runner and make them a, quote, extinct species.

789
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Whoa.

790
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Oh, yeah.

791
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,940
A third email refers to IBM's, quote, dated maternal workforce, which was an apparent

792
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,880
implication to the older women at IBM.

793
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,760
And it said, quote, this is what must change.

794
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,880
They really don't understand social or engagement.

795
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,280
Not digital natives.

796
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,560
A real threat for us.

797
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,280
That's like the hat trick.

798
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,000
All they were missing was something racist.

799
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,920
They got misogyny and ageism in one.

800
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,920
What's incredible, too, is this was a group of probably, you know, 50 to 60 year old men

801
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,920
and women.

802
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Right.

803
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,640
As I say, the upper level executives at IBM, they have to be older dudes, mostly.

804
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
Right.

805
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,640
Honestly, you and I know this.

806
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,400
This is how a lot of companies speak internally.

807
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Yeah.

808
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,080
I have been at a client of mine where I was consulting them because of an acquisition

809
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,120
and they wanted to speak to somebody who knew their infrastructure.

810
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,000
And one of the things they just openly spoke about in this meeting and this is a local

811
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,880
company here in Washington that nobody ever hear of, but I was shocked, is they knew the

812
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,200
numbers of people that were on antidepressants through the insurance program.

813
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,780
They didn't have the names of the people, but they knew exactly how many people were

814
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,400
taking what drug.

815
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,060
That seems not good.

816
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:34,280
And they had the open conversation of like, do we have too many people at work on antidepressants?

817
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,040
And I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

818
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,080
Now, this is probably 2009 or 10.

819
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
So this is a little while ago now.

820
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,200
I'm sure companies still have this.

821
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,120
This is the way these companies think and speak, right?

822
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,260
Humans that work for them are a resource that they move around.

823
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,800
That's why they have human resource departments that they have now given new euphemisms.

824
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,840
The other thing that strikes me here is there is actually a bit of truth to all of this.

825
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,540
I have also been at places where the older staff don't get it.

826
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,620
They don't get the internet.

827
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,840
They don't get the expectations of a younger generation.

828
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,160
They just don't get it.

829
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,680
And so they have been a bit of a challenge, but you don't work them out.

830
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,240
You find the work, especially at a company the size of IBM, right?

831
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,620
There's going to be a position there that works for them.

832
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:24,200
It's ruthless because you've got to assume some of these people probably worked there

833
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,180
for 10, 15, 20, 30 years, right?

834
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:33,400
They gave a massive portion of their life to this company and then they get to a certain

835
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,760
age and the executives who are their same age have to get rid of them because they're

836
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,200
a quote, real threat for us.

837
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Thanks.

838
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,600
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

839
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,520
I don't even know what to say.

840
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,900
This is just, I know it's gross.

841
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,900
It's gross.

842
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,900
Yeah.

843
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,900
We can argue about the app store stuff.

844
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,640
There's, you know, there's multiple perspectives.

845
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,280
There's really not two sides to this.

846
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,200
This is just like, you guys are a bunch of dicks.

847
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,600
I want to make it clear that this was years ago.

848
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,320
I couldn't tell you the exact date because I've apparently I've looked at the new yorktimes.com

849
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,640
too many times this month, so I no longer get access to information paywall because

850
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,480
that's the link I grabbed, but I want to say it was like 2006 or something.

851
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,700
It was a while ago that I guess when the documents happened or when it went down or something

852
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:23,160
like that, that makes sense too because that would be, it's just gross, right?

853
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,160
Well, the funny thing is now here we are.

854
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,660
Some of the older millennials, they're hitting their forties, right?

855
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:34,280
So these millennials that they had to hire to save the company, some of them are only

856
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,560
about 10 years away from the age where they were trying to, you know, call the herd.

857
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,600
It's just kind of wild.

858
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
It's nonsensical.

859
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,200
I could work with these people.

860
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,640
It's just, it's gross.

861
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,880
Well, I don't even think the premise is necessarily true, right?

862
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,040
Older, I'm assuming these people must be managers by now, right?

863
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,920
Like older managers don't necessarily need to know the new shiny, just, I don't know.

864
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,880
It's like if you just maybe communicated with them or had like a ongoing, you know, improvement

865
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,120
plan like many other companies such as Accenture, their main competitor who's kicking their

866
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
ass has.

867
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,120
Right.

868
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,480
Well, a lot of these times it's probably just, they don't appreciate the value of learning

869
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
something new.

870
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,440
So you just as a, you know, your mission is to do outreach and demonstrate the value.

871
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Okay.

872
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,080
Is it also just cheaper to hire young people though?

873
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,360
Cause this, this sounds a little, now that I'm reading, I just brought up the New York

874
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,360
Times.

875
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,200
I'm thinking, I bet these older folks have also been getting their, you know, end percent

876
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,560
raises every year.

877
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,720
They've accrued a lot of perks, right, a lot of time.

878
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,920
Frankly, the mention of the older women is, there's probably a lot of not a good stuff

879
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,920
there.

880
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,920
Yeah.

881
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,920
Yeah.

882
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,920
Yeah.

883
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,240
You know, I've, I've heard gross conversations of people being like, well, we're going to

884
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
hire this woman.

885
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,200
But you know, she's like, she looks like she's in her early thirties and then what if we hire

886
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,360
her and we have to pay a maternity leave?

887
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,400
And it's like, people are scumbags.

888
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,700
I have heard that conversation as well.

889
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:03,760
So I don't, I think the folks suing them should eat their lunch and IBM should not do this

890
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
kid.

891
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
Well, I don't think they will.

892
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,720
Optimus Gray got the date.

893
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,240
It looks like it was in 2018 where these, apparently things happened.

894
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,240
Oh boy.

895
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,620
It was reported that IBM fired about 20,000 American employees over the age of 40 back

896
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,620
then.

897
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,200
So 60% of its total US job cuts.

898
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,760
Ah, so this is, this is connected back to that big layoff they did in 2018.

899
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,280
Oh, but didn't they also offshore a bunch of that?

900
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,280
Offshored.

901
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,600
And it looks like the majority of the people they laid off were the older folks, quote unquote

902
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
older.

903
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,600
Yeah.

904
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,600
I'm going to go with money.

905
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,240
That I actually, at the time, remember, I remember specifically people on Twitter that

906
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,420
used to work there making that exact point that this is about money.

907
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,600
So you might be onto something there.

908
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,080
I just wanted to mention before we wrap up, I did on your recommendation, sign up for

909
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,880
the Xbox streaming service.

910
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
Oh.

911
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,880
So I could get like the ultimate one, so that way I could do the web streaming thing.

912
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,040
It's only a buck for the first month, so I'm giving that a go, but they don't tell you

913
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,320
this when you're signing up.

914
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,520
It's stupid obvious now, but when you sign up and you go to launch your first game, you

915
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,500
have to have a supported controller, which I have, but didn't have with me.

916
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,800
So I didn't get to try it this morning.

917
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,260
So I'm going to try it out later this week and I'll tell you what I think next week.

918
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,960
But so far the experience feels smoother.

919
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,960
I have to say that I do have an Xbox controller, so I'll hook that up.

920
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,200
I did think it was kind of slick with Stadia.

921
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,920
When I signed up for Stadia, they gave me a package that included a controller and a

922
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,160
Chromecast that showed up and then you just, you knew you just had something that worked

923
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,760
out of the box with the service and that was really kind of nice.

924
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,680
Whereas with this service, I'm probably just going to have a mix of different controllers

925
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,320
depending on what computer I'm at, but I'll give it a go.

926
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,120
I'm actually, the more I think about it, skeptical that this is even going to work for Microsoft

927
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:57,440
because I would propose to you, people that are really into game streaming are people

928
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,960
who are casual gamers and the most expensive aspect of running the service is going to

929
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,000
be spinning up the VMs and allocating the resources and creating the machines for a

930
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,840
game session.

931
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:15,320
And I often play for 10-15 minutes and then bail and try another game play for 10-15 minutes,

932
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,580
see if it's the right fit and then bail.

933
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,680
And I've been getting throttled on Nvidia's service because I think it's too much resources

934
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,440
to spin up these machines.

935
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,800
And I wonder if that isn't always going to be a problem because if you were super serious

936
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:34,800
about gaming, you'd probably have the hardware or you're going to be on the other end where

937
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,480
you're just like logged in streaming and running the service all the time.

938
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,560
It just feels like they're going to have a hard time getting that balance right.

939
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:49,680
Yeah, I think, you know, I don't think you're going to be playing Halo multiplayer on this.

940
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,680
I just don't.

941
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,680
I don't know.

942
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,680
Whatever.

943
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,680
I'm going to try.

944
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,680
That's exactly what I want to.

945
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,680
I want to try.

946
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,080
It's not going to be an experience that's going to be on par.

947
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,080
Why?

948
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,080
Latency?

949
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,080
Latency.

950
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,080
That's what I'm thinking.

951
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,920
You know, I would agree if it was a keyboard and mouse game, but when you're playing controller

952
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,280
based games, I don't know.

953
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,280
Maybe.

954
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
Oh, I see.

955
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,280
Okay.

956
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,280
There's a little bit of a...

957
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,280
Yeah.

958
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,280
That's right.

959
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,280
Okay.

960
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,280
So I see.

961
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,280
So if you were playing a real first person shooter, it would be a problem.

962
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,280
Yeah.

963
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,280
If I had real controls.

964
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,280
Yeah.

965
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,280
Like, you know, like not a baby game.

966
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
I'm just saying.

967
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:30,560
No, I mean, I love it, but yeah, like, you know what, I basically exclusively play Marvel

968
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,440
versus Capcom and like various indie stuff that they put on there.

969
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,920
And those indie games, I mean, these guys haven't left the SNES color palette or, you

970
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,440
know, game mechanics for the most part.

971
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,440
And they run just fine in Chrome.

972
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,440
Right?

973
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,440
I don't know what to say.

974
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,440
Yeah.

975
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,440
Okay.

976
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,440
I'll keep that in mind.

977
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,440
I'll keep...

978
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,440
I'll try some of those games too.

979
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,240
I'll make sure I try to try out both sides of the spectrum.

980
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,520
I'm looking forward to it.

981
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,920
Well, I'm also going to try it on my Starlink setup.

982
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,320
You know, that's the ultimate test is can you game stream?

983
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,480
I remember it's a streaming game service over a Starlink connection.

984
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,660
We'll find out.

985
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,600
If you're a member, I just wanted to say thank you, if you haven't become a member yet, maybe

986
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,600
consider it.

987
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,220
Go to coderqa.co.

988
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,600
That's where you sign up.

989
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,520
And then you get a tighter episode, something that's just a little bit shorter because we

990
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,520
cut out the ads.

991
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:28,100
It still has all of the full production from Drew, but you just get a nicer, shorter production.

992
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:32,200
And you can support the entire network by signing up at jupyter.party where you get

993
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,760
access to all the shows ad free.

994
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,760
It's pretty sweet.

995
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,920
It's a nice way to support us as well.

996
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,060
Then you get access either membership program to the Coderly report.

997
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,520
And we just put out a new one recently.

998
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,120
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send people before we get the heck out

999
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,120
of here?

1000
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,000
Check out alice.dev and at Dumanuco on Twitter.

1001
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yes.

1002
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
The power move.

1003
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,880
Why don't you join our matrix survey?

1004
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,900
If you got matrix set up, it's colony.jupyterbroadcasting.com or we got a telegram group if that's your style.

1005
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,400
That's at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

1006
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,460
We'd love your feedback.

1007
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,460
It's a big part of the show.

1008
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,460
We need more of it.

1009
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,760
