00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
This is KOTORadio, episode 484 for September 19th, 2022.

00:15.920 --> 00:19.760
Hello everyone and welcome into KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show

00:19.760 --> 00:23.840
taking a look at the art of development and probably the world of technology.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.680
We'll get into all of that.

00:25.680 --> 00:30.320
It's Chris and joining us every single week from our base in Florida.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.080
It's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:32.080 --> 00:32.640
Hello, Mike.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.240
Hello, Chris.

00:34.800 --> 00:35.600
Hello, handsome.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.800
You're sounding really good.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.920
Sounding healthy.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.520
I'm feeling a little better.

00:39.520 --> 00:44.480
Granted, I have some menthol powers that work right now, but feeling pretty better.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.600
Well, you're a soldier and I'm glad you made it.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.280
I had a question for you because I have a little story.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.680
Do you ever do the Instacart thing?

00:52.640 --> 00:53.840
Order your groceries and...

00:53.840 --> 00:57.120
Instacart, in particular, very rarely.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.920
Maybe like once a quarter.

00:59.920 --> 01:04.160
I'm trying to lean into it a little bit more because it's been a really busy week as we're

01:04.160 --> 01:05.760
preparing for the road trip.

01:05.760 --> 01:10.560
And we ended up with the kids on a night that we hadn't originally planned for, but worked

01:10.560 --> 01:11.200
out fine.

01:11.200 --> 01:16.080
And we thought, oh, you know, on the way home, we'll order some groceries and they'll be

01:16.080 --> 01:16.800
there when we get there.

01:16.800 --> 01:20.240
And it'll be perfect timing because we'll be arriving right at dinner time and the kids

01:20.240 --> 01:21.040
are going to be hungry.

01:21.040 --> 01:25.600
So the wife jumps on the old Instacart and orders up a couple hundred dollars worth of

01:25.600 --> 01:28.640
groceries because we need some stuff for the weekend and man, is food expensive here.

01:29.200 --> 01:29.680
Wow.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.440
And all is good to go.

01:31.440 --> 01:35.360
We get a little push notification as we're heading north saying, guess what?

01:35.360 --> 01:37.840
Your delivery has arrived.

01:37.840 --> 01:38.400
Enjoy.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.400
Thank you for being an Instacart customer, et cetera, et cetera.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.600
We think, OK, let's get going.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.040
We've got frozen foods.

01:43.040 --> 01:43.840
We need to hustle.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.200
So we rush, rush, rush.

01:45.200 --> 01:56.880
We get home, pull up and there's no groceries and I step out and it's instant chaos.

01:57.520 --> 02:03.760
Instant chaos the moment I open the door because our neighbor has a friend over who has a couple

02:03.760 --> 02:07.520
of dogs and they're just out free roam in the neighborhood and they're in the driveway

02:07.520 --> 02:09.600
and Levi jumps out of the car.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.560
He wants to go see the dogs bark, bark, bark, bark, woof, woof, woof.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.440
And then the kids jump out, hey, dogs, dogs, you know, so I got three kids.

02:15.440 --> 02:16.880
Oh, look at her daddy's dogs.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.160
It's all this chaos.

02:18.160 --> 02:21.520
And this neighbor lady comes over, this neighbor lady's friend comes over.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.240
She's half deaf.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.640
She's trying to talk to us.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.120
And she says something like, oh, do you live here?

02:27.120 --> 02:30.080
And and we say, yeah, this is this is us.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.160
It's like, oh, I think I just turned away your groceries.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.040
And we're like, what?

02:33.840 --> 02:35.120
What are you talking about?

02:35.120 --> 02:38.800
It's like, yeah, no, somebody just tried to deliver your groceries and I refused the delivery.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.480
I thought they made a mistake.

02:40.480 --> 02:44.000
And we're like, wait, why would you do that?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Yeah, I just thought they I thought they made a mistake.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.280
Oh, my sorry about that.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.880
Of course, Instacart's now charged us for the 200 plus grocery order.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.960
Yeah, this person's marked it as delivered.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.640
We now have to plea with Instacart support to refund us.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.520
They refund us credit in the app eventually.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.080
But that doesn't mean we get the groceries.

03:02.080 --> 03:07.200
So then we had to go get more groceries and double spend and double time.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.680
I mean, this stuff is a catastrophe sometimes.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.680
And so this week, I read that Instacart is planning to do an IPO.

03:14.720 --> 03:21.440
You know, this these apps that start on the back of all of these contract laborers who are a little sketch sometimes.

03:21.440 --> 03:25.040
Yeah, and then they go and they make billions.

03:25.040 --> 03:30.160
And of course, they're they're pitching this entire thing is it's a great opportunity for the employees to buy shares and really invest.

03:30.160 --> 03:34.560
Right. Of course, as the economy is going to and people can't afford these prices.

03:34.560 --> 03:41.760
I ordered food for the guys last night after Linux unplugged for Thai food was one hundred and twenty dollars for the three of us.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.680
It's just I couldn't believe it. I was shocked.

03:43.680 --> 03:47.280
And then the the DoorDash guy gets over there.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.800
He's sitting there for 30 minutes.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.440
I text him. I'm like, hey, man, I'm going to have to cancel this order.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.560
This is taking way too long.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.080
And then guess what?

03:54.080 --> 03:56.320
Next thing you know, the order's on its way.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.880
Something shady is going on with all these businesses.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.680
You know, and they say they're disruptive.

04:01.680 --> 04:02.800
I don't think so.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.120
I actually think they're exploitive is what I think.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.720
I don't I mean, I'm glad people can go get a little extra work.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.520
And, you know, for those people out there that's working for it, great.

04:11.520 --> 04:22.000
I mean, it's this isn't a universal statement, but there's something about seeing Instacart and DoorDash and Uber Eats work towards these IPOs and work towards these massive share programs.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.160
And meanwhile, as somebody who's on the other end of this, I just keep having a worse and worse experience.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.880
That's all just a little, I guess, start the show with a complaint.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.200
As is our way.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.200
You know, the kids these days is really what I'm saying.

04:35.200 --> 04:35.920
Yeah.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.160
Except for generally, it's usually older folk.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.200
So Jacob R. writes into the show, the ads are coming.

04:41.200 --> 04:46.160
If it's not a subscription model, more and more app developers are resorting to ads.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.800
And it's not just the independent shops either.

04:48.800 --> 04:55.760
In the recent article, which he included, Microsoft is leveraging their ability to deliver ads to the free users of Outlook.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.280
Yep.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.560
He wants to know what your take is.

04:58.560 --> 05:05.360
Do you monetize every part of the app you can in a development shop or are there parts that maybe you could intentionally release for free?

05:05.360 --> 05:06.240
The ads are coming.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.400
Should we just deal with it?

05:08.400 --> 05:12.400
Should Microsoft just bend and reduce how they monetize their customers?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.800
I mean, it's not really fair to them either, I suppose.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.840
So what's your thought?

05:15.840 --> 05:17.120
The ads are coming to ads.

05:17.120 --> 05:22.320
He believes that you're going to see it baked into all aspects of the apps that we haven't seen before.

05:22.320 --> 05:26.320
At the same time, he thinks maybe it's a viable way to pay developers.

05:26.320 --> 05:33.680
So the problem here is that people don't want to pay for stuff, as we've been talking about since 2012.

05:33.680 --> 05:44.800
But the new problem that's going to start coming is as more developers turn to ads to monetize, the rates on those ads is going to dramatically go down.

05:44.800 --> 05:49.280
So this is kind of a progressive sort of issue, right?

05:49.280 --> 06:00.160
Because the more people turn to this, the more aggressively they're going to have to, you know, basically shove ads into their apps to make the same amount of revenue.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.080
And I have had ad supported apps out in the past.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.600
That's a that's a tough hustle.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.040
I think you're right, Jacob.

06:09.040 --> 06:14.800
I just don't you know, it's one of those things where I think a lot of people that I hear all the time are like, oh, I'm going to make an app.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.720
It's going to be like, I don't know, right, like a Magic the Gathering life counter.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.120
I'm going to throw some ads in it and then I'll make money.

06:21.120 --> 06:28.480
But the truth is, it's it's just there's just not that much money in it at most scale, right?

06:28.480 --> 06:29.600
Unless you're a huge app.

06:29.600 --> 06:39.040
And that's different because at that point, you're not really just like shoving ads in like I add or, you know, Google's AdMob, I think it's called AdMob.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.240
Is it still? I don't know.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.040
I can't keep track.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.040
I think they may have changed the name.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.680
It's the Google version.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.160
You know, the bigger apps have like ad sales teams, right?

06:48.160 --> 06:51.440
They're like podcasts where, well, it's not even true for all podcasts.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.320
We still do it that way.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.040
But there are some who just do dynamic insertion of random ads.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.160
Oh, yeah, it's getting huge.

06:56.160 --> 07:01.520
It reminds me a lot of the beginning of the App Store when like an app could be like nine bucks or five bucks.

07:01.520 --> 07:07.280
And then, you know, we went from nine to five to two to one to ninety or to ninety nine cents rather.

07:07.280 --> 07:11.600
And then it just became zero effectively.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.960
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what to say.

07:12.960 --> 07:18.320
It's definitely a collective action problem because, you know, it is always going to be in the individual

07:18.320 --> 07:23.520
developers to show incentive to shove more ads into their app, especially if they're not like bespoke

07:23.520 --> 07:28.000
apps for like the Apple hipsters, you know, people who don't really care about ads.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.960
But that is going to devalue the ads themselves.

07:30.960 --> 07:37.120
So it sucks that we lost this monetization fight, but we did.

07:37.120 --> 07:42.640
And yeah, I think it's I know you didn't say just for Indies, but I will say for Indies,

07:42.640 --> 07:49.600
getting any amount of money out of end users these days is it's just like any like a buck.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.400
Like I buy me one cake up.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.440
It's really just not. It's hard.

07:55.440 --> 08:00.240
I mean, I hate to be right, because I know Chris and I predicted this years and years ago,

08:00.880 --> 08:02.800
but this is where we are right now.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.600
Yeah, I'm I am fascinated to see how far this goes.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.880
I know there's definitely the conversation in the podcast industry that you and I have

08:08.880 --> 08:13.520
talked about a little bit on the show that's evolving really quickly around just dynamically

08:13.520 --> 08:18.240
inserting ads and kind of monetizing things that you haven't monetized before.

08:18.240 --> 08:22.880
Like the one another initiative that I've seen out there is kind of companies will

08:22.880 --> 08:27.280
browse the app store or the play store and reach out to developers and say, hey, have you thought

08:27.280 --> 08:30.400
about monetizing your your app with ads?

08:30.400 --> 08:33.840
Look at this. We could promise you this this amount based on your downloads.

08:33.840 --> 08:38.000
And they're kind of proactively asking developers sort of like these dynamic insert companies

08:38.000 --> 08:41.760
are proactively asking podcasters, but they're all really low numbers.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.680
And they're going to get lower.

08:43.680 --> 08:45.840
But the more people say yes, the lower it gets.

08:45.840 --> 08:49.200
What I'm trying to figure out, I wonder if you have thoughts is why is it just hitting

08:49.200 --> 08:50.960
so hard all of a sudden?

08:50.960 --> 08:54.560
Because the digital advertising market in the broader context is in pretty bad shape

08:54.560 --> 08:55.360
right now.

08:55.360 --> 08:59.280
A lot of contraction, but it seems like the low end is just exploding.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.880
Well, I think a lot's happened, right?

09:00.880 --> 09:05.840
And it's it's kind of related to each other.

09:05.840 --> 09:10.560
My impression and you would know a lot more from the podcasting side is there's just a

09:10.560 --> 09:12.320
lot more podcasts, right?

09:12.320 --> 09:16.240
I remember like JB even before Coder was super niche, right?

09:16.240 --> 09:18.240
It was. Are you a Linux fan?

09:18.240 --> 09:19.040
Are you a techie?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.800
I don't know why you won't bring my Star War star.

09:22.800 --> 09:23.440
What is this?

09:23.440 --> 09:24.000
Swo tour?

09:24.560 --> 09:25.600
What was the name of the show?

09:25.600 --> 09:28.480
Oh, Stoked was Star Trek online.

09:28.480 --> 09:33.840
You had a show dedicated to one MMO that was not even like one of the top MMOs.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.040
No, I'm just a Star Trek fan.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.080
I'm a Star Trek fan.

09:36.080 --> 09:36.960
Right, exactly.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.440
And you know what?

09:39.440 --> 09:40.800
The show did decent.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.160
You know, it did decent.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.680
Well, that was that was kind of the thing.

09:43.680 --> 09:47.120
And I think that's why we're able to still sell the types of ads that we do because we're

09:47.120 --> 09:47.760
so focused.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.920
But I'll give you a great example.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.200
So I've been playing magic again and I've been kind of into that kind of gaming world

09:53.200 --> 09:53.520
again.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.680
Oh, I was completely unaware of that.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.400
I know, right?

09:57.200 --> 10:00.720
And I'm like, let me see if there's any magic, the gathering podcast.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.600
And I just did like a dumb query and overcast.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.040
Holy mackerel, like everybody in there.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.720
So I did the same thing for like Linux now.

10:08.720 --> 10:13.040
And there's I haven't really looked for new shows on anything in a long time.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.080
It's very different than, let's say, 2012.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.840
There's every conceivable topic has 100 podcasts.

10:19.840 --> 10:20.960
It's really something.

10:20.960 --> 10:25.040
Yeah, my fiance loves true crime and she can listen to somebody get butchered in an alley

10:25.680 --> 10:29.920
all day every day because that's apparently a thing that people like.

10:29.920 --> 10:30.640
Plenty of that.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.400
Yeah, it's remarkable.

10:32.400 --> 10:38.240
What you discover, I believe, I mean, because I recently took this, I don't know, over a

10:38.240 --> 10:42.000
year ago when we got an email when somebody said, hey, what do you guys think of Web3?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.880
And then I just went down the rabbit hole of, well, I need to at least get a solid

10:44.880 --> 10:45.920
understanding of what this is.

10:46.480 --> 10:51.280
And so one of the things I did is I went I went podcast shopping and, you know, you

10:51.280 --> 11:00.320
just you type in like Bitcoin or Web3 and there's hundreds and maybe four of them are

11:00.320 --> 11:01.520
any good at all.

11:01.520 --> 11:05.600
Like, it's really, oh, the bar needs to be raised.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.640
Otherwise, podcasting is going to get a bad reputation, I say.

11:08.640 --> 11:13.520
And, you know, if I just had less on my mind, if I had one less thing to think about, perhaps

11:14.240 --> 11:15.040
I could help solve that.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.520
Perhaps the uniform lifestyle is the answer.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.360
MTG Jacob writes in.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.360
He has wise, uniform words.

11:21.360 --> 11:24.880
He's glad to hear that you enjoyed TCG Con as well.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.640
Hopes you're still going strong with the commander sessions.

11:28.640 --> 11:29.360
And standard.

11:30.400 --> 11:30.800
OK.

11:30.800 --> 11:31.200
Sorry.

11:31.200 --> 11:31.520
All right.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.880
No, I you know what?

11:32.880 --> 11:34.160
I don't I don't need to know.

11:34.160 --> 11:34.560
It's good.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.960
I'm just baby, I'm just happy that you're happy.

11:36.960 --> 11:37.600
There you go.

11:37.600 --> 11:42.320
He says, I wanted to respond to Chris's dilemma regarding the uniform lifestyle trademark.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.880
I've been doing this for a few years now.

11:44.880 --> 11:48.880
Identical shirt, jeans and the same pair of shoes nearly every day.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.320
It's super helpful.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.720
And most people don't really notice.

11:52.720 --> 11:57.760
One piece of advice I have for Chris is you will need some variant of shirts for housework,

11:57.760 --> 12:00.240
cleaning dishes, messy jobs, essentially.

12:00.240 --> 12:05.040
If you want to keep your uniform clothes clean, you don't want manual labor eating away at

12:05.040 --> 12:07.040
your clothes and shortening the lifespan of them.

12:07.040 --> 12:10.640
But maybe this is just because I organize cleaning for certain times of the day and

12:10.640 --> 12:11.760
I can change accordingly.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.240
In any case, I found it very helpful practice.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.800
And if done simply enough, most people don't even pick up on it.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.200
All the best and to Chris and keep on tapping, Mike.

12:21.200 --> 12:25.040
You know, Jacob, that's a great bit of advice is you do need the work clothes.

12:25.760 --> 12:29.040
I think this is my post trip job is to get myself a uniform.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.960
I got to do this even this morning.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.680
So I got up early this morning because I didn't sleep much.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.960
So I just sort of threw in the towel, you know, decided to get up early and get down

12:36.960 --> 12:38.400
here and discover you put the whole show together.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.960
So I was like, oh, well, I have an easy morning.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.880
I would last week.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.400
Yeah, no, you did.

12:44.400 --> 12:44.960
You did.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.160
I just, of course, forgot.

12:46.160 --> 12:50.800
But I got dressed in the dark and then I got down here and saw what I put on.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.920
It was so wrinkled and awful and just so disheveled and doesn't really match.

12:53.920 --> 12:57.360
And I'm just thinking, yeah, this is a problem I don't need anymore because there are.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.560
Usually one week, one day, if not a couple of days a week where I'm getting dressed

13:00.560 --> 13:02.880
pretty early and just don't even really have the capacity.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.560
So I think it's happening.

13:04.560 --> 13:09.040
My only thing is like, if I'm going to do it, I don't want somebody else's logo.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.040
You know, I don't like some clothing brands logo like Carhartt or, you know, just as an

13:13.040 --> 13:15.440
example, I'd rather have my logo.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.760
So that's my then I'm starting to think, well, could I could I make myself something, you

13:19.760 --> 13:20.960
know, make a few of them?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.040
That's kind of what I'm thinking.

13:23.040 --> 13:23.540
We'll see.

13:24.640 --> 13:25.200
Guess what?

13:25.200 --> 13:31.280
This is the last coder that's going to sound decent for a while because for like nearly

13:31.280 --> 13:33.120
almost the next month, I'm going to be on the road.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.040
Actually, I think I think it's going to sound OK.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.360
Drew and I worked on it ahead of time a little bit.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.240
I sent him a few samples.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.280
He gave me a few tips.

13:40.080 --> 13:40.580
He's so great.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.920
So actually, I'm hoping it's one of the better sounding in terms of audio quality road trips.

13:45.920 --> 13:51.840
But when we hang up, I'm going to do like the last little bits of post-show stuff I

13:51.840 --> 13:57.760
have to do and then I'm hitting the road and I'm doing the West Coast tour, meetup.com

13:57.760 --> 13:59.280
slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

13:59.280 --> 14:04.320
So by the time you hear this episode, our southern Oregon meetup will have just concluded.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.640
But our meetup near Sacramento is nigh.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.000
So we'll have details at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.640
If you're in the Oregon area and you missed our southern meetup, we're going to have one

14:14.640 --> 14:18.160
more in early October in the Portland area.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.200
So details there.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.320
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting and then future events.

14:22.320 --> 14:26.800
Now that we're doing the West Coast this summer, probably checks that box for a while.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.880
We're going to do a different area next year, hopefully, if everything goes as planned.

14:30.880 --> 14:34.880
And we'll set up location specific chat rooms for every area where we do these types of

14:34.880 --> 14:35.680
events.

14:35.680 --> 14:39.200
And we have a directory of those in our matrix spaces.

14:39.200 --> 14:50.000
But just the easiest way to get to it, honestly, is bit.ly slash matrix meetup.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.520
Linode dot com slash coder.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.880
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.840
Support the show while you're checking out something really cool, too.

14:57.840 --> 15:00.000
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.160
You got to try it for your next project.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.240
Maybe you want to experiment with something.

15:04.240 --> 15:08.000
It's what I use when I'm testing things and then when I flip over to production.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.320
Linode is always rolling out new nice upgrades.

15:10.320 --> 15:14.080
They've been improving their UI, which I already think is top notch.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.240
But an area they've recently focused on is their one click deployment marketplace.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.960
Oh, I love the new changes.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.520
And now I can quickly see the new projects they've added.

15:23.520 --> 15:27.600
So like sometimes I'll just spend an evening playing around up on Linode with one of these

15:27.600 --> 15:29.440
new free software projects and learning about it.

15:30.080 --> 15:34.560
And if you're a performance hound, just a little bit ago they rolled out MVME PCIe

15:34.560 --> 15:37.440
storage, new AMD epic processors.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.040
They are their own ISP.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.680
They have 11 data centers around the world.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.600
I mean, just checks all the boxes.

15:43.600 --> 15:47.680
But the other thing that's great is Linode's business is architected in a way where they

15:47.680 --> 15:49.120
have real support.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.240
They don't have to just cheap out on the support.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.840
They've built it into their business model.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.560
So great support.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.960
You call them, you get somebody, they stick with you till it's fixed.

15:58.160 --> 16:02.560
And you combine that with their great documentation, fantastic performance,

16:02.560 --> 16:06.160
and how easy it is to integrate with any of your infrastructure management tools.

16:06.160 --> 16:09.760
Guys, there's really just nothing that checks all these boxes and is reliable and

16:09.760 --> 16:10.960
trustable like this.

16:10.960 --> 16:14.960
It's something you can run your business on for a decade or your personal site forever.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.240
You can find some cheaper places, I would imagine.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.520
But you better be prepared to migrate in six months or a year.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.960
You're not going to get this kind of support, or you won't get this kind of performance

16:26.960 --> 16:28.320
or this level of integration, right?

16:28.320 --> 16:29.840
It's just all of these things.

16:29.840 --> 16:33.920
Because Linode's had to make a great product for 19 years to get by.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.560
And it's a very competitive market.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.400
And they figured it out, and they just keep making it better.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.000
That's why I keep talking about it.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.560
Because Coder Radio listeners love Linode.

16:44.560 --> 16:45.600
They keep signing up.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.360
They become customers.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.720
They recommend it to their friends.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.240
I know you're going to love it too.

16:50.240 --> 16:54.400
Go try it out and get $100 for 60 days on a new account and support the show by going

16:54.400 --> 16:57.360
to linode.com slash coder.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.080
One more time.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.200
Let's do it together.

16:59.200 --> 17:04.160
Linode.com slash coder.

17:04.160 --> 17:09.200
So Mr. Dominic, you got a first look at something brand new from JetBrains.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.680
And I have been absolutely curious to hear your take.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.560
You haven't shared it with me.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.440
You've been a good boy.

17:13.440 --> 17:13.920
I have.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.680
Haven't violated any NDAs.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.520
But we get to hear what you think now.

17:17.520 --> 17:17.920
Yeah.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.440
So one, there is no NDA.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.520
I just got into the early whatever.

17:21.520 --> 17:22.640
You hacker.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.080
Yeah, you just fell out of form.

17:24.080 --> 17:31.120
So it was the JetBrains fleet editor, IDE Lite.

17:32.480 --> 17:38.640
And if you're familiar with JetBrains, they make PyCharm, RubyMine, Rider, WebStorm.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.000
But basically, oh, yeah, IntelliJ, right?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.520
Their big one's IntelliJ, the Java one.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.960
They have a product management cool called Space.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.480
I know virtually nothing about it.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.520
I tried a demo of it once.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.480
It wasn't my cup of tea.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.520
But this is basically a editor.

17:53.520 --> 18:02.880
Think of it as like an IntelliJ Lite, almost like the text wrangler to IntelliJ's BBedit.

18:02.880 --> 18:06.640
Now that's a deep Snow Leopard era Mac OS reference.

18:07.280 --> 18:11.920
They don't say it, but it feels like it's trying to be the just enough IDE.

18:11.920 --> 18:12.960
It's interesting.

18:12.960 --> 18:17.360
So I have thoughts and fee-fee's, of course, right off the bat.

18:17.360 --> 18:22.880
If you're a hardcore IntelliJ user, this is not going to replace IntelliJ for you at all, right?

18:22.880 --> 18:27.360
If you're deep into the refactorings, if you're using all the fun Java tools,

18:27.360 --> 18:30.240
like the Spring tools for the annotations and all that good stuff,

18:30.960 --> 18:35.040
you're probably going to be sticking with just IntelliJ proper.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.720
They say they're considering open sourcing it.

18:39.520 --> 18:45.920
I find that hard to believe given their business model, but maybe they are.

18:45.920 --> 18:52.480
It's a lot like VS Code in that you can add plug-ins to it and make it more full-featured.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.720
So it straddles that weird, like it starts out as like a...

18:56.720 --> 18:58.640
Like honestly, if this came out a few years ago,

18:58.640 --> 19:01.280
this would have been like the TextMate 2 replacement for me.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.160
And when I say a few years ago, time dilates and I really mean like six years ago.

19:07.360 --> 19:08.160
I do like it.

19:08.160 --> 19:14.400
I'm not trying to kind of slag it off here, but there's a free Electron package

19:14.400 --> 19:18.240
free Electron-powered Elephant in the room and that's VS Code.

19:18.240 --> 19:18.640
Of course.

19:19.280 --> 19:24.880
For reasons of just pure economics and network effects, VS Code has effectively

19:24.880 --> 19:27.760
become the de facto standard tool for this type of workload.

19:28.480 --> 19:32.000
And frankly, it does a very good job, particularly if you're working in Python.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.200
Fleet looks really cool.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.360
I wish it had come out about six years ago.

19:38.720 --> 19:43.840
I think it could have become that TextMate 2 replacement for the dev hipsters like me

19:43.840 --> 19:46.480
who are willing to pay 70 bucks for an editor.

19:47.840 --> 19:52.800
With that said, I've used it straight for about a week and a half

19:53.600 --> 19:57.360
and I see no real reason to abandon VS Code.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.200
And it does not replace heavier IDEs.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.200
So I am a JetBrains customer, right?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.840
I have whatever it is, their toolbox pack.

20:05.840 --> 20:09.760
And for Ruby, I tend to use RubyMine rather than just VS Code

20:09.760 --> 20:14.720
because I like just more of the assistance and I'm used to it.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.440
It doesn't replace that.

20:18.480 --> 20:21.760
It is in a lot of ways a direct competitor to VS Code.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.160
In fact, I would just say it is a direct competitor to VS Code.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.520
Think of it as Sublime Text 3 on steroids.

20:29.840 --> 20:33.600
I think if you are deep in the JetBrains experience, if you just hate Electron,

20:33.600 --> 20:40.320
if you just don't like Microsoft, you probably want to take a look at this.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.840
This is what's painful for me, right?

20:41.840 --> 20:43.200
I felt this way about Nova too.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.160
Nova from the Panic guys, they're a Mac native editor.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.200
There's absolutely nothing wrong with Fleet or Nova.

20:50.720 --> 20:51.680
They're really great products.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.840
But VS Code exists.

20:53.840 --> 20:58.960
VS Code is free and has taken so much of the mindshare on the market share that the plugin

20:58.960 --> 21:05.120
story, I don't even wonder if some weird file or some weird things a customer wants me to

21:05.120 --> 21:07.760
look at, will VS Code have a plugin?

21:07.760 --> 21:09.040
They always do.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.000
And it's always good.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.160
So I don't know where that leaves us, but a little sad, I guess,

21:14.160 --> 21:17.120
because market domination by a behemoth.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.960
Yeah, it sounds like you feel there's not really a place for it.

21:22.320 --> 21:23.600
It doesn't quite fit anywhere.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.280
It doesn't.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.800
So the part of this that I'm sure if anybody from JetBrains is listening to that I'm

21:28.800 --> 21:34.640
kind of ignoring because I just don't believe in it, is they have this whole story about

21:34.640 --> 21:37.680
spinning up instances of Fleet as like web IDs.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.040
We've covered those kind of tools for years, right, Chris?

21:41.040 --> 21:44.640
I mean, we did, what was it, Cloud 9?

21:44.640 --> 21:45.680
Cloud, yeah.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.480
A bunch of them.

21:46.480 --> 21:47.440
I can't even remember.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.560
And also VS Code can do that too, right?

21:50.560 --> 21:53.040
There are versions of VS Code just running as a node server.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.560
I just don't think that's that strong of a use case.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.400
And I've had conversations with people.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.120
I'll give you an example.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.880
I like the warp terminal on Mac.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.960
I wish I could get a Linux copy of it.

22:02.960 --> 22:07.200
Those guys seem to feel pretty strongly that it's more important to get their web-based

22:07.200 --> 22:08.720
distributed terminal up and running.

22:09.520 --> 22:10.960
I don't see it, right?

22:10.960 --> 22:13.760
This may be one of the things where we're super right about Docker.

22:13.760 --> 22:17.680
I might be super wrong about this, but I just don't think your whole Dev

22:17.680 --> 22:19.440
stack is going to go into Chrome.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.040
I don't think it's going to go into the web.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.280
I mean, is it a web app or is it a native app?

22:23.280 --> 22:27.360
Because it seemed to me like kind of the conversation around this was how do we build

22:27.360 --> 22:28.960
something that doesn't use Electron?

22:28.960 --> 22:30.480
Well, they've got some weird...

22:30.480 --> 22:34.400
So the big problem is their cloud features are quote-unquote coming soon.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.520
So to answer your question, I can't really answer it, right?

22:37.520 --> 22:39.360
It sounds like a cloud 9 to me.

22:39.360 --> 22:39.840
Yeah.

22:39.840 --> 22:43.760
They have deep integration with Spaces, which is their own product management tool, which

22:43.760 --> 22:49.360
again, if you are deep in the JetBrains ecosystem, then this probably has a lot of just like

22:49.360 --> 22:51.680
process advantages for you that make a lot of sense.

22:51.680 --> 22:56.320
Yeah, and they pitch things like that collaborative editing just being built in, being native

22:56.320 --> 22:58.960
and then, yeah, integrating with all of those products, like you say.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.240
But so is VS Code, right?

23:00.240 --> 23:01.200
Live Share.

23:01.200 --> 23:05.280
KP in the chat room says, unfortunately, I feel the same way about JetBrains' issue tracker.

23:05.280 --> 23:09.760
A lot of niceties, but I just can't compare with the mindshare of GitHub, GitLab, and

23:09.760 --> 23:10.720
Jira and Bitbucket.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.800
It's like it's the network effect.

23:12.800 --> 23:19.920
But the reason why that's sad is that means they're basically entrenched until they kill

23:19.920 --> 23:20.400
their own money.

23:20.400 --> 23:27.440
Yeah, I mean, VS Code is, well, one, before we all, you know, render our garments, nothing

23:27.440 --> 23:28.240
is eternal.

23:28.240 --> 23:28.560
Yeah.

23:28.560 --> 23:32.880
I mean, people couldn't have imagined TextMate being abandoned and dying.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.640
It just kind of was, right?

23:34.640 --> 23:35.120
It happened.

23:35.120 --> 23:39.440
I know there was a TextMate 3 at some point, I believe, but no, was there?

23:39.440 --> 23:41.520
Was that like an open source, like community thing?

23:41.520 --> 23:43.520
Well, Vim never dies, so I don't know what you're talking about.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.160
But I would argue Vim is almost like a utility.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.200
Yeah, I'm just kidding.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.480
And nobody's buying Vim.

23:48.480 --> 23:48.720
Right.

23:48.720 --> 23:52.720
I wanted to love this so much just because I want it to be kind of a hipster too.

23:54.080 --> 23:56.960
But it just doesn't make a ton of sense.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.880
Interesting problem.

23:58.880 --> 24:03.600
And I'm curious, just to kind of top this off, what are your thoughts?

24:03.600 --> 24:06.720
If they don't open source this, does this have even less of a shot?

24:07.440 --> 24:08.800
I don't think they should open source it.

24:09.760 --> 24:10.960
You know where this has a shot?

24:10.960 --> 24:12.320
I'll tell you exactly where this has a shot.

24:12.800 --> 24:17.520
Corporate environments that have the JetBrains corporate licenses with strict IT that the

24:17.520 --> 24:19.520
developers can't install their own tools.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.720
Sure, good market.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.080
This would be the closest thing.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.440
This would be the VS Code.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.760
So I don't think this product's DOA.

24:25.760 --> 24:30.160
I just think if you are an independent developer or someone who gets to make the decision,

24:30.800 --> 24:36.400
VS Code does everything you want to do and presumably will continue the, frankly, just

24:36.400 --> 24:40.560
insane rate of plugin development and will do more things that you may want to do in

24:40.560 --> 24:41.760
the future for free.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.600
God, that sucks.

24:45.600 --> 24:49.360
Honestly, it's the Google Docs problem, right?

24:49.360 --> 24:52.560
Why is there no innovation around word processing and spreadsheets?

24:52.560 --> 24:54.400
Well, because Google Docs is free.

24:54.400 --> 24:54.880
Yeah.

24:54.880 --> 25:00.240
And Microsoft Office is, for many people who buy a Windows computer, effectively free

25:00.240 --> 25:00.960
in some form.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.160
Why is there no great Linux mobile operating system?

25:04.160 --> 25:06.400
Because Android is free and Android's good enough.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.360
People can just use that.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.640
Where's my Ubuntu TV?

25:08.640 --> 25:09.120
Yep.

25:09.120 --> 25:10.880
Where is your damn Ubuntu TV?

25:10.880 --> 25:13.200
Tailscale.com slash coder.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.760
You know, people ask me all the time, they say, Chris, what's your secret?

25:15.760 --> 25:16.960
Tailscale, I say.

25:16.960 --> 25:20.080
That's where I go to sign up for free for up to 20 devices.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.440
It's a great way to support the show, too.

25:21.440 --> 25:22.960
Tailscale.com slash coder.

25:22.960 --> 25:28.560
You get yourself a zero config VPN that you can get deployed on any of your devices in

25:28.560 --> 25:29.760
just minutes.

25:29.760 --> 25:36.800
Raspberry Pi, your phone, your VPS, your VM, your various desktops with your crazy setups,

25:36.800 --> 25:40.640
it all works with your carrier grade net, your firewall rules.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.840
It's smart in how it routes.

25:41.840 --> 25:46.000
So it's not just like blasting all of your machine's traffic through the tunnel.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.480
It's the stuff you need to go to the Tailscale network.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.960
Everything else routes through your regular connection.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.280
You can leave it connected 24-7.

25:53.280 --> 25:56.320
It knows how to route the traffic intelligently.

25:56.320 --> 26:01.680
Something else that Tailscale does that I love is it realizes when two of your nodes

26:01.680 --> 26:03.200
are on the same LAN.

26:03.200 --> 26:08.320
So if you're talking Tailscale IP to Tailscale IP, it doesn't like route it out to the internet

26:08.320 --> 26:09.360
and back in.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.120
It goes direct over the LAN.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.560
It's so smart.

26:12.560 --> 26:17.520
And now, Tailscale SSH allows you to establish SSH connections between your devices in your

26:17.520 --> 26:21.760
Tailscale network as you've already set up using your Tailscale access controls.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.080
You don't have to manage the SSH keys.

26:24.080 --> 26:28.480
It'll authenticate your SSH connection using Wirecard.

26:28.480 --> 26:29.600
It's so great.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.000
And Tailscale Send, it's kind of like the same thing.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.840
Tailscale Send, it's kind of like AirDrop, but over the Tailscale network to all your

26:35.840 --> 26:42.880
Tailscale devices, including your GNU slash Linux boxes and your Windows boxes, you know?

26:42.880 --> 26:46.480
I don't know what you run, but Tailscale Send works on all of them, including the command

26:46.480 --> 26:50.720
line, which is so handy on a headless server sometimes.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.760
So handy.

26:51.760 --> 26:56.080
I recently used that to copy my Nix config over to a brand new setup.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.960
Get it on there, because Tailscale is like one of the first things I always set up, guys.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.400
It's so great.

27:00.400 --> 27:03.760
And you know, copy the config over using Tailscale Send, rebuild the box, my whole workstation

27:03.760 --> 27:04.760
set up.

27:04.760 --> 27:05.760
It's so awesome.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.360
Oh, I could go on forever, but I'll just end with this.

27:09.360 --> 27:12.240
Go to tailscale.com slash coder.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.440
It's going to change your game.

27:13.440 --> 27:18.480
When you're famous and you're walking down the red carpet because your game is so changed,

27:18.480 --> 27:19.480
they're going to ask you.

27:19.480 --> 27:23.720
They're going to say, hey, you, listener of Coder Radio, what's your secret?

27:23.720 --> 27:31.000
And you're going to say, Tailscale, tailscale.com slash coder.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
All right.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.520
I didn't see this one coming, but I think it makes a lot of sense for them.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.660
Speaking of consolidation, yes.

27:37.660 --> 27:46.000
Adobe has bought Figma for 20 billion, oh, come on, billion, billion pickies up.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Yep.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.300
The thing is, it's kind of the same story we were just talking about.

27:50.300 --> 27:55.200
It's a tooling story, and it's about, in this case, proactively protecting their market

27:55.200 --> 27:56.200
share.

27:56.200 --> 27:59.320
In other words, taking the old yeller behind grandpa's shed and putting a bullet in the

27:59.320 --> 28:00.320
back of its head.

28:00.320 --> 28:01.320
Yes.

28:01.320 --> 28:02.320
Yeah.

28:02.320 --> 28:05.640
It reminds me of when the old car companies would buy the little upstart electric company

28:05.640 --> 28:10.280
and then just suppress everything they had done, and it goes nowhere.

28:10.280 --> 28:11.280
Here's your money.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.280
Yeah.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.280
Here's an NDA.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.280
Now, shut the fuck up.

28:14.280 --> 28:15.280
Right.

28:15.280 --> 28:16.280
There you go.

28:16.280 --> 28:20.080
The acquisition will allow Adobe to incorporate Figma's popular design tools into its widely

28:20.080 --> 28:22.320
used portfolio of creative apps.

28:22.320 --> 28:25.200
I just want to say the Adobe PR team ought to be fired.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.540
They were so close to an amazing Borg reference.

28:28.540 --> 28:33.100
All they had to change was incorporate to assimilate, and they were right there.

28:33.100 --> 28:36.300
Your biological and technological distinctiveness will become our own.

28:36.300 --> 28:37.300
Browser-based technologies.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.360
Your life will adapt to service us.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.360
To service us.

28:40.360 --> 28:43.720
We will rebrand it Adobe Photoshop Lite.

28:43.720 --> 28:50.320
They had to do this because what Figma is is a set of design tools designed to replace

28:50.320 --> 28:54.520
Adobe and do it better in a collaborative way.

28:54.520 --> 28:59.360
That's what Figma is all about, and so that's why they're getting $20 billion, not necessarily

28:59.360 --> 29:02.160
because their product was necessarily worth it.

29:02.160 --> 29:08.980
I guess Figma hit $400 million in annual revenue, but $20 billion is sort of Adobe's defensive

29:08.980 --> 29:14.800
acquisition because they just can't afford to lose that market, and they need that tooling.

29:14.800 --> 29:19.700
What do you do when what's succeeding in the market is a tool that's been specifically

29:19.700 --> 29:24.840
designed to oust you from small and medium businesses?

29:24.840 --> 29:25.840
They were screwed.

29:25.840 --> 29:33.360
They panicked, and they spent $20 billion right before a possible tech recession.

29:33.360 --> 29:39.400
We may look back at this in nine months or a year and laugh that they spent $20 billion

29:39.400 --> 29:43.360
to acquire a company making $400 million.

29:43.360 --> 29:49.920
So they spent $20 billion to smother the nearest real competitor to them, and before everybody

29:49.920 --> 29:53.320
writes in about Sketch and Acorn, I'm aware of them, but let's be honest.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.880
It's not the same.

29:54.880 --> 29:59.640
I don't think Adobe's crazy for doing this because one, it's funny money anyway, right?

29:59.640 --> 30:02.240
Yeah, I suppose if you've got the money to burn.

30:02.240 --> 30:07.160
And to me, the weird thing, I read a bunch of coverage about this, and only one guy in

30:07.160 --> 30:12.560
my mind got it right, and I don't remember his name because I suck, but he was the only

30:12.560 --> 30:19.160
one to mention the other side of this transaction, the Figma board and the Figma founders, and

30:19.160 --> 30:23.960
most importantly, ye olde investors who want ye olde exit.

30:23.960 --> 30:28.520
The IPO market, it's dead, Jim.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.520
It's dead.

30:29.520 --> 30:32.160
Yeah, I think you're thinking of at Jay Finance on Twitter.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.880
I think I am, yeah.

30:33.880 --> 30:38.640
So these guys, first of all, they sold at their high, right?

30:38.640 --> 30:42.860
This is the old, get off the stage while they're still clapping and throwing panties at you.

30:42.860 --> 30:43.860
Good work, Figma.

30:43.860 --> 30:44.860
Very savvy.

30:44.860 --> 30:45.860
Very, very savvy.

30:45.860 --> 30:47.220
This was the right move for Figma.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.360
It's naive to...

30:48.360 --> 30:51.600
I think, honestly, in the next couple months, we're going to see a lot more of this kind

30:51.600 --> 30:57.560
of thing because the valuations, we've talked about this a lot, but the valuations on a

30:57.560 --> 31:01.340
lot of these types of SaaS companies are so crazy.

31:01.340 --> 31:06.440
Another big thing for Adobe, why they went to the creative cloud, is the multiples that

31:06.440 --> 31:12.880
Wall Street gives you on your share price for SaaS is roughly double, I think, of just

31:12.880 --> 31:14.960
like regular revenue.

31:14.960 --> 31:22.480
So they may make this 20 billion up in a couple of years, if not less, by having Figma.

31:22.480 --> 31:29.920
And just honestly, rebranding it to Adobe Art Studio Cloud or whatever, I'm sure the

31:29.920 --> 31:34.360
name will suck, but people will buy it.

31:34.360 --> 31:38.760
I know lots of people, myself included, who have an Adobe subscription and are happy about

31:38.760 --> 31:41.840
it, but it's the standard, right?

31:41.840 --> 31:44.680
If somebody is going to send you a file, they're going to send you an Illustrator file or a

31:44.680 --> 31:45.680
Photoshop file.

31:45.680 --> 31:46.680
Absolutely.

31:46.680 --> 31:47.680
It is.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.560
It's just the way it goes.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.560
Should this be allowed to happen?

31:50.560 --> 31:51.560
I don't know.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.000
Ask Lena Kahn.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.200
If I was the founder of Figma, would I have done this?

31:56.200 --> 31:59.480
You bet your sweet gungan ass I would have.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.480
Yeah.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.480
Oh, man.

32:01.480 --> 32:05.880
I mean, they are set for life.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.520
There is that element to this.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.520
His name is Dylan Field.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.920
He's the CEO of Figma.

32:10.920 --> 32:15.040
Him and his leadership team, their families are set for life now.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.040
Champagne, baby.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.040
Cristal.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.040
Let's do it.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.040
Yeah.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.040
They're rich.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.040
They're rich.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.400
Figma has eliminated a competitor.

32:23.400 --> 32:27.480
They can put it behind their paywall and offer it as a branded Adobe product that they really

32:27.480 --> 32:28.560
should probably have.

32:28.560 --> 32:31.280
And most importantly, Figma no longer exists.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.280
Yeah.

32:32.280 --> 32:35.000
Again, it's like, okay, this is the way this goes.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.960
This is probably their best option.

32:36.960 --> 32:37.960
This has happened before.

32:37.960 --> 32:39.800
Just the numbers got bigger, right?

32:39.800 --> 32:41.240
Instagram, Facebook.

32:41.240 --> 32:44.840
How many spreadsheet companies has Microsoft managed to buy and destroy?

32:44.840 --> 32:47.840
Don't you think, too, though, there's something about the fact that what Figma was successful

32:47.840 --> 32:52.120
at was building really good design apps for the web?

32:52.120 --> 32:53.120
These are web apps.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.120
Yeah.

32:54.120 --> 32:57.040
Well, Adobe has been making mouth noises about doing web apps, too.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.040
I wonder if that's a factor.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.040
I'm sure it is.

32:59.040 --> 33:03.400
But I'm just saying they just paid $20 billion for a company that makes mostly web apps.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.640
I mean, they make other stuff, but they make mostly web apps.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.560
$20 billion for web apps.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.560
Yeah.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.560
Good.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.960
I mean, nobody does anything for one reason, right?

33:11.960 --> 33:17.000
They pay $20 billion for probably the web know-how and the application itself.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.480
And of that, $19 billion was to kill a competitor.

33:20.480 --> 33:21.480
That's fine.

33:21.480 --> 33:22.480
Yeah.

33:22.480 --> 33:23.480
Right.

33:23.480 --> 33:24.480
Exactly.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.480
Yeah.

33:25.480 --> 33:26.480
One billion was for the tech.

33:26.480 --> 33:27.480
Nineteen billion was to kill them.

33:27.480 --> 33:28.480
I completely agree.

33:28.480 --> 33:31.880
I just think it's kind of to your point where everything eventually reverts back to the

33:31.880 --> 33:33.360
web.

33:33.360 --> 33:39.520
And this is a $20 billion bet by Adobe that web apps are ultimately the direction all

33:39.520 --> 33:40.920
platforms are going.

33:40.920 --> 33:47.480
The web, I think, is just the front end of the future, quote, TM Mike Dominic defined

33:47.480 --> 33:52.480
as the next five years, right?

33:52.480 --> 33:55.920
We don't have this on the doc, but I've been digging into Oculus development a little bit.

33:55.920 --> 33:56.920
Oh, interesting.

33:56.920 --> 33:57.920
Yeah.

33:57.920 --> 33:58.920
Disappointing.

33:58.920 --> 33:59.920
Yeah.

33:59.920 --> 34:00.920
Yeah.

34:00.920 --> 34:04.240
It's just icky, right?

34:04.240 --> 34:08.520
Once you're used to the freedom of the open web, once you're in a commercial where you're

34:08.520 --> 34:13.720
cracking open a Bud Light, driving on your Harley in a denim jacket, towing a Ford.

34:13.720 --> 34:15.280
Well, of course you have an F-150.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.280
I mean, how could you not?

34:17.280 --> 34:18.800
And none of this electric crap, right?

34:18.800 --> 34:19.800
I want diesel.

34:19.800 --> 34:20.800
Yeah.

34:20.800 --> 34:21.800
I don't know, man.

34:21.800 --> 34:22.800
It's pretty expensive right now.

34:22.800 --> 34:27.440
No, I just filled up my car, my sedan, and I was like, hmm, maybe I could just walk.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.440
Yeah.

34:28.440 --> 34:33.440
This road trip, the federal rate is like 78 cents or something like that for reimbursement,

34:33.440 --> 34:38.360
but I just don't think it's going to cover it because, you know, the RV gets eight, nine,

34:38.360 --> 34:43.360
ten miles per gallon, and we're going to the bottom of California.

34:43.360 --> 34:44.360
That's going to cost a lot of money.

34:44.360 --> 34:45.360
It's going to be expensive.

34:45.360 --> 34:46.360
Gas is just going to...

34:46.360 --> 34:50.680
And it's in, at least in the continuous states, it's like the state with the most expensive

34:50.680 --> 34:51.720
gas too.

34:51.720 --> 34:52.720
It's going to be a disaster.

34:52.720 --> 34:53.720
Well, you know, California.

34:53.720 --> 34:56.520
But we do it because we love the people.

34:56.520 --> 35:00.600
You know, I go to California not because I want to go to California, but because we love

35:00.600 --> 35:03.280
the people and we're going to go to JPO.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.160
That's going to be a lot of fun.

35:05.160 --> 35:08.880
It'll be fascinating to see where this goes, you know, and what other consolidations we

35:08.880 --> 35:11.800
see because I think you're right.

35:11.800 --> 35:16.220
These companies that can get access to big money or have been sitting on big money, there's

35:16.220 --> 35:17.840
some companies that are ready to sell.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.640
And these startups that can't IPO now.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.460
That's really the...

35:21.460 --> 35:25.800
It's the thing is the, you know, this is like the middle school dance.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.060
There's just not many dancing partners left.

35:28.060 --> 35:29.860
The girls might say yes now.

35:29.860 --> 35:31.480
That's making the startups.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.720
My middle school was Catholic school, so it was kind of weird.

35:33.720 --> 35:37.520
But yeah, I don't know, a bunch of the other sort like Snap.

35:37.520 --> 35:41.680
I know he went on stage at Code and said he's not for sale.

35:41.680 --> 35:42.680
Snap's for sale.

35:42.680 --> 35:43.680
Right.

35:43.680 --> 35:47.800
So is the weird one where people like to do like their wish boards or whatever.

35:47.800 --> 35:48.800
I can't remember the name.

35:48.800 --> 35:51.300
It's one of the social labs.

35:51.300 --> 35:52.720
There's a bunch of them that are...

35:52.720 --> 35:54.200
Everything's for sale now.

35:54.200 --> 35:58.000
Everything's in play except for Twitter because I don't know what's happening over there,

35:58.000 --> 36:01.800
but every day it just seems to be getting worse.

36:01.800 --> 36:09.000
The Marchi boosted in with one, two, three, four sets on the topic of uniforms.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.240
I've lived a less strict form of this for a while, and I think it's valuable for saving

36:13.240 --> 36:14.440
brain cycles.

36:14.440 --> 36:21.800
I have five plus black v-neck t-shirts and five plus black button down long sleeve shirts.

36:21.800 --> 36:25.120
It's hard to think of an occasion when you can't wear one of those.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.400
Making a morning selection just easy.

36:27.400 --> 36:30.200
I say it's a little less strict because it's not always a hard and fast rule.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.960
It's just a default selection that I can always fall back to.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.720
Other outfits can still be used.

36:34.720 --> 36:38.640
I'd recommend to Chris, just buy lots of one top that you like.

36:38.640 --> 36:39.640
That's nice and simple, Marchi.

36:39.640 --> 36:44.440
You know, Mike, I've been thinking, I actually think for folks that are working from home

36:44.440 --> 36:51.320
too, the uniform lifestyle seems like the perfect compromise because it's ridiculous.

36:51.320 --> 36:54.560
When you're working from home, it's this fine line of, do I get dressed?

36:54.560 --> 36:56.140
How presentable do I want to feel?

36:56.140 --> 36:59.360
If you have video meetings, there's all these factors.

36:59.360 --> 37:03.440
And so again, a uniform makes the work from home lifestyle easier too.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.360
Thank you, Marchi.

37:05.360 --> 37:08.760
Trev Dev boosted in with a row of ducks.

37:08.760 --> 37:13.200
But honest and truly, I am Robin Hood.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.360
We were talking about dynamic ads.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.400
He says, the jokes on the crappy advertisers.

37:16.400 --> 37:23.360
I may be 38, but I went bald at 23 and all I need is my imagination and my razor.

37:23.360 --> 37:24.520
What about a bed?

37:24.520 --> 37:26.260
Could we sell you on a new bed?

37:26.260 --> 37:29.060
You order a bed online, they ship a tea in a box.

37:29.060 --> 37:33.120
They'll never get it back in that box, but they will let you ship it back to them somehow

37:33.120 --> 37:34.600
for free if you don't like it.

37:34.600 --> 37:39.280
After you get it all set up, you get your clothes on there, you make your mess on it

37:39.280 --> 37:43.580
and you decide you don't like it, they'll let you box it back up somehow and ship it

37:43.580 --> 37:45.200
back to them for free.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.200
Somehow.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.440
Can I sell you on that, Trev Dev?

37:49.440 --> 37:50.440
That's it.

37:50.440 --> 37:51.440
That's all the boost we got.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.000
See, people don't like the shows you do when you're sick so they don't boost it.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
I know.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.640
They're mourning for me or they're playing MTG Arena.

37:57.640 --> 37:58.640
That could be it.

37:58.640 --> 37:59.640
That's probably it.

37:59.640 --> 38:00.960
We actually did get some boosts that just didn't make it on air.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.720
I wanted to say thank you.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.200
Everybody who does boost in, we read all of them.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.600
A couple of shout outs.

38:05.600 --> 38:10.240
Jabber Crowley boosted in 500 just saying thanks for the show.

38:10.240 --> 38:13.720
Noob Steve boosted, and I'll share this with you privately.

38:13.720 --> 38:18.660
He boosted in 4,444 SATs to give us a little more details about Red Hat Linux on those

38:18.660 --> 38:20.920
drone systems.

38:20.920 --> 38:21.920
Some specifics.

38:21.920 --> 38:25.760
But he thought maybe for security purposes we probably shouldn't discuss those bits on

38:25.760 --> 38:26.760
air.

38:26.760 --> 38:27.760
It's nothing specific.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.000
Like no big secrets.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.200
But you know, why get into operational security stuff if we don't need to?

38:32.200 --> 38:34.800
But we did get more details on where RHEL is used.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.480
And the short answer is everywhere.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.480
You were right.

38:37.480 --> 38:38.480
Everything.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.480
All of it.

38:39.480 --> 38:40.480
Off the bottom.

38:40.480 --> 38:41.480
Even the things in the sky.

38:41.480 --> 38:42.480
Wow.

38:42.480 --> 38:45.000
Also, I wanted to say hi to Willy Ramas.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.520
I think that's how you say it.

38:46.520 --> 38:47.800
I thank everybody who boosted in.

38:47.800 --> 38:50.360
You can do so by getting a new podcast app.

38:50.360 --> 38:51.360
Upgrade to a new podcasting.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.360
Turn it over.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.360
Compatible app at newpodcastapps.com.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.360
I also like Fountain FM specifically.

38:55.360 --> 39:01.400
I'll have a link to my profile in the notes where you can follow my boosts and my clips

39:01.400 --> 39:02.960
and the ones I do.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.000
Or go try Podverse.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
The totally GPL one.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.660
It's available for Android, iOS, the web, and F-Droid.

39:08.660 --> 39:09.840
And a big thank you to our members.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.960
Coderly will be coming your way soon, I suppose.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.200
We may have to do it while I'm on the road.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.200
Oh yeah.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.200
I'm not sure.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.200
We'll figure out a time.

39:16.200 --> 39:19.960
But every quarter we do a Coderly report for our members as a special thank you.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.600
A little exclusive content for them.

39:21.600 --> 39:24.200
They also get an ad-free version of the show.

39:24.200 --> 39:29.640
You can go invest in our content production at coderqa.co or all of the shows at jupyter.party.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.680
All right.

39:31.680 --> 39:34.280
It's exciting.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.560
I'm not freaking out at all about leaving right now.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.480
I'm not panicked that we're not ready.

39:38.480 --> 39:39.480
I'm not freaking out.

39:39.480 --> 39:40.480
I promise.

39:40.480 --> 39:43.240
Is there anywhere you want to send people before I go have my panic attack?

39:43.240 --> 39:44.240
Wow.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.240
Wow.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.120
Caught me with that one.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.840
Just follow me at Dumanuco on Twitter.

39:49.840 --> 39:54.320
And I have a special super-duper thing coming out on dominicm.com tomorrow.

39:54.320 --> 39:56.400
You will probably be interested in it.

39:56.400 --> 39:57.960
You dirty, dirty hippies.

39:57.960 --> 39:58.960
Definitely.

39:58.960 --> 39:59.960
Definitely.

39:59.960 --> 40:02.000
I think I know what it is and I recommend.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.320
I definitely recommend.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.480
All right.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.560
That does wrap it up.

40:05.560 --> 40:09.880
You can find me on the Twitters at chrisles, the podcast at Coder Radio Show.

40:09.880 --> 40:13.040
Our matrix chat room that's going all the time and during our live streams.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.040
That's at coder.show.matrix.

40:14.040 --> 40:19.800
And of course, we're live on Mondays, 9 a.m. Pacific, noon Eastern at jupyter.com.

40:19.800 --> 40:25.760
And links to what we talked about today, those are at coder.show slash 484.

40:25.760 --> 40:31.640
You'll find our contact page over there, our subscribe page, all of that goodie right there.

40:31.640 --> 40:32.640
It's nice and easy.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.880
It's called a web page.

40:34.880 --> 40:35.880
Maybe it's a web app now.

40:35.880 --> 40:36.880
You tell me.

40:36.880 --> 40:37.880
Coder.show slash contact.

40:37.880 --> 40:38.880
Thanks for joining us.

40:38.880 --> 40:48.640
See you right back here next week.
