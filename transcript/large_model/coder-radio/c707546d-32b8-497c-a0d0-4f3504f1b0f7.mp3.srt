00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Kota Radio, episode 358 for May 20th, 2019.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,600
Hi everyone and welcome to Kota Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,280
its related technologies. I'm filling in for Mr. West Payne this week who's off in

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,720
Barcelona, Spain. It's a Kota classic because joining me as always is our host

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,440
battling the Gators in Florida. It's Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike. Hello, hello Chris.

7
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,560
Hello, it feels good right? It's back. You know it's like my

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,600
ex-husband came back to me. This is beautiful. I love it. I just had to send

9
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,920
him to Spain you know then finally could be you and me again. Just the two of us.

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,640
That's an expensive way to do that. Hey I'm a VP now. Listen, that's right.

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,520
That's right. You got that corporate job. Actually this is funny. Elle put it all

12
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,760
together. I don't even think Linux Academy is paying for it. I think because Elle

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,760
is such a contributor to the community that they like please come. I think this

14
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,900
I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure like it was like all expenses paid trip.

15
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,880
Although they do have to volunteer and do work. I don't know if we told them that

16
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:38,880
yet but he'll figure that out pretty quick. Surprise. Yeah I know it's good to

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,120
be with you. It's good to be with you. Especially on an episode where we've got

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,640
like a good mix of hoopla, a good mix of feedback. The only thing we're missing

19
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,640
is like a classic pick or something. Yeah. Maybe we can randomly come up with

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,280
something. Like the Mac Pro we could talk about? Sure yeah I'm good with that.

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,400
Oh that's not a pick. That's not a pick. That's a dream. That's a dream. All right

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,880
so I was just gonna go through some of the feedback and see what you guys have

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,480
wrecked while I've been gone. But you know because the universe hates me my

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,400
markdown preview tool took a dump right as we started the show today. You ever

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,440
had one of those? Happens all the time. I'll tell you what. I tell you. I tell you

26
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,360
what. So anyways we're just narrowly avoiding too I should say. Narrowly

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,320
avoiding the whole WWDC thing. Now I think you and Wes are gonna have to

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,880
cover that next week right? Is it like it's the week after? It's very soon. It's

29
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,800
June the 3rd? The only reason why I say we're narrowly avoiding it it's not that I

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,960
mind the show talking about it it's just that if if I came on the show during the

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,120
WWDC week. You'd buy five HomePods. No I'm gonna be too busy buying the HomePods to be on

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,680
the show. Now everybody would assume we're talking about it because I'm on

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,160
the show. Not because it's WWDC week but just because I'm on the show. Well let me

34
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,920
explain something. Okay. If there is a Mac Pro launched we're gonna have to

35
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,520
rename the show. Why was that? You think you're gonna get one? I have wanted one

36
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,960
since I was a wee lad. Although I probably can't afford one given what

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,920
they charge for the iMac Pro. It starts at like five thousand maybe six thousand.

38
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,120
Oh I think five is generous. I'm thinking like eight. Really? Yeah I think

39
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,480
it's like I think it's kidding aside I think it's a 10k plus purchase for most

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,480
people. Which sounds insane to me but you know how Apple is they're gonna make it

41
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,920
they're like you know this is our Tesla right mm-hmm yeah you wanted this fine

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,160
pay for it that's what it's gonna be here's what we did we took a Dell case

43
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,240
we laminated it a few times and we multiplied the price by 20 and ran Mac OS

44
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,160
on it all right so let's get into some feedback from last week's episode three

45
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,200
OS is one GPU Tom wrote in and he says Google has contributed a ton to Linux in

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,000
the open source but at this point it's no comparison to what Microsoft is now

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,080
doing they've got a lot of developer mindshare as a result of that but

48
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,920
Microsoft's has spent a lot more on acquisitions and developer relations and

49
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,080
has simply made some great moves since Nadella took over you have VS code

50
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,200
github and typescript which are all crushing it now and it sure looks like

51
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,560
2019 will be the year that Microsoft took over the software development scene

52
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,000
he says by the way your analysis has been right all along all roads do lead

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,820
to Azure Google was busy trying to pivot to the

54
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:25,000
enterprise with Google Cloud Microsoft came along and snatched up the hard one

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,480
dev mindshare right underneath them Google blew it by not buying github and

56
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,520
I admire how Google tends to prefer to spend on engineers but in this case

57
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,480
Microsoft outflanked them he's right only in that at all of the major events

58
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,520
in the last couple of weeks I have seen people talking about a lot of Microsoft's

59
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,200
tools Satya Nadella was up on stage at Red Hat VS code was on the slides at

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,120
Red Hat it's huge right now what they're doing with github and the private

61
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,520
repositories that they've just announced or public repositories as well it's it's

62
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,600
um I don't know man it's like it's like Microsoft has has realized that they can

63
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,560
be the the like the development platform for the for the web and Google is trying

64
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,560
to still trying to like get like their infrastructure to be a legitimate

65
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,160
product like they're going through a renaming process right now yeah they are

66
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,720
actively trying to solicit businesses I've gotten a couple of notes from

67
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,480
listeners that have gotten offers from Google to come in and write them a check

68
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,880
to move off of AWS like they're they're really scrambling right now someone told

69
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,400
me something like that I sort of didn't believe it I've got three different

70
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,080
stories really that I can't directly share on air one that I have very very

71
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,080
very familiar knowledge with and two others that I got very good

72
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,560
descriptions of what the offers were yeah I mean there's so much there just

73
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,160
with the AWS stuff and Google like if you've ever used Google App Engine and

74
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,220
you've also used AWS or digital ocean and Docker Google it's just not a

75
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,840
pleasant environment to work in it's not that it's bad it works right I mean I'm

76
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,840
not trying to but yeah they're there's they're somewhat behind I mean I would

77
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,600
say from a DevOps perspective my preferred solution is just do and doku

78
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,320
my way to glory but if I have to use one of the big clouds AWS is uh although

79
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,080
honestly Azure cuz yay click to deploy and I'm lazy you know I feel like what

80
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,280
what Google Cloud had going for it was we can be sort of the neutral cloud

81
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,600
provider we'll work with Kubernetes early on before anybody else would you

82
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,440
know if they were that was that was their big well one and I shouldn't say

83
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,080
they're big but that was one of their big value ads is that they were more

84
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,360
vendor neutral they would work with multiple different vendors and clouds

85
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,000
yeah and it turns out that wasn't that hard for the other vendors to implement

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,320
it didn't take them that long to figure out a way to provide Kubernetes services

87
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,040
and things like that and that's on my mind right now just because our crews at

88
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,200
KubeCon like Wes but that sort of changed the game and I think it removed

89
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,800
some of the value proposition of Google Cloud not all of it in fact there was a

90
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,680
tech snap episode we did towards the beginning of the year I believe with a

91
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,800
training architect from Linux Academy Matt you Lason who is brilliant and

92
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,960
really knows the Google Cloud platform and was able to clearly clearly

93
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,360
articulate reasons why it is a good product and so that is you know fair

94
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,360
enough to them it is if they've built something there but it seems a little

95
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,120
too late and I think that's really Tommy Tom's point in the feedback what do you

96
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,680
think about this emax romance er wrote in hadn't really crossed my mind let's

97
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,400
just chew on this for a sec for a second he says isn't in theory the Windows

98
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,360
subsystem for Linux a version one more interesting from a technological point

99
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,480
of view sort of more like how wine but it was in the opposite direction whereas

100
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,200
WSL 2 is more like a tiny VM that's just running a Linux kernel in hyper V so

101
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,400
it's not as tech like they were trying to do something technically really

102
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,600
interesting with WSL 1 it didn't quite get there but in a way isn't it

103
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,160
actually a more interesting technological experiment when you're

104
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,380
doing that translation instead of just doing a big old VM I mean interesting in

105
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,560
terms of was it more interesting to read the Microsoft research papers sure was it

106
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,360
more practically viable well it's hard because WSL 2 isn't really out in a 1.0

107
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,640
form yet yeah fair enough my bets gonna be no day-to-day like like you know we

108
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,760
were talking a little bit about like my assertion that Windows 10 might end up

109
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,320
becoming the most popular quote-unquote Linux distro yeah I mean it I I just

110
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,440
have a feeling that from a practical boring perspective of getting crap dumb

111
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,160
WS 2 is going to be the way to go but certainly there's an alternate universe

112
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,760
maybe where I definitely get us a point where the work being done on WSL 1 for

113
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,400
lack of a better term that kind of translation strategy might have actually

114
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,320
bled into services like wine and stuff like that although we have a lot of

115
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,680
stuff like that now right we have proton we have wine I almost feel like weirdly

116
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,160
enough the odd man out here is Mac in terms of being able to kind of like

117
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,480
cross-pollinate between the you know the ecosystems the systems right operating

118
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
systems I do get his point and it did make me smile I think I kind of agree

119
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,280
doing that translation is maybe more interesting but when it really comes

120
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,520
down to it and you're just trying to get work done especially when you're trying

121
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,280
to develop software the practical nature of having the entire kernel it's just

122
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,800
matters so much more that that functions that I think at the end of the day I

123
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,040
think we will not even really give it a second thought it doesn't matter moving

124
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,840
forward speaking of Windows I was just reading this feedback from mangas I'm

125
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,040
sure I'm getting that one wrong and he's he's pointing out a tool that makes me

126
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,360
realize something if I were to spend like a solid year or to three years like

127
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,320
just getting my head into Windows 10 I bet you I could make it a killer

128
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,040
workstation OS he says hey Mike I wanted to point you to a little tool that you

129
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,760
can use to update your Windows machine from the command line one of the

130
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,520
features is it will do a reboot loop between updates meaning you just run

131
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,040
something like this from a fresh install you come back a couple hours later with

132
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,960
a fully updated Windows machine we'll have a link to that in the show notes

133
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,760
ABC update I believe is what it's called and I bet you there is tons of like

134
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,080
tools like that that if I could learn how to use those on Windows I could

135
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,480
probably get by pretty good yeah I mean that would have saved me just so much

136
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,680
time yeah that first the fresh install it's such a bad experience on Windows

137
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,960
like it just really sucks it's weird to me that no one unlike the Windows team

138
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:02,280
is like hey this is this is terrible can we like fix this right right and the

139
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,560
excuse is always that this is the go-to the go-to excuse is well most Windows

140
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,960
consumers never experienced that Windows they experience a Windows that they have

141
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,400
pre-purchased on a PC yeah you know what those images are always like six to nine

142
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,440
to a year out of date right six nine months maybe if you're lucky that they

143
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,360
still have months worth of updates firmware updates and driver updates and

144
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,600
all the individual applications with their individual install wizards and

145
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,880
their individual update wizards are all gonna run it's no good but I like that

146
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,520
feedback I lose really good feedback that was all from the subreddit this

147
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,200
week I was gonna do a deep dive into the email inbox but there were so many great

148
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,520
comments in the subreddit I stopped there and I left the email for you guys

149
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,320
next week I didn't rob Peter pay Paul this week

150
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,840
coder radio dot reddit comm if you want to jump in on that or if you would like

151
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:57,160
to send an email it's coder dot show slash contact well it's kind of a lull

152
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,120
this week cuz last week was Red Hat summit and it was the Python conference

153
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:10,080
and it was build and Google IO and a few others this week it's like there's some

154
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,720
hoopla but it's not like gonna change your world hoopla but that gives us an

155
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,520
opportunity to kind of chat about a few things that are more retrospective and

156
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,680
introspective and there's a post that you was it you that sniffed it up you or

157
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,680
West sniff this up and we've been chatting about it in our slack this

158
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,920
looking back at an app that somebody wrote like six years later where they

159
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,320
took a really hard line stance about something and then you know six years

160
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,080
later had some reflection and realized not everything is as black and white

161
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,760
we'll link to the whole thing in the show notes but six years ago he writes I

162
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,600
wrote one of my most popular blog posts on logic in a rails app in which I

163
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,400
debate some of the critiques about extracting code from the controller but

164
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,960
to summarize his argument was that rails is just a UI layer and business logic

165
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,060
should be put in domain objects instead of keeping them somewhere in the model

166
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,000
view or the controller he says to give you some context he writes it was a time

167
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,840
when I was starting to grow as a rails or Ruby developer I was reading a lot of

168
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,260
blog posts on the topics and I started to have very strong feelings as to how

169
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:20,080
rails code should be written fast forward six years I'm back man I'm

170
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,280
bringing I'm bringing everything it's all the classics and he says a lot of

171
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,240
things have happened in my career as a software developer my experience has

172
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,580
gotten more rich I've launched more projects my day-to-day work has changed

173
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,280
I've climbed the company ladder and frankly he's gotten more emotionally

174
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,760
mature which thankfully has prevented him from writing a few more

175
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,640
controversial blog posts so what do I think about the post now he writes well

176
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,360
it's really about the trade-offs and the personal preferences if you found a way

177
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,060
to keep all the logic in the controller while your team iterates fast and does

178
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,520
not make silly mistakes code is easily digestible new features can be added

179
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,160
without pain then good for you it doesn't really matter what any other

180
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,520
person says he writes that and I wonder this is really what I'd like to get your

181
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,980
thoughts on too it's very hard to maintain a productive discussion on the

182
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,520
internet about the right approach for building software because that may be

183
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,520
very similar to just discussing religion for some people there's no much there's

184
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,280
so my says there's so much hidden context that you might as well just

185
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,040
respect the other's decision and focus on their personal insight instead oh my

186
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,640
gosh that's beautiful that is that is my philosophy right there in words I've

187
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,520
never been able to put it and I'm curious what you think about that I think

188
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,600
that's pretty fair I mean I his original argument from six years ago isn't kind

189
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,120
of that compelling to me either way because I just sort of don't think it

190
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,640
matters it's weird though right like I had myself have been going through this

191
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,600
kind of his enification process you sort of have to at some point just because

192
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,160
like you're gonna end up dealing with a lot of systems and a lot of

193
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,480
integrations now don't I'm not always perfect in this right it's a journey

194
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,760
right it's it's a journey where you have to accept things that are maybe like

195
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,000
violating what you consider to be principles of good engineering or

196
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,440
whatever but yeah I mean I think it's interesting that this is a rails

197
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,640
developer same as Andre Lisnick rails was known for being quite shall we say

198
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,840
strict when it was originally launched way back in the you know the bad old

199
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,420
days of what is it 2006 2008 oh yeah now rails is legacy and people are

200
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,920
basically doing whatever the hell they want right having said that I'm not sure

201
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,960
I'm ready to shave my head and join the the Hare Krishnas quite yet I mean the

202
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,520
definitely are things that are just bad right like there were such a thing as

203
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,360
wrong not everything is relative I pass it to Chris all right I think you well I

204
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,600
don't really think we do I think we don't dwell on it I think you're

205
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:03,240
probably right and it's it's it sort of tracks my evangelism for Linux when I

206
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,080
was younger I built a career around convincing people to switch to Linux

207
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,680
sure both you know as a contractor and as a podcaster and it was a everything

208
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:19,520
should be on Linux everybody everything all Linux as I got older my mind shift

209
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,040
has changed to Linux is a great solution for me but everybody has a reason to use

210
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,640
the tools that they need to use and I don't understand all of the context of

211
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,720
it and I think in part it has been I've been doing something that on the surface

212
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,080
seems simple and people think they understand what's involved with making

213
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,920
something and then when you actually learn what's involved you understand

214
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,320
there's there's so many there's like what the words he uses here perfect

215
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,760
there's so much hidden context there's so much hidden context that I cannot

216
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,840
appreciate or understand that I just need to trust in their personal insights

217
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,640
if I find that if I find someone to be intellectual and seems to have their

218
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,760
crap together then I just tend to trust their insights and don't get judgy about

219
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,160
the tools or the platforms they're using and I think that's a similar transition

220
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,360
the author went through here and essentially yeah and I yeah I think

221
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,080
there's also like there's the extremes here right there's full-on Buddhists and

222
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:23,600
and then there's what is in my opinion far more common like reddit rage right

223
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,880
yeah how much do you want to bet those people either skew young or they have

224
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,360
something else going on if they're if they're I bet there's not a lot of

225
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,520
people raging on reddit above 40 that don't have a complex set of

226
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,000
circumstances speaking of complex circumstances I know right and the other

227
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,640
and this is something we didn't get a chance to talk about a lot last week the

228
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,600
Python language summit like I just alluded to earlier was going on and true

229
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,080
to form we have pulled out what may be what some consider the most quote-unquote

230
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:05,160
controversial talk it was by amber brown from the twisted project and she shared

231
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,080
some of her criticisms about the Python standard library I thought maybe for

232
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,520
some context if you're not familiar the twister project just a really short

233
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,640
version it's an event based framework for internet applications so you know

234
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,280
HTTP events SSH events IMAP events DNS events it something happens it triggers

235
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,880
something yeah it's like an it's a networking library it's a very fancy

236
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,720
networking library yeah it's great and boy she had some things to say and I

237
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,760
just thought I'd read just you a couple of highlights we won't have to like read

238
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,440
it all but she says Python claims to ship with batteries included but

239
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,600
according to Brown without external packages it's really only marginally

240
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,660
useful for example async IO requires external libraries to connect to a

241
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:52,360
database to speak or to speak HTTP the SSL module requires monkey patches to

242
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,520
connect to non ASCII domain names etc actually she looks like four different

243
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,200
examples other standard library modules are simply inferior to alternatives on

244
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,600
pypi the HTTP dot client documentation advises readers to use requests and the

245
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,000
daytime module is confusing and compared itself to competitors such as arrow and

246
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,360
default till and moment but there's also just poor quality lagging features and

247
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,560
obsolete code she says the batteries are leaking she thinks some of the bugs in

248
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:25,520
the standard library will never be fixed the batteries are leaking yeah yeah

249
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,800
that's pretty good isn't it that is pretty good

250
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,560
savage savage yeah and even when bugs are fixed pypi libraries like twisted

251
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,160
cannot assume that they'll run on the latest Python so they must preserve their

252
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,960
bug workarounds forever Brown identified new standard library features there were

253
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,280
really too little or too late leaving users to depend on back ports to use

254
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,160
features that were in Python to she's got several examples like socket dot

255
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,520
send message and she says twisted is forced to ship its own C extension to

256
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,600
use the send message in Python 2 even though pythons 2 is nearly at the end of

257
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,680
life she says it's going to be until like the end of time they're going to

258
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,120
hey she says quote distributions like Red Hat and others will keep Python 2

259
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:20,920
alive until the goddamn end of time 100% true she says so we should set the same

260
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,280
state here right cuz I think folks who don't work in like a Ruby ish Python

261
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,400
world won't understand there are many reasons to dunk and make fun of Ruby

262
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,560
developers and our defense is always how's that Python 3 transition going

263
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:41,960
because it's not right right so there's a huge current schism between Python 2

264
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,000
and Python 3 and like yes if you are doing a new project of course you just

265
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,820
use Python 3 if your organization allows you to which spoiler alert many

266
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,160
don't and you're fine but the truth is the transition just hasn't gone well

267
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,640
it's caused like if you ever want to laugh it just go into a Python forum and

268
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,120
say need help upgrading from Python 2 point insert version here to 3 and just

269
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,440
like watch not that we should troll each other's communities that's wrong I mean

270
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,640
I want to take a moment and just say Python I have a soft spot for Python so

271
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,520
I got to defend my Python love a little bit here it is it is complicated but I

272
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,360
don't know if the solution is to cram everything into the standard library and

273
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,200
rip all the code out and to criticize it for for some of these things I think the

274
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,940
flipside could also be argued you could argue that by developers like the

275
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:43,200
twisted project continuing to use Python 2 code and encourage users to use the

276
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,660
older Python stuff that you're slowing down the overall Python ecosystems

277
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,600
yourselves and that if they were making users move forward the overall

278
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,560
ecosystem would be in better shape so the blame goes both ways here I got I

279
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,960
mean I just gotta defend Python a little bit yeah no I'm not actually against

280
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Python right so it's funny because I have kind of the opposite thing coming

281
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,740
at this from someone who when given the choice between Python and Ruby went Ruby

282
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,240
years ago I'm kind of jealous of the standard library like one of one of the

283
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,360
annoying things for me is every Ruby project there's always like four or five

284
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,800
gems you always have to use and in addition to rails right which is in

285
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:29,400
itself like 30 gems it just seems crazy like like that model of architecture

286
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,440
always makes me a little nervous because you have all these like literally 20 or

287
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,320
30 external dependencies at least where in Python most of that basic stuff is

288
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,520
kind of just built in batteries included hmm yep I think the challenge is and

289
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:53,040
this is where this is where I think amber has has a great point is that the way

290
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,640
the transition has effectively gone down from 2x to 3x I'm not gonna use

291
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,560
individual versions because it's just too hard has basically created two

292
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,840
pythons ah yes and you have to look at it from her perspective she's not a

293
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,680
Python app developer you know we're like writing scripting or doing me she

294
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,680
may be all of those things in addition but in her talk she's primarily

295
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,480
representing her open source project which because of just their users

296
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,640
demands right twisted is not a small project has to support both let's call

297
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,360
it both the streams of Python which I don't know man I've been hearing about

298
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,720
the Python 3 transition since before we started the show at some point I mean

299
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,280
you had a you know last year they got rid of the benevolent dictator for life

300
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,280
my why can't the last act be yeah and by the way we're just not supporting

301
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,440
Python 2 which I know is destructive and bad and there are recordings of me

302
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,240
complaining about things rails has done that like destroy stuff I was using and

303
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,160
maybe rewrite it but it seems like there's some Delta between two

304
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,160
relatively incompatible versions and you know we just blow things up every time

305
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,640
you we have a change right like it seems like there's got to be a middle ground

306
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,040
maybe like three years you know I think there's a handful of projects and I

307
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:19,240
believe pythons one of the top three that really moved red hats hand on

308
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,920
introducing a new feature to rel called app streams or in fedora it's called

309
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,720
modularity and this is an idea where you can now have virtual software

310
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,080
repositories that are outside of the version of your main distro so you can

311
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,600
install rel 8 but you could install the rel 7 version of Python if you need old

312
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,080
Python and when rel 9 comes out you could be on rel 8 and you could install

313
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,040
the rel 9 version if you needed a newer version of Python or PHP or whatever it

314
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,880
might be and it's then it's just all through your software package manager

315
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,400
and it's all gets updated as long as it's a supported version that you know

316
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,360
rail makes available and it's projects like this that have forced the software

317
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,320
distributions the Linux distributions and others to come up with these kinds

318
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,520
of creative solutions and you know that's probably you know it's also it's

319
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,120
these kinds of things that have led to the rapid adoption of containers yeah I

320
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,240
would think so because in that case you could have a container running the 2x

321
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:21,280
stream the 3x stream and hopefully be okay okay so um there is also what is

322
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,920
being quoted this is according to the high found blogspot article that we'll

323
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,240
have linked in the show notes the most controversial comment that Brown made in

324
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,760
her speech you know again and we're not criticizing I think good on her for

325
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,720
bringing up these issues so I want to make that clear and that was adding

326
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,680
modules to the standard library stifles innovation by discouraging programmers

327
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:48,360
from using or contributing and completing pi pi package or pi pi

328
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,320
packages I don't want sounds weird when I say it out like that is the naming

329
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,440
that I never quite understood why they named it that but yeah yeah that's that's

330
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,360
some that's some bacon I I don't know if I buy that I could I could kind of see

331
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,960
it I guess they're worried about essentially being Sherlocked would be

332
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,560
the concern I guess but the standard library is never gonna move as fast as

333
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:18,360
an individual project oh obviously right and if there was ever a community where

334
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,320
that was true maybe Cole balls a little slower and I you send your email to Alan

335
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,440
at Jupiter broadcasting I mean I don't know I did at one point author and

336
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,920
support an HTTP library and objective C long long ago and like you know NSH TP

337
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,840
did exist right but yeah you could do like a get request in one line and at

338
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,720
the time that was you know new for iOS with my library why why wouldn't that be

339
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,160
true in other languages I'm just actually it is I'm using a library called

340
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:53,240
sucker punch in rails Ruby on rails that does I think it's what is the hell is it

341
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,840
delayed jobs but it does them as like it's just an abstraction right it does

342
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,120
them as simple you know it spins up the workers all that fun stuff for you it's

343
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,960
just a nicer interface I I do wonder if it's a more of a cultural thing in the

344
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,120
community that Python developers are just used to turning to the standard

345
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,160
library first maybe it's maybe it's because you know it's a lot of that you

346
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,240
always know you it's available kind of kind of situation I think can I zoom out

347
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,560
here for a second zoom out while you were talking and you're touching on a

348
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,040
couple of these things like my community my community guy hat slipped on and I

349
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,880
started thinking what's obvious when you read through the event and it happens a

350
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,000
couple of different times in a couple of different ways the core team and some of

351
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,920
the major developers on some of these projects are essentially just they're

352
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,640
talking past each other and they have different sets of core concerns in fact

353
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,440
in her talk Brown even kind of pointed out a little bit she said that few

354
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,800
Python core developers are also major library maintainers so essentially to

355
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,880
the core Python developers a library author complaints are devalued or

356
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,360
ignored because you know it doesn't affect them there's not there's nothing

357
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,560
that they're working on it's not they can't be their problem she said there's

358
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,120
that issue there and so looking at this I think to me it's clear that people are

359
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,280
talking past each other and then I also take Brown's point here that if nobody

360
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,600
has any skin in that particular game they may not take it as seriously as they

361
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,080
take their part of the job and so you have an empathy problem as well yeah and

362
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,160
also you know I keep making analogies to Ruby one thing Ruby does not currently

363
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,960
have that Python does is Python's being asked to do a lot of stuff right a lot

364
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,960
of different domains with different I'll use the word stakeholders and different

365
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,320
types of developers where let's be honest if you're right writing Ruby

366
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,840
you're writing Rails right so for instance maybe the data scientists group

367
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,920
who uses Python maybe the ML people all have different concerns compared to

368
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,040
let's say you're a flask developer or Django developer and there's this weird

369
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,480
Ubuntu guys running desktops app in Python to boot yeah are they still

370
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,520
around anymore GTK is that a thing no I thought I thought I was using Vala now I

371
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,440
thought that you've been drinking Cassidy's elementary OS Kool-Aid I see

372
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:15,160
sometimes I tell you what sometimes it's just so pretty okay you know before we

373
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,920
go I wouldn't mind since I haven't talked to I wouldn't mind getting like

374
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,320
an update on on your Linux setup right now you run in Linux and is it still is

375
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,200
it elementary is it Ubuntu is it pop where you are right now so things have

376
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,640
calmed down my desktop workstation is the Mac Mini with Mac obviously oh yeah

377
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,240
Mojave right yes you have to on those newer ones you don't have a choice you

378
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,960
do you don't know choice how is the sound level on that thing well I have it

379
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,360
plugged into the LG monitor so is it quiet though like you hear any fans no

380
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,720
much less than yeah no it's the quietest machines yeah that's nice the

381
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:55,200
laptop is the daughter which is running pop night I just updated it 1904 yeah

382
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,480
1904 which is fine right pop is very Mac OS like in that it just works and every

383
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,600
once in a while I forget which OS I'm on in Ruby mine and I get the wrong command

384
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,080
the wrong key commands when you put the Mojave in dark mode I think it looks a

385
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,280
lot like no Michelle yes it's also terrible though I'm liking my Mojave

386
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,440
light these days just because there's always that one app I use that like

387
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,240
doesn't respect dark mode and it's like whoa blinding geez we run an old stuff

388
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,360
geez I'm sorry I will not pay for Photoshop again and then and then there

389
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,200
must be a Windows box in this mix now yeah there's a there's a Windows there's

390
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,160
a Windows laptop that's just used for demos and testing and there's Windows

391
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:44,240
VMs basically everywhere are you are still WSL spelunking I am I'm liking a

392
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,520
penguin quite a lot once WSL 2's out I'm probably gonna take a very serious look

393
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,480
at it really yeah it's shipping a lot of things on Windows I mean most things

394
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,440
it's weird I say that most things you know by volume and just by time worked

395
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,100
we're are shipping on Linux because most of this technology is like web and

396
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,000
server technology so it's all like back end anyway but the front ends more and

397
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,480
more are just becoming like Windows I wonder if I bet you out there must be a

398
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,080
build of that new terminal floating around out there I know you can build it

399
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,840
from source right now but there must be a pre-built one I'm telling you it's

400
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,720
compelling it sounds like some of the WSL folks that are involved like the

401
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,920
penguin developer and some folks from canonical were treated pretty well by

402
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,600
Microsoft around this entire thing got some information we're at the event at

403
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,440
build if they could make it that seems like Microsoft did right I mean weirdly

404
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:42,300
enough going into WWDC I'm actually looking at Microsoft saying okay what

405
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,200
can Apple show for developers at WWDC which is allegedly a developer

406
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,760
conference during that little keynote it's gonna be the year of marzipan no

407
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,520
doubt right I hope it's not I hope in marzipan isn't the ace they think they

408
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,680
have up their sleeve it is the answer is don't worry about all this other crap

409
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,920
just develop for the Apple ecosystem it's simple it's clear this is how you

410
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,160
build the application for both platforms this is how you'd sell it I

411
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,600
mean it's it's a complete story it's an end-to-end story I mean for me it's just

412
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,000
not a practical story no no for many I don't think it is I think that's their

413
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,520
issue that's their gamble is is it practical for enough or is their

414
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,360
ecosystem big enough that makes it forces some people to make it happen but

415
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,960
yeah when you look at it it just marzipan and it just doesn't seem as

416
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,000
compelling if it can't run on other platforms it's funny because when I

417
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,560
think desktop software that I like professionally have to support it's

418
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,600
always Windows now if you could write a marzipan application that would run on

419
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,280
Windows and Linux like electron does dad let me just fantasize for a moment okay

420
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,960
that they create some sort of super fast electron competitor you know just a

421
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,240
screw with Microsoft it's not gonna happen but then it would at least be

422
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,000
somewhat compelling right but if it's just you could your iPad app can run on

423
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,600
the latest version of Mac OS that's a tiny tiny market there's hardly any iPad

424
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,160
users and there's hardly any users of the current Mac OS like okay yeah all

425
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,760
right I'll target about what is that about 300,000 people and how many of

426
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,960
them are actually willing to pay me which is the other thing we didn't even

427
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,000
cover this week the Apple Supreme Court app store pricing thing yeah I just

428
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,760
don't even know what to make of that you know I think it's not gonna matter

429
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,760
really yeah I mean what they're gonna lower 30% to 20% I mean what do you what

430
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,080
do you think is gonna happen I don't know so for those of you that don't know

431
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,480
this essentially opens up the possibility for people to sue Apple for

432
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,040
monopoly practices with the App Store both both users and developers just

433
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,160
yeah yeah and you could really see how a group of developers or users could come

434
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,960
together and put a hell of a suit together there's gonna be some lawyer

435
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,000
that love to go after some of that Apple money yeah but I mean I've heard

436
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,880
everything from Apple doesn't have an issue here to Apple will have to enable

437
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,480
sideloading of applications like they'll have to do gatekeeper for iOS I would be

438
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,840
amazed if that happens but I know but the idea would be by default it only

439
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,280
runs applications from the App Store but you can download applications but you

440
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,360
have to run them in a certain way where the users authorizing them or something

441
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,760
like you know I you know how like gatekeeper works on the Mac yeah yes I

442
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,440
do I disable it yeah yeah I don't know it's hard to say with these kinds of

443
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,320
things it really is we're going into an interesting place I mean I think you

444
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,440
know just do a quick prediction I think this year's WWDC is either going to be

445
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,360
one of the most interesting because they do something really really cool with a

446
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,200
Mac Pro which really cool for Apple would be just do the obvious simple

447
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:43,660
black box or like I have this concern I know people are gonna be mad the Apple

448
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,980
Action Show but I have this concern that they think a Mars up hand is a really

449
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,520
good idea and that it's like super cool and people are gonna be thrilled and

450
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,280
like all the longtime developers were leaving for like Linux and Windows and

451
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,200
moving on to web technologies all of me and a bunch of other people throwing the

452
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,520
whole like Mac Exodus time are gonna just like come back and do Mars a pen

453
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,600
which scares the crap out of me because it says there it suggests they're like

454
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,600
missing the boat completely right it's definitely not a play to reclaim

455
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,480
developers right like I I don't know I would be interested to hear from the

456
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,280
audience yeah are you out there are you psyched about Mars a pen and if so why

457
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,960
what like what do you is it that you already have a successful iPad app and

458
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,600
you just like to kind of spiff off some sales for Mac which makes sense I mean

459
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,320
okay I'll give you an example of this you know because you're saying like you

460
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,920
know you run on the Mac mini what if as a result of bars a pan slack rebases

461
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,400
their Mac app off of their iPad version and it uses half the amount of RAM it

462
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,560
launches twice as fast it's only two gigs okay yeah I mean what if like what

463
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:57,040
if what if that so there's an example of where developers from those companies

464
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,160
who are already producing applications for both platforms can now save time and

465
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,560
money and build for one and gets them off of electron possibly I doubt I

466
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,400
actually seriously doubt slack would do it they have so much invested in their

467
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,280
electron app now but it's a great example of one that would be a great

468
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,600
opportunity I mean I kind of I almost feel like slack is the perfect case to

469
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,000
do it right because they're their Mac app is notorious widely used and like

470
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,200
notoriously crappy compared to native Mac apps but that that's just it's such

471
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,600
a limited use case right so you already have to be big enough on Apple's

472
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:39,960
platforms including Mac OS which is like just a very small platform for that to

473
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,240
be worth it right what if you have a new project you're starting Chris are you

474
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:50,520
really starting in marzipan no no given like Xamarin exists electron exists

475
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,840
flutter exists it's more about you're starting you're gonna make an iOS app

476
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:00,040
and now you can also make some Mac sales I think that's what it might be oh yeah

477
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:05,640
it's gonna be shovel we're central to right like yeah yeah yeah yeah basically

478
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,080
I'm thinking about it from like games to where the UI doesn't have to be very

479
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,880
Mac like like those Altos Odyssey type games yeah I could see that if that

480
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,080
would seems like that would just be a no-brainer for those shops it's gonna be

481
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:24,160
a lot of crap man it's gonna be a lot of crap it's gonna be rough it's the Mac is

482
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,020
going to such an interesting place right now with with marzipan and arm on the

483
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:35,320
horizon and Apple's focus on iOS and the Mac Pro lingering like there it's it's

484
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,120
it's interesting times for them right now and I feel like it's funny because

485
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,120
just as a quick aside like my Linux world is more rock-solid than it's ever

486
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,480
been like I'm the ThinkPad is still really really really working for me and

487
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,680
I've been stupid happy with XFC it's just a very simple desktop environment I

488
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,800
just really need my apps I don't need anything more it's stupid quick the

489
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,600
thing wakes up faster than a MacBook this ThinkPad with all open source

490
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,080
graphics drivers and XFCE like it's legitimately before the screens even

491
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,340
like halfway up it's awake and ready to go it's really great and so I'm looking

492
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,840
back you know from a very detached perspective now because none of my gear

493
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,480
is dependent anymore on what they do where when we were doing the show just a

494
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,240
couple of years ago there were some pieces in the production pipeline that

495
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:28,240
were Mac machines and very critical I just I don't know it gives me a very

496
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,280
different perspective now and I can't help but just chuckle a little bit

497
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,840
because it's just fascinating to see where they're gonna go you know for

498
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,560
people that depend on it for their day-to-day work tool who I say you know

499
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,520
you look at Windows 10 the thing that they really have going for is not only

500
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,320
is the surface line pretty decent Mike but then you do have a bunch of other

501
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,960
vendor options if Microsoft ever screws that up and that's the Windows and

502
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,120
Linux advantage I know I harp on that but I just think you look at it where

503
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,480
there's just so much uncertainty right now on that platform and where I'm at I

504
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,320
feel like I have more certainty than ever I've got more hardware choices than

505
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,680
ever my desktops working better than it ever has I don't know it's just a really

506
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,600
weird position to be in it's weird I mean and for those of us who are like

507
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,640
somewhat tethered to the Mac ecosystem because we my case you know have to

508
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:20,920
compile iOS apps and deploy them it's it's interesting like just ten years ago

509
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:27,120
Apple I felt really had a good like firm grasp of the developer market right and

510
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:32,120
now it's just like maybe it's the relative society see we I mean we can't

511
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:39,560
really post more to it but it just seems like okay like I okay he cards on the

512
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:45,280
table I'm terrified that they're gonna like release this Mac Pro and then in a

513
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,600
year or two you know there will be lots of excited people who've been waiting

514
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,220
for a Mac Pro who will spend lots of money right like this is a type of

515
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,920
machine people are going to finance seriously no yeah and then they're gonna

516
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,560
like switch to arm in a year or two right with their own chips I know that's

517
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,400
what I was saying right which which is kind of like holy shit like you can't do

518
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,240
like it's a huge risk it's a huge risk and it's it's so weird to me because if

519
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,320
they had just like not been stubborn and made a simple black cube called it a Mac

520
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,680
Pro and everybody would have been happy years ago I certainly wouldn't have gone

521
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,820
down this primrose path here right like you it would have been fine right or put

522
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,600
this another way wouldn't marzipan be a great opportunity for Apple to come out

523
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,160
clear they're on the stage of WWDC they name this thing whatever it's gonna be

524
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,480
finally called and they say and by the way this is the technology we're using

525
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,160
to move the Mac to the ARM platform so that way you just knew straight up right

526
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,520
then because there's a very good chance at the second half of the marzipan story

527
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,280
is prepping the Mac for ARM and I think this is a great opportunity for them

528
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,720
just to be straight up all right you want to depend on the Mac platform you

529
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,840
want to plan for the next few years this is our intention and this is their

530
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,680
opportunity this year at WWDC to be clear about it otherwise you're buying a

531
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,880
$10,000 machine or what our $5,000 machine if you get a deal on an iMac Pro

532
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,960
with a ARM transition looming on the horizon that you have no insights on yeah

533
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,800
absolutely I mean and they have done stuff like that before without the

534
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,360
telling you part remember the several years ago when they changed X code to

535
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,560
compile not to native code but to bytecode which is there and why well

536
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,440
because they had the Apple watch in labs but they didn't want to announce it and

537
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,960
they needed to compile down to that architecture or whatever it was right I

538
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,640
don't know and that was a good move you know it's made it it's made like the

539
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,480
Apple watch transition to 64-bit lickety-split yeah I mean I mean the

540
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,160
question is if you're a developer what tools are you using that exists on Mac

541
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,280
OS that don't exist on Windows 10 or Linux and unless the answer is I

542
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,960
develop iOS apps it's kind of like just do whatever you want and probably don't

543
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,360
choose Mac at this point yeah and you're gonna get a taste of it because I

544
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:10,240
believe then so Mojave is the last version of Mac OS that supports 32-bit

545
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,560
applications well that's the other thing bunch of people have a bunch of like

546
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,880
internal legacy Mac apps that are just gonna break yeah so that'll be a good

547
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,600
test of the markets resiliency how how many people hold off on upgrading how

548
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,040
many people upgrade and have things break or how many people upgrade and

549
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,520
it's flawless like I have a suspicion I wouldn't have very much trouble I think

550
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,480
a couple Adobe things I have are 32-bit and I don't really care about those too

551
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,080
much so yeah that's what that'll be an interesting testing of the waters

552
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,000
because that'll be out in the fall I would imagine yeah it should come out in

553
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,520
the fall yeah yeah which is probably when the Mac Pro will ship too it'll

554
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,800
ship in the fall with the new OS so does a Mac Pro ship do you think I think it

555
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,480
does not a WWDC of course I know maybe they announce it then pre-orders open up

556
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,760
like in October or whatever you know and then when the OS ships the Mac Pro ships

557
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,760
and it ships in the week or two around the new OS with the OS pre-installed

558
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,960
that seems like their style doesn't it because they'll satisfy everybody if

559
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,520
they just announce it they don't actually have to ship it it'd be I mean

560
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,520
they should because they're so far being remember that I think the trashcan was

561
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:25,960
released and I might be wrong but I think was released in 2013 yes it's just

562
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,160
just ask John circuit so he'll give you a hour by hour so they may not even

563
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,900
release this thing they probably will not release this thing at WWDC and right

564
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:44,680
now as we record this episode the current Mac Pro ladies and gentlemen

565
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:53,080
yeah December 19th 2013 Wow December of so it was it was basically probably

566
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:58,720
started shipping early 2014 yeah so 2020 if you pre-order one on day one happy

567
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,960
new year second week of January and you know it's great to you know it's so

568
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,000
great about Apple it's so it's so great because a product is a product and it

569
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,680
costs a certain amount of money right and it doesn't matter you if you go to

570
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,160
Best Buy right now or you go to the Apple Store or wherever you go there's

571
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,720
still the same prices that they launched them with in 2013 of course they are a

572
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:26,680
3 gigahertz late 2013 model with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 256 gigabyte

573
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:32,080
hard drive and a single 8 core processor you know instead of a dual processor

574
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:42,120
$4,000 for a machine from 2013 like I love that I love that about Apple it's

575
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,880
like you know that the price is the price and it never changes you know what

576
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,280
I wish I could negotiate like Tim Cook man that's like no just cost what it

577
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:59,000
costs 1978 days since the last update well mr. Dominic it people don't have to

578
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,920
wait that long for a coder radio in fact no it's every single week often on

579
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,600
Mondays you can get it over at Jupiter broadcasting comm all the links
