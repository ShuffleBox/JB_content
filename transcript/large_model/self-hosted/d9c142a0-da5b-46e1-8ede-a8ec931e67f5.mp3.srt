1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
I'm feeling that big 80 energy. We're just one shy as I'm prepping to hit the road.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,240
Episode 80 is going to be from the road because this is my last in-studio self-hosted.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,720
I'm doing all the things, all the pre-flight checks, you know, doing all the updates, Alex.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,560
I'm getting everything ready to go, except for Home Assistant, obviously.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,000
You're a madman. You should do all that stuff when you get back,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,600
because things right now are presumably working fine-ish.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,080
I got a week, right? So I got enough time to fix it if it breaks. No, you don't.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,040
You're prepping for a road trip. But this is how I avoid doing it on the trip.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,040
Because, you know, when you sit there and you see the thing needs updates, it's so tempting.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,960
Yeah, I suppose so. So this is how I avoid it, is I do it now before the trip.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,240
You know, and I go around to like, if the sensors got low battery, like I got a couple,

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,920
like in my bays and stuff, I'm just going to replace them now. Just going to get all that done.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Some minor fixes, you know, stuff like that. That's a good idea. Yeah, absolutely.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,680
So, you know, what's got me thinking is three years ago,

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,560
Memorial Day weekend was when we went to see Wendell,

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,920
which means self-hosted is three years old somehow.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,880
Well, happy show birthday, buddy. How about that?

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,560
Thank you very much, friend guy.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,960
That was pretty good there, pal. I like that.

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,320
I'm not your buddy guy.

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,120
Okay there, pal. Yeah. Wow, that goes by fast, but also slow, but yet really fast.

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:29,840
It seems like just, I don't know, a year ago we were in the Smoky Mountains on the Tale of the Dragon.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,400
That's it.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,000
Doesn't seem like it was that long ago, but 80 episodes almost. That feels like a long time ago.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,040
There's a suggestion that for each decade now of episodes, we have a rich area of musical

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,920
history to tap into so we can really lean heavily on the 80s tunes for the next 10 episodes.

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,320
Oh, I like this idea. What happens when we get to like, you know, episode 200 or something?

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,200
What do we do? Do we go into the future?

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,080
200? Oh my goodness. That's a long way away.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,120
Well, by then we'll be the self-hosted franchise, I would imagine, you know,

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,720
with the self-hosted blog and the self-hosted YouTube channel and the self-hosted-

32
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,440
We'll have been bought out by Google and then we'll have unmerged from Google,

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,440
of course, because that's how JB rolls.

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, yeah. You got to do both. Let's be honest.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,280
It's not a one-way deal with you.

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,560
Man, you know what? You get married, you get divorced, you get married again. You know,

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,960
it's really that second marriage you wanted to stick. It's that second wife, I always say.

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,720
Well, I wanted to get an update from you on that new fancy, shiny ARK Intel GPU. How did that go?

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,400
I know you ended up receiving it, but I imagine now you've had a chance to actually plug it into

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,040
something.

41
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,400
Yeah, it's plugged into my little test box behind me. I ordered the Intel ARK GPU, as you say,

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:56,000
the ASRock A380 is the model number. And I got a notification, I think it was on Reddit or

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,240
something saying, you know, these GPUs will be in stock on Newegg tomorrow. So I, you know,

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,200
went and ordered one or pre-ordered one, I think it was, and it shipped. I didn't actually expect

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,880
to actually get one as soon as I did. The thing is, when it arrived and I plugged it in, I thought,

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,440
okay, cool, right, I'm going to plug it in. And I'd read online with gamers Nexus and a few others

47
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,400
that the drivers weren't particularly good on Windows. I'm like, well, I don't really care.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm not going to be gaming on it. My primary use case for this thing is to stick it in a server,

49
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,160
pass it through, and then maybe get rid of my Blue Iris dedicated box.

50
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,360
Because I could use the quick sync functionality that's built into this GPU

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,080
for hardware encoding, maybe, maybe Blue Iris, maybe Plex, whatever. So I installed Proxmox

52
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,200
on my system behind me, got the pass through working in five minutes because it's super easy

53
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,080
on Proxmox these days. Code 43 in the Windows VM, just like we used to get with Nvidia back in the

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,120
day. So something in the drivers, and I don't know what because I'm not clever enough to figure that

55
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:11,120
out. But code 43 basically is the warm, warm sad trombone moment when you when you get the drivers

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,280
installed. So pass through to a Windows VM was no go. And I thought, okay, can't be that difficult

57
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,200
to do pass through to a Linux VM. How wrong I was, Chris, how wrong I was.

58
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,440
Yeah. Is it just too freaking new? Is that the problem? Because I don't know anybody that has

59
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,920
one of these. Michael Larivelle over at Ferronix has one too, thankfully. And he's written a couple

60
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,800
of articles about this thing. And this graphics card is so new that of course, because Intel ship

61
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,280
all their drivers as part of the Linux kernel, I need to go and download the 6.0 RC release from

62
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,680
GitHub and actually run mainline kernel and compile it and pass a couple of kernel arguments to force

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,600
it to use the the GPU. And so how's that going, Alex? How's that been going? It's more effort

64
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,520
than I'd imagined so far, Chris, I'm going to be honest with you. And it's like one of those things

65
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,400
where how motivated are you right now? Because if you wait three months, it's probably going to be

66
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,880
done for you. Right? It's like, God, how much you just want to do it right now versus just wait?

67
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,640
Well, I'd love to do it right now. Because I actually think as part of the public service,

68
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:30,160
angle that this show kind of fills that a media server oriented card like this that has a lot of

69
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:38,000
really exciting new hardware encoding stuff on it with the AV1 encoders. I'd like to give the people

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,760
an idea of how well this thing does or does not perform with Plex with Jellyfin with Handbrake and

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,720
FFmpeg and all those kinds of things. I suppose all of those things actually lead to FFmpeg under

72
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,280
the hood, really. But I follow what you mean. It's like, do people want to know, is this worth their

73
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,080
money? Is this worth actually investing in? Is this the next way to build my next media server?

74
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,240
Yeah, because, you know, potentially you could you could that old Xeon that you've got chugging

75
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,400
along, you could throw this graphics card in there and potentially have a very low power,

76
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,920
highly performant hardware encoding setup for your media server. You could do that with an AMD

77
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,200
chip as well, or even an Intel CPU that doesn't have a latest QuickSync in there, you know,

78
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,640
like an old third or fourth gen, something like that. So lots of options if we can get it working.

79
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,640
And I've been really busy playing Factorio this week. And that's not the best excuse in the world,

80
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,680
that's why I haven't done my homework, teacher. But the factory must grow, you know?

81
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,840
Are you playing this on your new shiny Steam Deck by chance?

82
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,120
Actually, no. That also arrived this week. It's been an expensive month.

83
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,600
Hold on a second here now. Hold on, hold on. So you get a new Steam Deck, you're playing a Steam

84
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,720
game, but you're not playing it on the Steam Deck. So here's the thing about Factorio,

85
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,600
particularly, and a lot of the games I seem to like, are these kind of isometric kind of city

86
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,200
builders, where you need a big canvas to see all the different bits and bobs all, you know,

87
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:14,560
gesticulating on the screen. And unfortunately, the 1280 by 800 little screen that the Steam Deck has

88
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,400
ain't quite it, chief, you know?

89
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,560
And it would struggle, it would, it would struggle mightily if you tried to hook that thing up to a

90
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,080
monitor that big. I've experimented and you go much higher on the resolution and you start to

91
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,800
leave the optimal zone of the Steam hardware.

92
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,240
I've been really, really impressed with the Steam Deck for the, you know, sort of casual gaming,

93
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,120
like, you know, Forza Horizon or F1 2022 or whatever, you know, playing those sorts of games,

94
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,280
like I'm taking a flight to LA soon, it's going to be amazing on the plane to be able to do that

95
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:54,400
kind of stuff. But for more air quotes, serious gaming, like Factorio, it's not quite the right

96
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
fit. But my goodness is an impressive device overall.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,040
And what a fantastic retro emulator. Absolutely the most solid retro emulator experience I've had

98
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,360
for the Super Nintendo. I got the nostalgia feels like it was the good old days playing the Super

99
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,760
Nintendo on a CRT. It just is so tight, the way everything works. And then also there's just,

100
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,160
like, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game, Shredder's Revenge, also just plays incredible

101
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,240
on the deck. And you can hook up controllers to it either over Bluetooth or over USB. And so like,

102
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,200
for example, my son and I are sitting there, I set the deck down, and we both have controllers,

103
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,400
and we're playing Turtles Shredder's Revenge on the deck. And it's great for that kind of stuff.

104
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,800
And it's killer, killer for anything that works really good with a controller.

105
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,520
I saw you pop up in my notifications in Steam saying Chris Lass is now playing Turtles. I was

106
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,120
like, yes, good for him. Yeah, that's great for that. It is. I really think that they've got

107
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,280
something there. And the fact that it's open, that you can install stuff, you can get to the desktop,

108
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,680
you can tinker with it. I love that trend. And I hope that takes off. Others see this, I hope.

109
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,880
It's a first generation device, so it's not perfect. But again, besides the battery life at

110
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,520
two hours, which on a flight is going to be a bit of a problem. I mean, at home, it's absolutely not

111
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,120
a problem because I just plug in a cable. For a first generation device, I think Valve must be

112
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,040
absolutely commended for everything they've done to progress and further the Linux narrative with

113
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,120
Proton. Everything they've done over the last, I guess, seven or eight years since they announced

114
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,560
that very first Alienware Steam box, I suppose. That's what this has been leading. It's been

115
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,960
coming since then, really. There've been a few things happened in the meantime that have kind

116
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:54,400
of made this possible, I suppose, like AMD's propensity to create gaming console quality

117
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,080
mobile chips that things like what go in the Switch and what have you, although that's Nvidia,

118
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,320
that one. And their work to upstream those, right? So that stuff's just in the kernel.

119
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,040
That's just it. And I was saying to someone the other day, I got the one with the anti-glare

120
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:17,040
screen and the 512 SSD that's in there. So it wasn't a cheap device. I think it was about 650

121
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,400
or so. I would pay that again, quite happily, just to support Valve and what they're doing.

122
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,760
And I think voting with your wallet really is the only way to send a true message. And there's so

123
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,080
many companies out there, like Nintendo, that want to lock people into gaming so hard that when you

124
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,680
buy a new Nintendo Switch, for example, which I did when my wife was pregnant, I realized that

125
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,960
actually I have to spend another couple of hundred bucks on games for this thing. Whereas when I buy

126
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,760
my Steam Deck, I've got the last 10 years of my Steam library sat there ready to go. And we can

127
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,000
have an argument about Steam DRM probably till we're blue in the face. But the fact is that I

128
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,320
didn't get locked into a proprietary ecosystem. I'm running Linux so I can go under the hood and

129
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,800
as you say, run EmuDeck, all of that emulation stuff as well on the same device. And it's just

130
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,520
so, so cool. I'd be curious to know if anybody out there in the audience has integrated the deck

131
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,960
into their home lab setup somehow. Is there something there? I had a real wow moment. I've

132
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,000
got a USB-C monitor just here. Oh yeah. And it's got Ethernet in the back of it as well as a couple

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,400
of USB ports. One cable into the Steam Deck charged it, gave me Ethernet and gave me a 4K

134
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,400
output to display to do all the tinkering. And I'm like, okay, this is convergence in action right

135
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:46,560
here. I know it works. It actually works. They've done it, Jim. Yeah. I'm really impressed as well.

136
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,000
So let us know how you're using it. If you've picked up a Steam Deck and if you're considering

137
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,080
it, it's a thumbs up from both of us. I agree with Alex. I think one of the best things is you take

138
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,760
it out of the box, you log in and you've got games. You don't have to go spend a bunch of money.

139
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,320
I just need an 18 terabyte hard drive to go in that thing now. Cause even though I've got the

140
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,560
512 one, it's, you know, F1 is a hundred gig. The Witcher is a hundred gig. Red Dead is, you know,

141
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,080
three or four games and it's full. You know what I mean? I do. I do know what you mean. We've been

142
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:21,040
getting a lot of feedback around our topic in episode 78. It seems like it had a big impact

143
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,080
on a lot of people. That story that Google flagged a dad and then auto-batched up his

144
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,920
entire Google account history from the early aughts and sent it to the cops. That seems to

145
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,680
have really stuck with people. And I think it stuck with both you and I a lot too. Cause we've

146
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,760
talked off air that you and I are still thinking about it. It feels like something's changed. A

147
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,440
real line has been crossed by Google. Like the risk reward calculation about using Google services

148
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,640
has changed. And for some of us pretty dramatically. Last episode, I was talking to you in Chrome and

149
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,480
this time I'm talking to you in Firefox. Uh-huh. Interesting. Yeah. I've also switched to using

150
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,080
Firefox. I just cold turkey quit. I, uh, I exported my bookmarks and just switched over.

151
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,160
I actually looked into self-hosting the Firefox sync server. Uh, there's a couple of things that

152
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,720
go into it as well. If you want, if you want to go into the weeds of it, you've got to self-host

153
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,280
the authentication server as well. And it really starts to get pretty complicated, pretty fast.

154
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,520
So I didn't end up doing that for now, but it is something I'm going to keep an eye on. There's a

155
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,720
rust based implementation of the sync server. That's fairly new. There's an older one, which is

156
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,640
no longer supported by Mozilla. So there's a few options there, but, um, you know, I suppose if I

157
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:39,680
think about it, what's the sync session syncing my browser history and, uh, my bookmarks really

158
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,480
passwords are in bit warden. They're not being synced extensions, I suppose extensions. Yeah,

159
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,080
of course. So I don't really know what the future holds, but I still have to use Chrome through

160
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,800
work because Red Hat or a Google suite, uh, company. So, I mean, I guess I could use Firefox,

161
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,080
but it's easier to use Chrome. Even still, Mozilla feels like a way less bigger threat,

162
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,520
you know, like galactically smaller threat than, than Google. I feel like for me, what's,

163
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:12,640
what's shifted is I now see all of Google services as a bit of a minefield and you could see how they

164
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:18,160
can really compound to screw you really good. And now, like, am I going to one day find out that

165
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,160
they are also parsing communications to try to detect things that could be harmful for children

166
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,880
in our communications? You know, they are, you know, if they're not the NSA already. So it just

167
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,960
kind of compounds the risk kind of compounds the more you use Google. So when I get back from the

168
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:38,080
road trip, I'm going to cancel Google Fi. I'd, I had kind of gotten it over the years. I have

169
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,200
a T-Mobile SIM coming tomorrow. I've already canceled my Google Fi. Yeah, I almost did it.

170
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,600
And then I was like, this might be really stupid to go on a road to be right about to go on a road

171
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,840
trip to cancel cell service. But when I get back, I'm done. You know why I did it before the trip

172
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,400
is because I'm flying Delta and they have free Wi-Fi with T-Mobile. Well, okay, there you go.

173
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,480
That's the incentive you needed. I think that's great. But I was thinking about it, you know,

174
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,280
you know, I'm a big proponent of tail scale. I realized I actually use the Google authentication

175
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,800
for tail scale, which is a problem. So I'm gonna have to fix that. Probably gonna move to head

176
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,800
scale as a result of all this. Finally, finally do the self hosted thing, you know, eat my own dog

177
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,280
food. But there's so much stuff on the web that tracks you when you actually start reading and

178
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,160
looking into the privacy stuff. This might sound obvious to some people, but it hadn't occurred to

179
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,760
me that every time you see that little login with Facebook button on a web page, whether you use it

180
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,600
or not, they're using that to track where you are. Yeah, they're getting they're getting info,

181
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,160
aren't they? It's gross. It is gross. And a lot of people use it because it, it does it, you know,

182
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,320
it takes care of the username authentication. That's a tricky one. It's really tricky one.

183
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,680
I don't really know what the solution is there. I really got to figure out where I draw the line

184
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:02,080
with Google because I've also got the set up for Google apps. Prozac boosted in with a row of ducks

185
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,240
along this line of thinking. He said, I don't know how I feel after listening to episode 78. I left

186
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,360
Google a long time ago and I switched to DuckDuckGo. My mail is in a paid service in Norway,

187
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,720
yada, yada, yada. But I guess I'm still magnifying my tinfoil hat. Now that the new normal is for

188
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,240
our tech overseers to be the judge and the jury, that makes me a complete target because I'm not in

189
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,080
the system, a system that says maybe I'm guilty by default. It's a no win game unless a large number

190
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,200
of people get away from those services. So in other words, you almost put a target on your back

191
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,200
by not participating in these systems is what Prozac is saying. Do you though? I mean, there's

192
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,760
already, there's so much noise. I guess, I guess he has a point actually. There's so much noise.

193
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,040
There's so much signal to noise that they've got to process with, with these things. But that's

194
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,080
where machine learning comes in is to help, help do that. And a machine can't do much learning if

195
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,720
you're not part of the system, I suppose. Yeah, that's true. You're protected in the,

196
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,400
in the like automatically flagging you because the machine learning thingy just misunderstood

197
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,680
what you took a picture of or what you had a voicemail about or something. You're like

198
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,680
avoiding all of that trap. There is a dystopian future playing out here though already, isn't

199
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:22,800
there? Where if you're not, if you're not part of the, uh, the Amazon or the Google ecosystem,

200
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,800
you know, you're not allowed to buy prime. You're not allowed to buy stuff off Amazon.

201
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:33,280
You're not allowed to, I dunno, whatever the, whatever the problem would be. And Josh in the

202
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,480
chat says, don't put all your eggs in one basket. And to that, I would just counter that there's

203
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,760
only three or four baskets to really choose from with, with big tech in air quotes. You know,

204
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,480
there's really not as much choice as you might imagine when it comes to the, the internet.

205
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,640
Has anyone out there successfully cut off Amazon completely? I mean, how do you do that? Especially

206
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,760
in the day and age where a lot of people can't get stuff, but Amazon can still get it.

207
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,960
Can you imagine if somehow your social credit score prohibited you from accessing AWS based

208
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,280
services? That already does. They won't let me on. No, I don't mean as a customer. I mean,

209
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,880
as an end user, you, you are not allowed to load any traffic that traverses Amazon's network

210
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,080
somewhere. That'd be pretty awful. That'd be most of the internet, wouldn't it? What about this

211
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,680
concept of just don't put all your eggs in one basket? Like, so maybe Mozilla's handling your

212
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:34,800
syncing and maybe fast mail's handling your email. Trevdev boosted insane. He switched to fast mail.

213
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,880
I know. I think you mentioned you're looking at fast mail. Yeah. Yeah. I've been with fast

214
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,360
mail for a while now. I use proton mail for some things. You're still using somebody else's service,

215
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,320
but you're kind of spreading the risk out. Is that better? Well, I mean, I found it interesting.

216
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,680
You think talking about email specifically, there's, there's a link in the show notes. There

217
00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:00,080
was a blog post doing the rounds this week about a guy who's been self-hosting email for 23 years

218
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,920
and has finally thrown in the towel and basically gave all the reasons that you might imagine as to

219
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:12,080
why he stopped. Email is not distributed anymore. He says you cannot create another first-class

220
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,320
node in this network. Email is now an oligarchy, a service that is gate kept by a few big companies,

221
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,120
which does not follow the principles of net neutrality. First, they cut off the residential

222
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,800
IPs. Then they cut off the VPSs. Now they've basically cut off all self-hosters. He says,

223
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,520
my emails are just simply not getting delivered anymore. After running a mail server since 1999,

224
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,120
the day he got a broadband service. And ever since then, he's been running a mail server and he says,

225
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,920
now it's just completely, he's throwing in the towel. He says hell banning everybody,

226
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,960
except other big email providers is a lazy way to fight spam and it's dishonest.

227
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,480
He uses spam as a scapegoat to nerf deliverability and stifle competition.

228
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,560
Absolutely. It's all about stifling competition in my opinion. And the issue isn't necessarily

229
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:09,200
that your IP gets blacklisted and you get sent straight to spam. The issue is that you get part

230
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,360
of a block of IPs and your mail just simply gets rejected before it even gets that far.

231
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,880
And what do you do then? You completely SOL.

232
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,880
Your really only best option, if you find you can't self-host your mail,

233
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,600
is you need to at least own your domain. Don't have an at Gmail domain. Don't have an iCloud.

234
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,840
Though Apple would love to tell you that they have the most private system. Actually,

235
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,920
I probably believe them that they do actually, of all of them, of the big three or four, I suppose,

236
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,560
with that, what's it called? iCloud Plus or something?

237
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,120
For now.

238
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,600
For now.

239
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,680
For now. Though as they begin to monetize services and things like that, they're going to have to

240
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,960
drive revenue from advertising. And they're launching more and more resources and staff

241
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,920
around their advertising department. So we shall see. Carlos, the guy that had this email,

242
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,160
shutting down his email server, he says it's a huge, invisible problem that really isn't

243
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,960
getting fixed. Email is basically going to the big tech companies. I think he's right.

244
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,200
I think the future for that kind of stuff is Matrix. I mean, not that it's going to replace

245
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,040
email, but for something that you can self-host and federate and is truly decentralized and open.

246
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,640
I just wonder where email will be in 10 years time. Answers on the postcard.

247
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,920
selfhosted.show.com Yeah, let us know.

248
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,400
Okay, then photos. I just have a quick update. You mentioned image last week.

249
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,360
Image. I-M-M-I-C-H.

250
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,160
And we got a little bit of knowledge from Fuzzy Mistborn. He says, I think he might be a lawyer,

251
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,120
he says, the Fourth Amendment only protects against government searches.

252
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,920
So, a EULA can and does allow for Google to search all of your photos.

253
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,920
So, I think it came up, you know, does the Fourth Amendment protect you here?

254
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Fuzzy Mistborn says it does not.

255
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,320
I think I tried to sound intelligent and say they needed a warrant or something.

256
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,720
I wish they did. I wish they did.

257
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,720
So, I gave Image a try, which is a self-hosted photo and video backup solution that's

258
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,120
aiming to have a client on Android and iOS that auto backs you up, just like Google Photos does.

259
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Only you self-hosted all yourself.

260
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:26,320
And the basic UI of the web app is very much like the early days of Google Photos.

261
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,920
Yeah, it looks pretty promising, huh?

262
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,120
It does. I'm very excited about this. However, having used it for a bit,

263
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:40,720
I'm also a little sad because I realized after using it, we're like five years out.

264
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,320
I mean, like, you're going to get really basic functionality where you can look at your photos

265
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,320
and probably put them in albums and you can probably upload them.

266
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,120
Although, it sounds like iOS is giving the developer a hard time.

267
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,720
He's an iOS user himself.

268
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,520
But they just did a big update this week and they got Android auto backup working.

269
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,720
They got deduplication working.

270
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,520
They got dark mode on mobile, but iOS users, he's having a hard time with the background killing.

271
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,920
Yeah, it's those background APIs, huh?

272
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,920
There's a lot of finesse there to get that working.

273
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,320
Yeah, and I think that's where Apple probably have an anti-competitive advantage in that

274
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,720
they have system level access to APIs that normal mortal developers just simply don't have.

275
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
It might just be for iOS users.

276
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,920
The solution is to just let iCloud have the photos for a bit, pull them off of iCloud,

277
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,920
with the backup scripts we've talked about on the show before, and then upload them to something like this.

278
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:39,520
I do think image is probably the emerging leader in the pack of all of these different photos apps.

279
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,520
I mean, I wrote for Ars Technica, I guess, 18 months ago, a couple of years.

280
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,120
I can't remember when exactly.

281
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,320
You know, I did a roundup of all the runners and riders at the time, you know, Photo Prism and,

282
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,320
you know, there was about 10 or 12 in that list at the time.

283
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,120
And I think image has come along out of nowhere since the article, really.

284
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:08,720
And really, if he delivers, which so far, the developers given us absolutely no reason to believe that he won't deliver on his promise.

285
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,520
If he delivers on it, then I think this is probably going to be the app to beat.

286
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,320
Agreed.

287
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,520
You know, we get Photo Prism recommended a lot, and it is part of a solution, definitely.

288
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,720
But this is a complete, this is like, give it to your family, give them this app.

289
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,120
It just auto uploads in the background, that kind of stuff.

290
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,720
That's really exciting.

291
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,320
And it's pretty easy to get up and running in Docker.

292
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,920
It just takes a few seconds.

293
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,720
So here's the thing.

294
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,120
I mean, it's been architected as microservices.

295
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,720
So, you know, it's what, four or five containers all linked together.

296
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:46,720
But for me, I think we're at a point where these services need some kind of financial incentive.

297
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,120
To be able to have the resources to beat Google or Apple or whoever.

298
00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:04,320
I mean, Google's budget for Google Photos must be astronomical for the development, for all the machine learning bills that it has, et cetera, et cetera.

299
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,120
Now, obviously, we're outsourcing a bunch of that cost to our servers, to our hard drives, to our CPUs, whatever.

300
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,520
So the argument sort of kind of goes away.

301
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:30,720
But with that comes a lot of vertical integrations that Google can do with, you know, matching lots and lots of different dogs and making their algorithms better and more accurate and that kind of thing.

302
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
I'm sure it's very valuable for them in that regard.

303
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,520
And so I wonder, you know, if you're listening to this show, if you were in the market to pay for this app.

304
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,720
Let's just, for example, say image.

305
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:50,720
If you were to pay a subscription to support the development of this application, not to unlock any functionality like what Plex do, for example.

306
00:25:50,720 --> 00:26:01,120
Just simply, I guess, sort of like the Home Assistant model to say, here's five bucks a month to support this developer's ability to go to the grocery store.

307
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,920
Is five bucks, would you be willing to pay that for a completely self-hosted application?

308
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,520
Where does the line draw?

309
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:17,920
Because I know personally subscription fatigue is real, but also I'm fatigued of giving up my privacy to these big companies.

310
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:30,320
And I remember one of the things you said to me in the car on the way to Wendell was we can't have self-hosted just be cloud bad, local good, because the cloud isn't all bad.

311
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,320
And I don't wish to sit here and say that cloud is all bad at all.

312
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,920
Just bash on Dropbox, bash on Google, bash on all these big companies, because they do offer a lot of cool stuff.

313
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:46,720
But at the same time, got to draw a line somewhere, and I feel like that line is inching, inching.

314
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,720
It's moving like the border in Georgia.

315
00:26:50,720 --> 00:27:03,920
I think the part that's really shifted is the automatic just batching up and transferring of your Google account to the authorities where they can review your chat history with your wife and your friends to see all the stupid stuff you said for the last 15 years.

316
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,520
I think that's where the line got crossed, and that's the new calculus.

317
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,320
And that's why I'm willing to look at things like image.

318
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,120
Yeah, I'm looking, you know, I'm looking, does he take GitHub sponsorships?

319
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,720
You know, I'm looking at this.

320
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,920
I don't like the buy me a coffee stuff.

321
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,920
His work is worth more than a cup of coffee.

322
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
I also don't like calling it a tip.

323
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,120
It's not a tip.

324
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,720
He's working really hard.

325
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,920
In fact, he even says in this Reddit thread that he posted, he likes he'd like to be able to do this full time because he thinks it's a full time job.

326
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,920
And I agree after using it.

327
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:46,720
The reason I got sad is I realized this is a massive undertaking like huge.

328
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,120
I didn't I didn't really connect with it until I actually used it in its current state, which is super early.

329
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,920
And he says right here, you know, he'd love some more get up sponsorships because he would love to eventually work on this project full time.

330
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
I think he's going to need to.

331
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,720
And I don't know if there is the will out there to sponsor something like this.

332
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,520
Maybe that's changed.

333
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,320
I don't love that it's going to be through a GitHub sponsorship or the buy me a coffee thing.

334
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,720
I wish it was a better system than that.

335
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:23,120
If only there was a free and open decentralized way to send people money that wasn't under the control of capricious tech companies that have lots of things to protect.

336
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,720
What could that be, Chris?

337
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,720
I don't know, Alex. I don't know.

338
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,520
Leno.com slash SSH.

339
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,720
Go there to get a hundred dollars in 60 day credit on your new account.

340
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,920
It's a great way to support the show while checking out something really awesome.

341
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,920
It is the Geeks Cloud with 11 data centers around the world.

342
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:51,120
They've been hard at work for nearly 19 years, creating the best experience to run your applications on Linux in the cloud under your control.

343
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,520
This is my go to cloud platform.

344
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,720
It is a model in which they have actual support.

345
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
I love this about Linode.

346
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,720
But on top of that, they've continued to invest in their hardware aggressively over that 19 years.

347
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,120
In this last few months, MVME storage has been rolled out to the rigs.

348
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,720
They're constantly updating the CPUs as new models become available.

349
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,920
They are their own ISP, so they always have the optimal routes.

350
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:25,520
And then they have a bunch of really great services like S3 compatible object storage, which can really change your offsite game.

351
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:33,120
Easy to use API with lots of libraries that you can take advantage of, cloud firewalls, physical boxes if that's your thing.

352
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,720
I mean, there's really like a thousand reasons I could list.

353
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,120
I think that's why they did the hundred bucks, because then you can just go there and try it yourself and see what I'm talking about.

354
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,320
The performance is incredible.

355
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,720
I wouldn't host JB's new website anywhere else.

356
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,920
And the other thing I love about Linode is they get the big picture.

357
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,520
They invest in the community.

358
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,520
You know, they're making our road trip possible.

359
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,120
They're making these meetups possible.

360
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,320
They're supplying the swag.

361
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,320
They're not going to make a million bucks off us taking a road trip to go meet the audience.

362
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,720
They're investing in the community because they know long term that pays dividends.

363
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,920
After you've used Linode for a minute, you'll understand.

364
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,520
If you're like me, you'll also start to use some of the more advanced features as well.

365
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,120
And then you're really going to love it.

366
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,920
So for the best customer support, super fast rigs, super fast networking and a Linux culture that runs deep.

367
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,720
Those are just some of the reasons I choose to use Linode.

368
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,320
I think you'll find your own.

369
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
Go get that hundred bucks and try it.

370
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,720
Put it over the top, kick the tires.

371
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,120
Linode.com slash SSH.

372
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,920
Support the show, get a hundred dollars to try out something awesome.

373
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,520
That's Linode.com slash SSH.

374
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:46,320
So it was our third birthday this week, Home Assistant also celebrates a birthday nine years old.

375
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,920
That's impressive.

376
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,320
Yep.

377
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,120
September 17th, 2013, Paulus made his first commit for Home Assistant.

378
00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:00,720
And then today they announced as we record version 22.9, which is their birthday release.

379
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,120
They've revamped the automation screen.

380
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,920
I don't know if you've had a chance to look at it, but they now have collapsible cards for triggers, conditions and actions.

381
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:18,320
And they also have an overflow menu where they've moved some of the less common use things and some of the more frequently commonly used things.

382
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
But it is a nicer UI overall.

383
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,920
And they've added a new weekly schedule calendar element.

384
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:29,920
So you can actually you get a seven day calendar and you can draw on there like it's your meeting calendar.

385
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,220
So that's kind of nice.

386
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,820
It's actually it looks like a pretty clever way to to solve that particular problem.

387
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,920
Big revamp in the UI, Alex.

388
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,420
I updated today.

389
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,720
I don't really notice a difference, but I haven't built an automation since.

390
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,520
You updated to a dot zero release.

391
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,420
You are raw dog.

392
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,020
You are braver than I.

393
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,420
I do it for the show.

394
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,820
I do it so you don't have to.

395
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,120
Right.

396
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,720
Yes, that's right.

397
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,020
I do remember saying to you before the show that when stuff breaks, I think we call that content in the business, right?

398
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,320
That's probably true.

399
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,620
There was a lot of talk.

400
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:09,920
I watched the release announcement, which is like long and there was a lot of talk in there about improvements to Bluetooth.

401
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,720
Bluetooth speed.

402
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,120
If you're using they stress, you really need to be using home assistant OS to take advantage of all these improvements.

403
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:22,420
But a lot of speed improvements for Bluetooth communication esp to 32 devices can be used as Bluetooth proxies.

404
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:29,120
Home assistant is actually now selling some Bluetooth proxies easy for me to say in their online store.

405
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,520
Big improvements for Bluetooth devices and they think it's going to open up to a lot more devices.

406
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,220
Wow, nice.

407
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,520
Yeah, it is nice.

408
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,920
That's a good area to improve.

409
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,120
If only you had received your home assistant yellow by now though, huh?

410
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:49,420
It was supposed to be here yesterday, but I got an updated email saying it should promptly arrive after I've been gone for about a week on the road.

411
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,120
So I'll have to wait till I get back.

412
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,620
I guess one of these days.

413
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,620
We'll do a show and we'll be able to actually review it.

414
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,420
Whereas all the YouTube has had theirs like a year ago.

415
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,020
Yeah, maybe ours will be like a better though.

416
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,820
It'll be like the final edition.

417
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,320
Yeah, maybe the shipping one.

418
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,120
Maybe productive.

419
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,820
What do they call it?

420
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,320
Like a production sample, not an engineering sample, right, right.

421
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:16,020
ZigBee users are going to be happy to know that there's now a ZigBee backup and restore option in home assistant.

422
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,120
So that's actually really nice.

423
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,720
That's you.

424
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,420
You're a ZigBee user these days.

425
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,020
I am now.

426
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:28,220
I'm a big ZigBee guy now, don't you know and it turns out I didn't realize this but I would have been so well if I had to if I had done like a

427
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,520
restore of home assistant on like maybe on a new device or something.

428
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,320
I guess none of my ZigBee stuff would have worked.

429
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,320
I had not even realized that nor had I to be literally just said that I know.

430
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,620
Thank you, Chris.

431
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,620
Good to know, right?

432
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,620
They now have fixed that and you can back up and restore your ZigBee stuff.

433
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,320
But also they now have a really slick migration assistant.

434
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,120
If you just maybe like want to move to a new radio, you want to upgrade your ZigBee radio for some reason.

435
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,920
They'll handle all that migration stuff because I guess some of that's written to the controller.

436
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,020
I think that's really neat to see there because ZigBee is going to be the future.

437
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,820
We'll see.

438
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,820
They did actually do some updates to the Z-Wave support as well.

439
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:13,420
I did see the verge pick up this week that they were doing they were controlling a home kit compatible.

440
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:17,820
I think that the headline was this is why it matters.

441
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,620
Well, I can control home kit from somewhere else and I was like, yeah, okay good headline chaps.

442
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,020
Well done.

443
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,520
I might have grabbed a matter related story for the member post show.

444
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,120
Oh, yeah.

445
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,520
Okay.

446
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,520
I can't wait to get there.

447
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,620
I may have I may have also there's just been a few UI updates.

448
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,720
You can see a processor and memory usage in the home assistant UI,

449
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,120
which is nice for people using it on a hardware device and then a couple integrations.

450
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,020
There's so much more in the release announcements.

451
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,620
These are just my highlights but a couple integrations that caught my eye.

452
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:51,820
The Android IP webcam app is now available as an integration into home assistant.

453
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,620
So you can easily set up tablets that you're using as a dashboard

454
00:34:54,620 --> 00:35:01,720
or your Android phones as cameras that feed into home assistant now super easy to do that slick.

455
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,020
And then also there's an integration now for the fully kiosk browser.

456
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,020
So if you're using a tablet with the fully kiosk browser to display home assistant,

457
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:17,020
there's now an integration that allows you to control certain things get information about the tablet

458
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:23,020
like its battery level what current page is displaying how much RAM is available.

459
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,520
You can also do things like you can remotely refresh the kiosk page.

460
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,020
Bring it to the front lock the device.

461
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,120
You can turn motion detection on and off the screensaver on and off from home assistant.

462
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,320
Now for your Android tablets that you might have around your house

463
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,520
or should have around your house acting as a dashboard for home assistant.

464
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,020
I just think that's a neat integration.

465
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,720
That is a really cool integration.

466
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,420
I was I had one of those aha moments with home assistant this week

467
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:53,520
when I have bought a new an Elgato key light to make my face look more beautiful,

468
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,020
you know from from my camera for those of you listening on audio makes zero difference,

469
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,620
of course, but for the live stream, I mean you can see how many gray hairs I have.

470
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,020
That's just what brings the people to Jupiter tube Alex.

471
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,320
That's what it is. Exactly.

472
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Yeah, but when I plugged in this Elgato light it connected to my network via the app on my phone

473
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,820
and then within a minute or two home assistant picked it up

474
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,020
and was like there's an Elgato integration.

475
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,620
Do you want to enable it and I was like click?

476
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:26,020
Yes, I do boom boom done moments like that remind me that actually this stuff super cool.

477
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,020
I love that had the same experience obviously with the Shelly devices,

478
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:35,820
you know, they just get on the Wi-Fi network and boom home assistant just sees it.

479
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,320
You know, you click a button.

480
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,120
I just set up another Shelly smart plug on my test bench upstairs.

481
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,320
I have a super secret rig that I'm testing right now.

482
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:51,920
And so one of the things that I do in my test is I want to know what the power usage is in various scenarios.

483
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,620
And I you know, I used to have what I used to do Alex is I used to get a kilowatt.

484
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:01,020
I don't know if you've seen these kilowatt devices and then I would just I would I would run a benchmark

485
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,220
and I would walk over to the kilowatt and I would write down with the power usage was right

486
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:09,320
and then when the benchmark and I'd walk over to the kilowatt right down with the power usage was

487
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,220
and now with the Shelly I just pull it into home assistant

488
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,820
and then I can just look back over the entire,

489
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,420
you know review period and see what the power usage was and you know,

490
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,020
that's so freaking valuable for me.

491
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,720
So there's a lot of interesting ways you can use home assistant.

492
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,820
Are you exporting any of this stuff to influx so you could do historical data?

493
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,220
It's a good idea. There's a there's an exporter built into home assistant that you can enable

494
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:38,620
which will ship out that data to influx DB, which is a time series database.

495
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,020
And then you could put if you if you wanted to a Grafana front end in front of that

496
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:47,620
and make pretty graphs or query it based on whatever, you know query logic you want to use.

497
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,620
So I found that very useful for stuff like hard drive data where I want to know

498
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:54,920
what the temperatures were from season to season so I can actually look

499
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:01,020
and see on average how warm or cool my my basement is just simply based on the fact

500
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,820
that my hard drives are 10 degrees warmer on average in the summer than they are in the winter.

501
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,420
That's a great idea. I'd love to know that data.

502
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,220
I don't care so much for the bench stuff, but boy for dupes with influx.

503
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,120
You've got to be careful though because it's writing constantly obviously not an SD card.

504
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,820
Otherwise that will burn out pretty dang quick peely.

505
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,920
Yeah, so I don't know just some kind of SSD or something is probably the way to go for that.

506
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,720
That's a good tip. I have one other like home assistant related tip.

507
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,620
If you have hacks, which do you still use hacks at all on the HACS community store, right?

508
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,820
Yeah, the home assistant community store.

509
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,320
I believe I don't remember if it's in there or if you have to go find the repo,

510
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,220
but there is a tail scale integration now.

511
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:51,920
So my home assistant blue has tail scale

512
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
and I you know, when you're on the home assistant OS,

513
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,020
it's not like you can just SSH in and install the tail scale package

514
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,720
and get it on your tail scale network.

515
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:05,720
And I already have one home assistant system that is subscribed to Nebuchadnezzar cloud.

516
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,420
And I don't know how to have two different home assistant systems on one Nebuchadnezzar cloud account.

517
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,620
So instead of getting two Nebuchadnezzar cloud accounts with two different email addresses,

518
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:20,020
I just put one home assistant on tail scale and it's working great.

519
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,020
It's better than that darling. It's an official add-on these days.

520
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,820
Is it? Well, there you go.

521
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,820
I have to say it's been working really well for me and it's how I am doing remote control

522
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,220
of one of my home assistant instances now and I give it a big thumbs up.

523
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,420
Not a sponsored thing, just telling you this is one of the things I've done recently.

524
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,420
I still think it's worth paying for Nebuchadnezzar if you don't.

525
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,920
So I'm not saying avoid paying.

526
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,520
I just didn't want to have two accounts, although I did consider it actually.

527
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,520
I did consider doing it,

528
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,620
but I just didn't want to have to manage it with two different logins and all that kind of stuff.

529
00:39:53,620 --> 00:40:00,120
So Lord Pandemic asks in the chat room, anyone know if you can use Nebuchadnezzar and tail scale at the same time?

530
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,520
And so I think the answer to that would be yes.

531
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,120
With tail scale, if you use the split DNS functionality,

532
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,920
so let's say you have a specific subdomain you use just for your LAN stuff.

533
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,020
For me, I have a couple of letters which delineate the site that I'm at, for example.

534
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,720
So, you know, let's just say AB would be site one and CD would be site two.

535
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,720
So it'd be ab.domain.com and cd.domain.com.

536
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,820
And in tail scale, you can go into their magic DNS settings and do what's called split DNS

537
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:36,020
and actually have tail scale route to the specific DNS server in that local subnet in that location

538
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,320
and look up the home assistant domain name in your LAN that way.

539
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,220
But if you're also paying for Nebuchadnezzar, you've pretty much got it open to the internet anyway.

540
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,920
I know it's obfuscated through a long series of letters and numbers,

541
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,520
but it's security through obscurity, that one, and it's open to anybody.

542
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,920
So if you're worried about people accessing your home assistant remotely,

543
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,520
maybe the Nebuchadnezzar thing isn't the remote access portion of it anyway, isn't the way to do that.

544
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,020
Maybe tail scale is, but I'll leave that up to the listener.

545
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:15,920
And there is one key difference between the community tail scale version that I'm using and the official add-on.

546
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,120
So the official add-on is kind of like a control panel for your devices in tail scale,

547
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:27,820
but it does not put your home assistant instance on the tail scale network.

548
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:32,620
So the community edition actually puts the machine on the network.

549
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:38,520
That's the difference. And you need that if you have a home assistant OS based system.

550
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,920
If you're just, you know, rolling your own OS and then, you know,

551
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,320
doing like container version of home assistant, you just install tail scale on the base OS like you normally would and it'd be fine.

552
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,820
I'll put a link to both of them in the show notes so you can, you know, pick and choose the one that works best for you.

553
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,820
Because if you got like the Nebuchadnezzar cloud thing,

554
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,820
then you probably just want the tail scale control panel where you can control devices and stuff.

555
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,420
But if you don't have Nebuchadnezzar yet or you got an additional home assistant box,

556
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:09,220
you might want the full tail scale stuff. For that, you're going to need the community add-ons.

557
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:17,020
humio.com slash H C E. That's where you go to ingest all of your logs in one place.

558
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,920
Humio is a centralized log management and observability platform.

559
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,820
The company was founded by developers in Denmark in 2016 as an alternative to legacy logging solutions

560
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:32,420
that make it cost prohibitive to ingest and search tons of logs.

561
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,420
I mean, you know how many logs just one of your boxes produce these days.

562
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,420
What if you threw all of your systems in there? That's the real beauty of Humio,

563
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,020
is it takes the logs from any source and it makes them usable.

564
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,820
You don't have to constantly massage the format. You don't need to provide it a schema.

565
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:53,520
You just pump them all into Humio and they're there when you need them with a great dashboard.

566
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,520
And their platform is crazy fast.

567
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,620
Humio's index-free architecture means you can ingest over a petabyte of data per day

568
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,320
and then search that data with sub-second latency.

569
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:08,820
But I'll tell you what, I think the best way to get going with Humio is probably the Community Edition.

570
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:14,820
Humio Community Edition is the largest no-cost data ingestion offering on the market today,

571
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,820
allowing you to ingest up to 16 gigs per day with seven-day retention.

572
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,820
It's not a trial period. You get it for the long haul.

573
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,520
This is perfect for self-hosters who are maybe trying to do a little troubleshooting,

574
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,820
figuring out what's going on. Maybe you want to put all your devices in there

575
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,320
and get a view on your entire environment at once.

576
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,320
So much simpler when you're trying to troubleshoot.

577
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:38,320
Actually going to every place to check every log, especially when you're dealing with Home Assistant.

578
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,320
Now, yeah, it'll also take your Home Assistant logs.

579
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,320
It's great. You could use it to monitor power consumption.

580
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,320
You could use it to monitor the health of your system.

581
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,320
You could use it to monitor your system log and more.

582
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,320
And the best part is, Humio just figures it out.

583
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,820
So go try the Community Edition. It's awesome.

584
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,320
We already have listeners out there that are trying it out right now.

585
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,320
Some of them out and they're off-grid setups. Very jealous.

586
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,320
It's such a great system.

587
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,320
And the best part is, you get that forever.

588
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,820
That seven-day retention, 16 gigs per day.

589
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,320
But you got to get started by going to humio.com slash H-C-E.

590
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
That's the Community Edition. It's free.

591
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,320
humio.com slash H-C-E.

592
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,320
I did something I should never do today.

593
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,320
Smoke crack?

594
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,320
I updated to the iOS 16 beta.

595
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,320
Oh, you did?

596
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,320
It's the release candidate, in fairness.

597
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,320
I put that on my iPad. I didn't dare put it on the phone.

598
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,320
It's nice.

599
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,320
Yeah?

600
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,320
It works well.

601
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,320
I just wanted that lock screen. I just wanted to try out the...

602
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,320
Sure.

603
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
Literally, I just wanted to try the lock screen.

604
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,320
Yeah, it's always nice to know what apps might need updating or might break, too.

605
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,320
You know, if you got the ability.

606
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
And you work from home.

607
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,320
My favorite feature so far is the battery percentage.

608
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,320
Really?

609
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,320
That's it.

610
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:57,320
Oh, Apple. They give it so, so slowly.

611
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,320
They really do.

612
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,320
Yeah, the iPhone 14 has always on display.

613
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,320
And I jokingly said to a buddy of mine,

614
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
Yeah, welcome to 2014.

615
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,320
Yeah, my Pixel 3 has that.

616
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,320
Yeah.

617
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,320
Now, the satellite calling actually kind of legit.

618
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,320
That's pretty cool.

619
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,320
Yeah.

620
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,320
I could see, you know, even though I'm not like some extreme hiker,

621
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,320
I could see being on a back road somewhere

622
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
and, you know, need to make an emergency call.

623
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,320
Or you're in the middle of nowhere in your RV,

624
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,320
and there's a couple of dodgy looking dudes coming your way.

625
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,320
You know what I'm saying?

626
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
Yeah, that has happened. You're right.

627
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,320
And the thing is, is they said that it's not only going to be restricted to emergency calling.

628
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,320
Like, there'll be some other limited functionality like you can use Find My with it.

629
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,320
So, if you needed some...

630
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,320
Oh, could I order a pizza to the middle of Death Valley?

631
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,320
Probably. Yeah, I think you probably could.

632
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,320
I hope so. Otherwise, what a waste.

633
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,320
I wonder what the delivery fees would be for that.

634
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,320
What you do is you sign up for DoorDash.

635
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
You get the free membership delivery.

636
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,320
Right. Yes, life hack.

637
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,320
Hey, you know what?

638
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,320
Maybe we'll order a pizza at our Airbnb because the crew is getting together.

639
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,320
We have meetups coming up,

640
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:10,320
and the Jupiter Broadcasting crew is renting an Airbnb next to JPL.

641
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
So, we have a whole series of meetups along the West Coast,

642
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:19,320
meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, including one in Southern California near JPL.

643
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,320
Oh, I am so excited.

644
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
We got the JPL tour.

645
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,320
We got the roadshow.

646
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,320
You know, somehow I talked Brenton to join us again, or he talked me.

647
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,320
I'm not exactly sure.

648
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,320
This is one of those events that I can't quite believe is actually really happening.

649
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,320
Like, it's just too cool for just a bunch of dudes, right?

650
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,320
It is too cool.

651
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,320
I'm really excited about it.

652
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,320
I'm also excited about all the meetups along the way.

653
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
We're going to do some geocache stashing.

654
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,320
So, even if people can't make it to the meetup, if they're in that area later on,

655
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,320
they might be able to go find like a swag bag or a box or something.

656
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,320
We're going to have shirts and some Linode plushes.

657
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,320
If you bump into a wild Brent at any of these meetups,

658
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:01,320
I did seed him with a few of those self-hosted stickers I made for London that were left over.

659
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:06,320
So, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for these meetups and future ones.

660
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
We will have future ones.

661
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:12,320
And then we also have – we have what's called a space in Matrix.

662
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,320
It's like a way to organize several rooms together.

663
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,320
And we have what's called a meetup Matrix space.

664
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,320
So, we have a chat room for Raleigh near Alex.

665
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,320
We have a chat room for Ohio for the Ohio Linux Fest.

666
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,320
We have a chat room for London.

667
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
We have a chat room for the West Coast.

668
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
As we go, as we build out, we'll just add more chat rooms.

669
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:35,320
So, eventually, we'll probably have different East Coast and Central and I don't know, Australia.

670
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,320
I mean, no, it just kind of depends as we kind of spread out.

671
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,320
We'll build different ones.

672
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,320
You joke.

673
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,320
We've had people in Matrix asking about an Australian meetup.

674
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,320
Does anybody know of a self-hosted meetup app that we can run?

675
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,320
Because I think we need to just – we just need to bite the bullet

676
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,320
and let people, you know, start setting up their own meetups, Alex.

677
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,320
True.

678
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,320
Right?

679
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,320
I think that'd be pretty cool.

680
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,320
If anybody does know, send it in.

681
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,320
That'd be great.

682
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,320
We got some boosts into the show.

683
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,320
Our first one comes in from the Linux Trucker, 30,000 SATs.

684
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,320
He says, I was listening to the latest show and I wanted to write in with my experience with ZigBee.

685
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:12,320
The first thing you bullshit do is switch over to ZigBee to MQTT.

686
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,320
It's so much better than ZHA.

687
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,320
It makes adding a new device a breeze.

688
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,320
Second, the Aquare brand is top notch.

689
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,320
In fact, the Aquare buttons are way better than the Tradfy ones.

690
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,320
Or is it Tradify?

691
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,320
How do you say that, do you suppose, Alex?

692
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,320
Tradfy?

693
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,320
I say Tradfree, but I have no – it's like,

694
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:38,320
when I first read Harry Potter, I read Hermione or Hermione for like three years.

695
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,320
So don't ask me.

696
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,320
I have no idea.

697
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,320
You've never said it out loud?

698
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,320
Okay.

699
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,320
He also says the contact sensors are phenomenal.

700
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,320
I just wanted to let you know about a little gem I found.

701
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,320
It's called the KiwiSet cover kit.

702
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,320
It will connect with any deadbolt and turn it into a ZigBee lock.

703
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
Forget the August and all the other expensive ones.

704
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,320
This is a game changer.

705
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,320
You keep your existing locks, you keep your existing keys,

706
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
you just make them ZigBee.

707
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,320
It uses AA batteries and it works all the time.

708
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,320
I'm sometimes gone overnight for a few days,

709
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,320
and anything smart I put in my home has always managed to break before I get back.

710
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,320
But the Aquare and the KiwiSet are both very reliable.

711
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,320
Thanks for the show.

712
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,320
Well, that's some really great recommendations, Linux Trucker.

713
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,320
Thank you.

714
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,320
Yeah, I need to make sure I'm grabbing devices that can be gone for a while

715
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,320
and reconnect because sometimes things go offline and I don't get to it for a few days,

716
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,320
or I leave an area and leave a device behind.

717
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,320
That's good to know.

718
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
I don't know about going to MQTT though.

719
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,320
Well, I don't really add a device to my ZigBee network all that often.

720
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:48,320
I mean, I go through phases where I add a dozen at once and then nothing for six months.

721
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,320
And that's fairly simple.

722
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,320
You turn the Add to Network thing on.

723
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,320
It stays just in discovery mode.

724
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,320
You plug it in or whatever.

725
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,320
You tap the button.

726
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,320
I mean, it's not that hard.

727
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,320
I don't know what I'm missing.

728
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,320
I feel like I should try it for science.

729
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,320
But again, everything's just working, so I don't want to jinx it.

730
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,320
So why has Papa John boosted him with 10,000 SATs?

731
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,320
He wants an update on your thoughts on iPhone versus Android.

732
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,320
He says he knows we've talked about this before,

733
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,320
but he's looking at a Pixel phone currently,

734
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,320
and he's having a hard time choosing between Android and iOS

735
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:21,320
because he needs a second phone for some personal applications he's going to be using.

736
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,320
He's been in the Android ecosystem for years,

737
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,320
but he's not opposed to trying the fruit.

738
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,320
So he wants our thoughts.

739
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,320
And you're the most recent Android convert,

740
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,320
so I'm curious what your update is.

741
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,320
Well, I've still got my OnePlus 7T knocking around.

742
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:42,320
It's actually just my sofa phone because I much prefer the Reddit client for Android,

743
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,320
which is called Boost that I used to use.

744
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

745
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,320
I can't let that pass.

746
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,320
Your sofa phone, Alex?

747
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,320
That's amazing.

748
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,320
Well, here's the thing.

749
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,320
If I was to sell it, it's only worth like $70 or $80,

750
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,320
so I'd just rather keep it.

751
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,320
I've got a sofa laptop, right?

752
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,320
It's an old laptop.

753
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,320
It's nothing fancy.

754
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,320
I'm not going to throw it away, though.

755
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,320
It still browsers the web, so I'm just giving you a hard time.

756
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,320
In terms of feature parity and stuff like that,

757
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,320
I mean, there's a few headline features,

758
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,320
like if you want to watch a smartwatch,

759
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,320
then there's only really one game in town.

760
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,320
If you want to integrate with your laptop and your tablet

761
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,320
and AirPods and all that kind of stuff,

762
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:31,320
there's only really truly one game in town that's actually worth the prices they charge.

763
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,320
From a usability perspective on both platforms,

764
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,320
they've each got their quirks.

765
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:43,320
I really still strongly dislike the new Google Material UI that they went with.

766
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:48,320
Those used to have five or six quick settings along the top in Android 10 and 11.

767
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:55,320
I thought that was a perfect balance and blend of screen real estate to usability and functionality

768
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,320
if you long pressed them and all that kind of stuff.

769
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:02,320
I don't find Control Center on iOS to be particularly intuitive,

770
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,320
although it does get the job done.

771
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,320
Just the way that Google kind of took their UI,

772
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,320
the direction they took it in last year, I think, with Android 12,

773
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,320
I just don't like it.

774
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,320
So it's just personal preference on whether you like the UI or not.

775
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,320
But I think it boils down to this for me.

776
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:23,320
I'm taking a lot of photos with a toddler running around,

777
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,320
and often they're in questionable lighting situations.

778
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:35,320
I've never, and I've tried a lot of Android phones from OnePluses to Samsungs to Pixels to,

779
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,320
there's another brand whose name escapes me,

780
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:43,320
and nothing really came close to the iPhone with regards to that low light performance

781
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,320
of keeping up with a toddler.

782
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,320
And for me, the camera at the moment, as a fairly new parent,

783
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:55,320
is the most important thing about the device I have with me all the time.

784
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,320
Everything else I can kind of make do and kind of make work,

785
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:05,320
and it doesn't quite feel as comfortable on iOS even a year in or so,

786
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,320
because I think I switched around Christmas.

787
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,320
But it's fine. It's good enough.

788
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,320
I can get everything done that I need to get done,

789
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,320
all my messaging is through Telegram and other places.

790
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:21,320
So switching from one platform to the other these days is really not a big deal.

791
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,320
It might feel like it before you do it, because I certainly felt that way.

792
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,320
But it's just, just try it.

793
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,320
You know, what's the worst that happens? You go back after six months.

794
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,320
Just avoid the iMessage trap, because that can be a bit of a black hole.

795
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,320
But yeah, I think Alex has nailed it.

796
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,320
I also find iOS to be, on average, more stable.

797
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,320
Apps on average to be slightly better, a little more polished,

798
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,320
a little more performant. Generally, they're going to be native, not always.

799
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,320
And then obviously, the privacy situation is hopefully better with Apple,

800
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,320
but I think you could argue either way.

801
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,320
All right, last couple of boosts.

802
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,320
We had a blank user from Podverse boosted in.

803
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,320
And we got this from a lot of people, so I wanted to get this in here.

804
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,320
We did.

805
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,320
I think I must have had about two dozen pings about this app,

806
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,320
even though we talked about it.

807
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,320
We just cut it from the show, unfortunately.

808
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,320
There is an overseer fork for Jellyfin called JellySeer,

809
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,320
and it does work great.

810
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,320
And you know what? Fair enough.

811
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,320
That I think is worth mentioning.

812
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,320
We also had authorities boost in with 5,555 sat,

813
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,320
saying, this episode has me moving from Plex to Jellyfin.

814
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,320
But the issue is I like Plex's remote feature for listening to music on the road.

815
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,320
What are your recommendations for streaming content from Jellyfin

816
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,320
when outside your home network?

817
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,320
I've come across a few articles that mention doing it with tail scale,

818
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,320
but I'm wondering if that would actually work seamlessly with the phone.

819
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,320
Love the show.

820
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,320
So there is actually a couple of options here.

821
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,320
Jellyamp is one of them.

822
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,320
It's a web-based player that you can also use on the desktop.

823
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,320
And it is not the same as Plexamp.

824
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,320
I'm going to say that right up front.

825
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,320
This is not the same.

826
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,320
But it does kind of accomplish what you're looking for potentially.

827
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:04,320
And then I think the one that really has some promise is the Jellyfin audio player,

828
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,320
which is now in open beta testing on iOS.

829
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,320
Now this is a local app a la Plexamp.

830
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,320
And it actually looks really great.

831
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,320
You got to set it for the test flight beta.

832
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,320
And I think there is an Android build as well.

833
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,320
But yes, there is an Android build as well.

834
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,320
And that I think might be the way to go.

835
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,320
So we'll put links to both of those in the show notes.

836
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,320
This is an area I'm going to look into as well because I have decided as well,

837
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,320
Jellyfin for me when I get back from the road trip.

838
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,320
I'm going Jellyfin both in the RV and I'm going Jellyfin here at the studio.

839
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,320
I appreciate all of the hard work from the guys at Plex,

840
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,320
but I need a system that just is rock solid offline too.

841
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,320
There's a couple more as well, of course, with all these things,

842
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,320
particularly with Jellyfin.

843
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,320
It seems like there's a pretty good proliferation of clients.

844
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:59,320
There's one called Geli, G-E-L-L-I, as well as Finamp is another option as well.

845
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,320
So there's lots of options with Jellyfin.

846
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,320
I think that's really the name of the game.

847
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,320
With Plex, it's almost like the Apple way, like this is how it is, boys.

848
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,320
This is what you do.

849
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,320
Whereas with Jellyfin, there's about 20 different clients

850
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,320
you could use for different platforms.

851
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:20,320
And there's one I know I'm going to have to pry from my wife's cold dead fingers,

852
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,320
and that's Prologue, the audio book app for iOS.

853
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,320
I'll be interested to see what Hadir makes of you switching away from Plex

854
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,320
because I know she loves the Prologue.

855
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,320
Oh, crap.

856
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,320
You're right.

857
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,320
So if anybody in the audience, that's what that sigh means,

858
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:44,320
if anybody in the audience has a good audio book solution for Jellyfin

859
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,320
that's in the same class as Prologue, let us know.

860
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,320
And obviously, we know about audio bookshelf already

861
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,320
because we covered that previously, so you can keep that one to yourself.

862
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,320
But if you know something that's in the Jellyfin ecosystem,

863
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,320
then let us know at selfhosted.show slash contact.

864
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,320
Indeed, that would be great.

865
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,320
You can also send us a boost.

866
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,320
I'm trying out Podverse right now.

867
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,320
I think it's going to stick.

868
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,320
I like it because it's totally GPL, which I think I've just decided

869
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:17,320
with all of this recently, sometimes I'm just going to pick the free software app,

870
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,320
even if it's slightly not as optimal as maybe like say Overcast or something

871
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,320
or, you know, Podcast Addict, I know people love that,

872
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,320
or Antennapod, people love Antennapod's free software.

873
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,320
But it's like, at least I'll know where to be around for a while.

874
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,320
You know, at least I know it's not going to rug pull me.

875
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,320
And those screw pulls are intact.

876
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,320
And they have iOS and Android versions.

877
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,320
I like to flip-flop sometimes.

878
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,320
They have an F-Droid repo.

879
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,320
I appreciate that.

880
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,320
They got a web player, and it's embedded in the new JB website.

881
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,320
So Podverse.fm, I think that's a great one.

882
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,320
Also, Fountain is really great.

883
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,320
And if you don't want to switch podcast players to Boosted,

884
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,320
you can check out things like Albee and, of course, Breeze.

885
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,320
We'll have links in the show notes if you want to try it out.

886
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,320
We do get that question a surprising amount about what do you recommend as a podcast player.

887
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,320
So for you, it's Podverse.

888
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,320
I've been using Pocket Casts personally for many years,

889
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:13,320
but I do think with all this Boost stuff, you just earn satch just for listening to other podcasts,

890
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:17,320
and then you can send them to creators just as a little tip to say thank you.

891
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,320
Yeah.

892
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,320
In the Fountain app, check out Fountain.fm.

893
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,320
I'll put a link.

894
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,320
You know what, I'll put a link to my profile in Fountain.

895
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,320
Sometimes I share clips on there and stuff, and then I get a referral bonus.

896
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,320
How about that?

897
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:33,320
Because I think this Google Photos thing, going right back to the beginning of the show,

898
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,320
there's got to be more support for independent creators,

899
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:41,320
because there was a plea you made in this week's Linux Unplugged that kind of resonated with me.

900
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,320
I was just a lowly listener this week.

901
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:48,320
I wasn't in the episode, but where you were talking about the future of independent podcasting

902
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:53,320
and making a plea for people to wake up and sort of see what's happening around

903
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,320
and not being preachy about it.

904
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,320
Especially with dynamic ads, that's where I really think things are going sideways,

905
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:05,320
is the dynamic ad companies have figured out the best thing to do would be to get on as many podcasts as possible,

906
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,320
even tiny podcasts, and then just saturate all of them with ads,

907
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:12,320
sell one sponsor across a thousand podcasts at once, and that's what they want to start doing.

908
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:19,320
And so if you like content like this, you can always become a subscriber over at selfhosted.show.sre.

909
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:25,320
That's obviously a very direct way to fund the JB Network and all the shows on it, including this one, of course.

910
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,320
But there are other ways as well through the boosts.

911
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:35,320
That's what they're for, that's what they're part of the show for, is to help support Chris's podcasting habit.

912
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,320
Yeah, it might be a podcast disease now, Alex.

913
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,320
Oh yeah, maybe. Is it graduating?

914
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:46,320
I think so. I think it went from hobby to career to disease now. It's all I do. Good thing I like it.

915
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:50,320
Perhaps. So we do this show live every two weeks on a Wednesday,

916
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:56,320
although I think next week you might be on the road, so the live thing is potentially up for debate.

917
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,320
We'll see when we get there.

918
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:02,320
We'll give it a shot. Yeah, we'll try. I mean, we may have to do it offline if the bandwidth is rough,

919
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,320
but if we can do it, we'll be at jupyter.tube on a Wednesday.

920
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:12,320
And you can get that converted to your local time at our brand new, fancy, shiny website, jupyterbroadcasting.com.

921
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:20,320
That's right. The fancy new website, jupyterbroadcasting.com, with dynamic live, jblive embedding on the live page,

922
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:26,320
and it's fully built in Hugo and completely self-hosted up on Linode and all that good stuff.

923
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:30,320
So go and take a look over on our GitHub if you want to contribute to that website.

924
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:36,320
We've talked about it a bunch in LUP and office hours as well with the fantastic work that Brent's been doing over there.

925
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:43,320
And I really look forward to seeing some of you at the upcoming meetups, meetup.com slash jupyterbroadcasting.

926
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:48,320
As I've mentioned a few times, self-hosted.show slash contact is the place to go to get in touch with us.

927
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,320
And you can find me on Twitter at ironicbadger.

928
01:00:51,320 --> 01:01:00,320
And also Twitter too, at Chris LAS, the show is at self-hosted show and links to what we talked about today are at self-hosted.show slash 79.
