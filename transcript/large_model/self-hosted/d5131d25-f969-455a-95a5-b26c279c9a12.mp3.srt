1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Think we have something like 70 people signed up for the East Coast meetup so far

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,200
69 baby nice

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,520
You know, it's gonna go up from there too because it always kind of goes up a few ticks in the last day

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,880
Now the question that I I have is this barbecue place gonna have enough meat

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,840
Well, I've been emailing them back and forth and it's a little bit complicated

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,600
Like we don't want to have to charge everybody like tickets and admission and that kind of thing

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,640
but you know a barbecue restaurant they make a certain amount of food in the morning and

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,080
Well the night before and once it's gone, it's gone. So yeah

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,780
There are a couple of things that we can do to help kind of mitigate that you can pre-order on the website

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,500
so, you know when you turn up to the spot you can walk into the restaurant and they'll sort of

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,040
Carve your food while while you wait in there without waiting in the normal line

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,620
The other thing that we were thinking about doing but we're not sure of the logistics and how it would work is giving them numbers

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,180
Before hand so that we can actually make sure there's enough meat for everybody. Well, the way that would work is if people sign up

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,500
On the meetup page. Yeah, so it is critical if you are coming, please make sure you sign up on the meetup page

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,900
So we have a really accurate idea of numbers and equally if you aren't able to make it, please unsubscribe

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,100
Please saying you know, you're not coming anymore. That's really important, too. I love that. We're running into this problem

17
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,900
And this is just a great problem to have we are thrilled to have this problem and we want it to be an even bigger

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,980
Problem, so if you can come on come hang out with us on April 9th in Raleigh, North Carolina

19
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,860
We have all the details of meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting and don't worry

20
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:35,200
We're gonna bring some snacks too. So and they're not gonna be meat snacks. So if you're not a meat eater

21
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,940
There will be something for you. You know, I think we're bringing a Brent with us

22
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,020
So we've at least got to take care of him, right? Right? He'll be our vegan advocate

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,300
You know, he always stands up for the non meat eaters because he's about the only one in our crowd

24
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,260
I

25
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,780
Was browsing the old hacker news the other day and I came across a docker.com blog post

26
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:01,360
About a speed boost achievement for docker desktop in 4.6. This is fascinating story Alex

27
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,140
Yeah, I think so too and the performance of docker desktop particularly on the m1

28
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,060
silicon Apple silicon max has been

29
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,440
Bad enough that I have literally stopped using docker on my Mac

30
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,080
And I just SSH into a server and use it there and do all my builds on a remote server

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,520
Yeah. Oh

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,080
Okay, so, you know, we're gonna talk today about how I'm looking at ditching containers

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,480
so we thought we should probably have a little bit of container good news and

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,540
This is a neat little happenstance. There was a discovery by the Asahi Linux team Hector Martin

35
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,500
Who's trying to port Linux to the m1?

36
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,680
Discovered that Apple's MV me drivers are really really great

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,080
except for a particular function called the f-sync and

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,900
Depending on how this is called and when it's called. It's

39
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,080
Horribly slow on Mac OS so Hector discovered that

40
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,740
Talked about it publicly. They've submitted code upstream the Linux kernel to solve it on on Linux

41
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,980
But it isn't necessarily solved on the Mac. And so a docker user noticed this

42
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,700
We'll have a link to the github issue and said hey, by the way, this might help performance

43
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:21,580
I've done some testing here and I've noticed that if you use the same fix that Hector Martin found and you apply it

44
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,420
You're gonna get this kind of expected performance increase and you know

45
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,640
Just one of these great examples of community helping, you know

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,160
Really improving a product like this the docker team took a look at the suggestion and said yeah, you're right

47
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,600
Let's implement it and and now they're saying some operations are like 98% faster

48
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,960
Well, they were pretty slow beforehand. So I mean

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,800
They had plenty of headspace to improve that. Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting

50
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,360
And you know as we record the Asahi Linux team just released. I think it was you know a few days ago their first alpha

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,600
right and

52
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm gonna give it a go this Sunday by the time people are hearing this it'll be just like

53
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,680
probably

54
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,040
The weekend this episode came out, but we tried it at first and there's a there's like some

55
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,680
File-system typical problems you'll fall into that just sort of trap you it's like I don't know if you ever played that game pitfall

56
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,840
You know, yeah, you're running along and also you just fall into a pit

57
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,760
That's what it's like right now trying to get Linux on the m1

58
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,880
but if you solve file system problems

59
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,800
Or you don't have any file system problems and you're trying it on an m1 Mac like like an air or a mini

60
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,360
it seems to be pretty straightforward and

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Early benchmarks are showing

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,640
Pretty good performance as long as you're not hitting that GPU

63
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,600
Yeah, you know what's interesting is Jeff Gehling released a video this week talking about his experiences with the new Mac Studio and

64
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:56,080
in that video he did some power comparisons between a recent Ryzen system that he built a Linux gaming PC

65
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,880
compared to the Mac Studio and I

66
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,940
Couldn't quite believe what I was seeing but then at the same time having used the m1 MacBook Air and my m1

67
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,840
Max MacBook Pro god, that's such a stupid name. I

68
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Just called the MacBook max

69
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Okay. Yeah, well, it's still a stupid name. But yeah, who thought max Mac was a good one

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,280
Anyway, I know, you know, there's just nobody to say no anymore. Is there anyway, that's a bit of a segue bit of a tangent

71
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
bit of a tangent

72
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Yeah, the power draw was a lot better though. You're right the like the wasn't the Ryzen something in the 40 watt neighborhood?

73
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,080
That's right. Yeah. Yeah, the Ryzen was about 38 40 watt something like that and the Mac Studio idle was 6 watts

74
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,760
It's the same as a Raspberry Pi. Yeah, and in the context of Docker desktop, too

75
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:53,240
you really got a you got to figure the majority of the use case is for development testing and

76
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,120
So this f-sync change doesn't really impact things much other than you know improves performance

77
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,680
I think I'm not sure Alex

78
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,280
But I think there's an argument to be made that it might be slightly less safe the way the way they've changed this operation

79
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,080
but it kind of feels like

80
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,360
You know again for a development Docker setup

81
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,240
It doesn't it doesn't really matter if it's slightly less safe because you're not running your production

82
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,680
Server on this thing. Yeah, it's a similar type of operation to when you make a bunch of rights to a USB Drive, right?

83
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,400
After you've written some data

84
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,680
You need to sync it and make sure that those rights have occurred and the file system tables all been updated that kind of thing

85
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:38,280
So as it turns out Mac OS actually cheats as you said Chris on Linux f-sync will both flush rights to the drive and ask

86
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,060
It to flush its right cache to stable storage

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,800
but on Mac OS f-sync only flushes rights to the drive itself instead they provide a

88
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,920
f-full sync operation to do what f-sync does on Linux

89
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,440
Aha, so you got f-sync and you got f-sync full sync

90
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,720
Now on the laptops I can see why they would do this, right?

91
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,240
Because essentially the laptop has a built-in UPS if you yank the power cord on a MacBook

92
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,640
It's gonna keep on trucking right but on a Mac studio same on the iPhone right same on iPhone

93
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,080
Yeah, absolutely, but on a Mac studio or some kind of other desktop

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,120
Once you pull the power cord your toast

95
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,320
So this leads me to wonder what would happen to you know data integrity on a desktop Mac that doesn't have a built-in battery

96
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,840
Yeah, you got to figure Apple must have done the math

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,920
But there is that sort of cynical voice in the back of my head that goes well, you know

98
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,440
They may have just designed this for mobile devices because that's their primary device now

99
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,120
And you know when they sell max the the number one Mac they sell are the laptops

100
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,300
So they're probably designing for that, you know

101
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,560
I got that's the voice in the back of my head when I hear that and I think to myself

102
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:56,420
Maybe APFS needs a few more years before I give it the old production grade for any kind of serious data storage

103
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:03,480
I mean that said I've experienced zero issues with APFS and the migration was flawless and I

104
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,080
Really give them credit for the migration. I also give them credit for

105
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
the really kind of

106
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,280
low-key

107
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:19,800
But consistent rollout they did over three versions of Mac OS to sort of slice and dice the way that volumes are managed on

108
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,400
APFS like they really executed well on that transition. I'll give them credit there

109
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,280
that that doesn't change the fact though that we haven't seen a lot of

110
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,120
Production server grade edge case uses out there for years, right?

111
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,560
And I don't mean to be the old IT guy in the room

112
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,800
But for me for a file system to really be production grade safe for like server data

113
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
I want to see other people

114
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,000
Banging on it for a few years in production in the way I'd be using it

115
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,680
So if it's containers or or whatever it might be, you know, like yeah, they've did they've done

116
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,040
Well, and I think that sets the ground for a pretty good file system that I can trust

117
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,400
But it's still like for it to actually be considered safe in my brain

118
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,080
I got to see people using it the way I'm using it and I got to see that working for a while

119
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,040
Yeah, so with all that in mind, okay. I really hope that Asahi Linux

120
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,760
Works well in a couple of years time and you know with the market is flooded with these cheap

121
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,800
M1 Mac minis that are now obsolete from Apple software and we can all run low power

122
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Linux Apple silicon

123
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
home service

124
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,680
Leno comm slash SSH go there to get

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,560
$100 in 60-day credit on a new account and you go there to support this here show. Yeah, that's right

126
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,360
This here shows made possible by you taking advantage of our sponsor when it comes time for you or someone

127
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,920
You know or someone you're working with to deploy a server go to Linode comm slash SSH

128
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,080
It's what I use for anything that I deploy in the cloud for like the last two and a half years and it's so much

129
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,400
Nicer than those hyperscalers that just want to lock into their crazy complicated platforms

130
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:07,260
You know Linode started in 2003 and they've just been moving it forward iterating on making it better and better and now

131
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
It's like nearly 19 years later

132
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,320
That's wild Linode is old enough to vote. That's crazy

133
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,440
And they've really just iterated on and making something super great and that's why they're willing to give you $100

134
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
$100 is like a confidence statement

135
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,360
They're saying we trust that if we let you actually kick the tires with this thing

136
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,800
You're gonna like what you see and it's just such a great way to support the show, too

137
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,920
So it's Linode comm slash SSH go deploy something go try something go see why they are the absolute best

138
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,920
They make cloud computing simple affordable and accessible to all Linode comm slash

139
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
SSH

140
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,800
Now this is a mixture public service announcement slash app pick I think we've mentioned paperless on the show before

141
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,320
It's a document management system that helps you transform physical documents into a searchable online

142
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,740
Archive and I've used this to great effect for my wife actually when when we're traveling and stuff back to England

143
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,540
She does a lot of Skype and zoom music teaching lesson

144
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,060
she's a music teacher and

145
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:14,840
What we actually did was scanned all of her students music into paperless and then using the OCR that's in there

146
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,140
We can actually search for the specific bit of sheet music that we need when she's in England on my server back here

147
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,820
which is just

148
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,780
Super cool. So anyway for the longest time I've been using paperless dash ng

149
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,460
I think it stood for paperless next-gen not entirely sure to be honest

150
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,900
I like to think the next generation. Yeah, like make it so

151
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,900
You got it

152
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:47,140
A chap called Jonas Winkler actually took over the original paperless project, which itself had been abandoned now in the last few weeks

153
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,020
There's been a new project come along called paperless dash ng X

154
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,620
next generation X

155
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,180
something like that

156
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:04,300
And essentially what the community have done is the ng fork of the original code has seemed to go unmaintained

157
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,500
There's actually a github issue which we'll link to in the show notes

158
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,740
Where there's a bunch of people talking about how much value they get from the software

159
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,580
And also how much of a shame it is to see it kind of go to waste

160
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,800
But obviously open source being open source, you know

161
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,020
This discussion thread went on for you know, the best part of two three weeks

162
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:28,580
Before eventually the community just went okay this Jonas guy. He seems to have fallen off the the radar for now for whatever reason

163
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,340
So we're just gonna fork this thing and call it ng X. Yeah, I sure hope he's okay

164
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,340
You know, I hope it's just a case of burnout

165
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,620
and it is good to see something like this you wouldn't this wouldn't happen with a

166
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,200
Commercial service right when a cloud company is shutting down for whatever reason

167
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,420
The products just kind of gone

168
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,780
but when you have something that you can self host that's open source software

169
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
there can be a

170
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:01,700
Escape hatch when the project kind of starts to fade now this first version doesn't seem like it's introduced a ton of new stuff

171
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,100
They drop support for Python 3 7 so they're kind of moving that forward

172
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,900
They've updated a ton of the docs and the scripts and the containers and the branding

173
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,060
They also had to drop support for ansible playbooks, which is definitely a bummer to see that

174
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:21,700
But they are hoping maybe somebody would want to help them support that it seems like maybe it's just an issue of things getting out

175
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,340
Of date and the dev team not really having the skill set to manage it

176
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,580
So long as they continue to support Docker, you know, they're all they've got my vote

177
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,780
What's interesting though is if if we look through the the issues on their github, there is one

178
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,340
specifically talking around moving the organization in github forward and

179
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,660
You know, so that right now is probably a really good time to get involved in the project

180
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:52,580
If you're looking to do any kind of open source contributions, you know clearly they're looking to improve the the project

181
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,100
There is an issue in here

182
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:02,520
1632 which again will be linked in the show notes where they're talking about how you can make your membership official of the project

183
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,780
It's 100% a community project and they will gladly welcome

184
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,700
contributions from anybody member or not

185
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,460
But you know if you're a member of of it

186
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,560
You can start to have a bit more say over where the direction of the project goes and that kind of thing

187
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:23,580
Interesting. Yeah, I wish them the best right? This is one of those projects that I think is

188
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,460
Probably not mentioned enough

189
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,580
If you look into it, it's such a no-brainer

190
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,540
I'm I'm implementing this in the future probably at the end of summer

191
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:41,900
I'm gonna I'm definitely putting this into action and it's amazing there. There's just no way I'm gonna do another year without this system

192
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:49,020
So paperless ngx go check it out. I'm gonna my plan is to have something set up by the end of summer. So that way I

193
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,220
Know me a big talker right now, but that way at the start of 2023

194
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,340
I could just just use paperless from the beginning of the year. We'll see

195
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,660
I'll tell you where it's really useful is tax season

196
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:07,180
You know, you get all these 1099s and w2 forms all this kind of crap coming in, you know from yeah all over the place

197
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,180
you just take a picture on your smartphone with one of the scan apps and

198
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:20,460
It then you can share it from there with paperless, you know, like through the share sheet on iOS or a similar thing on Android

199
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,140
that will basically then upload the file into paperless and then it does its

200
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:30,300
Optical character recognition OCR on those files and from there

201
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,460
All you need to do when it comes to tax time is search

202
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,860
1099 or tax or whatever it is and you'll just find all the forms boom boom boom boom

203
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,300
Even cooler than that though is you can set up a bunch of ingestion rules

204
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,600
So what we did for the sheet music for example

205
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:53,360
Was we look for certain keywords like bassoon or piano or that kind of thing and add certain tags to each file

206
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,080
So in our case we added sheet music as a tag or any time I get an email from Google with my Google

207
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:07,520
Fi bill in it. I have that send the email automatically forward it to an address that will put it into a specific folder and

208
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,120
Paperless will scan that folder ingest the file

209
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,480
Automatically tag it and so when I come to expense my cell phone bill through work

210
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,560
All I need to do is I don't need to log into Google Fi and then spectrum and in all these different

211
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,800
Systems, I log into paperless search for my little keyword to bring up my personal

212
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,680
Internet bills boom just download the PDF done. That's so

213
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:39,480
Great. I love it. I really really love it. I've been struggling with that very thing today

214
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
That's what I was working on earlier today

215
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,440
It's just been one bad news after another including the one that I probably heard from

216
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:55,040
The most from the audience since our last episode and that is that the matter group has announced a delay

217
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,600
For the matter standard. Yes, that is the one announced in

218
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,920
2019 by Amazon Apple Google and Samsung

219
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,560
The idea is to take ZigBee and make something they could all use together that has a few base

220
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,840
things that could all agree on and of course Alex the industry is trying to

221
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:20,400
Spin this like the Nanoleaf CEO said quote. I think the three-month delay might actually be a good thing

222
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,720
I feel that now that there's more certainty across the industry. We'll see unity at the time of launch

223
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,280
Yeah, it's a good thing because we can't get enough chips right now

224
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,580
So we'll just push it out and then sell the same amount anyway

225
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,200
Right. Sure. Yeah, I mean it's his job to say it's a good thing, right? I gotta say I'm not too surprised

226
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,240
Um, it really is funny though. Cuz like anybody who like doubts matter. It's like they they took this newsman

227
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,760
They just they were on with it. They like they they sent me the link, you know

228
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,140
And you know, I agree my confidence is slipping

229
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:01,860
But it just it's so obviously needed that I I hope I hope I hope that this delay

230
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,860
Doesn't throw this whole thing off

231
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,840
track, but it has sent me into a bit of a

232
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,320
Death spiral with my whole home set up now Alex. It's just a disaster

233
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Well, I blame you

234
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,240
I mean we had that feedback a couple of episodes ago saying

235
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,400
should I wait for matter or should I get into Z wave or Zigbee or whatever right now and

236
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,320
If I recall the advice was if you need something now buy it now and I think that advice has just been proven

237
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,040
Right, you know if you need a new smart home widget today

238
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,320
buy

239
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,120
What's on the market today and hope for the best?

240
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:44,240
Yeah, and for me for me it it sends me into this whole spiral of okay. Now I've got a problem

241
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,960
Because I've got a network of you know

242
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
30 Z wave devices and

243
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:58,840
They are integrated throughout the automations and you know everything from temperature display widgets to

244
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:04,920
Scripts and automations. I have a Z wave device in there. And so the migration to Z wave JS

245
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Which I've tried in the past for me

246
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,560
Went horribly bad. Nothing worked

247
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,880
I essentially had to just retouch everything in home assistant

248
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,840
And you know one of those things where you load your dashboard and like everything's aired out and not working, right?

249
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was my situation

250
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,000
And so my thought was screw it. I'm not gonna migrate to Z wave JS

251
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,960
I'm gonna hold out and just move over to matter and I'll just

252
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,040
Low-key replace the devices over a year and call it good and

253
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,240
That plan came crashing down a couple of months ago when I discovered or a month ago when I discovered that the next release the

254
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,480
One that comes out in really probably a few days from the release of this episode

255
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:50,440
Will totally disable the Z wave integration that I'm using so I'm kind of stuck in time

256
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,040
With home assistant and now that matter is delayed. It's like a whole nother complicating factor and

257
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,720
I've realized that if I'm going to do this Z wave JS migration

258
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,560
That it's gonna end up being so much work

259
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:11,000
That I might as well take this opportunity to just redo everything, you know, have you reached that point?

260
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,920
We're like, yeah, okay

261
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,280
This one this one job is essentially so much work that just nuke and paving the entire infrastructure

262
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,040
Is only a minor part of the overall work. I

263
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,480
Feel that way every time I think about implementing a VLAN set up in my house like at the moment

264
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,600
I just run a flat network and I think I would be cool if my cameras are on their own VLAN and then all my

265
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
IOT stuff was on its own but you think

266
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,880
I'm gonna have to touch every device here and I just can't be bothered

267
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,720
Let's just stick it in a slash 16 and forget about it

268
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,600
Tailscale comm slash self-hosted go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices

269
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,000
And of course you support the show and you can sign up for tail scale tail scale comm slash self-hosted

270
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,360
It is the zero config VPN it installs on any device in minutes. You can manage firewall rules

271
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,840
You can work from anywhere. I have really taken things to the next level

272
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,680
I have recently started adding a couple of my VMs to my tail scale

273
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,920
Network now stick with me here for a second now, I can SSH into the VMs

274
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,120
I have running on my machines here in the studio where I'm working on projects from home. It's so

275
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,200
Great. It is so great. Also, I can confirm that it is

276
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,720
Stupid simple to set up tail scale on Nix OS more details on that in a moment

277
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,160
And what I love about tail scale is it supports two-factor authentication

278
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,280
You're single sign-on and underneath all of it. They're using the stuff that just makes WireGuard

279
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,920
So great the noise protocol and they do a mesh network. So that way it's one flat network between all your machines

280
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,560
It's so simple to get started as well

281
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:53,440
And they really have installers for like every distro even ARM Linux distros all that kind of stuff

282
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,960
You'd be amazed how fast you can build out a WireGuard network

283
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,520
That's mesh peer-to-peer in just a few minutes

284
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,960
I love it. And you know after you get everything signed up. They all have their own IP

285
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,160
And so I've started setting bookmarks. I have a I have a tail scale folder in my bookmark bar and

286
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,040
All of the different web services that I hit that I have a tail scale IP for now

287
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,640
So from and I of course that syncs across all my Chrome instances

288
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,720
So from every machine I can get access to those web apps and it doesn't matter what your machine is

289
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,440
Every machine I can get access to those web apps. It doesn't matter what it could be Dylan at home

290
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,040
It could be something at the studio. It could be something in the RV. It could be something up on Linode

291
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
It's just super powerful

292
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,840
So go try it for yourself support the show and use it up to 20 machines for absolutely free by going to tailscale.com

293
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,840
slash

294
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
self-hosted

295
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:55,600
In the dock, I see a very tantalizing little sentence that says I have a new direction for dupes the no

296
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,040
Container theory. I cannot wait to hear your logic on this

297
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,320
I want more control with this next go-around and I'm looking at what my options are

298
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,080
With any kind of setup that I might redo and maybe to kind of help you understand. I should recap what I have now

299
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,640
So right now I have a couple of Raspberry Pi 4s that are running Ubuntu 20

300
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,280
04 right the previous LTS and

301
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,240
Back when I set that up Alex you could still get

302
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,480
a setup script for home assistant where you could install supervised home assistant

303
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,080
On vanilla Ubuntu, which I don't think they actually support anymore

304
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,320
But in my world

305
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,320
This is the ideal setup because I have home assistant running in containers

306
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,280
But a fully supervised setup so I have access to the add-ons. I can get the hack store

307
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,640
All that kind of stuff. I get the backup manager snapshots, etc, etc

308
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
But it's on an OS that I manage

309
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,320
That I update because that's how I prefer to do things

310
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,360
That is no longer a viable option and even now it's kind of

311
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,360
fiddly

312
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,560
Home assistant will often say that I am in an unhealthy state and so it won't let me update add-ons or update the system

313
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,360
And I have to reboot and then it's all of a sudden in a healthy state again

314
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,840
And then I can go about updating things

315
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:20,400
So it's it's already not perfect and I don't want to go the direction of where I was trending

316
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,440
Which is an x86 machine that would be more powerful

317
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,880
Ideally like a laptop that supports quicksync

318
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
And then I would put proxmox on that

319
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,620
And I would run home assistant in its own dedicated virtual machine as just an appliance

320
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:41,220
And I would just swallow the fact that I am running their OS and I don't really want to do that

321
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,300
But you know what?

322
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,300
It's fine. I told myself

323
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:52,680
But as the asahi linux team started getting linux on the m1 closer to a reality and I started realizing

324
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,580
that a headless mac mini m1

325
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,420
running

326
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,980
Linux could be a viable home server

327
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,940
And maybe I don't want to go this proxmox route. Maybe I want to go a

328
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,480
Linux host that is running these applications

329
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,980
But then I started thinking

330
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,300
What are my two main problems that I would like to solve with this next round?

331
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,380
Like if I besides performance because that's a given

332
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,060
If I were rebuilding my entire home setup and you got to think about this yourself probably sometimes

333
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,900
What would be the next step

334
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,700
And I realized I would love to solve

335
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
reproducibility

336
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,380
Because a year or two into this I don't

337
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,740
Really remember how I have it set up. I have it set up

338
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,620
In a way that it's pretty obvious to figure out

339
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,940
And I do have some documentation, although I haven't touched it in about a year

340
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:54,100
So I don't really have like a game plan to like rebuild this thing should a rabbit

341
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,940
So I don't really have like a game plan to like rebuild this thing should a raspberry pi crap out

342
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
I mean I could probably do it in a couple of days

343
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,820
Then the home assistant stuff would take longer

344
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,060
But you know, it's not ideal

345
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,580
And I started thinking about what I could do to solve this problem

346
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,580
And I started thinking about your favorite ansible, of course

347
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,340
Perhaps like, you know, this was an opportunity and my moment in time to learn ansible

348
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,980
I'm sure you think that's probably a great idea

349
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,980
Well, you're not going to hear anything

350
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,620
Bad about some kind of config management from me. No, no, I think ansible is a

351
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,940
laudable goal

352
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:37,620
So instead I did a hard right and turned from that and and went down the path of nix

353
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:45,380
And the reason why I got to nix is I wanted god damn it. I wanted I know i'm sorry. I know it's so close

354
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
I wanted something that was

355
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
reproducible from the metal

356
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,800
So I could essentially just recreate the same exact setup by just dropping in some config files

357
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
And building the system

358
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
And that's what nix provides

359
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,000
and then as I start to

360
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,280
Use nix and nix os and I tried nix os versus just putting nix on top of a distro

361
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
and really it's just a

362
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,520
it's kind of like

363
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,800
It's a matter of how far do you want to be able to control the system, right?

364
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:23,280
Are you good with setting up a base distro and keeping its package manager going and then putting nix on there and then rebuilding everything?

365
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,760
Or would you like to build everything from the ground up?

366
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,480
user accounts groups permissions

367
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:35,360
Everything reproduce everything and that's the route I want to go and that's why I went more than just nix the package manager

368
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
I went to nix os

369
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,160
and the nix os way of doing things is extremely compelling because you can

370
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,040
with very simple syntax you can say I want containers and then

371
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,560
You build the system and you can test it before you deploy it and it's reproducible

372
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,720
And it's so great, but you build the system and if you tell it I want containers

373
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,480
It it the nix system figures it all out man

374
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,640
It figures out the software dependencies the services that need to be installed you can make declarations in there for firewall stuff

375
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
It's a lot like dr. Compose

376
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,160
But for your entire os it's honestly how linux should be

377
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,440
For a lot for basically every use except for the desktop

378
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:25,360
This is how linux should work for every container for every server for every iot device out there for any system out there

379
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,240
I'm telling you this as somebody who's used linux for probably almost 25 years

380
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,120
This is how linux should have worked forever. Now. Nix has actually been around for a little while

381
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,560
I'm, just finally getting around to try it

382
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:41,280
And so what I have discovered alex while using nix is if you can use the nix package manager to install stuff and manage stuff

383
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,720
You've essentially documented your entire system with the config file and made it reproducible

384
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,200
so anytime you could like deploy home assistant through the config file or

385
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,720
A sync thing or plex or you know, whatever

386
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,680
You can essentially run a command on another box and rebuild and recreate that entire system to the exactly how you had it

387
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
And you can do that in a rolling way

388
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,320
So what happens when something isn't in the nix way that nix ethos

389
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:17,200
Yeah, like an example of this actually is paperless ngx. Like I don't think that's been packaged up yet, right?

390
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,640
You can totally do containers and nix like totally is great for that

391
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,000
It's great as a container base and it is great as a container host

392
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,440
And uh, you can do podman and docker on the same system at the same time. Like it's really powerful

393
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,640
And um, I think a lot of listeners that are hearing me right now are probably thinking no chris

394
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Just run the container on nix os. It's so much easier

395
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
And that may actually ultimately be the way I go

396
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,040
I may still end up running a few things in containers, but what I have realized is

397
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,840
the benefit

398
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,960
of the way nix manages everything is that I can come back to a system

399
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
five years later

400
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
And not only will it be fully up to date

401
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:07,520
But if it just has any problems a super easy to roll back and be super easy to reproduce

402
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,600
Just like done. How often do you do that though five years as your example?

403
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,960
Often I mean usually I don't use hardware past that right? So i'm touching on i'm rebuilding nix

404
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,560
stuff every few years usually I mean speaking about myself. I prefer to

405
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,000
Change stuff every couple of years

406
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,360
So the chances of me sticking with the same system for five whole years is is quite slim

407
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,480
Have you have you ever had like an arch desktop that you install and then like three years later?

408
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,760
You realize it's the same install and you've just been reliably updating it

409
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,720
My arch desktop actually is the one that I installed in london and it travels to the US

410
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,640
It's the one that I installed in london and it traveled across the ocean in a container, you know

411
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,720
I love it, right?

412
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,960
And when you think about how like some desktop linux users, especially mint users

413
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,720
They they actually like reinstall every major for every major version. I know they have it's crazy, right?

414
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,320
Nix is that for everything to the next level and I can pin versions if I need to I can roll back

415
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,480
It's the kind of distro

416
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
that you can install it and and

417
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,960
And you can actually reliably let it auto update because it's so simple to recover

418
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,000
It's very compelling and I'm I'm still kind of new to it

419
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,720
So I'm struggling to really put all of it into words

420
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,400
But it's got me excited in a way about deploying software on linux

421
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,800
That essentially docker compose did for containers and I I really don't have a major problem with these

422
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,520
With running these applications in containers, but if I'm being totally honest

423
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
I do feel kind of weird about

424
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
pulling down like

425
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,840
Essentially an entire software os environment to run sync thing when it's just like, you know

426
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Some binaries and some config files

427
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,480
And I don't really need to run all of that in a container. I don't need to manage the network

428
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,820
I don't need to have like these virtual network interfaces

429
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,840
I don't need any of that. I don't need to like mount storage volumes or any of that

430
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,280
I don't really need it

431
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,160
If I can still get all of the manageability benefits that I got with the software as a container, you know

432
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,800
Being able to pull down specific versions being able to stay current being able to roll back

433
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,800
Being able to isolate data and application stuff like I get all of that with nix without actually having to have in a container

434
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,440
That's compelling to me and it also means that I could probably really eek a lot of performance out of an m1

435
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,960
And the great thing is is there's already people working to get nix os running on the m1 mini

436
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,760
That's running on the m1 mini. So like by the time i'm ready to do this the work's going to be done

437
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,040
Can I play devil's advocate now? Are you done?

438
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,760
soakbox, uh

439
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
So so in summary

440
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Boo containers. No. Yeah, go ahead

441
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,720
Why

442
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
learn a

443
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,320
Slightly unusual bespoke

444
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,880
Soak deployment configuration system, which is what nix appears to use just from a quick glance. I'll be honest

445
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm, not super familiar with it

446
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,200
Uh, and I really you know, I have I have no real opinions

447
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:13,040
Let me preface everything i'm about to say with no real opinions about nix os at all. I haven't looked at it super closely

448
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,520
but

449
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,580
Devil's advocate time if I am learning ansible

450
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,760
And I want to run it against ubuntu or centos or arch

451
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,680
or mac os or any other system that ansible supports

452
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,600
I've learned a skill that's transferable not only between multiple different operating systems

453
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,080
but also different

454
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,360
Jobs and ansible has been hugely powerful for my career

455
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,760
You know as a springboard where I could start operating at a level that was much higher

456
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,760
Than actually if i'd just been doing everything like a caveman on on the command line

457
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,840
Right simply because people smarter than me had abstracted away a lot of the complexity

458
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,480
And so I look at nix os and I I see their configuration language looks

459
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,880
Pretty easy to understand. It's you know, it's just a standard sort of json type looking configuration thing, right?

460
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,200
And some of the things you said right you you wanted reproducibility

461
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,960
okay, so nix os is clearly that because of the whole ethos of the project, but

462
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,600
Let's say you wanted in five years time to redeploy a specific version of sync thing for whatever reason it might be

463
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,000
You could do that with a container on ansible. You could go through your git commit history

464
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,280
Look up what tag you are running five years ago

465
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,040
Pull that down from docker hub assuming it's still there

466
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
But the same is true of nix os, right?

467
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,600
And then deploy that container and you've got everything as it was on that day in history five years ago

468
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,120
And it's all in git. So it's all version controlled and it's all reproducible

469
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,120
I wouldn't be surprised if the more common way of using nix isn't

470
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,760
Ansible deploying like a centos or a rail system or an open to system with the nix package manager installed

471
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,440
uh, because I think the other thing you I don't know if you mentioned it necessarily in there, but

472
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,640
Learning ansible would also be a much more employable skill

473
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,080
You know if you're ever looking for a job, it looks good on the resume

474
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,680
It looks good on the resume. Um, so I actually don't think it precludes me from wanting to learn ansible because I think that's still

475
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,040
Time that would be well spent. Yeah, I do

476
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,520
what I have kind of felt about using nix is um, okay, this is going to be kind of a controversial statement, but

477
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,960
Uh, this is the future of linux and this a lot of what they're solving. It just should be done at the os

478
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:39,680
anyways, and it doesn't necessarily mean you don't still also need something like ansible maybe for some small scale things, you know,

479
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,480
You're if you have a few boxes maybe with something like nix you could get away without something centralized

480
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,160
But if you have any kind of scale, you're you're obviously going to need tools to manage that

481
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,800
But I I honestly think when I use nix I look at what rail is doing and I don't know how they're going to get there

482
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
But they're ultimately going to end up here

483
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,160
And same with what canonical needs to do with ubuntu

484
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,640
uh, and it's so in some ways I like using it because it's just

485
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,080
I I think it's how i'm going to use linux now for the future

486
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,480
When i'm not deploying a desktop system and i'm not even convinced

487
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,480
It may actually ultimately end up using it for a desktop system as well

488
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,360
Especially like a system here in the studio. That's pretty static

489
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:29,360
I think the counterpoint to that is what redhat for example. I know it well are doing with the uh, redhat core os

490
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,800
Core os operating system at the minute fedora core os if you want to try out the uh, the upstream version

491
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,340
Everything is configured

492
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:42,960
Declaratively up front, right? So you say I want this nick to have this ip address, right?

493
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,200
I want these storage disks to be configured to this mount point that kind of thing

494
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,280
Uh, that's all done through an ignition config file. You supply that to the vm or to the

495
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,440
The machine when it boots up and it then configures itself based on that

496
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,220
instantiation kind of request

497
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,040
And it seems to me like nix is operating in a similar space where the the operating system is almost like read only

498
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,960
And everything is kind of given to it. It's like this blank canvas

499
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,320
Onto which everything gets painted straight away

500
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,800
Nix os itself managed to make base arch feel bloated. It's really nothing. There's not a lot going on there

501
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,000
So what happens when you need to do a rollback, uh, for example with my home assistant vm

502
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Uh running on top of proxmox

503
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
If an upgrade goes sideways

504
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,920
all I do is roll back a specific snapshot which on the zfs backend storage that uh proxmox uses is

505
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,600
Simple what's uh, how does that work in nix? Do you know yet?

506
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,840
See you probably wouldn't quite go through the same scenario

507
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:56,320
So what i've what i've run into so far is uh, there's two ways you can you can yolo it and just build and deploy

508
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
But you can also do like a build

509
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:04,320
Dash dash test and that does everything and it'll uh, you know, that's where it'll fail out

510
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,800
So they have this sort of switch command that you add. So once you verify that everything's saying the config works and

511
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,680
Like like what software building when it fails to build it'll give you errors and it'll tell you where in the config file

512
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,680
There might be a problem and stuff like that

513
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:24,560
Um, and then once you've resolved all that you do the switch command and it actually then deploys that as your production system

514
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,800
Um, but by the time you've deployed it, you already know everything works. So there's no, uh, you can roll back but there's

515
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:37,440
It doesn't really you don't really need to because you just don't it doesn't it doesn't actually switch over unless it actually successfully

516
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
Everything works

517
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,440
I mean, that's interesting. Uh, obviously there's a paradigm shift there that I

518
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,920
I and you and we perhaps as a as a show need to go through and kind of figure out

519
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,120
What the future looks like if nix is is the way to go because you're certainly you're certainly peaking my interest as we talk about

520
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,400
I think it is kind of for me. It's a discovery thing, too

521
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,600
Um, i'm thinking about making a nix chat room on the matrix server because I think we have some nix nerds

522
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,960
In the audience, uh, just to kind of wrap this up, uh, alex

523
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,600
What I was thinking is uh with using nix, I would keep things under very tight control

524
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,920
And then I think I kind of want to and maybe you could tell me if i'm on the right track here

525
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,040
I think maybe I might stick with home assistant core. So it's going to be a pretty minimal home assistant

526
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,920
I'm going to get like the minimum viable home assistant rebuilt

527
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:33,600
And I I wonder if I shouldn't and maybe you could talk me off this ledge consider going with node red

528
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:40,720
For my automation. So i'm doing all my automations in something separate something else outside of home assistant again kind of

529
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Building these data silos

530
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,360
Um, and i'm also thinking and I don't know how I would even manage to pull all this off at this point

531
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,600
But this is really the time to transition everything to mqtt like anything I can get over mqtt do it including

532
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,480
Like z-wave js to mqtt and all of it

533
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,920
So do you think i'm on the right track is node red too far?

534
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,760
Or is it just like I don't know i'm just if i'm going to redo all this again

535
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,320
I don't really want to have to do it a second time

536
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:14,720
node red is brilliant for extremely complex automations where there are lots of uh,

537
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,800
tre

538
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:24,000
If this then that and if this condition is true, then do that, you know, all that kind of really complicated almost like programming logic

539
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,640
Um where it's I think complete overkill is just a simple turn light on at 6 a.m.

540
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,520
Type thing turn heater on at 6 a.m. Whatever it is. Sure. Sure. Yeah, um, and I

541
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,920
I tend to have in my mind as soon as I go beyond like three or four or five kind of steps in an automation

542
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,960
I find the uh home assistant yaml based or the interface based automation is quite cumbersome and that's when I reach for node red

543
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,360
I could see like 80 of our automations wouldn't need to do that

544
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,320
I could see like 80 of our automations wouldn't need that

545
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,040
but there is a niche there like

546
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,120
If so-and-so hasn't been home for so long and so-and-so is this far from here then turn these things off

547
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,680
and then additionally

548
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I hope at some point i'm gonna have

549
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:14,960
Over mqtt all of my power information from the victron system feeding in and then I would be also looking at solar input

550
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,600
And battery charge level and possibly doing automations based on that as well

551
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,780
Mqtt is just so lightweight and

552
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,060
It's all you it does all you need it to do in a really small

553
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:30,580
Little lightweight package. So I got an idea. So here's what we're going to do is you and west come out

554
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,220
We'll fly you out for episode 70

555
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,780
And we'll do a bro build at the rv

556
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,100
We'll rebuild everything over the weekend. We'll record it for the show

557
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,300
You know, we'll go do some fancy driving

558
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,700
We'll make a whole thing out of it because I just don't know if I want to take all this on like we got to

559
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,900
Get linux. We got to get nixos going on in m1. I got to

560
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:56,900
Get everything rebuilt. You got to get all the individual docker services restored got to migrate data

561
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,740
And we got to get everything using mqtt got to get no red going

562
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:09,060
Just talk about my daily rate, huh? Yeah, I mean, you know, you know, maybe I could pay it in like sandwiches delicious burgers

563
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:14,020
Oh, i'll tell you what is good in the pacific northwest. There's a little asian place just across the road from the studio

564
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:19,460
Which yeah, I love that place is good. That's when noah comes in to visit

565
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,100
That's the first place he and I go and if we don't have time

566
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,140
And but I know he's coming i'll order ahead for him

567
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,540
So I remember this is a very old linux action show where he was waxing lyrical

568
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,500
I think about panda express and you're like dude. It's a chain

569
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,980
He does love his chinese food though. I don't know we just think about it

570
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,460
We gotta do something for episode 70 and i'm just saying you come out here. I mean, you know, jb will put you up

571
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,020
Yeah, it's not long is it? It's probably what sort of may june sort of time. Yeah, maybe we'll see

572
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,180
Watch this space

573
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,180
We need to issue a correction on the show

574
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:56,020
Samuel g writes in about the argon aeon four bay raspberry pi nas case that we covered last episode

575
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,900
Hi guys, I love the show. I think you might have read the argon aeon announcement wrong

576
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,100
You referred to the base model as seven hundred dollars, but I think that's actually an hk money

577
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:12,580
Uh in u.s. Dollars, it's only about 120 which is a pretty good price if you if you look at it

578
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:18,020
So yes, thank you for writing in and letting us know that uh, we we can't do currency conversions

579
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:24,100
No, you know what? It was my bad because I grabbed it and I put it in the dock, but I didn't note the currency

580
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,980
And so I just assumed it was us because it was like, you know had been a couple hours because i'm a dummy

581
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,540
Also samuel sent that in as a boost

582
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,340
With a value for value podcast app

583
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:40,820
Uh, that's pretty cool very and um gene sent. Oh, I meant to bring it in the studio with me alex, but gene

584
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:47,140
Uh gene heard about the temperature issues. We've been having in the studio garage server room

585
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:54,180
Over the summer and he built a wi-fi sensor for me to put in there. That is so cool

586
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,180
I meant to bring it down here for you

587
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,900
Uh, so that way you could look at his handy work. So i'll i'll show it to you, uh after the show

588
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,980
But of course it's using esp home. So it should be uh, no problem to get it working

589
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,300
Uh with home assistant here in the studio and we'll be able to monitor the temperature out there

590
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,740
Which i'm going to get this installed once we have the rack in its final position

591
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:19,940
So thank you gene for setting that in he sent that in a bit ago and um, the plan is to deploy that soon

592
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:26,420
Yeah, I mean if I come out there we should do that and deploy. Oh, yeah deploy a fleet of sensors. Not just one

593
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:33,060
Oh, man, if you actually came out here. Yeah, it would be we'd have a lot with this probably like a dozen things we could do

594
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,580
Um bearded tech sent in something so

595
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:42,660
Rad and I say rad ironically awesome. I got I got feedback that I should stop saying rad. No

596
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,340
No, I will not

597
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,740
Uh, anyways bearded tech has written this piece of software called fever

598
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,940
And you got to look at this alex. Go look at uh, go look at his github page there. It's a uh,

599
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,660
Frigate event video recorder. Have you seen this?

600
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,700
Yeah, I only because you put it in the dock and it looks awesome. I am going to be uh,

601
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:09,060
Adding this to my frigate arsenal pretty soon. Yeah, so it lets you store video independently of frigate

602
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:15,460
But it also has some home assistant integrations for notifications. Um, you can get frames in home assistant

603
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:19,380
It makes browsing it really easy. He's been working on mobile support. So if you got

604
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,060
One of them internet phones like alex does you can still look at it. Yeah

605
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,720
You can look at your vidjas in the uh web viewer

606
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:33,140
Like an internet phone is a special thing these days I gotta give you gotta give you crap I guess I don't know

607
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:41,380
You know have you seen the prices of the coral like the little ai kind of usb sticks that work really well crazy

608
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,700
Yeah, so I paid I think like
