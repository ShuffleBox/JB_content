00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Coming up on today's show, I give you my thoughts on the new Helios 64 Ultimate Arm Powered NAS.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,640
And Chris has a huge sack full of your feedback.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay, I'm Chris and this is Self Hosted 33.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,520
After last week's episode, everyone got the impression that both you and I

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,960
were iOS users exclusively, but that's not actually the case.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,840
I am a whore to different OSes, Chris.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,280
I use Linux, Mac OS, Windows, Android, iOS on a daily basis.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,400
So I think I don't think I fall into that camp of being pigeonholed as an iOS user.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,560
I'm trying not to be offended, but it's hard.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,640
Well, you know what it was is because we were talking about audiobooks

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,560
and we didn't mention any audio players for Android.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,080
We only mentioned them for iOS.

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,760
That was just that was my bad.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,720
I'll tell you why that is.

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,800
It's just simply because booksonics been so reliable for my wife that

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,400
I didn't feel the need to try anything else.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,360
But there's some really good options that some listeners have sent in.

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,960
Yeah, we'll link to those in the show notes for the for the Android

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,000
ones that got at least a couple of mentioned via the email.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,800
I also have an Android and iPhone, but I do.

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I do mostly mostly use the iPhone, but I do love my pixel three.

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,080
It is time for an upgrade.

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
I'm just not in a particular rush, but I am in a rush to tell you about a cloud guru.

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,240
This episode is brought to you by the all new cloud guru.

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,600
The leader in learning for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,160
They have hundreds of courses and thousands of hands on labs.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,240
So get certified, get hired and get learning.

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,080
Go to a cloud guru dot com.

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,000
I feel like our roles have reversed this episode.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,360
This Helio 64 hardware you're about to tell me about seems like something I would have bought.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
And it like would have been the natural upgrade from a Raspberry Pi

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,280
four days to something a little more hardcore.

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,840
So I'm extremely interested to know what your experience has been like with the with the Helio 64.

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,480
And is it.

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,960
Cobal, is that how you say the company?

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,160
Cobal, I guess.

37
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,200
Yeah, like the element.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Yeah, this this thing builds itself as the ultimate arm powered NAS.

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,520
And Cobal is the name of the company behind it.

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,160
You can find them at cobalt dot IO and they have a couple of products.

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,160
But the one that I picked up was the Helios 64.

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,880
Now this thing purports to be, as it says, the ultimate arm powered NAS.

43
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,560
It has five hotswap SATA 3 bays.

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,600
It has an M2 SATA port.

45
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,320
It supports hot plug for those drives.

46
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:40,000
It's got two gigabit Ethernet ports, one of which is two point five gigabit USB-C.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120
It's got a micro SD card slot, a couple of USB ports,

48
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,760
and it's no bigger than, you know, your average Synology type box.

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
OK, so it's about Synology size.

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,160
I was just going to ask you that.

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,520
It also has eMMC for storage.

52
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,680
And then I understand it's a hexacore processor,

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,720
but I don't really know what that actually means in terms of real world performance.

54
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,880
Yeah, so I'll come on to all that later.

55
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,920
But six core system on a chip arm.

56
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,480
Wow.

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,960
System four gigs of RAM.

58
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,680
The eMMC is 16 gigabytes.

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,880
You know, Alex, if this thing performs half as good as the specs sound,

60
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,240
I'm going to be pretty impressed.

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,800
We'll get there.

62
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,800
One feature I thought was just unbelievably cool and just shows the power efficiency of arm

63
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,760
is this thing has a built in UPS.

64
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,560
It's got a pair of 18650 cell batteries in there.

65
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,400
You don't know how cool this is.

66
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,800
You just you have a NAS on your desk.

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,320
You unplug it from the wall and the thing just stays running for 15 minutes.

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,080
You pick it up and walk around the house with it.

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,160
I mean, that is that is great.

70
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,760
I mean, I'm not going to do that because I need a network cable and stuff.

71
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,160
But in terms of money, I mean, you look at how much you could spend on just a UPS.

72
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,160
That's easily a hundred or two for a decent one, you know, and to have that built into this unit

73
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,080
for the ticket price of $295, which didn't include shipping.

74
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,680
I think I paid about $330 for it to be shipped overall.

75
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,880
The proposition is great.

76
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,200
It also has a direct attached storage mode as well as a USB type C display mode.

77
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,440
So in the promo materials, at least, they show it hooked up to your TV running Kodi,

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,920
which I thought was a really interesting use case.

79
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,040
That could be nice if, you know, the budget only allows for one machine.

80
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, absolutely.

81
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,080
Now, I'll come on to my impressions in a second.

82
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,880
But first of all, I wanted to let the audience know that this thing is it's a little DIY.

83
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,160
So when it when it arrived, it was a kit.

84
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,960
It was a box with baggies full of screws and drive trays and stuff.

85
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,720
It's not fully assembled and the assembly took me about two hours or so.

86
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,920
And that's on top of about a three month lead time for ordering it.

87
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,920
So I'd waited, I think I ordered at the end of August and when I ordered,

88
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,720
it told me it was going to be delivered in September.

89
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160
September came and went and I looked on the website and it's silently updated.

90
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,400
To October, October came and went and silently updated to shipping soon.

91
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
And then it went on the slow boat from China.

92
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,440
So it took literally like felt like forever, you know, left China.

93
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,960
And you don't hear from it again for weeks.

94
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,240
And then suddenly this box shows up at my door and I'm like, oh, yeah, I ordered this thing ages ago.

95
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,520
Yep.

96
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:27,920
Yep.

97
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,360
And if you go to the website right now, it doesn't say buy, it says preorder.

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,440
So it's like another batch is coming.

99
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,920
Yes.

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,000
I think they're sold out of the batch that I have here, which is, I think, the first one.

101
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,040
Now, what I will say is that the machined aluminum housing that it comes in is gorgeous.

102
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,320
The outside, the look of it, sat on a shelf.

103
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,280
This thing looks really premium.

104
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,040
I love how it looks.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,640
The downside to it, to them being a, an upstart in the kind of case manufacturing world is there's

106
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,840
a lot of rough edges and I mean, literally it drew blood in the odd place because there

107
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,320
are so many sharp edges to just to catch you.

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,400
It's like building a, a computer was 15 years ago before people like Fractal came along and

109
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,520
really stepped up the game.

110
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,120
So absolutely the outside looks great.

111
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,880
And you know, sat on a shelf, which is where it's going to spend 99% of its life.

112
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:29,040
It's, it's a huge thumbs up, but they have cut some corners in several very important

113
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:36,640
areas. If you look at the product picture on the website, the front IO panel has what

114
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,800
looks like a laser etched, you know, um, power button and reset button and, you know, HDD

115
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,560
number one through five with little leds for LAN and USB.

116
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,160
That looks like it's a laser etched led kind of front panel, right?

117
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,280
It's a sticker, isn't it?

118
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,080
It's a sticker.

119
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,560
Yep.

120
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,120
Yeah.

121
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,120
And it's on this flimsy little PCB that's held in with a couple of small screws and

122
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,000
if you push too hard, the entire thing, the sticker is stuck to kind of flexes and moves,

123
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,520
which makes this ultra premium, beautiful aluminum chassis feel like it should cost

124
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,880
a fraction of what it does.

125
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,640
So that's disappointing.

126
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,880
The same is also true of the rear IO panel.

127
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,240
There are stickers there that go over the, um, the panel there.

128
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,720
So in future revisions, I would love to see actual laser etching because I know that stuff

129
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,120
doesn't come for free, but I think that is going to make a huge difference to the overall

130
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,680
quality of the product, just the fit and finish.

131
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,760
If it bumped the price to another 50 bucks, would it be worth it too?

132
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,720
I'm not sure.

133
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,520
I mean, I'm going to come onto the price at the end, I think, um, once you've heard the

134
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,760
overall impression, you're just teasing it out.

135
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,160
I got you now.

136
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,960
Another thing, uh, that is a bit tricky is once you finally got it assembled, which as

137
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,200
I say was a bit fiddly and took about two hours, they do have fantastic documentation.

138
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,120
I just want to say that upfront wiki.cobol.io is built around MK docs, one of my favorite

139
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,480
self-hosted wiki solutions and the quality of the documentation and the open schematics

140
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,560
they have on there for all of the, you know, SATA controllers and the way that different

141
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,480
things connect to each other and stuff.

142
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,880
It's great, you know, um, and I'm, there's, there's a lot this company have done, right?

143
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,640
So I want to just preface everything I'm about to say by saying most of it is good, but there's

144
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,960
just a few other problems with it.

145
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,640
So let's go on to installing the operating system.

146
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,720
This isn't simple.

147
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,960
So you have to flash the OS to the eMMC via a USB-C cable, uh, which you do using, you

148
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,800
know, Balena Etcher or something like that.

149
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:50,800
That's not too difficult, really, but it could be easier.

150
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
It could be a USB key that you flash, which we're a lot more used to.

151
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,640
They are making use of the direct USB-C attachment to do that.

152
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,240
So once you've got the drivers installed into windows, which is what I was using, it's not

153
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,480
too bad, but I can just imagine trying to talk my family through it over the phone or

154
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,560
something as that's not going to work.

155
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,960
The next thing is that once you've put the OS onto the eMMC, you think to yourself, right,

156
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,160
I just press go and it's going to also configure and appear on the network.

157
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,120
Well, not quite.

158
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,480
You have to use something like PuTTY to connect to a serial console and do some initial

159
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,040
Ambient configuration before it will boot and get a network IP address.

160
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,120
Can you give me an idea of what kind of Ambient configuration you have to do there?

161
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,360
That's getting in the weeds pretty quick, it sounds like.

162
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,080
Yeah, if you've ever installed a Raspberry Pi one or something, you know, back in the

163
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,280
day, you know, a lot of these things had wizards that you followed.

164
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,440
I mean, it wasn't difficult to do.

165
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,680
It was just stuff like set host name, set a time zone, you know, what do you want your

166
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,280
boot order to be, that kind of stuff.

167
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,160
But it's an in-curses kind of walk you through it wizard style?

168
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,640
Correct.

169
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,120
Yeah.

170
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,920
And it's over a USB-C serial console.

171
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,640
So it looks straight out of the movie hackers or something.

172
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,280
You know, but once it's booted, it's very nice.

173
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,160
It's very quiet.

174
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,240
The fans that are in there are, I think, fairly cheap, Chineseium PWM fans.

175
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,400
So I replaced them with a pair of Noctua fans and noticed a reasonable drop, not a seismic

176
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,440
drop in noise, but definitely noticeable.

177
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,560
Now, the fans are controlled using a fan control program, which is linked to CPU temperature

178
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,040
right now.

179
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:43,600
So that unfortunately leads to the fans going quite a lot as you, you know, run a particularly

180
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,360
heavy, you know, while you're doing apps update, install, whatever, the fans will go bananas,

181
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,600
even though the CPU temperature is only at about 60 degrees and the hard drives, which

182
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,680
are the important thing in there, in my opinion.

183
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,840
Right.

184
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,760
Have moved not at all.

185
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,680
So one thing I would like to see them address moving forward is have that temperature control

186
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,440
or the speed control more accurately, I suppose, for the fans be linked to kind of overall

187
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,640
chassis ambient temperature or take an average of the hard drives and then divide it by five

188
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,720
or whatever and then do the fan curves based on that.

189
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,400
I think I found a forum thread that said they were going to do that, but I couldn't find

190
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,000
it researching for the episode again.

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,800
So the fan noise isn't too bad, but it's just really when they ramp up and down that you're

192
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,440
going to notice it.

193
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,520
Now, it has been on the entire time we're recording right next to us.

194
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,040
So it maybe it's maybe two feet from this microphone, which is a very sensitive one.

195
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,080
So it is quiet when you're not doing anything with it.

196
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,280
But I had a real problem trying to get ZFS working, which is you can imagine is

197
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:59,520
is a problem for me because my primary use case for this box was going to be a local

198
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,200
ZFS remote replication endpoint.

199
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,160
It's going to just sit in a in a closet quietly getting on with its life.

200
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,440
And it was just going to be a ZFS target.

201
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:20,240
But because it's running Ambien because it's an ARM CPU and not full on Ubuntu, the ZFS

202
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,880
modules aren't in the kernel, and then that leads you down the road of having to do DKMS

203
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,960
and worry about specific kernels.

204
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,440
And after about two or three hours last night, I just gave up on to throw my laptop at the

205
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,800
wall because, man, I hate DKMS.

206
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,480
Yeah, it's always that, oh, right moment when you're doing your updates and then you

207
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,320
realize, oh, I'm going to have to wait for this.

208
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,760
Oh, I hope it doesn't break.

209
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,280
I just couldn't get it working.

210
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,480
I mean, as well, I say that I had it working and then the kernel upgraded without me

211
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,040
noticing.

212
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,000
And then I just haven't been able to get it to work since.

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,240
So there's a pair of drives in there that are ZFS ready, but I just can't get the the

214
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,040
module to load.

215
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,400
So maybe I'll get it working over the next few weeks.

216
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,280
But but right now it's a pain in the ass, to be honest with you.

217
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,040
And that's a real shame because they actually bill and this was a learning for me.

218
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,600
I was speaking with Pope on Twitter over the weekend for those of you that don't know,

219
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,800
Pope works for Canonical, so he knows a thing or two about Ubuntu.

220
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,120
And he was schooling me on the fact that even though on the Kobol website it says it's

221
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,440
a focal fossa image, 2004 image, it's not Ubuntu, even though it says Ubuntu and has

222
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,440
the Ubuntu logo, Ambien is not Ubuntu.

223
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,960
So you live and learn.

224
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,440
You're telling me on their website they claim it's Ubuntu?

225
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,360
So if you go to wiki.kobol.io slash download and take a look at the images there, Chris,

226
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,640
and tell me what you think.

227
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,960
Is that misleading or is it just me being an idiot?

228
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,360
It is.

229
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,320
It's like they have they have Debian 10 Buster and Ubuntu 2004 listed is essentially what

230
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,040
is they have both.

231
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,960
It looks like it's hard to say, though.

232
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,080
It's hard to say when you click it.

233
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,640
I'd have to actually down.

234
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,040
You're right.

235
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,480
It is it is a little vague.

236
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,920
I'd have to download to actually to actually determine.

237
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,040
And so then if you scroll down that page a little further, you get a bunch of known

238
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,760
limitations regarding some of the hardware things.

239
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:22,400
So one of the issues that I ended up facing was I plugged my gigabit LAN switch into the

240
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,440
two point five gigabit ethernet port that's on the thing.

241
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,240
And I ended up getting horrible.

242
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,480
I'm talking like 10 or 15 megabyte out of a thousand.

243
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:32,800
Right.

244
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,920
So very, very slow performance.

245
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,520
And it turns out it requires a hardware fix.

246
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,480
I'm going to put a link to this in the show notes.

247
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,840
But if you're interested, go and take a look at what their proposed fixes.

248
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,200
It's to solder a wire on the back of the PCB.

249
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,040
Are you going to do it?

250
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,280
I am.

251
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
I mean, that's almost that's almost your kind of thing.

252
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,280
I am because I'm comfortable with it because I've been doing, you know, building racing

253
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,320
drones and stuff for years.

254
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,640
I'm quite comfortable at soldering small stuff.

255
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,840
But this wire would be maybe two centimeters long if that and going on to very, very tiny

256
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,080
surface mount components and a small pin.

257
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,000
So if you screw that up, I don't know what the warranty would say about that.

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,760
They don't really mention anything.

259
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,120
And, you know, the final conclusion at the end of this post is we will, of course, fix

260
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
this issue in a future revision of the board.

261
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,600
But what they don't say is what they're going to do for everybody that has current boards.

262
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,880
My assumption is nothing.

263
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,280
That's perhaps it shows some wisdom in choosing to do these in batches because they realize

264
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,360
that they're going to have kinks to work out.

265
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,080
Perhaps I would like the option to send mine back for a replacement.

266
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,040
Yeah, I could see that seems seems reasonable.

267
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,200
They may not be too excited about offering that because they don't even have probably

268
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
devices to replace yours with.

269
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,840
Sure.

270
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,600
But if you're a company offering a product, I think maybe a refund something, you know,

271
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,840
I don't know, because if I screw this up, which, you know, with a soldering iron on some

272
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,400
some components that are that small, it's very possible.

273
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,040
Sure.

274
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,440
What then?

275
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,960
Am I up the creek without a paddle?

276
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,880
Then you've got a really nice looking piece of equipment.

277
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,440
Yeah.

278
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,560
Now, I think if if these guys had marketed it such that here is a kick ass aluminium

279
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,120
beautiful machined case that you can buy that, by the way, also we sell a kit that fits inside

280
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,000
of, I think it would be a completely different proposition.

281
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,280
But they didn't.

282
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,760
They tried to go full Apple, do the OS, do the hardware, do the software.

283
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,260
Right.

284
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,400
And for me, they've just fallen short in enough key areas that it's really taking the

285
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,600
shine off the product for me.

286
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,680
Another example is and again, this is my fault because I can't read.

287
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:56,640
Apparently, the M2 SATA slot that's built into the motherboard disables SATA port one.

288
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,400
So you suddenly go from having a five, three and a half inch drive capacity.

289
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,640
You put an M2 drive in there and suddenly one of the bays is useless.

290
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,080
Why not spend the extra few cents on a SATA control that can do six devices?

291
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,800
I just don't understand why they would cut that corner.

292
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,160
It's just really annoying.

293
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,800
And then I suppose the other thing that kind of tripped me up was the USB-C cable that

294
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,080
ships with the product.

295
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,960
I actually had to cut some of the rubber off the outside of it to make it fit in the port

296
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,460
properly.

297
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,840
They have a Wiki article about that.

298
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,000
There's just a lot of rough edges literally with this product.

299
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,920
That said, all of this said, and I'm aware that that all sounds a little bit negative.

300
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:49,120
The reality is, I bought a product, it shipped, it arrived eventually, it sat on my desk next

301
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,480
to me working and pretty much as advertised.

302
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,280
The hard drive hot swap caddies are a little bit hard to get in and out because the manufacturing

303
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,160
tolerances.

304
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:05,520
I spoke with Gautier at COBOL about this and he said that it's only during mass production

305
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,440
that we can start to see what really needs to be improved because at the prototyping

306
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,880
stage, different factories will always show us their best in terms of tolerances.

307
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,240
That's an interesting insight.

308
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,160
They do say they're going to rework the backplane for the drives, which is my other major complaint

309
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,880
with this unit.

310
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,440
So the backplane for the five SATA drives are these little plastic things that convert

311
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:35,120
the ketchup and mustard cables into a SATA power and SATA data connector.

312
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,080
And they've got these really very, very small, thin plastic tabs on either side to mount

313
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,880
them to the chassis.

314
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,360
And I bent a couple of them just by inserting a drive slightly misaligned, which was enough

315
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,160
to make the power pins on the drive have contact.

316
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,120
So when I was putting the drive in, I could hear it spinning up.

317
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,440
So I'm like, okay, cool, the drive seated fine, but it wasn't making contact with the

318
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,320
data pins.

319
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,160
And it took me a couple of hours to figure that out.

320
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,360
Oh, I bet.

321
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,200
So yeah, once I took it, I basically had to take the whole thing apart again, saw that

322
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,720
I'd bent the tabs, I guess, just by having to push so hard to get the drives in because

323
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,080
the tolerances were so tight.

324
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,880
It actually shaved plastic off the drive caddies as I did so.

325
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,200
I guess I just bent the connector at the back.

326
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,160
You're super tough.

327
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,200
Yeah, yeah.

328
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,240
You're strong.

329
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:35,600
The drive caddies themselves are not tool-less.

330
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,160
You need to use four screws to mount drives into the caddies and then two screws to secure

331
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,160
the caddies into the drive bays themselves as well.

332
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,280
So, you know, it's not perfect.

333
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,760
And I think for the price of 300-ish dollars, I look at what we could get from Synology

334
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,320
or QNAP, and I'm having a hard time with it.

335
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,840
What would be the advantage here?

336
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:06,320
Because the Synology products and the QNAP products, they offer a lot of features.

337
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,440
So what do you think the Helio 64's biggest advantage over those would be?

338
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,200
Well, we didn't talk about performance yet.

339
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,840
Uh-huh.

340
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,400
I know.

341
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,120
Oh, I know.

342
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,880
I'm waiting.

343
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,040
Basically, if you want to do transcoding, forget about it, of anything.

344
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,600
Oh.

345
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,240
It can handle direct play just fine.

346
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:32,000
It will just about handle transcoding a true HD audio track, but not much more than that.

347
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
And even then, the CPU is going bananas trying to do it.

348
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,360
So I'd like to see some hardware circuitry, a bit like, you know, Apple Silicon is doing

349
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,760
to get some of those crazy numbers with the M1.

350
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,040
Some hardware decoders for H.264, H.265, that kind of thing.

351
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,920
Maybe some kind of quick sync of some sort.

352
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,560
Well, yes, that's the other elephant in the room, isn't it?

353
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,520
I mentioned Synology and QNAP because they are off-the-shelf, ready-to-go products that

354
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,840
you could send to your family and say, right, just shove a couple of hard drives in it,

355
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
and I'll do the rest remotely.

356
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,000
You know, you could, and over at serverbuilds.net right now, actually, they've been linking

357
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,120
on eBay this UNAZ chassis, which can take a mini-ITX motherboard and run whatever OS

358
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,440
you want on it, and you have full control over everything, which I think is the primary

359
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,800
advantage of the Helios 64 over a Synology device is that you own it, right?

360
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:35,280
It's not, you're not beholden to whatever Synology decide to do with DSM moving forward

361
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,040
or who knows.

362
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,520
Right.

363
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,320
And the fact that they offer both Ubuntu and Armbian is rather nice.

364
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,120
You have some choice there.

365
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,000
You could probably put Arch on there if you tried hard enough.

366
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But I think the other thing, the other story with these ARM devices, and for some of us,

367
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,920
it matters more, is power usage, and the Helios 64 may have them licked there.

368
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,160
30 watts at full load.

369
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,280
Whoa, really?

370
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,320
That's pretty impressive.

371
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,440
With all the drives spun up.

372
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,640
Right, right.

373
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,320
Compare that to my dual Xeon system in the basement that's pulling 300 and something

374
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
at idle, you know?

375
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,000
So there is a real benefit to having these low power devices.

376
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,240
You know, the fans that I mentioned run at zero RPM most of the time.

377
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,320
Yeah, I'm really glad you checked that because fan noise and power draw, I think, are the

378
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,440
big part of these ARM devices in a review.

379
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,080
You got to look at that because that's where they're going to be most competitive.

380
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,080
So it does seem like as far as noise, because you're podcasting with it right now,

381
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,400
and as far as power draw, it may beat what those other products have to offer, maybe.

382
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,400
It might, as long as you're aware of all of the caveats going in, and the fact that you

383
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,680
are basically a beta tester for this product, as long as you're fine with all those things,

384
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
then go for it.

385
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,360
You know, I was hoping for a bit more of a finished product, like, particularly from

386
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:00,240
the software perspective, there's lots of things in Ambien that on the Helios 64 forums

387
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,880
users are talking about fan control being one of them, and there's a few other things

388
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,000
as well.

389
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,800
If you look at the known issues on the download page in the Wiki, you know, you can see that

390
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:17,440
some kernels will let you monitor the internal battery, some kernels won't.

391
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,280
Suspender RAM is not supported because of some issue with the USB host controller.

392
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,760
Some kernels have kernel panics on shutdown, and some don't.

393
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:35,120
So, you are very much a beta tester, and I think for the price it's a bit hard to swallow,

394
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,360
but it is a beautiful physical thing.

395
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,200
That it is, and it needs to start somewhere.

396
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,960
These devices will only get better over time.

397
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,960
They'll be able to add things like accelerated hardware, accelerated decoding.

398
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,600
It may even be possible with the SOC it has, maybe it just hasn't been enabled via software

399
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
yet.

400
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Yeah.

401
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
So those things will improve.

402
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,920
They'll be able to address things like the wire harness approach I mentioned for the

403
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
backplane.

404
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:04,080
They're going to move to a PCB backplane on the next batch to address issues exactly like

405
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
the one that I faced.

406
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,040
So, you know, they are going to improve things over time, and if all my $300 has served to

407
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,440
do is enable them to eventually build the ultimate ARM-powered NAS, then it might be

408
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
worth it.

409
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,440
And I think ARM is the future, Apple are showing us that, you know, just the sheer power on

410
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,240
offer with that M1 chip.

411
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:32,160
I mean, I've been watching the benchmark videos over the weekend, and wow, I mean, it's fast,

412
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
that thing.

413
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Yeah.

414
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,560
And I have to tell you that 30 watts is extremely appealing to me.

415
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
I'm sure it is.

416
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,400
Yeah, Mr. I run on batteries in the middle of the desert half the time.

417
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Right.

418
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,280
So that to me is something where it's like, okay, I want to see where this goes.

419
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,560
But you know, your review here has made me appreciate something I don't think I've really

420
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,400
thought about when it comes to pre-built NASes, because I think traditionally both you and

421
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,160
myself have done it the more like complicated way where we build an x86 server and it has

422
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:04,800
a bunch of disks, and like my case, I went to a Unix, or I think it's Unix Surplus, is

423
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,400
that what it's called?

424
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,960
And I got myself, you know, a whole chassis, and I have big disks slided, and then that's

425
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,540
how I do a NAS.

426
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:20,480
This is it, these smaller NASes, these product NASes, like the Helio 64 and like the Synology,

427
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,940
they're a category of their own.

428
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,960
And the point that you made about how things like the battery detection and the thermal

429
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,800
sensors and those things not quite being worked out, because right now they're not upstream

430
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,000
everywhere yet.

431
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,080
In a couple of years, it'll probably be universal across Linux distros where that stuff is supported.

432
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,280
But with something like DSM, they're building it for that device to support that specific

433
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,480
device and their other ones.

434
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,640
And so they can purpose load hardware and software to make sure everything works together

435
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,840
so you can get something that runs DSM and have a pretty, you know, as long as you've

436
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,280
looked at the specs, it's going to do hardware decoding of your Plex videos because they've

437
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,960
got the chip and they've got the software and they're going to support it because it's

438
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
one package.

439
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,520
So if you're going for these one package products that are everything from the chassis disk

440
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,160
to the OS, it seems like that might be the more appliance like strategy where you know

441
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,960
you're going to have better long term luck.

442
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:25,880
And I mean, I have I think I don't know, Alex, it it actually could be a six year old, seven

443
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,320
year old Synology at Angela's house.

444
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,900
And it's still running today.

445
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,840
And about a month ago, I logged into it and did a bunch of updates.

446
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:41,400
And it's still running 24 seven out in a garage for I mean, may even be seven years.

447
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,120
Yeah, you buy these things to be an appliance.

448
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,100
You shove the disks in, turn it on and off you go.

449
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,680
And that should that should be the end of it.

450
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,880
That's that's the last thought you should give this type of device, in my opinion.

451
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,880
I did note on their website that they have adapters so you can put two and a half SSDs

452
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,040
in there, which is probably what I do for vibration resistance.

453
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,980
But they're about six bucks a pop.

454
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:08,000
So I'll in it, I'd probably be close to $400 if I was going to buy this thing.

455
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,040
If I was interested in power savings, if I didn't need hardware accelerated decoding,

456
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,920
or if I felt like maybe it's going to get fixed, would you recommend it to me?

457
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,320
Because I may be the target audience for this thing.

458
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,080
It's a tricky question to answer.

459
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,600
I think, yes, but with the caveats we've discussed, you think the price is right.

460
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,880
As long as you go into it with your eyes open, then definitely maybe it depends on you.

461
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,720
It's not for it's not for everybody.

462
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,920
That I think is my answer.

463
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,560
It's not for everyone.

464
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,120
Linode dot com slash SSH.

465
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,280
Go there to receive a $100 60 day credit towards a new account and support this here podcast.

466
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,080
Linode is our cloud hosting provider.

467
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,240
Any time we're trying something that has a cloud component for the show that we can self

468
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,780
host, we spin it up on Linode.

469
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:58,660
The back end infrastructure for the JB podcast network, Linode, my personal sites, Linode.

470
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,500
If you need a simple personal server for a blog or a portfolio or maybe a game server

471
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,920
or a VPN server, Linode has you covered.

472
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,080
And if you get $100 credit, you can try out some serious systems, too.

473
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,100
I mean, you'll be cooking with gas because they have rigs that start at $5 a month.

474
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,240
So you've got a lot to play with there.

475
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,000
And if you need to scale your business or maybe something you're doing goes popular,

476
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
gets viral, they can help you there, too.

477
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,800
It's a really fantastic cloud hosting service because they've got the network to really

478
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,640
back it all up, 40 gigabit connections coming to the hypervisor.

479
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,960
Plus Linode's been around since 2003.

480
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,600
So they've been able to secure some super great long term relationships in connectivity.

481
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,560
Plus on top of that, they've got native SSD storage for each of the hosts, 11 data centers

482
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,960
around the world, and Linode costs 30 to 50% less than the major cloud providers.

483
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,960
They've been around longer, they're independently owned, and you can support the show.

484
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,080
Linode.com slash SSH.

485
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,200
Turns out our listeners are the target market for audiobooks.

486
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,280
Who'd have thought, Chris, people that like podcasts also like audiobooks.

487
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,480
Yeah, I guess when you put it that way, it does seem kind of obvious.

488
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,720
But man, did we get a lot of feedback about audiobooks.

489
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,320
So I collected, like I mentioned earlier in the show, some of the apps that people sent

490
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,320
in.

491
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,120
But I also thought I would just cover a couple of the more clever ways people are consuming

492
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,640
their audiobooks once they have freed them from their DRM or acquired them in some other

493
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,640
means.

494
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,320
And Phil wrote in and he said, stop thinking about audiobooks as some special thing you

495
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,000
need a specific player for.

496
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,560
Audiobooks are basically identical to podcasts.

497
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,260
Just use a podcast player and publish your audiobooks via an RSS feed.

498
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,880
We got like eight different versions of how people are converting their audiobooks into

499
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
podcast feeds.

500
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,720
It seems to be really popular.

501
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,720
Phil here, he's written a Python script that generates an RSS feed given from a folder.

502
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,320
He put that behind some HTTP server with basic authentication.

503
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,960
And then he says, with that, I build a Docker container that hosts my audiobooks in an RSS

504
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
feed.

505
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,600
And he just has that and he subscribes to that in his app.

506
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,240
He says, I'd actually be happy to release the script and container to the community,

507
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,440
but they aren't really ready for public consumption yet.

508
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,800
It would be great if I could get a few spare cycles from someone in the community to clean

509
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,520
it up before releasing the code.

510
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,000
Maybe you can help facilitate such things.

511
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,240
And Alex, we got a couple of people that have come up with clever scripts on how they convert

512
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,640
things or do what.

513
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,520
And they often ask, should I share it with the community?

514
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,960
And it got me thinking, maybe we could use our GitHub for that.

515
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,040
Because people won't know how to find individual GitHubs for all of this.

516
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,960
Maybe there's a way for us to use our GitHub as a jumping off point for people's Ansible

517
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,880
scripts and cool Python scripts and other stuff.

518
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,180
Several things came in.

519
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,240
So let's you and I ruminate on that, because that might be a way we could facilitate some

520
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
of this.

521
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,800
And then you combine that with the Discord, and it could be cooking with gas again.

522
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,240
I like cooking with gas these days.

523
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,600
We do have that Wiki that's been sort of languishing a little bit lately.

524
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,000
So maybe we could have the best audio book playing Wiki page on the internet, something

525
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
like that.

526
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
That'd be pretty good.

527
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,440
Turns out, though, that there's not a lot that you can't do with FFmpeg.

528
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,440
I know.

529
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,660
Yeah, including convert your Audible books, turns out, Phil.

530
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,960
And actually a couple of others, and this probably is what OpenAudible is just doing

531
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,000
on the back end, really, has a FFmpeg script to check and convert.

532
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,600
One more podcast trick.

533
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,400
This one comes from James.

534
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,480
He says he uses OpenAudible to download his purchases to his home server.

535
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,460
And then he has a PHP script and a cron job to auto-generate RSS feeds for any book that

536
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,800
appears in the audio books directory.

537
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,280
I have another tiny script that then creates an index of all the RSS feeds.

538
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,520
When I want to listen to a book, I just add the feed to Antennapod.

539
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,680
It's super handy, and it takes care of all of the offline syncing issues and lets me

540
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,460
choose if I want to listen to a whole book on the go or a podcast here and there in between

541
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,240
chapters using Smart Shuffle.

542
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,280
It's basic, but maybe I should publish my scripts.

543
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,680
Would anybody want that?

544
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,680
Where could I do that?

545
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,320
Well, you know what they say, sharing is caring.

546
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get that going.

547
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,100
So yeah, there's several that came in, but it was interesting to see people using different

548
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,960
tricks to convert them to podcasts.

549
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
I don't know, Alex.

550
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,440
It's not my jam, I got to be honest with you.

551
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,400
Something like Booksonic or an audio book dedicated app still kind of seems to be more

552
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
my speed.

553
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,160
That's the beauty of this kind of stuff, though, in the self-hosted world is that there's not

554
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,520
really ever a right or a wrong answer to this kind of stuff.

555
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
True.

556
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,280
Once you have your data, once you control your data, you can serve it up to yourself

557
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
however, wherever you like.

558
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,260
And that's one of the advantages of it.

559
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:48,640
So Luck wrote in, and this is a tip that goes back to our discussion last episode, where

560
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,760
we were experimenting with a Google Photos replacement.

561
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,520
I don't know, do you still have that going?

562
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,480
I probably do, but I haven't opened it in two weeks.

563
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
Yeah.

564
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,200
Well, one of the things we were talking about was what would be the best way to get the

565
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,400
photos off your phone and into a directory where this tool could index and do all of

566
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,480
the object recognition.

567
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,800
And Luck wrote in to say, check out Photosync.

568
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,480
It's photosync-app.com.

569
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:24,720
It's available for iOS and Android, and it supports tons of ways to transfer from like

570
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,740
all of the typical cloud services, but it also supports S3 uploads, NFS uploads, web

571
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,400
dev uploads, Samba, et cetera.

572
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,360
And we've got a couple of people that are trying to do their uploads to S3 and then

573
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,760
having that app, which I'm drawing a blank on the name of it, analyze the photos.

574
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,720
And so this app supports S3, NFS, web dev, so there's a lot of ways you could get these

575
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,800
up on your home server to then point Photoprism at it, photosync-app.com, if you want to

576
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
check that out.

577
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:59,080
Now our next bit of feedback comes from Draw, D-R-O-R, I'm sorry, I'm going to go with

578
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
Draw.

579
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,240
You said that about your podcast a couple of weeks ago, and I'm on a marathon catching

580
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,100
up with the previous episodes.

581
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,440
So far, I'm enjoying it.

582
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,760
Many thanks for all the tips.

583
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,020
Thank you very much.

584
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:14,640
Now I'm stuck in a wanting mode where I pretty much know my needs, but I'm failing to actually

585
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,640
make purchases.

586
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,460
We've all been there.

587
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,800
You're in the research phase, Draw.

588
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,240
Too much choice is paralyzing you.

589
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,240
Yes, definitely been there.

590
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,960
So storage backups NAS wise, I'd like to start with decent storage for my media, but I'm

591
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,600
far from being a hardware and network guy.

592
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,200
Where would you recommend to start without diving too deep into learning all this stuff?

593
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,300
Would a couple of my book, Western Digital Hard Drives, work and what would I connect

594
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,640
them to?

595
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,040
Regardless, maybe you might discuss it later.

596
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,640
But what about Mycroft as well as a self-hosted Google Home replacement?

597
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,640
So this is a great email because this is maybe the candidate we were just talking about for

598
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,600
the Helio 64 versus something like a Synology or QNAP.

599
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,040
Yeah, I think so.

600
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,680
And you know, to get started, a Raspberry Pi with a couple of USB hard drives connected

601
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,960
will do just fine.

602
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,360
Yeah, you know, don't be shy when you write in.

603
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,640
Let us know what your budget is and let us know what your comfort level is, like your

604
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,360
DIY comfort level, your budget and your DIY comfort level.

605
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,400
Because Alex and I are totally happy making recommendations anywhere on the spectrum.

606
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,560
So you could go with Raspberry Pis, like Alex was saying, and hook up a couple of USB disks

607
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,680
and you'd really be off to the races as long as you're comfortable configuring Samba or

608
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,480
something like that, or maybe even going something with like Cockpit.

609
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,920
And what I would say as well is that over the last several years over at linuxserver.io,

610
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,560
I've been writing the Perfect Media Server series.

611
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:52,320
Go and take a look at that because in that series, I cover Docker, MergerFS, which is

612
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,200
an awesome bit of software, with SnapRaid as well for drive parity to protect you from

613
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,320
drive failures a little bit, that kind of stuff.

614
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,920
And I talk about the overall kind of decisions you've got to make.

615
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,520
And hopefully, when you start looking against your requirements versus what some of this

616
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,840
software can do, you'll start to narrow down your field of decisions a little bit and it

617
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,040
should make things a bit easier for you.

618
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,320
I don't cover hardware.

619
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,520
There's plenty of other good pieces of journalism about that.

620
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:30,440
So Brian Moses writes a really good blog every year, I think, on the perfect NAS build.

621
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,840
Of course, there's serverbuilds.net as well, which is always a great resource.

622
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,200
But yeah, I mean, just feel free to let us know what your budget is or drop into the

623
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Discord.

624
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
We have a hardware channel.

625
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
I'll add to that.

626
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
And you were touching on it there, Alex.

627
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,720
I think what he needs to do is figure out what his primary app or use case is and then

628
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
build for that.

629
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,440
I think maybe that's what he's lacking.

630
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:57,000
Because he may also be a good QNAP or Synology candidate and where he wants to, instead of

631
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,540
struggle with the networking and OS aspect of it, he'd rather learn at the application

632
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,840
level where he could deploy the applications using a UI that they provide and learn the

633
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,840
applications.

634
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,580
And then maybe from there, get a passion, get rolling, get enthusiastic about this stuff,

635
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,760
and then go more towards the DIY route.

636
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,360
I think that is really common for people is they have an application or a use they build

637
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
for that.

638
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,200
They kind of take the easiest route possible that is sustainable for them.

639
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,160
And then when they go hardcore, they just start going even deeper.

640
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,440
And that may be what happens to you.

641
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,200
So consider maybe one of those Synology or QNAPs, like we were talking about earlier,

642
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,120
that will make it a lot easier to just get going with the applications, but still give

643
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,800
you a good, solid base to run everything from.

644
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:45,000
A really expensive requirement to ask yourself about is, do I need to transcode?

645
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,160
So with Plex, if you want to watch stuff on your phone or on your TV or anywhere really,

646
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,420
it will go ahead and transcode on the fly.

647
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,360
So it will convert the video that you have to whatever format the device you're watching

648
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,680
it on can play back.

649
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,160
It will also reduce the quality.

650
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:09,160
So it will take a 1080p quality file, for example, and convert it all the way down to DVD quality

651
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,760
or something like that, if you're on limited bandwidth.

652
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,760
But that requires some very specific hardware choices around CPUs or GPUs and that kind

653
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
of stuff.

654
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,360
So I mentioned API earlier, but that wouldn't be the best choice if you want to transcode,

655
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
for example.

656
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,360
So lots of options, but it depends, like Chris says, on what you want to do.

657
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,760
And our last one today, although we did get some other emails in, so we will cue those,

658
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,640
but also do please keep sending those in at selfhosted.show slash contact.

659
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
We have a form there.

660
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,220
You fill it in, and it lands in our inbox.

661
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,760
And Russell writes in with our last one, and it's a bit of a workaround for you OpenHAB

662
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
users out there.

663
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,560
Alex and I are obviously deep into Home Assistant, so we don't have a lot of OpenHAB experience,

664
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,240
but we do like getting tips.

665
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,600
And Russell writes in and says, to my knowledge, OpenHAB doesn't have anything built into it

666
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,500
that detects dawn, dusk, sunrise, sunset, et cetera.

667
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,200
So I wanted to set something up myself, and I turned to Python.

668
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,280
But every library I found that used calculation-based time had an issue where, after a year or so,

669
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,320
the sunrise and sunset times would be wildly incorrect.

670
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,720
He goes on to say there's a couple other libraries that were just very out of date.

671
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:23,680
So to make it work, I got myself a free API subscription to ipgeolocation.io.

672
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:30,360
The free developer subscription allows for 30,000 requests per month with 1,000 per day,

673
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,440
which is way more than the two calls I use, one to get the sunrise, sunset times, and

674
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,800
another to get UTC offset.

675
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,320
That's how you can also handle daylight savings, which, nice catch, Russell.

676
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,400
He goes on to say I use a cron job to call the Python script, which retrieves the times

677
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,200
every day and then runs an at command to schedule the sunrise, sunset triggers.

678
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,400
It works really well.

679
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,280
And the documentation is easy to understand.

680
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,360
I highly recommend it for anyone looking for sunrise or sunset solutions.

681
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,160
He needs a good way to share that script, though, because I think people could take

682
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
advantage of that.

683
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,840
Cheers, he says.

684
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,240
Well, good work around there.

685
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,120
OpenHAB might not have it built in, but he came up with a way to make it work.

686
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,600
And that's all it really takes.

687
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,240
My tip of the hat to you there, Russell.

688
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
All right.

689
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,640
So coming up on December 13 is the Home Assistant Conference.

690
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,160
It's to attend will be $1, which they're going to use to cover the cost of the platform.

691
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,000
Obviously it's a virtual conference for obvious reasons.

692
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So it's Sunday, December the 13th, and that is at 10 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, which

693
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,400
I think is 7 p.m. Central European Time.

694
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,280
So hopefully with it being on a Sunday, that should fit most people's schedules.

695
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
Interesting.

696
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,320
I, of course, signed up.

697
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,520
I got my ticket.

698
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,520
I'm all in.

699
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
I'm going to go.

700
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,600
And they will have it just on YouTube as well, I think, from reading their website.

701
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,280
You don't have to sign up.

702
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,140
And I'm going to keep my eye on the conference.

703
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,000
And if there's some really great audio, I may grab some clips.

704
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You know, I may.

705
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It could happen.

706
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm particularly looking forward to just seeing how different people work with Home Assistant.

707
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,480
You know, there's a couple of sessions around improving YAML workflows.

708
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,340
There's one here which might be interesting for you.

709
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:18,300
On the main stage, managing an off-grid vehicle with Home Assistant.

710
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,300
Stop it.

711
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,300
Are you serious?

712
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,300
Uh-huh.

713
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,300
Somebody's doing my bit?

714
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,300
No.

715
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,300
That's great.

716
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,760
I should like pick them for all the knowledge they have.

717
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,960
I did not see that.

718
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,120
As well as reverse engineering a 433 hertz megahertz RF protocol.

719
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,560
I did see that one.

720
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,000
That could be useful for, you know, hacking some of the little remote controls you have

721
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,640
for like garage door openers and that kind of thing.

722
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,920
Well, I want to thank a Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode of Self-Hosted.

723
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,920
And they do have their Black Friday sale going.

724
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,640
We'll have a link in the show notes.

725
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,640
We know the cloud is growing, and so is the demand for skilled cloud professionals.

726
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,240
82% of hiring managers say cloud certifications make a candidate more attractive.

727
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,540
Well, ACG's Black Friday sale is your last chance for low prices this year.

728
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,060
Keep up with change and develop the skills you need with a Cloud Guru.

729
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,600
Developing cloud fluency can be hard, and it's even harder to keep up.

730
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:16,000
So they make it easy by providing an engaging way to learn, retain, and stay competitive.

731
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,360
Get the best price possible by using our Black Friday link in the show notes.

732
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,860
You can get that at selfhosted.show slash 33.

733
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,640
And thanks to a Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode of Self-Hosted.

734
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,320
You know, speaking of Black Fridays, Alex, I'm going to do a Black Friday sale for the

735
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,620
Self-Hosted SREs for probably a couple of weeks.

736
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,960
So if you want to support the show and get a limited ad feed and get the extra content,

737
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:46,520
the post-show, go to self-hosted.show slash SRE and then use the coupon code blackfriday.

738
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:53,840
And it'll work for as long as I leave it active, and that'll take $2 off, which is like basically

739
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:59,240
nothing for this show because since it's only twice a month, we have a lower membership

740
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,280
fee already.

741
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,680
So that's a ridiculously good deal.

742
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:08,360
Crazy Chris is blowing off the doors with these crazy prices, but you know, I never

743
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,080
really have had an opportunity in the past to do a Black Friday sale because I never

744
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,160
really had anything to Black Friday sale, so I thought it'd be fun.

745
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,680
So yeah, if you want to support the show and get a great deal, go to self-hosted.show slash

746
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,160
SRE and then use that coupon code blackfriday and you'll get that deal.

747
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,720
Maybe by next Black Friday, we'll be able to have a merch sale.

748
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,720
Wink, wink.

749
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
I know, right?

750
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,720
You know what?

751
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,640
I just was looking at badges this morning.

752
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,320
Self-Hosted badge would be pretty cool.

753
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,140
So as usual, you can go to self-hosted.show slash contact to find more ways to get in

754
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,380
touch with us.

755
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,720
And you can find me on Twitter at ironic badger.

756
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,880
Yeah, I'm there too at Chris LAS and the show is at self-hosted show.

757
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,280
Don't forget the network is at Jupiter signal.

758
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
Thanks for listening.

759
00:43:52,280 --> 00:44:07,560
And that was self-hosted.show slash 33.
