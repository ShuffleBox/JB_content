1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,500
Coming up on today's show, we have good news, everyone.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,220
I check out Lychee's latest release and Chris licks a stamp and sends it.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,140
All of it.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,220
I'm Alex.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,020
I'm Chris, and this is Self-Hosted 27.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,240
Episode 27 feels like a lucky one, Alex, because around the time this comes out,

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,740
it'll be our one year anniversary.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,140
Happy birthday to us.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,820
Can you believe it?

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,660
I mean, in some ways it feels like we've been doing this forever.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,420
In some ways it feels like it's been six months.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,020
God, they grow up so fast, don't they?

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,920
You know what else this means?

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,060
It means it was a year since you and I went to see Wendell.

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,940
Right.

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,820
On that road trip.

17
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,140
What a different world it was.

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,940
I could use a nice road trip like that.

19
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,940
Me too.

20
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,400
Well, we have a lot to talk about.

21
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,460
I'm going to try to convince you to adopt something.

22
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,980
So let me start by saying thank you to a cloud guru for sponsoring this episode.

23
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,780
If you're looking to make a high paying career move into the cloud, no better

24
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,740
place to start than a certification.

25
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,180
ACG has helped more than 2 million people skill up on cloud, AWS, Azure,

26
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,900
GCP exam preps also available.

27
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,900
They've got you covered.

28
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,460
Get going at a cloud guru.com.

29
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,540
Alex, as we record this show, some people may know this, others may not, but a cloud

30
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,020
guru and Jupiter Broadcasting have made a mutual decision to separate and restore

31
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,460
Jupiter Broadcasting's independent media status.

32
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,700
This de-merger will allow Jupiter Broadcasting and a cloud guru to dedicate

33
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,020
their resources to specialize in content they do best.

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,460
Jupiter Broadcasting in creating Linux and open source podcasts, content catered

35
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,100
to enthusiasts and industry professionals, and a cloud guru in creating comprehensive

36
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,060
hands-on multi-cloud computing.

37
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,740
Linux and DevOps training for businesses and individuals.

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,100
A cloud guru and Jupiter Broadcasting share many commonalities such as a passion

39
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,860
we have for our respective missions and an investment we make in creating

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,900
accessible, accurate, and engaging content that makes a difference to our audience.

41
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,420
We also share a belief in the importance of giving back to the open source

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,780
community, as such a cloud guru will continue its support of Jupiter

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,300
Broadcasting with a sponsorship arrangement, and we'll continue to explore

44
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,460
future content collaboration opportunities.

45
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,140
So we are an independent company again.

46
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,780
And as part of that, we have been rolling out some new shows.

47
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,620
Linux Action News just relaunched.

48
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,300
I'm very excited about that.

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,140
So am I.

50
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,820
That was one of my favorite ways of just, you know, dipping my toe into the pool

51
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,060
of Linux news every week.

52
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,100
That's a funny visual.

53
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,660
And then Coder Radio also just relaunched.

54
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,220
We just recorded our second episode.

55
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,900
So that's out right about now as well.

56
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,420
What's funny about my toes?

57
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,300
It's not so much that it's like the Linux news pool and what that might actually

58
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,820
look like.

59
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,540
I'm picturing a pool with a lot of algae, you know, a really gross one that needs

60
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,740
to be washed a little bit.

61
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,420
Maybe some ducks came and crapped in it.

62
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,180
I'm staying out of this.

63
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,180
You're going to have to find a shovel, man.

64
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,420
I just love it.

65
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,260
I just, the Linux people know I love, so I get to have a little bit of fun as part

66
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,140
of this transition to independent.

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,740
Some of our shows are launching membership feeds.

68
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,140
Predominantly, these are limited ad feeds that will have some

69
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,660
additional value as well.

70
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,460
The idea being is that we want to help for production of the shows

71
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,780
and keep them sustainable.

72
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,300
Jupiter Broadcasting will live and die on the success of some of the multiple

73
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,140
sources of income that I can come up with.

74
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,700
And so the idea being is we don't want the only way we live and die being

75
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,500
sponsorships, we're very grateful for our sponsorships.

76
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,220
And if you can't afford to be a member or a member of all of our shows, that's

77
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,740
fine, just, we appreciate you listening and engaging with a sponsor if it seems

78
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,700
like an appropriate fit, if you can't afford to support the show and you want

79
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,100
to help keep us going, and in addition to getting a limited ad version of the show,

80
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,820
you will also get a bonus post-show, we'll include the bonus post-show

81
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,140
that isn't included anywhere else.

82
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,860
If you want to join us, we have a limited time code and we've come up with a name

83
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,460
for the team that we think is pretty great.

84
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,460
It's going to be the Self-Hosted Site Reliability Engineers.

85
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,180
So you go to selfhosted.show slash SRE to sign up.

86
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,940
It is $5 a month.

87
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,300
And if you use the code SSH, we'll take a dollar off indefinitely.

88
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,540
So it's $4 a month indefinitely.

89
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,740
If you use the promo code SSH at self-hosted.show slash SRE, you become

90
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,140
a site reliability engineer for the show.

91
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,900
You get a limited ad version of the show.

92
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,780
Plus you also get the post-show included with that one feed and you just subscribe

93
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,380
to that and that's your version of the show fully produced, just limited ads,

94
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,820
the post-show just for you and you help keep us going.

95
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,180
It's $5 right now.

96
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,860
You might want to get in on that because if for some reason in the future,

97
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,980
in the, in, you know, in year two of this show or something, we decided to go to

98
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,180
weekly, we'd probably bring the membership price up to help cover that cost.

99
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,420
So you might want to lock that price in while you can at self-hosted.show slash SRE.

100
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,020
Thank you to everybody who is in a position to support us there.

101
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,580
And if you can't, your support by listening, sharing the show with someone

102
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,340
you like, or engaging in those sponsors is all the thanks we need.

103
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,460
And we appreciate that too.

104
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,300
Absolutely.

105
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,420
I couldn't be more delighted in the news that JB is independent again.

106
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,540
I think that's fantastic for everybody involved.

107
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,420
So, uh, I thank anybody in advance that sees fit to throw a bone or two, are we?

108
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,780
Thank you, Alex too, because you know, it's doing these shows is what makes it

109
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,580
possible and it just means this is, this is my full-time thing now.

110
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,660
It's a lot right now.

111
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,700
Like honestly, it's overwhelming at the moment and it's touch and go.

112
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,220
I don't know if we'll make it the next three months and I don't know if we'll

113
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,380
make it six months after that.

114
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,300
I'm hopeful, but it is really quite touch and go.

115
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,540
And I know it's touch and go for a lot of people out there, but I'm hoping

116
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,660
these memberships not only give us like a little additional runway.

117
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,460
So if maybe a week, we don't have a sponsor, we can still cover the

118
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,700
cost of running the show that'd be ideal.

119
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,940
But additionally, maybe it can go towards paying the hosts a little bit of beer

120
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,220
money for doing the show, which I think would be really, that's, that's my kind

121
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,660
of hope, I don't think it's going to make us millionaires, but I hope it covers

122
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,340
the cost of an editor and maybe gives you and I a little beer money, you know?

123
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,060
Wouldn't that be nice?

124
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,980
Reminds me of only fools and horses in the UK to watch as a kid.

125
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,580
And David Jason was one day Rogers will be millionaires.

126
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,460
That won't mean anything to you, but to anybody from England will

127
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,700
know exactly what I'm talking about.

128
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,060
No, but I'm going to, I'm over here scratching my lottery tickets.

129
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,300
Sorry.

130
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:26,700
What was that?

131
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,580
I kid, but also I do have something in the works for like a, um, a bundle for

132
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,580
the network, if this isn't for you yet, or you want everything, stay tuned.

133
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,980
There will probably be upgrade options or something like that as well.

134
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,860
But I do have some ideas around that to try to give everybody one bundle package

135
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,980
you could get and you get all the shows feeds and all of that, but that's in the

136
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,180
works, we'll have more information about that in the meantime, self hosted that

137
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,980
show slash SRE, it's a new beginning.

138
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,780
It's, it's fun and kind of coincidental that it's right here at the year.

139
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,300
Mark too.

140
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,220
Do we start playing 2001 space Odyssey now?

141
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,940
I haven't been thinking about it more and more.

142
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,980
Actually, I have a project for you, Chris, and it has a name

143
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,580
with questionable pronunciation.

144
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,740
So it's perfect for you.

145
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,620
Oh, okay.

146
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,460
I'll give it a go.

147
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:14,940
You ready?

148
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:15,940
I'm ready.

149
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,460
Yes.

150
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,340
I'm going to say, okay.

151
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,260
It's L Y C H E E.

152
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,740
I'm going to say lychee.

153
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,420
You bastard.

154
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,460
You copied me.

155
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,980
That's not what you said five minutes ago.

156
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,300
Well, I was either that or lychee.

157
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,860
I just wasn't, I could be lychee.

158
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,780
Oh, I think lychee, I've, I've always said lychee to myself.

159
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,100
Okay.

160
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:33,700
Oh, okay.

161
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,100
All right.

162
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,380
But the whole big thing was you were going to get it wrong, but I don't think

163
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,340
you did, so good job, Chris.

164
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,460
Although for all you know, you have a wrong true.

165
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:41,780
Yes.

166
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,660
Well, I mean, you are speaking to the guy that read Hermione as Hermione for about

167
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,220
the first two Harry Potter books.

168
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,740
So, but that's, that's not what really matters.

169
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,740
What matters is this is a self hosted photo gallery.

170
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,620
Yes, sir.

171
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,860
So light room and those kinds of things come with the photo gallery.

172
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,420
Those kinds of things come with built-in galleries and stuff like that.

173
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,460
But obviously if you stop paying Adobe, those galleries go away.

174
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,860
That's what happened to me.

175
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,180
I stopped paying Adobe for a bit and my galleries went away and I'm like,

176
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,300
this is probably a solved problem in the self-hosted space.

177
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:23,380
And yes, there are tons, and I do mean tons of photo galleries, but for me,

178
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:31,460
none are quite as simple and just fit the bill of doing nothing except for just

179
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,500
displaying my image in a distraction-free way with basic album support.

180
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,540
And that's what Lychee does fantastically well, I think.

181
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:47,700
So if you head over to gallery.selfhosted.show, I am in the process of hopefully by

182
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,100
the time the episode airs, setting up a gallery for you all to go and have a look

183
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,340
at what Lychee looks like, but in the meantime, you can go and take a look at

184
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,020
their GitHub there at lychee.org as well.

185
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,180
And it's a fully open source photo gallery app.

186
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,580
And I think it's the best of the bunch.

187
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,660
It's clean.

188
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,860
It's really easy to navigate and the UI is clean and it has various size thumbnails

189
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,020
for the images, which really displays them nicely.

190
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,700
Like you have this one at the beach and it's a super wide shot of birds flying

191
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,380
along the water, and it displays that one as a large panorama in the list.

192
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,860
It does a really good job of doing that and making it all work.

193
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,300
This is super slick.

194
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,140
Now, my question for you is how are these photos stored on the backend?

195
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,300
Is it just looking at a directory and then indexing them and presenting them?

196
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,380
Or are you uploading them through a web form?

197
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,220
Like, what's that like?

198
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,060
Well, come on, you know me, if it doesn't run in a container, I

199
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,820
don't generally run it at all.

200
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,620
Okay, of course.

201
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,900
So I'm running it out of a Docker container, a Linux container.

202
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,340
Someone actually wrote in and told me off for calling them Docker containers.

203
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,340
You know, they're not Docker containers, Alex.

204
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,340
They're Linux containers.

205
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,100
I know.

206
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,220
I swear.

207
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,660
I even said in the episode that Docker is the Kleenex of containers

208
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,420
and someone still wrote in anyway.

209
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,860
Thank you for writing in.

210
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:15,460
I love hearing from you all, but I do know the difference between a

211
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,980
Linux container and Docker container.

212
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,460
Thank you.

213
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,420
Right.

214
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,980
Going back to Lychee.

215
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,260
Yeah, it's running out of a container.

216
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,500
I do a volume bind mount to the images.

217
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,220
So I'll go and sign in.

218
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,980
And once I'm signed in as my admin user, I am able to create albums and

219
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,700
upload through the web interface.

220
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,260
So you can import via link from a server.

221
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,500
Oh, I haven't tried that one or Dropbox.

222
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,740
Oh, interesting.

223
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,980
That's not bad.

224
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,340
Those are a couple of good options really.

225
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,820
Yeah.

226
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,460
So this action will, if you import from a server, you point it to a

227
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,300
folder or sub folder, which will be located in the following directory.

228
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,420
So I assume that means a volume that you've bind mounted.

229
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,540
So this is probably a way to import entire directory structures

230
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,740
worth of pictures at once.

231
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,820
So I didn't know that feature existed until just now.

232
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,220
That's great.

233
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,940
That does seem nice.

234
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,580
And Lychee just released.

235
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,500
Well, I say just in 2020 time.

236
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,220
Anyway, just released a new release in April version four, lots of changes in

237
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,420
there, so head over to GitHub and take a look at some of them.

238
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,220
So in our off-air conversations, I have kind of grok that you are an anti-Syncite.

239
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,260
You don't like the SyncThing project.

240
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,380
I know you've got a experience from BitTorrent Sync back in the day.

241
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,460
You obviously have experience with Nextcloud and I'd like to take a minute to

242
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,700
try to convince you and maybe a couple of people in the audience to give

243
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,220
SyncThing another try.

244
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,460
If it's been a little while, it might be worth a go.

245
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:52,220
I too, like you had tried it, gave it a decent like 30 day try, actually a couple

246
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,620
of times and both times walked away very frustrated and decided I wasn't going to

247
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,020
use it.

248
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,300
If you're not familiar with SyncThing, it is a continuous file synchronization

249
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,700
program.

250
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,340
It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time.

251
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,660
It uses encryption.

252
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,140
There is no cloud storage.

253
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,340
It is from machine to machine.

254
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,940
It has a peer-to-peer discovery network.

255
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,460
It uses an open protocol.

256
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,300
It's open source and it's private.

257
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,420
There's no data stored anywhere else that could be indexed or

258
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,860
inventoried or reviewed.

259
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,500
It uses a key system for authentication.

260
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,340
It's overall, once you set it up, fairly just simple and just goes.

261
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,060
It's really kind of set it and forget it kind of background stuff.

262
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,900
So I'm looking at your server now.

263
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,420
You shared with me fish sticks.

264
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,980
Yes, that's what we've called your server.

265
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,300
You shared with me this through SyncThing and you gave me a code, like an ID.

266
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,820
If there's no middleman, how did my server reach your server to do that initial

267
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,980
key exchange behind firewalls?

268
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,380
Which is so cool, isn't it?

269
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,460
So if you actually just watch the logs, when you first fire up your SyncThing

270
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,340
server, you can see it doing a peer-to-peer discovery mechanism.

271
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,340
There's a shared directory amongst them that they can use to discover each other.

272
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,100
And it's incredible, actually, when you think about it, how fast that actually works.

273
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,020
In that initial key exchange, there's a third-party server somewhere, surely.

274
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,100
Like my server is talking to a shared directory.

275
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,220
Does that mean every SyncThing in the world is also talking to that shared directory?

276
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,980
So it's like a phone book for SyncThings?

277
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:37,220
In a sense, there is a SyncThing discovery server that finds peers on the internet.

278
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,260
So it's a peer-to-peer system.

279
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,900
And so there's a couple of directory servers they can check, and then they very

280
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,620
quickly populate and discover them.

281
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,100
In fact, it's very impressive when you think about it, how fast it does populate.

282
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,740
So the project just maintains a global cluster for public use that by default,

283
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,060
SyncThing just uses.

284
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:03,060
But you can point it at any discovery server you want, or you can tell it not to do that at all.

285
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,740
It's exchanging these keys, though, so it's nice and encrypted, it's secure.

286
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,300
And then there's a network of community-contributed relay servers as well.

287
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,220
So if you're behind some particular tricky NAT, like I am in the RV, it will automatically

288
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,180
help your relay server join that pool and get discovered by the other SyncThing

289
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,140
servers and actually make the Sync session start even behind a double NAT.

290
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,180
That's also a community-contributed thing that by default uses those community

291
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,020
servers, but you could point at something else.

292
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,100
So there's no hosted service that I'm connected to that's going to go away when

293
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,620
some company buys another company or something?

294
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,340
No, and not only that, but there's really no one company that goes down that takes

295
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:45,860
this out.

296
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,060
But for me, one of the areas I've relied on SyncThing a lot recently is the

297
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,740
transferring files with my clients that maybe are producing media.

298
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:00,780
So I have chrislash.com consulting and I have a handful of clients, some that are

299
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,180
doing video, mostly audio, but some that are doing video.

300
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,940
And these are really large files because they're, they're recording raw files, and

301
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,140
then they're asking me to like cut them up or do something with them.

302
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:17,180
And we looked at it and for cloud storage, like through Dropbox or OneDrive, or even

303
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,500
using something where you'd upload it and download it, it's very exciting.

304
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,580
It's very expensive for these 40 gig files, and there's like maybe a couple of them

305
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,940
and they take forever to upload and download.

306
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,540
So it was just a light above the head kind of moment, you know, where the light

307
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,060
goes on.

308
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,940
And I realized, holy crap, this is the perfect job for SyncThing because there's

309
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,740
no cloud provider, so there's no cost there.

310
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,820
Both my editing system and the system they're recording on have copious amounts

311
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,540
of free space, terabytes of free space.

312
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,900
So why not just have them go directly to each other?

313
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,540
I don't need a cloud server in the middle that it's also syncing to.

314
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,940
I don't need a big suite of software like Nextcloud offers sitting on top of my sync.

315
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,220
I just want this computer's file system writing to this computer's file system.

316
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,380
And the more I use SyncThing, the more it feels like it creates this pervasive

317
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,180
universal network file system for me.

318
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:15,980
I wonder how much, you know, storing my 40 terabytes on Dropbox would cost me.

319
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,740
Yeah, a lot.

320
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,340
Yeah, a lot.

321
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,300
And then so I can just pick a directory and give you a link, which is effectively

322
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,420
what we're doing with SyncThing.

323
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:23,980
Right.

324
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,540
Yeah.

325
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:30,460
I mean the, the cost alone of, of, you know, S3 or a Dropbox or a Google Drive

326
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,660
for that amount of storage is, yeah, this is quite compelling.

327
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,060
I have to be honest.

328
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,060
There's the peace of mind aspect of it too.

329
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,700
Right now I'm getting ready for a road trip and there'll be a good portion where

330
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,820
we go off grid, that's kind of like just something we do kind of on the regular

331
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,780
now and after chatting with you, it dawned on me, you know, I'm a fan of Open

332
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,820
Audible, I don't have all that stuff at my RV, but I have it here at the studio.

333
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,420
I can use SyncThing to lift and move all of my audio books that I want to listen

334
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,900
to on this road trip and it just does it in the background as the bandwidth that

335
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,380
the RV allows and it just does it silently and, and patiently to a Raspberry Pi.

336
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,940
And it creates this network syncing effect where I can move whatever I want,

337
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,620
even if it could potentially flag some copyright bot, even though I own it,

338
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,100
right, I own that stuff, I bought it.

339
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,140
I just want to listen to it in a different device, but it

340
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,300
would still trigger a bot.

341
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,980
I don't have to, I don't have any of that worries with SyncThing.

342
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,820
So is everything encrypted then between different servers when you're syncing?

343
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,780
Yes, it is.

344
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,380
And, um, they have a open bounty program that try to encourage people to discover

345
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,540
issues and they have a dedicated security page at syncthing.net that gives

346
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,540
you front and center information on how to report issues, where to get their

347
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,900
keys, if you need to verify something or sign something and how to report bugs.

348
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,980
Just all boom right there.

349
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,140
They take it pretty seriously from what I can tell.

350
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,060
And they have a foundation that they've created behind the project as well that

351
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,460
puts out annual reports and has created bylaws and seems to really run the

352
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,860
operations of the project for them.

353
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,060
So I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

354
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,260
I'm going to set a reminder for, let's say four months time.

355
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,580
And we'll check back in at an episode in about four months.

356
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,820
And you can ask me whether I've switched or not, I don't know.

357
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,780
I'm skeptical.

358
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,580
I'm tempted.

359
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,580
I am tempted.

360
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,700
And I tell you my, my main use case for syncing files around would be my

361
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,060
MacBook pro where I keep all my photos and stuff like that.

362
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,700
Yeah.

363
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,900
My general workflow is, you know, if I go out and take some pictures, I'll

364
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,580
import them onto the Mac book, edit them directly on that SSD.

365
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,380
And then as I'm making those edits, you know, that creates a sidecar XMP

366
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,820
files and stuff like that, if it would send it back then to my NAS as like

367
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,180
a read only situation, that's my primary use case for something like this.

368
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,660
Where I ran into some issues was when it was trying to index existing

369
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,900
content, that's particularly, you know, I've got about two terabytes worth

370
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,500
of very small files to index for, for pictures, for photos.

371
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,580
And, uh, it seems to just choke down on that for a couple of days on the

372
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:13,100
server side and then again on the laptop side as well, so it, because I only

373
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,900
wanted a one way sync, uh, it seemed to struggle a bit, so I actually be really

374
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,220
interested to know how it handles a bunch of files because that was the

375
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,820
Achilles heel of BitTorrent sync.

376
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,260
I don't remember if you recall.

377
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,420
I actually bought BitTorrent sync, uh, when you had it on and filter

378
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,620
probably half a year, half a decade ago.

379
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,700
Yeah, me too.

380
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,460
Um, but you throw it like in a director with a lot of files and it was just a

381
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,380
mess and then, um, I changed to Resilio sync, right.

382
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,380
And then Resilio sync.

383
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:42,580
Yep.

384
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,620
My tip for success is have a master server of truth, something that's online

385
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,300
when the other ones come online.

386
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,820
What I messed up, I think in the past is I had was mostly using sync thing on

387
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,500
laptops and they would be on and offline at various times and what would come

388
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,060
online and it just, I think it just caused problems.

389
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,860
Now I run it continuously in the RV and continuously on the NAS, but I'm also

390
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,900
considering tossing it up on a VPS to just make sure I always have a source of

391
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,300
truth up there, not syncing the files, but running as my own discovery server and

392
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,820
something they call an introducer server that will automatically introduce a

393
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,380
client to all of your other nodes.

394
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,900
Thinking about trying that.

395
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,380
So, all right, now you got me.

396
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,140
That's a, that's pretty cool.

397
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,940
And if you need some cloud hosting, check out lino.com slash SSH.

398
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,140
If you go to lino.com slash SSH, you'll get a $100 60 day credit towards a new

399
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,580
account.

400
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,020
This is a great opportunity to try out Linode.

401
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,260
They have 11 data centers around the world, enterprise grade hardware, and

402
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,580
next generation super fast network.

403
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,820
And Linode has a really easy to use interface and lots of distributions to

404
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,140
choose from and a ton of good pricing options starting at a $5 a month shared

405
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,180
rig, but they also have dedicated CPU plans, GPU compute plans.

406
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,500
They'll even integrate with orchestration management.

407
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,420
They have Terraform as well.

408
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,020
I'm reliably informed.

409
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,300
That's pretty cool.

410
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,620
And Kubernetes support is also in there.

411
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,780
So really you have the whole gamut.

412
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,500
They also have stack scripts, which are community scripts to spin up different

413
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,660
parts of infrastructure that are really easy to read and easy to create your own.

414
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,060
They have one click app deployments as well, but obviously you can just do the

415
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,340
traditional deploy a machine.

416
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,580
Then get running on top of that.

417
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,340
They have block storage.

418
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,740
So if you'd like to do something like we're doing with our next cloud setup

419
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:34,140
and use block storage or object storage on the backend, it's really nice.

420
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,420
They have both options available.

421
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,460
As an example, I'll use object storage for show notes when there's media that

422
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,260
we have in line in the show notes, Wes gave me this idea and it works so easy.

423
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,340
You just upload something to the object storage, generate a URL.

424
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,260
They have a Linode command line application, so you can just point it at

425
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,660
a file and tell it to market as public and you just hit enter and it does the

426
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,900
upload, it publishes it in the object storage.

427
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,620
It generates the URL for you.

428
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,780
And then I just dropped that right there in the show notes.

429
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,220
It's really slick.

430
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,860
Linode.com slash SSH.

431
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,580
Go there, get a hundred dollars, 60 day credit for a new

432
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,340
account and support the show.

433
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,660
That's Linode.com slash SSH and thanks to Linode for sponsoring

434
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,060
the self-hosted podcast.

435
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,020
Thank you indeed.

436
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,260
Push notifications.

437
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,300
This is something that has been a solved problem for a long time.

438
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,420
And somebody asked me in, in the self-hosted discord last week, how I

439
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,500
handle push notifications and I thought, well, doesn't everyone just use pushover?

440
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
I actually never have, I have heard of it.

441
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,700
I have to be honest.

442
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,340
I've never really thought of what a great use case would be other than possibly

443
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,380
alerts from some systems, some software.

444
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,940
Alerts is the primary use case.

445
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,020
I would say for a while, actually I was using it for home assistant notifications.

446
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,140
I also wrote a little script, which is on GitHub under the

447
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,700
name Ironic Badger slash bootlace.

448
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:05,420
A little Python script, which lets you send notifications from a Linux or any,

449
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,340
any Python capable system, I suppose.

450
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,060
What I use that for is to announce when my Linux boxes are booted.

451
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,820
So my remote server at my dad's house in England, for example, every time

452
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:21,460
that boots, the at reboot cron job is to call bootlace, which sends me a push

453
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,860
over notification, and that's really useful for a remote server.

454
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,140
You kind of piqued my attention there with the system D service.

455
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:34,100
So a service that I have on every box I essentially deploy now is a system D

456
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:43,020
unit that creates a self repairing SSH tunnel back to a Linode machine of mine

457
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,340
that is always on, always persistent.

458
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:51,340
So I could jump to machines from that one VPS, wherever I'm at.

459
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,900
Does that make sense?

460
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,900
You follow me, a jump post or a bastion type server, right.

461
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,300
And where I could see an advantage here is if there was a way within that

462
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,220
setup to generate an alert, when that tunnel has con has gone down or something,

463
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,580
if there's a way to hook in at that level of the Linux system, well, guess what?

464
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
I wrote a blog post.

465
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,100
Oh, Alex, that's perfect.

466
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,220
LinkedIn, the show notes, it uses my bootlace script, which was one of my sort

467
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,500
of junior programming assignments at, uh, at university.

468
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,540
So, uh, it just, you need to generate a couple of tokens from the push over

469
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,420
interface, and then once you've got those tokens, you just add it to your cron

470
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,100
with the at reboot to start with, and then just call the script from there.

471
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,220
It looks like at the core of it, you can generate a push notification just

472
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,540
by presenting the token, the user and calling a certain URL.

473
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,820
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

474
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,780
So push over, have an API, which when I wrote this tool, you know, several years

475
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,860
ago, there wasn't a lot in this space.

476
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,780
Push over's API was a lot more basic too.

477
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:01,020
Whereas now, if you go to the pusher of a website and have a look at their API

478
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,620
documentation, you can call this thing using curl from the command line, or you

479
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,300
can use Pearl, Ruby, PHP.

480
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,860
They've got a whole bunch of documentation, which, you know, curls installed on every

481
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,780
system, so that might be the way to go.

482
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,300
Chris.

483
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,100
Pretty neat.

484
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,500
All right.

485
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,420
I will give it a look.

486
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,500
I've heard of it before, and now that it's gotten your recommendation, I

487
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,820
think it's worth a look.

488
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:28,100
I posted this blog post in the discord and, uh, straight away, as is always the

489
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,620
way somebody said, why didn't you do it this way?

490
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,580
And I'm like, well, I didn't know about this way.

491
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,940
And this was, uh, rock Cedars, Roxas, Roxas, I'm sorry.

492
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,020
One of our listeners from Norway, anyway, he's very active in the discord.

493
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,620
Lovely chap.

494
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:49,340
He gave me a link to a GitHub repo called Karen see app rise, and that is

495
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,020
in the show notes as a link.

496
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:58,620
And this thing is like the universal notification library for literally

497
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,260
anything you'd want to do.

498
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,100
You can send messages to me.

499
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:08,580
Twitter, Facebook, XBMC, Slack pushover is one of those funnily enough.

500
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,340
Push bullets.

501
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:14,220
Another one next cloud, uh, matter most if this, then that.

502
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:21,100
So you could have an if this, then that event trigger when your server uses app

503
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,740
price, which you could then put in a script when it reboots and it's fantastic.

504
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,860
It sounds cliche, but I really like that.

505
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,820
You can send it to Slack because then I actually will see it.

506
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,940
I have to have that up every day anyways.

507
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,580
So I don't know whether it's because I've heard it so many times

508
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,700
with that little, but it does.

509
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,660
Yeah.

510
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,100
That little three dot noise it makes.

511
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,220
Oh, does it trigger you?

512
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,060
Does it get you?

513
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,180
Gives me nightmares.

514
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,780
Yeah.

515
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,180
Yeah.

516
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,820
Yeah, I know.

517
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,460
I, I've actually muted it.

518
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,860
So, you know, what have you and I said a lot, I don't know how many people have

519
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,100
said it on the show, but you and I have said a lot that somebody should create

520
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,300
a store and just take these.

521
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:09,180
Tasmoto compatible devices and pre flash them and start selling them as a product.

522
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,780
In fact, we've even said, maybe we should just do it.

523
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,100
Dang it.

524
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,340
Maybe we should just do it.

525
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,300
Well, a listener out there in the self-hosted community has taken it upon

526
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,500
himself to do just that.

527
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,500
And he has launched cloud free dot shop.

528
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,380
And it looks like one of the first things he's done is add a

529
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,980
cloud-free smart plug.

530
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,300
Check this thing out.

531
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,580
Okay.

532
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:35,460
So he's created it for $9 and he's pre flashed it was with Tasmota.

533
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,620
And, uh, it's essentially just set as a base image ready to go.

534
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,980
And he reached out to you, didn't he?

535
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,260
Via the discord again.

536
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:42,500
Yes.

537
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,740
All good things apparently start on discord this week.

538
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,660
So David reached out to me via discord and said, Hey, thanks for the great idea.

539
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,820
I've, I've turned your great idea into my next big thing.

540
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,420
I think he's at college, so some of, some of the funds from this for him, for

541
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,380
example, will go to towards his college fees, tuition, I suppose you call it here.

542
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:01,740
Don't you?

543
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,860
Now here's the question, Alex, did he give you a hookup for the audience?

544
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,820
He did indeed.

545
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,940
You can support the show by using the coupon code self-hosted at checkout.

546
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,300
That's all on word self-hosted.

547
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,540
Well, that's great.

548
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,500
That's really cool.

549
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,860
He says he's got a lot in stock too.

550
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,260
I, uh, I think this is nice because the no cloud forever.

551
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,900
Pair directly with home assistant via MQTT.

552
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,580
That is my kind of language right there.

553
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,700
Just imagine taking one of these things out of the box and it never, ever talks

554
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,980
to anything outside your house ever in its entire life.

555
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,460
That's like going back 10, 15 years, you know, now we've got toasters

556
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,820
that talk to the cloud.

557
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,740
We've got fridges, smart plugs, light bulbs, you name it.

558
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,380
This thing will be 100% owned by you.

559
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,020
There's no way you're going to be able to do that.

560
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,740
And owned by you, there's no business models at play your data.

561
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,980
I mean, I don't know what companies are doing with my power socket, turning

562
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:01,860
on and off schedule anyway, but I suppose meta metadata is, is, is powerful.

563
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,260
So yeah, even just knowing when you're home and active is useful.

564
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,380
Yeah, I suppose so.

565
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,580
And then there's the angle of you, this, this device is yours until

566
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,980
it physically stops working.

567
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:17,940
Whereas as we've seen with many different IOT vendors, they can basically cut

568
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,620
you off at any moment that their business model decides, right.

569
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,780
And when it comes to something in the home, you know, that's,

570
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,060
that is a big deal for me.

571
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,860
I still have a few of those TP links that work great, but I would imagine.

572
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,100
I would never be able to set them up again if I had to, for some

573
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,580
reason, and TP link had pulled the, uh, the, the Casa app or whatever.

574
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,460
Where's the incentive for TP link.

575
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,580
If you haven't bought a new physical piece of hardware in 20 years,

576
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,820
that'd be a record for me.

577
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,340
I meant from them, like it's, it's the planned obsolescence

578
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,020
model, literally in action.

579
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,660
So while we're talking about hardware, there was that group

580
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,140
by for the power monitoring PI.

581
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,220
That's right.

582
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,460
Yeah.

583
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,220
I almost forgot.

584
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,020
Uh, and I honestly did forget last episode.

585
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,700
So I'm very sorry, David, two Davids, this is a different David.

586
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,140
This is the power monitoring David I'm talking about.

587
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:11,940
So he set up a website over at power-monitor.dallbrecht.tech that

588
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,540
that link is in the show notes because I completely butchered that, but this

589
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,260
is now essentially a web store.

590
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,700
You can go and buy your DIY power monitor kit for $30.

591
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,780
What the group by form that you all filled out enabled us to do was, well,

592
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,180
I say us David's done all the work.

593
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,180
All I did was literally give, give him a plug.

594
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,700
What David's done is he's actually built he's he's known how many

595
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,740
orders are going to come in.

596
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,380
Approximately, and he's been able to order all those components in, put

597
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,340
them in little baggies, design a custom PCB.

598
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,860
So everything that you need is over at that link in the show notes.

599
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,300
You can buy the, um, the CT clamps, the current transformer clamps, the

600
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,060
things that actually do the reading of the power, um, you can buy the

601
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,980
power adapters as well as the actual power monitor kit itself.

602
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,740
So total cost I would imagine would be in the region of a hundred bucks.

603
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,980
By the time you've got everything set up, you've got the power

604
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,380
time, you've got everything that you need.

605
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,860
The actual power monitoring kit itself is $30 as priced on the website.

606
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,500
He gave me a code that was for all of the self-hosted people that were

607
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,740
part of the group by to get an exclusive $10 off.

608
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,220
Now we don't make anything from this.

609
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,100
This isn't a sponsorship or anything like that.

610
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,340
It's literally just a cool project.

611
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,780
I saw on Reddit, which I got in touch with the author and here we are.

612
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,220
The coupon code is all one word self-hosted.

613
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,020
It's actually kind of cool that the community is working

614
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,740
on these hardware projects and either you're reaching out to them

615
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,980
or they're reaching out to us and we're chatting and getting details

616
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,740
and they're creating codes for our audience.

617
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,780
I mean, that's pretty cool, man.

618
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:54,380
Well, I think we're in an interesting kind of time for open source.

619
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,060
I was listening to a point that you and Mike made in Coder this week about

620
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:04,180
how VS code is kind of the universal development operating system, if you

621
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,420
like, that kind of struck a chord with me.

622
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,420
Like I've stopped fussing with my tools now.

623
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,980
I kind of, I just use VS code everywhere.

624
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,660
And I get on with real work far more often because I'm not chopping

625
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,780
and changing the whole time.

626
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,260
Yeah.

627
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,220
And I think that that shift has, has opened it up to a lot more people who

628
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,660
are also hardware tinkerers and software tinkerers, and they're bringing these

629
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,220
two passions together and if they're doing it from a Windows 10 machine with

630
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,220
WSL, it's no big deal.

631
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,740
It's just, it's totally normal now.

632
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,180
It's not just only people on Linux that can know how to tell them that

633
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,980
into a USB device, you know, it's opening it up to more people.

634
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,420
And I think that's pretty awesome too.

635
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,980
I have a question that I put out there, and if you have an answer,

636
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,740
self-hosted.show slash contact or tweet me at Chris Lass.

637
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,500
I have a DC powered, it's a awning system.

638
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,420
It goes, you know, brings my RV awning out and then you push down

639
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,220
and it brings my RV awning in.

640
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,900
So it's like a rocker switch and it's a DC power system that powers the motor.

641
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:07,060
I had to, before the show today, drive home, unlock my front door, sit there

642
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:12,100
and hold the button down so that my awning would come in and then close

643
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,980
the door, lock my RV back up and drive back down to the studio because the

644
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,740
wind just randomly started picking up above 30 miles per hour and that's

645
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,220
enough to really damage something like that.

646
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:27,140
Cause it's basically like a huge wing alongside of my RV and it just, as I'm

647
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,660
driving there, I'm thinking to myself, there has got to be a way to either

648
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,700
make this accessible via home assistant.

649
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,740
So I could just remote into home assistant and trigger it, or even like

650
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,660
a sensor, like a wind sensor could trigger it, which is how they do it on

651
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,620
newer RVs that have fancy awnings.

652
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,820
They have wind sensors built in.

653
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,700
Is it a low voltage switch?

654
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,540
It must be.

655
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:54,660
I'm not sure because what I do for my garage door is I have a, uh, what's it

656
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:00,260
called a SONOFF SV, SONOFF safe voltage, I think is what it stands for.

657
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,140
And this will do like 12 or 24 volts or something like that.

658
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,180
Don't quote me on that.

659
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,060
I think it's that region anyway.

660
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,380
Um, maybe it's five, I think it's five volts.

661
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,980
I'm sure this must be 12 volts what I'm working with.

662
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,660
And using ESP home, I'm able to set a switch to stay open or closed for a

663
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,740
certain amount of time in software, you know, with a delay or something like that.

664
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,940
If I had a contact sensor, so I knew it was, yeah, that'd be tricky because

665
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,340
you have to hold it just for a certain time to open or close it.

666
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,060
That is tricky.

667
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,740
Well, you know how long that is, right?

668
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,300
So you just program in hold button for 7.2 seconds or something.

669
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:32,860
Yeah.

670
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,780
And it will just keep the relay close for that length of time.

671
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,300
You come up here, let's wire it in.

672
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,860
I love other suggestions to self hosted that show slash contact.

673
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,860
Maybe there's a solution there cause I'd love to solve it.

674
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:48,420
I kind of started to, um, pull back on the RV automation stuff.

675
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,020
Like I thought maybe I'd taken it far enough.

676
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,340
And then I came across a dude who's automated like everything, every bay

677
00:34:54,340 --> 00:35:00,340
door, flushing his tanks, everything's automated, everything's automated.

678
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,060
And then I thought, okay, there's something to aspire to.

679
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,260
I got to get ahold of that guy.

680
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,620
Here is motivation enough for home for home automation.

681
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,300
Anything that gets you further away from your own poop.

682
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,540
No kidding.

683
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,060
You don't want to even know the stories, Alex.

684
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,620
You really don't.

685
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,620
I'm now imagining the absolute worst case scenarios.

686
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:23,020
So I'm going to try to get ahold of that guy, uh, and get some ideas from him.

687
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,660
Uh, I know this is something that's developing more.

688
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,500
I'm seeing more and more people talk about it.

689
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,580
People have contacted me.

690
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,060
It's a thing.

691
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,660
So there's, they're selling them like crazy.

692
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,940
The RVs right now, some of them are nerds buying them and they want

693
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,340
to do crazy things like automation.

694
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,820
Now there are a couple of other options for people who

695
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,980
wanted to do power monitoring.

696
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,540
I actually set one up about three months ago from circuit

697
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,500
set up.us and they make, uh, an integrated board.

698
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,460
You can buy, you know, pre-made pre-soldered board, which

699
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,980
connects up to an ESP 32.

700
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,940
This thing sells for about $70 and that gives you six channels of monitoring.

701
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,100
So it's, you know, 60 ish 65.

702
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,580
So it's about $70 for the board.

703
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,980
CT clamps are again, about 10 bucks, same as the, um, other group buy products.

704
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:17,900
That we talked about with David and, um, this thing, I'll tell you what, because

705
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,540
it's just running on the node MCU, okay.

706
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,180
The ESP 32 variant, it's been solid, really, really good.

707
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,780
And I have it connected to my AC units.

708
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:33,380
And so in my home assistant, you know, AC cards, I'm able to get real-time

709
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:39,260
information about how many Watts each AC unit is pulling and, and then I use

710
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:44,780
that against my utility, you know, the electricity cost times that by kilowatt

711
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:50,340
hours, whatever, and so I can see I've spent exactly $1.83 on air conditioning

712
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:55,900
today, it's actually not as bad when you do the actual math, I'm like, yeah, I'd

713
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,380
pay two bucks to be really comfortable.

714
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:57,960
Yep.

715
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,520
Yeah.

716
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:05,060
Now the power draw and whatnot, that's a whole other, uh, discussion, but you're

717
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,700
probably going to have a lot more to talk about than that, but I'm going to

718
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,060
you're probably going to have a lot more to talk about that in the future, I'd

719
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,560
imagine.

720
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,500
Yeah, I think so.

721
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,420
I mean, that particular one was inspired by a video over on Digiblur's YouTube

722
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,820
channel, which there's a link to in the show notes, but I had some other

723
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,020
listeners write in when I mentioned I was going to do a sort of mini roundup

724
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,780
of the energy monitoring options, open energy monitor.org.

725
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,780
Now this thing is super duper cool.

726
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,940
Does exactly what it says on the tin.

727
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,820
It lets you monitor things that consume or create energy.

728
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,820
So solar is supported, EV charging, you can monitor your heat pump.

729
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,660
They have all sorts of different things, uh, sort of like recommended builds

730
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,420
almost, so if you go over to their shop, they have a bunch of different options

731
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,740
that you can buy, you know, there's Raspberry Pi shields, web connected

732
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:02,660
base stations, man, if you're a nerd, this is right up your street.

733
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,620
Now this one happens to be based in the UK.

734
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,140
So if that matters to you, then, uh, there's another option for you there.

735
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,580
They also have guides though, even if you don't want to buy anything that

736
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,620
could be really useful, including integrating them with Node-RED or MQTT.

737
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:22,980
So this is interesting because I very, very much would like to get as detailed

738
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,700
as possible insights into what is drawing power.

739
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:31,300
I was out in the woods just a couple of weeks ago and my system is using 500

740
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,220
Watts of power and I don't have anything unusual on my fridge isn't running.

741
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,260
I I'm not running anything strange, but all of a sudden 500 Watts

742
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,220
of power being consumed.

743
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,660
What the hell is using 500 Watts?

744
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,180
You didn't buy one of those new Nvidia GPUs did you?

745
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,020
I never did figure out what it was actually.

746
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,660
It just eventually stopped.

747
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,220
Whatever it was, it just stopped.

748
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,820
Oh, oh, and then the night before you see, cause we were a little rust.

749
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,020
We were a little rusty the night before we had left the water heater in electric

750
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,860
mode and it draws like 900 Watts while it's heating the tank and that

751
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,380
kept going all night long, a little dashboard, you know, a little bit

752
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,900
of information would go a long ways here.

753
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,900
This is so cool.

754
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,220
So open energy monitor.org.

755
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,820
We'll have a link in the show notes, but I'm just looking at the guides

756
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,500
alone, even though I don't buy a single thing, this could really be helpful.

757
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,060
Yeah.

758
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,980
Now the fundamental thing about all three of these different options is

759
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,780
that they all pretty much utilize.

760
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,180
Largely speaking the same technology.

761
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:30,780
They're using these CT clamps and these are little transformers that basically

762
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,100
clip around an electric cable, monitor the electric field going through that

763
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:40,500
cable and outputs a very low voltage, which you're, you can use a headphone

764
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,740
jack or something on the other end of the CT clamp and the chip will monitor

765
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,420
the voltage coming off of the clamp.

766
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,500
And then you can extrapolate from those pieces of information, how

767
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,260
many amps are being drawn and that's it.

768
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,860
That's really cool.

769
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,100
Boy, I've gotten some good stuff out of this episode.

770
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,900
Thank you, Alex.

771
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,340
And thank you out there to the community who have been getting in touch with us.

772
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,780
Again, that's selfhosted.show slash discord or selfhosted.show slash

773
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,460
contact if you just want to fill out a form.

774
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,620
I want to thank a cloud guru for sponsoring this episode.

775
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,860
You know, a cloud guru now includes cloud playgrounds.

776
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:19,140
This means for Azure or AWS or the Google cloud platform, if you want to learn, if

777
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,300
you want to get hands-on experience, if you want to create sandboxes and try

778
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,940
things, experiment and break things, you can do that now on ACG's credit card, not

779
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:33,020
yours that has bit me once before one time and one time only, I accidentally

780
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,180
got myself like nearly a $300 bill because I was just trying to learn AWS.

781
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,180
This was a little while ago.

782
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,780
It was very embarrassing.

783
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,260
It was, it was really embarrassing.

784
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,620
A former colleague of mine has that beat though.

785
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:49,580
I think his bill was like three and a half thousand dollars in a month.

786
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,580
Oh my goodness.

787
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,220
Yeah.

788
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,860
Yeah, so you got to be careful with that.

789
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:53,540
Yeah.

790
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,420
So this, and it's a nice resource because it's built in with all of the other

791
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,540
things on the training platform.

792
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,780
It's just one click to a fast, fresh, disposable cloud environment at your

793
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,500
fingertips, go to a cloud guru.com to check it out.

794
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,900
And thanks to a cloud guru for sponsoring this episode of self-hosted.

795
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,700
Also, I'm going to give a shout out for our Twitter handle at

796
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,980
self-hosted show on Twitter.

797
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,620
You'll get announcements about new releases or anything news related to the

798
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,060
show.

799
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,300
It's also a great way to ping us for questions.

800
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,780
If you like to do the Twitter thing and you're not on the discord or don't want

801
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,340
to do a contact form, we got all the options these days, Alex.

802
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,460
So many options.

803
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,500
Well, why they're over there.

804
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,260
How do they follow you?

805
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,220
I'm at ironic Badger on Twitter.

806
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:29,780
Get that.

807
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,180
I'm at Chris Lass and the network is at Jupiter signal links for everything we

808
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:52,700
talked about today or at self-hosted.show slash 27.
