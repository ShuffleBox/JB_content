WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.480
Coming up on self-hosted. I'm slow cooking some servers Alex has self-hosted some AI with a nasty gotcha and a damp basement

00:08.480 --> 00:11.980
I'm Chris and I'm Alex and this is self-hosted 22

00:13.200 --> 00:19.680
I've got a 13 pound brisket in my fridge the only man I know who has hooked his barbecue up to home assistant

00:19.840 --> 00:24.560
Almost almost so I bought a signals below or something now

00:24.560 --> 00:31.200
They make a couple of products and I wanted to try and get this particular one hooked up to home assistant

00:31.280 --> 00:39.520
They have another more expensive model, which does work with home assistant. And so this one I tried to decompile the APK and reverse-engineer the

00:40.880 --> 00:45.400
Firebase database calls that it's making but no luck haven't been able to get it working

00:45.400 --> 00:50.480
So I just have to cope with using their crappy app, which it's fine. No, it's no good

00:50.480 --> 00:55.200
but this needs to be an obvious priority clearly we need to have you set everything else aside and

00:55.920 --> 00:57.560
Get this working

00:57.560 --> 01:02.560
There's no other option. It's really nice. So when you want to cook a big piece of meat in this

01:03.520 --> 01:08.160
In the Kamado Joe you have to you know temperature is everything when you're coming to barbecue and

01:08.880 --> 01:13.560
Keeping a nice stable temperature to get that lovely smoky flavor. That's really important

01:13.560 --> 01:18.280
I had lessons from Carl, you know, so, you know, it's important, you know, we'll get to this

01:18.280 --> 01:22.080
But that's what I'm doing is I'm just slow cooking my raspberry pies in the RV

01:22.080 --> 01:27.080
I'm not it's not a thermal getaway issue. It's a it's a slow cooking and it plan

01:27.080 --> 01:30.360
I don't know what you're talking about. Ooh, could you use them to do sous-vide?

01:31.440 --> 01:37.880
You absolutely could you just put some meat in a bag in my server in my server booth and and let it go

01:38.200 --> 01:40.280
that is unless I have to

01:41.000 --> 01:43.600
Deploy my current fix which I'll tell you about shortly

01:43.600 --> 01:50.560
but one of the things I did for this road trip that I'm on down here in Texas enjoying myself some barbecue myself was

01:50.920 --> 01:52.880
shut down my

01:52.880 --> 01:54.000
shinobi

01:54.000 --> 01:58.160
Home camera system, so I have no recordings right now. Everything's just

01:59.480 --> 02:01.480
streaming into the wind I guess and

02:02.480 --> 02:04.440
Before I fire things back up

02:04.440 --> 02:10.200
I think you may be changing my mind on what software I go with because while shinobi did the job

02:10.200 --> 02:17.000
I kind of had issues with it over time. I'd have to reboot and for those of you not familiar shinobi is a

02:17.840 --> 02:20.640
Closed-circuit capturing application. It's a web-based app

02:20.640 --> 02:27.220
It's a little strange to use but it gives you an ability to pull in all these RTSP feeds and camera feeds into a single

02:27.360 --> 02:31.600
Application. I have a sense Alex. I have a sense you may have found something better

02:31.600 --> 02:35.960
I was watching a video by the hookup YouTube channel and he

02:35.960 --> 02:42.480
Really piqued my interest in blue iris now blue iris is paid software

02:42.480 --> 02:47.320
It's $75 for a proper license, so I'll just get that out out the way up front

02:47.320 --> 02:51.320
You know, it's not free like shinobi in terms of cost, but it is self-hosted

02:51.360 --> 02:55.560
It is self-hosted, but it's not open source either. So, you know, there's a couple of trade-offs to make

02:56.000 --> 02:59.960
it's running fully offline fully on my LAN, you know, it's a

03:00.840 --> 03:02.840
local NVR software and

03:02.840 --> 03:05.760
What really piqued my interest was he

03:06.640 --> 03:08.400
set up

03:08.400 --> 03:10.040
artificial intelligence

03:10.040 --> 03:12.160
motion detection really now

03:12.160 --> 03:15.560
This is super cool AI motion detection

03:15.560 --> 03:21.920
In other words, the software is aware of what's in the picture and it's using image recognition to make that determination

03:22.600 --> 03:27.140
Correct. So when I first watched the video, I thought there's no way this is all local

03:27.640 --> 03:30.520
He must be leveraging some kind of a cloud API

03:30.520 --> 03:34.680
sending these photos off, you know to who knows where and

03:35.520 --> 03:36.720
I'm not interested

03:36.720 --> 03:44.640
but then I watched the video and realized that he was using deep stack AI and deep stack you can run in a container on

03:45.000 --> 03:46.920
your LAN and

03:46.920 --> 03:52.600
so what this thing does is you submit a JPEG to it and then it will apply its

03:53.240 --> 03:55.240
What you call it? I don't know what

03:55.240 --> 04:00.920
object recognition because from what I could see in there, it seems like it can determine the difference between

04:01.520 --> 04:05.680
Faces dogs all kinds of common objects that would be in a camera feed

04:05.680 --> 04:12.680
There is a list of objects it can detect and you know a short list of useful ones is stuff like car truck bus

04:13.520 --> 04:16.360
Person dog bear that kind of thing bear

04:17.640 --> 04:22.040
Bear is on the list. That's good up in the Pacific Northwest. Trust me. It's just funny

04:22.040 --> 04:26.080
And so I thought this is gonna be really hard to get working, but I'll give it a stab

04:26.080 --> 04:33.240
I'll set aside an evening and I'll get going. So JDM who was on the last episode, you know, the server builds dotnet guy

04:34.000 --> 04:36.360
He hooked me up with one of those HP

04:37.800 --> 04:39.800
Z I

04:40.320 --> 04:45.960
Can't remember the model name a HP box anyway, and it cost me about $100 and in this thing

04:45.960 --> 04:47.960
it has a dual core seller on and

04:47.960 --> 04:52.480
And most importantly it supports Intel quicksync

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
so this $90

04:55.880 --> 05:01.960
x86 system with 12 gigabytes of RAM and I bought a very cheap NVMe SSD. That's like

05:02.520 --> 05:07.140
60 gigs to put in there. So it was not booting off the spinning rust drive. It shipped with I

05:07.940 --> 05:12.860
Have an NVR system now that can support five cameras for $90

05:12.860 --> 05:18.500
Whoa, and how much storage like how long can you keep the footage with this? Did you have to add disk?

05:18.500 --> 05:24.300
Are you using the network storage? How is that part working? I have a USB 4 terabyte hard drive

05:24.300 --> 05:26.300
That's been sat in a drawer for about three years

05:26.940 --> 05:29.180
And I thought well may as well use it for something useful

05:29.300 --> 05:32.720
So I've just literally plugged in a USB hard drive into this desktop system

05:32.940 --> 05:35.580
There is room inside for a three and a half inch hard drive

05:35.580 --> 05:41.220
So I was kind of tempted to go and buy an easy store and throw it in there, but use what you got, right?

05:41.220 --> 05:45.260
Yeah, especially for something like this and then you could always build on it later

05:45.700 --> 05:52.700
well, we're talking about storage one of the things that impressed me when I was digging around and learning a little bit about blue iris and

05:53.660 --> 05:58.860
The hookups videos. He also mentions this it would seem that if your camera supports it

05:58.860 --> 06:03.380
You can do two types of video storage a low resolution

06:04.380 --> 06:07.580
maybe 15 frames a second 640 by

06:07.580 --> 06:13.180
You know 480 or whatever some really low-res video that you can store indefinitely forever

06:13.580 --> 06:16.580
You have that but then when the AI

06:17.100 --> 06:21.780
Detection kicks in and it notices something that is recognized

06:21.780 --> 06:29.060
It will flip over and keep a 4k copy or whatever your camera support of that particular moment in time

06:29.140 --> 06:33.580
So your stuff that has the action is in full glorious resolution

06:33.580 --> 06:41.020
And then your keep forever stuff is lower resolution and lower frame rate. Is that how you are using it with this box?

06:41.220 --> 06:46.880
Yeah, pretty much. They're called sub streams. So, you know, I have a 4k camera pointing at my driveway

06:47.300 --> 06:52.780
There's no reason to record 4k 24 7 that's just honestly stupid and a waste of energy

06:53.220 --> 06:57.580
but these cameras have hardware chips in them, which do the

06:58.460 --> 07:02.620
Video encoding in real time. So you actually get two streams out of this camera

07:02.620 --> 07:07.780
You get the 4k stream it can be either h264 or h265

07:07.780 --> 07:11.860
Which is great for file size and then you get a second sub stream as well

07:11.860 --> 07:16.540
which again comes out in h264 or 265 depending on what you set up and

07:17.500 --> 07:21.460
The resolution as you say of the sub stream. The second stream is much much lower

07:21.900 --> 07:28.300
So the SD stream is what we'll call the low-res stream. The SD stream is running pretty much all the time

07:28.300 --> 07:32.540
It has motion detection turned on so that's what's looking for motion in the frame. So

07:33.260 --> 07:37.940
What happens is motion is detected. It takes a JPEG still of that frame

07:38.860 --> 07:41.220
Sends that to the AI detection software

07:41.700 --> 07:44.380
The three pieces of software at work here. You've got blue iris

07:44.700 --> 07:51.060
You've got AI motion and then you've got deep stack. So deep stack is what does the image processing AI?

07:51.060 --> 07:59.460
motion is what reacts to the JPEGs coming in and sends the images off to deep stack and then

08:00.660 --> 08:05.540
Obviously blue iris is the CCTV NVR software. So AI motion

08:06.020 --> 08:13.520
Which is a small app which was written by someone the IP cam talk forums. I think his name is gentle pumpkin

08:14.620 --> 08:19.660
This app you can figure what you want the deep stack AI to be looking for

08:19.660 --> 08:22.140
so, you know cars bears trucks, etc, and

08:22.660 --> 08:30.220
Then once it detects a certain type of object in the frame, it will then and only then tell your

08:31.020 --> 08:36.820
Cameras to record the HD feed and you can set a pre record buffer of 5 10

08:37.220 --> 08:41.140
30 seconds if you want to so if you were sat there thinking oh, well

08:41.180 --> 08:43.580
Maybe it takes a bit of time for the images to process

08:43.660 --> 08:47.060
Am I not going to lose in the time it takes for that to happen up?

08:47.060 --> 08:52.420
Am I not going to lose the pizza guy coming down my driveway? No, you won't because you get the pre-record and it's all fine

08:52.420 --> 08:56.980
And it all just works, you know, that's the amazing thing about it. Is it just works. So

08:57.860 --> 09:03.900
one of the big things I missed after moving away from nest when I moved into this house early this year was

09:04.460 --> 09:09.580
You know that that really super simple interface of just swiping back through the timeline to see events and stuff like that

09:09.580 --> 09:14.780
And with blue iris, I have that again now and it's it's great. I've really missed it

09:14.780 --> 09:22.360
Yeah, there's a couple of cool modes for capturing stuff including what looks like a really nice UI for reviewing those motion events

09:22.580 --> 09:24.580
Pretty efficiently. Have you found that?

09:24.780 --> 09:30.220
Okay, I downloaded an app on my iPad that has been the best way to do that kind of stuff

09:30.580 --> 09:31.900
but one of the

09:31.900 --> 09:37.300
Better bits of blue iris is that it has a web interface so I can just log into you know

09:37.300 --> 09:39.300
IP address of HP server

09:39.300 --> 09:45.540
Colon port whatever and bring up the web interface and I have access through wire guard to my LAN

09:45.540 --> 09:49.100
Of course so I can just connect through a wire guard tunnel and do it that way wherever I am

09:49.500 --> 09:55.260
That that works really nicely, but I do have a bit of a confession to make about blue iris Chris

09:55.980 --> 09:57.980
It only runs on Windows

09:58.020 --> 10:04.540
Wait a minute, but doesn't the deep stack stuff run in a container on Linux? It does. It's a Windows Linux mix

10:04.540 --> 10:09.460
Yes. Yep. Well, I don't know if I want to deploy Windows just for that but at the same time

10:09.460 --> 10:15.540
It does look significantly better than shinobi. That's would you say maybe it's biggest downside for those that don't run?

10:15.540 --> 10:20.960
Oh, I mean, I don't know some people that it's not a big deal for sure. I'd say it's the biggest downside. Yeah

10:21.580 --> 10:24.100
the reason I ended up going that route in the end was

10:25.120 --> 10:28.260
Because of the fact that you want direct hardware

10:29.180 --> 10:33.580
Support for things like quicksync to make the the video transcoding or stuff like that

10:33.580 --> 10:35.720
You know not to CPU intensive

10:36.420 --> 10:41.500
You're gonna have a dedicated box for it. Anyway, let's say I wanted to put it on my server in the basement

10:41.500 --> 10:46.740
I would have either needed to buy a dedicated graphics card and pass that through to the Windows VM

10:47.060 --> 10:51.060
So that that can do the transcoding using envy ankle or whatever

10:51.540 --> 10:56.220
or I would need to buy a more modern CPU and put that in my server because I have

10:56.300 --> 11:02.620
Some old Xeons that don't have quicksync or I can spend 90 bucks put Windows on this thing and just forget about it

11:02.620 --> 11:05.640
Yeah, you did Windows 10. I have an old Windows 8

11:06.780 --> 11:10.340
Product key that I bought back in like 2013 or something

11:10.840 --> 11:16.700
And I just typed that in thinking this ain't gonna work and it did so, you know, I've got Windows 10 Pro for free

11:16.700 --> 11:20.660
I was getting pretty hyped, but that is a bummer. Yeah. Sorry about that

11:20.660 --> 11:25.420
Do you think deep stack would work with shinobi deep stack will work with anything that is a JPEG

11:25.420 --> 11:27.660
So all you need to feed to deep stack is

11:28.460 --> 11:30.020
an image

11:30.020 --> 11:32.940
Doesn't really matter what the problem is. The rest is shinobi

11:34.340 --> 11:37.700
It's a good it's a good app, but I just yeah

11:37.700 --> 11:43.300
I when it came time to reduce thermal load in the server booth. I thought yeah, this is one that has to go

11:43.300 --> 11:46.660
Well, there are a couple of others that perhaps you should try out, you know in the interest of science

11:47.260 --> 11:51.100
There's motion. I and zone minder. Yeah, I have looked at them. I

11:51.860 --> 11:56.440
Definitely need to give motion. I another fair shake zone minder

11:56.440 --> 12:04.400
I'm less impressed with but maybe it's improved recently. Yeah, I mean the worst thing about running Windows is that

12:05.080 --> 12:10.200
It's Windows and I don't really like running anywhere and I don't mean to come across as a you know

12:10.200 --> 12:16.560
A typical Linux kind of, you know, four legs good two legs bad sort of guy, but I just don't

12:17.280 --> 12:19.280
Feel the need to run it anywhere

12:19.480 --> 12:23.000
That said if I'm throwing it in a closet and forgetting about it the whole time

12:23.000 --> 12:30.560
Does it really matter probably not probably not no and if you were in the commercial space out in the you know

12:30.560 --> 12:32.760
real world with that at businesses running

12:33.520 --> 12:39.200
CCTV systems if they weren't appliances running Linux, they would be applications running on Windows boxes

12:39.200 --> 12:44.040
So you do see some of it out there in the real world? Yeah, there's nothing really better in the small to medium

12:44.440 --> 12:47.780
NVR space in my opinion. Yes, there's the unified thing

12:47.780 --> 12:54.200
But again, that's a proprietary ecosystem that you need to have their cloud key dream machine, whatever. They're calling it this week

12:55.200 --> 12:59.640
That's super expensive and the prices of their cameras are outrageous

12:59.920 --> 13:03.240
They might be good quality, but they are super duper expensive

13:03.380 --> 13:09.780
So, you know 70 bucks for blue iris supports up to 64 cameras and for me, obviously, I'm you know

13:09.780 --> 13:15.400
I'm only in the house. I'm not gonna get anywhere much much above 10, you know, and that's pushing it really, you know

13:15.400 --> 13:17.000
I bought one of those

13:17.000 --> 13:21.440
Doorbells, we had Morgan review a couple of weeks ago, but I bought the easy vis branded version of it

13:21.480 --> 13:28.360
Must say picture quality is fantastic on this thing and it plugged into blue iris. No problem with the RTSP feed

13:28.360 --> 13:34.560
So another vote for that doorbell really so who needs a ring when you can get an easy vis, huh?

13:34.560 --> 13:36.560
well an easy vis with a

13:36.800 --> 13:43.400
24-7 Windows box talking to a 24-7 Linux box running an artificial intelligence model to

13:43.400 --> 13:47.640
Decode your images apart from that. That's what we're all about here

13:47.640 --> 13:51.120
Right is taking something that is a commercial offering and enrolling it yourself

13:51.120 --> 13:53.480
And in this case you bought a commercial app to do it

13:53.480 --> 13:58.560
But you're still able to run it locally on premises, which I think is when it comes to video camera footage

13:58.560 --> 14:03.640
It's just so critical. I'm trading my time and effort for my data and convenience

14:03.800 --> 14:09.680
Yes, but this in particular is visual data of activities around your home and that to me

14:09.680 --> 14:15.280
Like yeah, I'll tell you like when I'm walking around in my house in the buck naked

14:15.560 --> 14:20.000
It crosses my mind when I see a camera out of the corner of my mind. I think to myself man

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I'm really glad that's not cloud connected right now

14:24.000 --> 14:25.800
Ain't no one gonna see that

14:25.800 --> 14:28.600
Right exactly just go ahead and delete that footage

14:29.120 --> 14:33.280
So easy vis is the maker of the doorbell you got and that does RTSP

14:33.280 --> 14:36.080
So you could in theory pull that into home assistant as well

14:36.080 --> 14:40.080
If you just wanted a Lovelace car just showing you the front door. Yep

14:40.080 --> 14:47.280
I can pull it into Lovelace and I do it works great. The the camera is like a weird like fisheye lens thing

14:47.280 --> 14:49.480
So that's kind of a trip getting used to that

14:49.480 --> 14:51.280
But I mean that's no big deal

14:51.280 --> 14:55.960
At least I can see whether those packages on my porch now without actually having to go and physically look

14:56.000 --> 15:00.800
Yeah, and I it sounds silly but when you're traveling like I am right now

15:00.800 --> 15:03.840
I have a camera at the studio at the door on the door and

15:03.840 --> 15:08.840
I love being able to just pull it up and check on it from time to time that particular camera, too

15:08.840 --> 15:13.040
I've intentionally made it possible for me to view when I'm away

15:13.200 --> 15:15.680
Yeah, I just love this at the studio that way when I get a package

15:15.680 --> 15:18.600
I know it's there and I can I can call up West I can say hey Wes

15:18.600 --> 15:20.600
Will you go grab that package for me?

15:22.600 --> 15:27.920
Now before you left you were really quite worried about the heat down in Texas, you know melting your pies

15:27.920 --> 15:33.840
How's that been? It has been tricky. In fact, I'd say it's been trickier than I

15:34.680 --> 15:41.600
Appreciated because it really starts with the solar system. I've gotten some good experience and I've learned a few tricks

15:42.160 --> 15:46.340
So I can run my air conditioning off of solar which feels like a hack

15:46.340 --> 15:48.560
It feels like a cheat code for nature

15:49.000 --> 15:54.920
But what I discovered when I'm running my air conditioners off of solar is when you invert

15:54.920 --> 15:59.640
That much of a load it generates a lot of heat

15:59.680 --> 16:05.520
so I'm already dealing with a heat issue in my server seat and now my electrical system is

16:06.640 --> 16:11.720
Struggling to stay cool as well. So the very system that powers the entire RV which I did not expect to be an issue

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
But when you start inverting a huge load

16:14.360 --> 16:21.920
There's safety mechanisms that kick in when the gear reaches 110 Fahrenheit and it starts an auto shutdown procedure where certain things

16:21.920 --> 16:25.880
Ironically, it wasn't the air conditioner, but certain things start shutting off

16:25.960 --> 16:33.220
How much load does your AC unit pull in how when they're both going it's it's about 2,200 watts

16:33.800 --> 16:37.840
It varies that's the same as to what my entire house uses for AC

16:39.040 --> 16:43.280
Well when they're both going full bore and I really mean, you know, like it's 100 degrees out. It's hot

16:43.280 --> 16:45.800
It's hot. Yeah when it's Texas heat. Yeah

16:46.800 --> 16:51.360
If I run just one and it's not I don't have it on high, you know high power mode

16:51.360 --> 16:57.080
I think it's around 700 watts. Okay. Well, that's still a lot but not you know

16:57.640 --> 17:02.480
2000 plus it generates quite a bit of heat. So I've come up with a human solution to this problem

17:03.240 --> 17:09.020
I've trained the boy on which bays of the RV to go open to create some some venting

17:10.960 --> 17:12.960
Hey Dylan

17:13.360 --> 17:17.760
Ventilation bays go open the ventilation bays and he runs out so you have to do when you're stopped obviously can't do it going

17:17.760 --> 17:21.880
Down the road, so he runs out. He opens up the bays and I kick on the air conditioning

17:21.880 --> 17:26.200
I had visions of some Keanu Reeves style speed stuff of hanging out the window

17:27.100 --> 17:32.660
Yeah, I'm holding on to his feet. He's hanging down the side of the RV as we're going down the road. It's tricky

17:32.660 --> 17:39.800
It's trickier than I expected because the batteries are near the drivetrain and so the drivetrain gets hot plus it's 100 degrees outside

17:40.320 --> 17:44.780
So there's just a lot of thermal pressure on everything and the server seats

17:44.780 --> 17:51.860
very warm during the day if I don't get ready for this get ready for these numbers if I don't

17:52.900 --> 17:55.340
Implement a cooling solution for the server seat

17:55.340 --> 18:00.700
I have seen the temperature in that booth get as high as 97 degrees Fahrenheit for the ambient air temperature

18:01.300 --> 18:04.940
For all the components in there, so I've been following this very closely

18:04.940 --> 18:09.660
Of course, I'm bringing all this data into home assistant and then I'm reviewing it each day to kind of see how bad it got

18:09.660 --> 18:12.700
I now have like five of these

18:12.700 --> 18:14.700
six in one

18:15.020 --> 18:16.620
multi-sensor from

18:16.620 --> 18:24.060
Aotec AEO tech they're kind of expensive. They're like almost 60 bucks each, but they track light UV motion

18:24.820 --> 18:31.620
vibration temperature all that kind of stuff and it has a cool temperature sensor where it's actually like scanning using

18:32.260 --> 18:33.260
infrared

18:33.260 --> 18:38.860
So it actually it gets it's it's a really cool way to get ambient temperature and the pies themselves

18:38.860 --> 18:45.300
Start to throttle when they reach 80 degrees Celsius and they don't really

18:45.860 --> 18:48.700
Go above 85 degrees Celsius without shutting down

18:49.540 --> 18:55.860
Amazingly, they continue to function everything continues to work even transcoding and watching video

18:55.860 --> 19:03.660
All that stuff is still working and I have implemented another human solution here where I have tillin crack the booth

19:03.660 --> 19:05.020
he just he

19:05.020 --> 19:10.260
Removes the cover on the top of the booth and creates a little bit of airflow and that cools it down

19:10.260 --> 19:12.860
But then we have to seal it back up to turn it into a bed every single night

19:12.860 --> 19:18.140
So then if the temperature builds back up each day and then we crack it to cool it

19:18.140 --> 19:22.740
Have you thought about a vent in the side of the thing or something? Yeah, we're looking right now at ways to vent it

19:22.740 --> 19:27.920
It's tricky because it's wrapped in cloth and it would be really gaudy and it's also right as you enter the RV

19:27.920 --> 19:31.580
So if I put it right in the side of the booth, it'd just be right as you walk in you'd see it

19:31.580 --> 19:37.100
Very ugly. I am looking at other options. I've just got visions of Dylan going to sit down and you've been like, nope

19:37.100 --> 19:41.080
Sorry, son. You can't sit down today. The servers have got a breathe. It's a hot seat. Yeah

19:44.620 --> 19:48.580
It's so bad, so I ended up scouring the internet to find

19:49.180 --> 19:52.220
The various ways to take the temperature of a Raspberry Pi

19:52.860 --> 19:57.500
Because a lot of the built-in things like LM sensors that you would normally use on a Linux box

19:57.500 --> 19:58.800
They don't work on a Raspberry Pi

19:58.800 --> 20:02.180
I got a little script and I'll link the the details in it

20:02.180 --> 20:09.820
but essentially if if you just cat sys class thermal thermal zone zero slash temp if you just cat that file you'll get back a

20:09.820 --> 20:12.060
number and it'll be like

20:14.220 --> 20:20.340
54,530 and what that actually is is the temperature of your CPU. So when I ran it it was

20:20.340 --> 20:28.340
Fifty four thousand five hundred and thirty was the number that came back. Well, that is fifty four degrees Celsius fifty four point

20:28.860 --> 20:33.900
Five degrees Celsius and so I know that right now as we do this

20:33.900 --> 20:41.660
My pie is just a little under sixty degrees Celsius. So it's not in the dangerous throttling zone yet, and I just keep an eye on that

20:42.780 --> 20:44.780
Basically, I'm running it on the red line

20:44.780 --> 20:51.460
During this entire trip and I have a few ideas about relocating or using ventilate ventilation when I get back

20:51.460 --> 20:58.260
I mean, this is production mode, you know, the real solution here is just don't go to Texas in June. No kidding

20:58.380 --> 21:01.420
This was a non problem in the Pacific Northwest

21:01.700 --> 21:05.500
I'm only here for a few more days and then I'm making my way north again

21:05.500 --> 21:10.260
And it shouldn't be as much of an issue and then I think when I do eventually make it back to the Pacific Northwest

21:10.460 --> 21:14.460
And get to my home base. I will probably retool this setup

21:14.460 --> 21:20.220
And move it to a different spot that has ventilation because you had a spare Raspberry Pi ready to go and everything like that

21:20.220 --> 21:21.380
I did. Yep

21:21.380 --> 21:24.660
I was gonna be surprised if it was the pie that went first, you know

21:24.660 --> 21:30.140
Not a power supply or you know switch or something instead, but I think I think that's a very fair point

21:30.140 --> 21:35.240
In fact, that was the realization I had as the temperature started to rise as I realized

21:35.240 --> 21:41.120
Oh, you know, it's gonna pop first will be the power bricks or my firewall or my Wi-Fi

21:41.740 --> 21:43.780
That's what's gonna go first not the Raspberry Pi

21:43.780 --> 21:49.020
I mean if you look at you know, any Intel system these days, you know any Intel laptop

21:49.300 --> 21:54.740
They'll go up to 100 Celsius, you know almost instantly and so the I mean these things can cope

21:54.740 --> 21:59.220
I mean a pie isn't probably built to the same tolerances as a high-end Intel chip

21:59.220 --> 22:03.340
But you know these things can cope with some heat the circuit boards and stuff like that

22:03.340 --> 22:08.500
They're not they're not gonna melt or anything like that, but power supplies. They really really don't like heat

22:08.540 --> 22:10.860
Yeah, I'm a little nervous to be honest

22:10.860 --> 22:16.640
I have to give a hearty plug again for these AO tech multi sensors. I've talked about them on the show before

22:17.260 --> 22:23.220
They're not the cheapest z-wave temperature sensors. You can find out there, but I have these now

22:23.220 --> 22:26.060
I have one in my water bay. I have one in my electrical bay

22:26.060 --> 22:30.100
I have one in the bedroom one in the living room. I have one in the server booth

22:30.100 --> 22:34.180
I have one up front where I drive and I all of them

22:35.060 --> 22:36.060
flawlessly

22:36.060 --> 22:43.640
Report into home assistant and what is fantastic about them is you can run them with continuous power with with USB

22:43.640 --> 22:50.500
It's just you know, like super low voltage and then you get continuous one every second reporting if you'd like

22:50.940 --> 22:56.340
Or you can pop a like a Duracell lithium ion battery, you know those little removable lithium ions

22:56.620 --> 23:01.660
It has a spot for one of those you can pop in there and you can adjust the update interval by default when you run off

23:01.660 --> 23:02.580
Battery, it's much slower

23:02.580 --> 23:07.940
It's like every 15 minutes to save battery life and then the thing runs for like a year off one of those batteries

23:08.460 --> 23:13.880
Nice. I really like these things you do have to have z-wave, but they're just fantastic

23:14.340 --> 23:19.580
What I'm thinking is I'd love to put one under my deck or something outside that somewhere kind of vaguely sheltered

23:19.900 --> 23:22.560
Just to get you know an outdoor weather station going or something

23:22.780 --> 23:25.440
Are they suitable to go outside or are they indoor only?

23:25.440 --> 23:29.740
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if you could but on their box now they think about it

23:29.740 --> 23:32.580
Does it does say indoor use only I don't know man

23:32.580 --> 23:35.540
I mean once you have the power in there and you seal it up

23:35.540 --> 23:39.020
It's they're pretty simple if you had it under your deck where it was out of the rain

23:39.020 --> 23:44.460
I think you'd probably be fine because I have two of them in my outside bays and one of them is my water bay

23:44.620 --> 23:49.620
Which is frequently exposed to the elements because I have incoming, you know hoses and stuff

23:49.880 --> 23:52.840
So you might be like get away with it cuz I'm I'm doing it

23:52.840 --> 23:55.620
Basically, it's pretty great and I just want to give them a hardy plug

23:55.620 --> 23:59.300
So I'll put it in the show notes. No, you know, I get no affiliate or anything like that

23:59.300 --> 24:01.840
But boy have they just worked really solid for me

24:02.100 --> 24:05.820
What I learned is you can use motion sensors for a lot of the things

24:05.820 --> 24:10.740
I was using cameras for for presence awareness and and automations. It's pretty great

24:10.740 --> 24:15.340
Well, particularly in your world where you know one footstep probably shakes the entire house

24:16.340 --> 24:17.980
Or at least I'm running kids, right?

24:17.980 --> 24:26.140
Like I I see a future where when several of these sensors are reading a certain vibration level. I just automate

24:26.140 --> 24:34.180
Something I I started playing with this for a brief period of time where if there has been motion or or not motion

24:34.180 --> 24:35.540
but vibration

24:35.540 --> 24:40.760
Disable all of the automatic lights and heater stuff because one of the tricks about home assistant going down the road

24:40.760 --> 24:45.500
Which I've been dealing with on this trip. It does not automatically update its location

24:45.500 --> 24:52.740
In fact, nothing does nobody builds these home products for a home that moves the echo product doesn't update Google stuff

24:52.740 --> 24:57.980
Doesn't auto update its location. You think you have a smart tube on your on your counter and it

24:58.500 --> 25:00.500
For the life of it still thinks I'm in Washington

25:00.900 --> 25:04.460
but also home assistant doesn't update its location automatically and

25:04.860 --> 25:09.180
Heaven forbid you've ever specified it via the YAML file because then you can't even update it in the web UI

25:09.500 --> 25:14.540
So I've had to go through and like every time zone change. I have to go through and fix that stuff

25:14.540 --> 25:19.820
So my automations for sunrise and sunset and all that still work, right? That really is a first-world problem, bro

25:19.820 --> 25:22.140
Yeah, who you tell it I know

25:23.140 --> 25:29.380
Doesn't mean doesn't mean I don't enjoy them, you know, it's it's these little challenges that kind of make this fun

25:29.380 --> 25:34.180
I mean, I know you you were kind of playing around with trying to get it right in your basement recently because you got a wet

25:34.180 --> 25:39.180
Basement. Yep, when we first moved in actually one of the first episodes where I was in this house

25:39.900 --> 25:45.980
Around the turn of this year. We talked a little bit about how I was monitoring the temperature and humidity in my basement

25:45.980 --> 25:52.020
now it's not a finished basement, but it's important to me because that's where my primary server, you know with the

25:52.900 --> 25:54.820
15 or whatever is

25:54.820 --> 25:57.700
13 spinning hard drives in is down there

25:57.700 --> 26:03.860
So, you know if it's you know, sitting at 90 plus percent humidity for a month. I want to know about it

26:04.340 --> 26:07.500
well, the rainy season has started here in Raleigh and

26:08.700 --> 26:10.460
unfortunately the

26:10.460 --> 26:14.740
Basement at Casa del Crech Mar is getting a little bit humid

26:14.740 --> 26:16.740
Got a wet basement

26:17.620 --> 26:21.420
How bad is it? Like when you say a little humid? Is it like yeah 90% plus?

26:21.420 --> 26:26.100
Oh, so there could be even moisture like collecting in areas and maybe mold starting to develop

26:26.220 --> 26:32.260
Yep, you can actually correlate in Grafana when I when I put some of the six month views into the discord

26:32.260 --> 26:35.100
I was talking with some of the guys in there about it and

26:35.700 --> 26:37.780
You could correlate storms

26:38.460 --> 26:39.420
with

26:39.420 --> 26:43.140
Spikes in humidity in my basement. Obviously is the ground around the house gets wet

26:43.140 --> 26:46.940
It's got to come up somewhere, which I just thought was super interesting

26:46.940 --> 26:51.220
And so I went on the Costco's website and bought a hundred and fifty dollar dumb

26:52.260 --> 26:57.760
Dehumidifier as in dumb as in it doesn't have any Wi-Fi enabled nonsense or anything like that

26:58.740 --> 27:01.340
And I've just thrown it down in the basement forgetting about it

27:01.380 --> 27:05.460
But I didn't really want it running 24 hours a day because it's quite loud

27:05.620 --> 27:10.780
It's directly underneath where my home offices so I could hear it through the floor. Oh, that's annoying

27:10.780 --> 27:17.100
Yeah, and so I just thought hmm. I've got the technology to solve this haven't I I found one of my tasmota smart plugs

27:17.100 --> 27:18.620
I wasn't using I

27:18.620 --> 27:25.620
Threw the dehumidifier on there and then I put a home assistant automation to run the dehumidifier between 7 p.m

27:25.620 --> 27:29.860
And 7 a.m. And that's worked great. Have you thought about getting a

27:30.620 --> 27:34.380
Sensor for humidity and then just running it when humidity is at a certain level

27:34.740 --> 27:38.340
that's how I know the basement was at 90 plus percent was because the

27:38.340 --> 27:46.820
The temperature sensor I have is one of those esp8 to 66 d1 minis connected to I think it's a dht22

27:47.420 --> 27:53.900
Which just monitor temperature and humidity that's all they do and that just reports back into the home assistant API

27:53.900 --> 27:57.220
I flash that one using ESP home a little while ago

27:57.700 --> 28:05.860
Which it just works really really reliably really really well. And so yes, you know in time. I will have the humidifier

28:05.860 --> 28:12.020
The dehumidifier, sorry, I will have that only come on. I mean it has its own

28:13.060 --> 28:17.820
Sensors built in once it detects the basement is you know, like 45% or whatever your target is

28:17.820 --> 28:23.740
It will shut itself off, but I also only want it running overnight when I'm not anywhere near it. So

28:24.400 --> 28:26.400
You know for me, I think

28:26.780 --> 28:33.380
That's the best of both worlds the dumb appliance has been made vaguely smart to fit my own personal requirements

28:33.380 --> 28:38.740
And then it uses its own thing inside itself to turn itself on only when needed. So hmm

28:38.740 --> 28:42.540
Yeah, that is a nice combo a way to use some of its built-in sensors

28:42.540 --> 28:48.220
I really whenever I can now and I'm buying something like a fan or a heater or a dehumidifier

28:48.220 --> 28:51.220
I just look for something that just has a dumb switch on

28:51.700 --> 28:57.380
That I can just leave in the on position and then really power cycle it with a smart switch. Mm-hmm

28:58.140 --> 29:02.700
Speaking of smart outlets some of the designers at github have obviously been a bit bored recently

29:02.700 --> 29:07.340
Oh, I got to admit I didn't realize they'd done a design change

29:07.340 --> 29:10.620
I mostly just interact with github from the command line

29:10.620 --> 29:15.580
So and also I don't think it's as bad on my screen because I'm on a laptop screen

29:15.580 --> 29:22.060
It's quite a subtle change, but it was I think the same day as Apple's keynote where they announced the big sir

29:22.060 --> 29:27.260
You know the the big design refresh with the rounded corners and the transparency and the magic

29:28.060 --> 29:31.100
yeah, then comes the github theme change and it's

29:31.100 --> 29:35.900
It's it's a very subtle change, but I use github every single day

29:35.900 --> 29:41.740
So for me, it's like one of the most important websites on the internet and I hate it. I just hate it

29:41.740 --> 29:42.500
there is

29:42.500 --> 29:48.900
the issues and the projects and the wiki thing the little bar above the repo is now over to the left and the releases tab has

29:48.900 --> 29:51.700
Moved from being a tab to being this weird

29:52.260 --> 29:58.740
Micro sidebar on the right and oh you're right. It's a fully adaptive website now and it I

29:58.740 --> 30:04.820
Mean, it's probably better in some ways. I'm just checking it out right now. Oh my goodness. You're right. Oh

30:06.340 --> 30:08.340
Hmm I kind of like it

30:10.900 --> 30:14.500
You really are an apple sheep well, no, it's just I'm on a smaller screen

30:14.500 --> 30:17.940
So it feels like it's a little tighter, but I could see if I was on a ginormous

30:18.780 --> 30:24.060
95 inch screen like you are it would be a lot of wasted space 95 darling. It's only 38

30:24.060 --> 30:28.700
Well, it's bigger than my 14-inch think bad, yeah, yeah

30:28.700 --> 30:31.740
So, I mean I do generally work on an ultra wide all day

30:31.740 --> 30:35.660
So I'm probably not the target market the designers had in mind

30:36.620 --> 30:39.260
When you move github to be, you know

30:39.260 --> 30:40.980
A third of my screen width or anything like that

30:40.980 --> 30:45.100
It looks like it always used to and for the most part the changes are largely

30:45.820 --> 30:47.340
Fine and benign

30:47.340 --> 30:52.420
But it's only when you start to get that wider screen where you've got elements all the way to the right and all the way

30:52.420 --> 30:57.180
To the left and in the middle. It's like guys it was fine before you've just made it worse

30:57.420 --> 31:03.900
You're taking a mouse road trip just to click on a UI element. Yeah, true now the good news is that

31:04.460 --> 31:09.420
That pushed me. I mean, it's just something I've been using kind of not super seriously for a while

31:09.420 --> 31:15.220
But in the last couple of weeks, I've taken it a bit more seriously and that's get tea get a yeah get tea

31:15.220 --> 31:20.500
I think get tea. I've always called it get tea a self-hosted. I want to say github clone

31:20.500 --> 31:26.160
That's probably not necessarily fair. Although it's very similar feature set to github

31:26.220 --> 31:33.660
They call it a community managed lightweight code hosting solution written in go and it's published under the MIT license

31:33.660 --> 31:38.620
It's really nice. It lets you mirror any public repositories that you want to so if you know

31:38.620 --> 31:43.180
You want to mirror every single thing you push to github locally just automatically

31:43.780 --> 31:49.600
Get tea will do that for you. It supports multiple organizations multiple users pull requests

31:49.600 --> 31:54.080
Forks all that kind of stuff, you know everything you're used to really with github

31:54.880 --> 32:00.660
Obviously the downside of self-hosting something like git is that you don't have the community that's there

32:00.820 --> 32:06.380
You know, I often think that when I see big projects moving to git lab even which is obviously a next level up from self

32:06.380 --> 32:07.440
hosting your own

32:07.440 --> 32:13.400
Git server again, so, you know just bear that in mind when you're making that choice. I think that's fair

32:13.400 --> 32:16.200
I think if you're a project that's trying to

32:16.200 --> 32:21.560
Draw in as many contributors as possible. You've really got to do the math on this

32:21.880 --> 32:25.240
However, if it's for yourself and some friends or for a work project

32:25.240 --> 32:29.600
I don't think there's any real downsides to it if you've got the storage and the means to keep it running

32:29.600 --> 32:37.200
I assume you probably deployed the container version of get tea. I do. Yes, and then it backs itself up to a ZFS

32:38.160 --> 32:43.900
Dataset which is now remotely replicated between my server and my other server in England

32:43.900 --> 32:48.900
I finally finished a six terabyte upload to England which took eight weeks

32:50.320 --> 32:53.280
How often were you checking in on that thing the trouble was

32:53.960 --> 32:58.640
Whenever I was uploading and my dad wanted to watch I player it kept buffering

32:59.520 --> 33:04.480
So I had to keep going in and turning it off and then I'd lose a night because I'd forget to turn it back on again

33:05.320 --> 33:10.880
Did he complain Alex? My my internet's just been so horrible. I don't know why yes, he did

33:10.880 --> 33:14.360
Sorry, dad. Did you say? Oh dad. Sorry about that. I

33:14.960 --> 33:20.320
Don't understand because so here's here's what I'm doing. I'm running from ZFS in my basement

33:20.320 --> 33:24.040
I'm doing a wire guard tunnel through my open sense router

33:24.840 --> 33:26.840
directly to the endpoint, which is a

33:27.440 --> 33:28.600
Ubuntu

33:28.600 --> 33:33.360
2004 LTS the box. I did the remote reinstall on a few episodes ago

33:33.360 --> 33:37.520
So if you want to know how long this uploads been going for go back to that episode

33:37.520 --> 33:40.600
And that was when I started the upload so it was a while ago

33:40.600 --> 33:43.100
Wow, he was having stuttering

33:43.840 --> 33:48.120
Downloading I player which is going to be a couple of megabits of most I would have thought

33:48.520 --> 33:55.740
Made let's say 10 and he has 300 something down and I have 35 meg up here with spectrum

33:55.740 --> 34:02.500
And it's like how can that possibly be causing buffering on his end? No kidding. You would think that your remote connection

34:02.500 --> 34:04.920
That's over a transcontinental link

34:04.920 --> 34:10.680
It wouldn't be able to mess up a download that he's doing this probably as near local as it gets

34:10.880 --> 34:14.680
And the only thing I could think of and this is just a pie-in-the-sky theory

34:14.680 --> 34:18.080
Is that there were too many connections open or something?

34:18.440 --> 34:23.680
But then it's going into a pf sense box at the other end which has you know a pretty large state table

34:23.680 --> 34:26.760
So it's not a cheap ISP router or anything like that, you know

34:27.280 --> 34:31.000
So I'm a bit stumped to it is as to what was causing it

34:31.000 --> 34:35.960
So if you have any ideas right in and let me know please. Yeah, that's tricky. It may not be a bandwidth issue

34:35.960 --> 34:39.720
It could be could be a device issue that was causing it but six terabytes

34:39.720 --> 34:42.600
I mean, I must feel good to have it all done now and backed up

34:42.640 --> 34:45.120
Yeah, and now I just do the incremental backups, you know

34:45.120 --> 34:48.880
I did my app data back up this morning and it took about 20 minutes instead of

34:49.440 --> 34:52.640
Six weeks. That was nice when you're self-hosting boy

34:52.640 --> 34:58.040
Have I learned this lesson recently that kind of peace of mind is necessary because you know when you're when you're deploying something like get

34:58.040 --> 34:59.120
to yourself

34:59.120 --> 35:04.080
You don't want to lose that data. That's gonna be really embarrassing and I am so grateful that the recent data loss I had

35:04.720 --> 35:12.160
the vast vast vast majority of it was all recovered even though my backups had broken because I had that data stored on another system which

35:12.240 --> 35:14.560
like you're doing now too and I

35:15.480 --> 35:19.840
Just really really got to double down on that. Like if you're gonna do this if you're gonna host this stuff yourself

35:20.520 --> 35:22.520
take the time because

35:22.560 --> 35:25.840
Boy, did I learn that one the hard way recently and that's even knowing this, you know

35:25.840 --> 35:30.040
Even having said this and preach this stuff over and over again, like it can still be an issue. So

35:30.560 --> 35:35.040
Congratulations, sir. That must be a nice piece of mind. It must feel good. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

35:35.640 --> 35:40.600
My grand vision is I'll have the the ZFS

35:41.160 --> 35:48.120
Replication at his house which will then itself replicate to the PI 8 gigabyte. I bought a couple of weeks ago at my sister's house

35:48.360 --> 35:54.680
So I'll have three full copies of everything. I care about in a ZFS reachable location

35:54.680 --> 35:59.800
On top of that. I have everything backed up to Google Drive that I care about and also Glacier

35:59.800 --> 36:07.440
So between those five different points, I think I have it covered. You're set unless it's a meteor strikes the earth

36:08.440 --> 36:12.880
Yeah, unless something takes out North America and Europe at the same time. I'm fine. I

36:13.920 --> 36:19.040
Think you probably have other problems at that point. Maybe maybe we'll see if you're lucky

36:19.040 --> 36:25.800
So thank you very much for listening. That was self-hosted 22. You can find the show at self-hosted show on Twitter

36:25.920 --> 36:30.600
And don't forget the discord self hosted show slash discord. Oh, yeah, it's really kicking up over there

36:30.600 --> 36:36.120
We've got over a thousand users these days. It's a it's a really great community. It is my social media platform now

36:36.120 --> 36:40.800
I mean, I'm still on Twitter at Chris last of course, but I've been really getting a lot out of discord

36:40.800 --> 36:49.600
So go check that out. We'd also like your emails your feedback your questions your ideas self hosted a show slash contact
