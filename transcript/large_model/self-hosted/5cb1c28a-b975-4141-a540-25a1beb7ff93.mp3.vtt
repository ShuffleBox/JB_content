WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
Is there some sort of universal law that states that your infrastructure is going to fail

00:04.720 --> 00:06.800
whenever you're not around?

00:06.800 --> 00:09.580
Because I seem to always be subject to it.

00:09.580 --> 00:15.440
There I was, down at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, actually the night before, dreaming

00:15.440 --> 00:19.580
about what we might discover, thinking about what we might learn.

00:19.580 --> 00:26.060
I decide to check in on my Intrepid RV, about seven hours north of where I was.

00:26.060 --> 00:31.960
I pull up the Home Assistant app, and it just isn't quite loading, and I think, hmm, that's

00:31.960 --> 00:32.960
strange.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.040
So I fire up Tailscale, and I pull up the web interface, because the web interface always

00:36.040 --> 00:38.160
works when the app doesn't work.

00:38.160 --> 00:44.920
And it still doesn't load, and I think, huh, I wonder if something's wrong with Home Assistant.

00:44.920 --> 00:50.020
And a few days go by, and I finally make it back to the RV, and I discover that my Raspberry

00:50.020 --> 00:55.240
Pi home server, that runs more than just Home Assistant, I mean it runs my Plex instance,

00:55.240 --> 01:03.680
my SyncThing instance, my Duplicati instance, my Smokeping instance, my Markdown notes instance,

01:03.680 --> 01:07.640
and Home Assistant, dead.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.640
Just dead.

01:08.640 --> 01:09.640
Dead as a doornail.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.120
Just totally dead.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.120
Uh-oh.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.240
And you know the worst part?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.240
I don't even know why it's dead.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.080
What do you mean you don't know why it's dead?

01:17.080 --> 01:18.520
I don't even know what happened.

01:18.520 --> 01:22.400
I mean, we've been on the road, and I've been trying to figure it out, but I just haven't

01:22.400 --> 01:23.400
had a chance.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.720
I haven't even hooked up an HDMI screen to it.

01:24.720 --> 01:25.720
Oh, I see.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.240
I did the hardware swap thing, you know?

01:27.240 --> 01:29.400
Yeah, so what was your plan with that hardware swap?

01:29.400 --> 01:31.360
Because it seemed like a brilliant plan at the time.

01:31.360 --> 01:32.360
Well, thank you.

01:32.360 --> 01:37.520
I mean, I bought a duplicate Raspberry Pi, same thing, Raspberry Pi 4, 8 gigs, in the

01:37.520 --> 01:39.920
same case, forever ago.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.440
Just ready to go.

01:41.440 --> 01:46.320
I swapped everything over, hit the power button, and nothing.

01:46.320 --> 01:53.360
And I looked at my dead Raspberry Pi, and I realized, oh, there's an SD card in here.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.840
I think it might...

01:54.840 --> 01:56.320
This is like the first one I ever set up.

01:56.320 --> 02:00.080
I think maybe it was using that SD card for, like, slash boot.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.200
I can't remember anymore.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.560
But when I first did this, it was kind of a workaround to get Ubuntu running on the

02:05.560 --> 02:06.560
Raspberry Pi 4.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.840
It was before official support had landed.

02:08.840 --> 02:13.620
And I think maybe the SD card was used for grub or something like that.

02:13.620 --> 02:16.960
But I don't know why it would have died while it was running.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.360
So I'm wondering if something more significant happened, but I just don't know at this point.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.360
Maybe there was an unintended upgrade.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.960
Maybe a live patch.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.960
You know, I did the whole reboot thing, and of course, I'm trying to SSH into it.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.600
I can't ping it.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.440
I can't ping it on the tail scale IP either.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.520
It seems gone.

02:33.520 --> 02:39.600
And the worst part of that is it runs a lot of automations in the RV, like all of the

02:39.600 --> 02:43.160
lighting, the heating, of course, the cooling, a lot of the outdoor stuff.

02:43.160 --> 02:48.160
It's all managed by Home Assistant on this stupid Raspberry Pi.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.920
And so it's like we're running things like animals with switches.

02:51.920 --> 02:57.040
Yeah, this place went from a five star to about a three and a half, I think.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.040
Wow.

02:58.040 --> 03:03.640
You let this guy into your home, Alex, you know?

03:03.640 --> 03:04.640
Indeed.

03:04.640 --> 03:08.240
Well, this seems like an appropriate moment to introduce Brent again.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.240
Hello, Brent.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.240
How are you?

03:10.240 --> 03:11.240
Welcome back.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.240
Thank you very much.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.240
And what about you, gentlemen?

03:13.240 --> 03:16.920
Well, actually, we had some feedback at the meetup in Pasadena that we don't introduce

03:16.920 --> 03:17.920
ourselves anymore.

03:17.920 --> 03:23.240
So let's just take a moment for anybody that hasn't worked out that I'm Alex and the other

03:23.240 --> 03:24.240
guy is Chris.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.240
Hey, Chris.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.040
Hello, everybody.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.040
Thank you for being here.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.040
Okay, good.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.040
Now that's out of the way.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.040
Welcome to episode 81.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.040
Yeah.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.040
Now that's out of the way.

03:33.040 --> 03:40.400
I want to ask you if this has got you thinking about deploying some real hardware in the

03:40.400 --> 03:41.400
production system?

03:41.400 --> 03:42.400
Ooh.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.400
Throwing shade.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
Fair enough.

03:44.400 --> 03:52.320
You know, Listener Jeff was really the MVP of our West Coast road trip and he sent me

03:52.320 --> 03:59.080
home with an atom based unit that only draws five watts and it's got two cores, but four

03:59.080 --> 04:00.080
gigs of RAM.

04:00.080 --> 04:04.000
I'm tempted to just build a dedicated home assistant system out of that.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Why not?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.640
Well, I just got shipment notification about my home assistant Yellow.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.720
I should be receiving it this week.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.720
I did.

04:11.720 --> 04:12.720
No, you didn't.

04:12.720 --> 04:17.000
I've got UPS, I've got a UPS tracking number and everything.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.040
Where's it coming from Guam?

04:21.040 --> 04:25.600
I think they landed in Texas and then some some distribution place in Texas is sending

04:25.600 --> 04:26.600
them out from there.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.600
Right.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.600
Okay.

04:28.600 --> 04:33.520
It's so exciting because this marks the second crowd supply thing that I've ever backed that

04:33.520 --> 04:35.480
I'm actually going to receive.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.560
Very excited.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.560
And so the home assistant Yellow is supposed to arrive this Friday.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.000
The only thing was I kind of wanted to go something more powerful.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.480
Well, I'll tell you what's got me thinking is you often run into these issues when you're

04:47.480 --> 04:50.360
on the road remotely and that kind of thing.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.360
Yeah.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.360
Almost exclusively.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.360
Oh, it's so annoying.

04:53.360 --> 04:57.400
I think you need to embrace IPMI of some description.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.600
I think that needs to be a requirement for you.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.600
Oh, interesting.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.920
Oh, you know, I thought about that for the studio and I agree, but I had not thought

05:03.920 --> 05:05.120
about it for the RV.

05:05.120 --> 05:11.520
Well, of course, there's the Pi KVM project for x86 boards that don't come with a BMC

05:11.520 --> 05:12.520
chip built in.

05:12.520 --> 05:18.420
But, you know, you could probably build a server that does everything.

05:18.420 --> 05:21.120
How many pies do you have deployed in in dupes right now?

05:21.120 --> 05:22.600
Well, come on.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
I pared it down.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.720
I pared it down to only two.

05:24.720 --> 05:29.000
I'm not I'm not saying this to be a to be a, you know, a phallic object.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.940
I'm just saying this out of love, like genuine question.

05:32.940 --> 05:33.940
It was four.

05:33.940 --> 05:36.840
It was four in production, and over time I pared it down to two.

05:36.840 --> 05:45.320
OK, so if we allow a 10 watt budget per pie, give or take right now, it was 40 watts.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.160
It's now 20 watts.

05:47.160 --> 05:53.560
You could build a very capable x86 system that does everything all of those pies do

05:53.560 --> 05:58.480
and has a BMC built into it, you know, given the power is it's not you're not quite as

05:58.480 --> 06:02.360
limited on power as the Mars Rover is, but you're not far off.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.360
It's true.

06:03.360 --> 06:07.120
Every watt does count, especially watts that run continuously.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.180
What about heat consideration?

06:09.180 --> 06:10.480
That is a thing.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.480
That's a big thing.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.080
I've been really trying to do the math on that, too.

06:13.080 --> 06:17.440
When I build the next one, I'm trying to think, do I want to build it in a booth or do I want

06:17.440 --> 06:19.440
to go somewhere else and just drill holes?

06:19.440 --> 06:22.480
The Raspberry Pi and maybe that's what finally killed it was heat.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.480
I don't know.

06:23.480 --> 06:27.360
But the Raspberry Pi has done a remarkable job of holding up to intense temperatures

06:27.360 --> 06:29.520
over long periods of time.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.340
My bet really is what happened is there was some kind of a power brownout that was enough

06:33.340 --> 06:39.440
to make the Pi reboot and the SD card was toast in that time since it last rebooted.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.720
I don't obviously have any data to back that up, but that's what I suspect probably happened.

06:43.720 --> 06:51.600
So in total, I spent $169 on the Home Assistant Yellow and I was watching their live stream

06:51.600 --> 06:56.960
today as we record and I don't think they're going to make many more of these because they

06:56.960 --> 07:01.320
can't get their hands on the compute module.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.400
So they finally got this thing shipping.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.320
In fact, they don't even have the POE one sorted out yet.

07:06.320 --> 07:13.400
They have the non POE one shipping and they may not make many more just because you can't

07:13.400 --> 07:14.400
get them.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.400
That's a real shame.

07:15.400 --> 07:19.520
I mean, but on the flip side, it's not a good look for the project, is it?

07:19.520 --> 07:24.040
Charge people money for something and then not ship it for a year or two.

07:24.040 --> 07:29.560
I know it's not their fault, but yeah, I ordered it mid September and now we're here in early

07:29.560 --> 07:30.560
October.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.520
It was just over a year ago that I ordered it.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.520
That's a long time.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.120
It's a very long time.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.440
I mean, if you look at what Valve did with the Steam Deck, I know that Valve orders of

07:40.440 --> 07:47.160
magnitude got more buying power than Home Assistant, Nebuchadnezzar as a company, but

07:47.160 --> 07:51.100
I paid Valve five bucks to sit in a queue, essentially.

07:51.100 --> 07:56.440
And then when the time came to actually ship my hardware, that's when my credit card got

07:56.440 --> 07:57.940
charged.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.880
Maybe something like that could work for Home Assistant.

07:59.880 --> 08:04.720
Yeah, I think, too, the tricky thing here is they based it on the Pi compute module

08:04.720 --> 08:08.580
and that became one of the hardest things to get your hands on in bulk right now.

08:08.580 --> 08:12.920
The Raspberry Pi stuff is like still impossible to find.

08:12.920 --> 08:17.600
I was just doing a check recently and the most common thing you can find at the moment

08:17.600 --> 08:19.160
is the Pi 3.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.040
Which from what I'm learning, isn't that useful for anything.

08:22.040 --> 08:27.880
Did you see that Jeff Gehling did a video just last few days where he talked with the

08:27.880 --> 08:33.320
founder of the Raspberry Pi project about availability and things like that and how

08:33.320 --> 08:34.440
there's no end in sight.

08:34.440 --> 08:41.760
They're making 400,000 of these things a month and something like 95% is going into industrial

08:41.760 --> 08:42.760
use cases.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
Wow.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.760
95%?

08:44.760 --> 08:50.000
Is it even really meant for industrial use cases?

08:50.000 --> 08:55.680
I noticed, because Jeff also does an accompanying blog post, and I noticed that one of the comments

08:55.680 --> 09:02.480
on Jeff's blog post was sort of giving a different version of this story.

09:02.480 --> 09:07.480
They claim, I don't know how they would know, but they claim having inside knowledge and

09:07.480 --> 09:13.040
that Broadcom is actually a bit pissed at the Raspberry Pi folks because they're going

09:13.040 --> 09:18.760
commercial and essentially like the whole deal for getting a super cheap chip from Broadcom

09:18.760 --> 09:22.640
was that you were creating this educational device for kids and now you've announced your

09:22.640 --> 09:26.240
intentions to IPO and make a commercial company out of all this and now you need to pay the

09:26.240 --> 09:28.920
commercial rates and you're going to be lumped in with our commercial clients and not our

09:28.920 --> 09:30.360
educational clients.

09:30.360 --> 09:34.160
And so they're also getting slower supply from Broadcom, according to this commenter.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.880
But I have to say, it kind of seems like it checks out.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.640
I think the Raspberry Pi Foundation, much like all of us, are kind of being caught off

09:40.640 --> 09:44.320
guard by just how ubiquitous it's become.

09:44.320 --> 09:51.320
And I think it's a perfect example of how if you influence the right people, the nerds,

09:51.320 --> 09:56.240
the engineers, the people tinkering, if you influence them, they will then go into work

09:56.240 --> 09:58.880
and say, hey, well, why don't we just use a Pi?

09:58.880 --> 10:04.200
If I, you know, I remember my last job we had on the wall, we had TV screens showing

10:04.200 --> 10:09.840
build statuses of all the different CI processes and each one of them had a Raspberry Pi running

10:09.840 --> 10:15.040
because one of the development team in that sprint team was like, well, we need to monitor

10:15.040 --> 10:16.040
the status.

10:16.040 --> 10:20.960
Why don't we just get a Pi because it's only 35 pounds, stick it behind the TV and jobs

10:20.960 --> 10:22.060
are good.

10:22.060 --> 10:27.160
And I think not only has the Pi Foundation been caught out by the success of their product,

10:27.160 --> 10:30.280
but so it sounds like has Broadcom.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.680
Perhaps that would make a lot of sense.

10:32.680 --> 10:38.440
It's tricky because I actually think if they don't figure something out, the M1 platform

10:38.440 --> 10:43.440
is going to make a pretty worthy successor for home labors.

10:43.440 --> 10:49.240
If imagine for a moment, if you would, Alex, there was decent Linux support for the M1,

10:49.240 --> 10:52.840
which we may be only nine months, 10 months away from.

10:52.840 --> 10:57.640
And that includes Thunderbolt support because right now I'm hanging USB disks off a Raspberry

10:57.640 --> 10:58.680
Pi.

10:58.680 --> 11:03.960
But if I had Thunderbolt support, I could have real actual PCI attached storage.

11:03.960 --> 11:09.920
And if I had an M1 CPU, I would have something that has built in HD 64 decoding and encoding

11:09.920 --> 11:12.120
like a Banshee.

11:12.120 --> 11:15.700
And if somehow Plex could come along and get support for that, then we'd really be cooking

11:15.700 --> 11:16.700
with gas.

11:16.700 --> 11:21.800
Don't you just wish that Mac OS server wasn't terrible?

11:21.800 --> 11:23.360
Is Mac OS server even a thing anymore?

11:23.360 --> 11:24.360
I think they might.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.360
No.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.360
I don't even know.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.360
I know.

11:27.360 --> 11:28.360
It's really sad.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.560
And honestly, I feel like Docker desktop isn't good enough on the Mac for production use

11:31.560 --> 11:32.560
the way I would want.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.560
I want something headless.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.560
I want it to be Linux.

11:34.560 --> 11:41.880
I mean, Asahi this the last couple of weeks released preliminary support for GPU acceleration

11:41.880 --> 11:45.800
under Linux with the M1 chip, which is a huge, huge milestone.

11:45.800 --> 11:46.800
Yeah.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.800
Using a Rust driver.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.800
A Rust driver.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.280
I mean, that's amazing.

11:51.280 --> 11:55.280
So maybe, I mean, maybe it's not too far off, but it's not going to be within the time that

11:55.280 --> 11:57.440
I need to build my next home server.

11:57.440 --> 12:01.600
I think I'm going to have to just out of practicality base it around this yellow, it would seem

12:01.600 --> 12:06.560
crazy not to, you know, showing up on my doorstep as I'm returning back in town and I need a

12:06.560 --> 12:07.560
new server.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.600
If you need an appliance, it sounds like that might be it.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.240
But let me ask you this.

12:11.240 --> 12:16.320
If money was no object, what would you do in tubes?

12:16.320 --> 12:17.760
The trickiest thing is storage.

12:17.760 --> 12:21.480
If money was no object, I'd spend a lot on storage and it'd be solid state storage because

12:21.480 --> 12:23.560
I have to go down the road.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.360
So that's where I'd probably blow a lot of money.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.560
You're not going to believe this, but I mean, for 90% of the time I have found the Raspberry

12:29.560 --> 12:31.760
Pi 4 has been fast enough.

12:31.760 --> 12:35.140
The pages could have always loaded faster in Home Assistant and I'm on a couple of versions

12:35.140 --> 12:36.280
behind now.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.240
Home Assistant could have always been faster.

12:38.240 --> 12:43.160
But Plex and Sync thing and like my Markdown docs, I forget the name of the Markdown docs

12:43.160 --> 12:44.440
website thing.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.360
Those all always ran totally fine.

12:46.360 --> 12:47.360
I was surprised.

12:47.360 --> 12:50.180
I was shocked that I got by with a Raspberry Pi.

12:50.180 --> 12:54.100
It was just Home Assistant that could be a little bit faster.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.760
But you know, a lot of that might've come down to storage technology.

12:57.760 --> 13:03.200
That's why I think the M1 would be perfect, you know, 10, 20 Watts, a lot of horsepower,

13:03.200 --> 13:04.800
fast storage.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.800
Just don't want macOS.

13:05.800 --> 13:10.160
Well, if, if power was no object, I know we, we made money, no object just then, but I

13:10.160 --> 13:14.360
think power is probably your biggest limiting factor as well as maybe space.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.920
You can't have a big 42U rack in there, can you?

13:16.920 --> 13:20.200
Like if power was no object, would you do the same thing?

13:20.200 --> 13:24.560
If power was no object, I think I'd be tempted to build a rack unit into one of the storage

13:24.560 --> 13:32.960
bays, you know, and go with like a big x86 box and probably do a lot of hosting in dupes

13:32.960 --> 13:37.520
just because that's, I like the idea of it's, it's truly decentralized.

13:37.520 --> 13:42.280
I can move it, I can take it with me and I'd rather have the source of truth here as long

13:42.280 --> 13:43.720
as I had a good backup.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.740
Right now I hold the source of truth and everything at the studio.

13:46.740 --> 13:50.320
So I'd probably build a rack unit if I could go crazy, but I don't need it.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.760
You know, I didn't lose any data.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.280
My server is down, but I didn't lose any data.

13:55.280 --> 13:58.000
So the setup is working as I need it to.

13:58.000 --> 14:05.440
Well, the obvious thing that comes to mind for me is the Intel NUC, that kind of tiny

14:05.440 --> 14:06.440
mini micro thing.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.720
I don't know if you've been following serve the home at all over the last few months.

14:10.720 --> 14:16.320
They've been doing a series called tiny mini micro where they get these four, five, six,

14:16.320 --> 14:25.080
10 liter micro, essentially thin client machines designed for business applications.

14:25.080 --> 14:30.480
And they've got powerful chips in them and 32 gigs of Ram and you know, all the rest

14:30.480 --> 14:31.480
of it.

14:31.480 --> 14:37.120
And they are the size of two or three CD cases stacked on top of each other.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.120
What about something like that?

14:38.120 --> 14:43.440
That is pretty tempting, especially if it's got, you know, reasonable horsepower and it

14:43.440 --> 14:46.680
can do decent video decoding.

14:46.680 --> 14:51.000
That would be and networking and connectivity because I always need to add more storage.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.560
I think what you'd be looking for there as your silver bullet for video decoding would

14:54.560 --> 14:58.320
be quick sync support, which does limit you to Intel.

14:58.320 --> 15:03.760
But you know, speaking from experience, quick sync uses anywhere from four to six, maybe

15:03.760 --> 15:07.040
eight watts to transcode a 4k stream.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.720
And it's hard limited at eight watts.

15:08.720 --> 15:13.200
Like I've never been able to get it to go above eight, eight to 10 watts is about the

15:13.200 --> 15:14.520
maximum I've ever seen.

15:14.520 --> 15:20.360
So even if you're doing multiple trans codes at once, which in an RV I find very unlikely,

15:20.360 --> 15:21.800
quick sync is the way to go.

15:21.800 --> 15:25.160
That is the nice thing is I only really need to build for like two televisions.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.840
Three is the max.

15:26.840 --> 15:30.720
Well I guess there's always tablets, but very unlikely that we'd have three TVs and a tablet

15:30.720 --> 15:31.720
going in the RV.

15:31.720 --> 15:37.520
But you could negate the transcoding requirement entirely just simply by using something like

15:37.520 --> 15:40.840
Tedar or Handbrake to pre encode the media.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.800
And you can automate all that stuff, you know, into the correct formats for the TV.

15:44.800 --> 15:48.720
You know, actually I think for the most part, I mean, for the most part, most of my stuff

15:48.720 --> 15:54.080
doesn't need transcoding because it's either an Apple TV or an NVIDIA Shield and it's H264

15:54.080 --> 16:01.840
and AC MP3 or AC3 audio for the most part, not 100%, but I'd say, I'd say 85, 90%.

16:01.840 --> 16:05.400
How many terabytes do you need here in JOOPS?

16:05.400 --> 16:06.400
I'd love four.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.120
I'm getting by with two, right?

16:08.120 --> 16:09.360
I would love to do more even.

16:09.360 --> 16:13.400
I mean, ideally I'd love 14, let's be honest.

16:13.400 --> 16:18.040
But I get what I do is I, I batch over just the stuff we're watching, like a couple of

16:18.040 --> 16:22.080
series for the kids, a couple of movies that are for Hadiya and I, a couple of movies that

16:22.080 --> 16:26.640
are for the kids and a couple of movies that are for family and just a few TV shows.

16:26.640 --> 16:30.560
And I just kind of keep like what the current season is that we're watching of a show on

16:30.560 --> 16:31.560
there.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.060
And I don't need to keep everything because I have a larger storage at the studio.

16:34.060 --> 16:39.040
I have no idea how reliable it is, but I just looked on Amazon just to sort of see how much

16:39.040 --> 16:42.200
a two terabyte SSD costs these days.

16:42.200 --> 16:49.280
The brands you've heard of, Samsung, Crucial, et cetera, they're all in the 160 to 200 range

16:49.280 --> 16:55.160
per two terabytes, but there's a brand here I've never heard of called Levin and these

16:55.160 --> 17:02.600
guys make a two terabyte 3D NAND SATA 3 internal SSD for $99.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.040
I mean, you throw a few of those in a raid, what could go wrong?

17:06.040 --> 17:11.080
You throw a few of those in merger FS and what I'm thinking is before a trip, right,

17:11.080 --> 17:16.440
you take one or two of these into the studio, sync across what you need to through a USB

17:16.440 --> 17:21.780
interface that's much faster than a network interface and then you throw it back into

17:21.780 --> 17:25.440
your hot swap bay in dupes and you're good to go.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.440
Yeah.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.840
And then you just keep it topped off with a little sync thing action, you know?

17:29.840 --> 17:30.840
Yes.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.360
Yeah, that could totally work.

17:32.360 --> 17:35.120
What I'm kind of picturing is like a board, right?

17:35.120 --> 17:40.400
Like a removable, almost like a piece of plywood that has the yellow mounted to it and the

17:40.400 --> 17:47.080
disks mounted to it and the Zigbee and Z-Wave antennas mounted to it and I can just insert

17:47.080 --> 17:50.480
this board into dupes and I can pull this board out of dupes.

17:50.480 --> 17:55.040
And if I need to work on it, I just remove the whole componentry, all of it, put together

17:55.040 --> 17:58.880
as one piece, I take it to the studio and I work on it and then I bring it back into

17:58.880 --> 18:01.400
dupes and I just reinstall it and reconnect things.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.320
I love that modular approach.

18:03.320 --> 18:09.720
I'd love to add into that mix your new mixer plans too, that would be kind of fun, huh?

18:09.720 --> 18:13.080
Oh, imagine the ultimate setup, right?

18:13.080 --> 18:18.040
Like server capacity, media capacity and production capacity and just slide them all in.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.580
You have, you know, like eight XLR inputs on the front of this thing for all your mics

18:21.580 --> 18:23.020
and what have you.

18:23.020 --> 18:27.040
And then on the back, you've got a couple of network jacks and a power cord going in

18:27.040 --> 18:28.040
and that's it.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.040
That would be pretty cool.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.040
That sounds really sweet, actually.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.560
That'd be pretty, pretty, pretty great, pretty, pretty great.

18:33.560 --> 18:34.760
Let's work on that then.

18:34.760 --> 18:40.800
But speaking of upgrades and stuff like that, I assume you saw that Paulus from the Home

18:40.800 --> 18:47.280
Assistant Project has been very, very excited that Matter finally hit 1.0 this week.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.560
Damn it.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.560
Can you believe this?

18:49.560 --> 18:53.580
You know what that means is that they're beginning to pull it into Home Assistant.

18:53.580 --> 18:59.200
They're beginning to build in Matter support into Home Assistant and an actual device shipped

18:59.200 --> 19:02.700
in the last week, a light bulb with Matter.

19:02.700 --> 19:07.840
It's actually happening, but you know, it's really still like probably six months to a

19:07.840 --> 19:11.800
year out before just general devices are available.

19:11.800 --> 19:15.240
And of course, of course, I'm doing this rebuild right now.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.440
Of course, my server died.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.820
I couldn't hold out.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.520
You know, I was holding out for Matter.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.160
You know, that was what I did.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.600
That was my entire intention all along was to hold out and just replace my devices with

19:24.600 --> 19:25.880
Matter devices.

19:25.880 --> 19:30.720
And just as it becomes official, just as the first device ships, my system dies and I'm

19:30.720 --> 19:33.920
going to have to either go all in on Z-Wave or ZigBee.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.280
ZigBee is very well tested, though.

19:36.280 --> 19:42.840
I wouldn't imagine Matter is going to be stable, properly stable for another, I don't want

19:42.840 --> 19:43.840
to say five years.

19:43.840 --> 19:48.760
That might be a bit pessimistic, but you know, at least two or three before we've got, you

19:48.760 --> 19:53.040
know, the ubiquitous level of devices we have now in ZigBee land.

19:53.040 --> 19:56.240
I pulled the trigger and I pre-ordered the Home Assistant.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.240
I think they call it...

19:57.240 --> 19:58.240
iLink?

19:58.240 --> 19:59.240
What do they call it, Alex?

19:59.240 --> 20:00.960
SkyConnect, I think.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.600
Yeah, SkyConnect.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.800
It is a ZigBee radio.

20:04.800 --> 20:09.040
It has ZigBee and Thread, and they promise they'll do a firmware upgrade and add Matter

20:09.040 --> 20:10.040
to it.

20:10.040 --> 20:17.600
So Home Assistant SkyConnect is their own hardware ZigBee radio, which seems like, okay,

20:17.600 --> 20:20.680
so Home Assistant's clearly going all in on ZigBee.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.840
This is a clear signal from the project.

20:22.840 --> 20:28.280
ZigBee is the future of Home Assistant and Matter, but then they made the announcement

20:28.280 --> 20:32.160
that they just full-time hired the Z-Wave integration guy.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.800
And now the Z-Wave integration guy is a Nebuchadnezzar employee.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.320
Mixed messages, it sounds like.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.840
I'm so confused as to what direction to go right now.

20:40.840 --> 20:45.040
I think what they're saying is, whatever you want to use, we're going to support and we're

20:45.040 --> 20:48.180
going to try to support it really well, but they haven't like just clearly articulated

20:48.180 --> 20:49.180
that to me.

20:49.180 --> 20:51.360
So I'm trying to figure out like, well, if I'm going to buy one device, should I buy

20:51.360 --> 20:53.760
ZigBee or should I be buying Z-Wave or what?

20:53.760 --> 20:56.980
It's like, I'm probably going to have to replace some of these devices because some of these

20:56.980 --> 21:01.800
things are probably not going to unpair very easily with my dead system.

21:01.800 --> 21:05.920
Or are they saying that when you buy this in a year from now, when it actually lands

21:05.920 --> 21:08.520
on your door, then they'll be supporting it full-time?

21:08.520 --> 21:12.700
Yeah, it is a pre-order and it is quote, available soon.

21:12.700 --> 21:19.320
So just as I'm finally receiving my yellow, we'll see how long it takes me to get my SkyConnect.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.000
Linode.com slash SSH.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.600
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.880
It's just a great way to support the show while you're checking out something awesome.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.920
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting with the best support in the business.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.120
Real humans every day.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.360
It's how we run everything we've built in the last few years in the cloud, like our

21:36.360 --> 21:37.360
brand new website.

21:37.360 --> 21:40.400
Got to go check it out, jupyterbroadcasting.com.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.320
We use it in our personal environments.

21:42.320 --> 21:45.280
We use it in our testing environments and we use it in our production environments because

21:45.280 --> 21:49.160
Linode's tooling makes it really straightforward to do all of that.

21:49.160 --> 21:53.680
And Linode was built nearly 19 years ago and they just added better and better things.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.680
They've improved.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.120
They've refined the service over the years.

21:56.120 --> 22:01.420
So now, like, we're riding on top of years and years and years of investment.

22:01.420 --> 22:04.040
We get all of that as just part of the product.

22:04.040 --> 22:08.120
And Linode is still 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers that want to lock you into

22:08.120 --> 22:12.200
their crazy platforms that are just secondary to their main business.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.880
And on top of that, I think Linode has the best performance out there.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.920
And independent testing is also showing that.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.720
And right now, today, Linode has 11 data centers for you to choose from.

22:19.720 --> 22:22.320
And that's a whole bunch all over the world.

22:22.320 --> 22:26.880
And coming soon, there's going to be more than a dozen new Linode data centers firing

22:26.880 --> 22:29.200
up across the world.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.200
That's just going to be insane.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.200
You're going to have so much choice.

22:31.200 --> 22:38.080
And you know, Linode really is just the perfect balance of support, performance, and price.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.760
So with that $100, you get a chance to see it for yourself.

22:40.760 --> 22:44.120
That really is an opportunity to kick the tires and try it.

22:44.120 --> 22:48.680
So go build something, go learn something, go experiment with something, and support

22:48.680 --> 22:49.680
the show.

22:49.680 --> 22:50.680
Try it for yourself.

22:50.680 --> 22:54.080
Get your $100 at linode.com slash SSH.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.080
One more time.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.080
That's linode.com slash SSH.

22:56.080 --> 23:03.120
We're trying to review an app that I've actually put in the show notes more times than I can

23:03.120 --> 23:04.120
actually remember.

23:04.120 --> 23:07.120
We just never quite seem to get to it.

23:07.120 --> 23:11.260
This time, finally, Invoice Ninja has made the cut into the show.

23:11.260 --> 23:15.240
So I thought it would be good because I know, Brent, you do quite a lot of freelancing stuff

23:15.240 --> 23:19.320
with your photography and other things, you know, podcast related stuff.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.320
So you're always sending invoices to people.

23:21.320 --> 23:25.540
So I thought whilst we had you on the show, it would be a good time to discuss Invoice

23:25.540 --> 23:26.540
Ninja.

23:26.540 --> 23:31.160
Now, this is a piece of software that allows you to create customizable and nicely designed

23:31.160 --> 23:33.120
invoices and quotes.

23:33.120 --> 23:40.200
So essentially, whenever I do a piece of freelance work for somebody, I create a customer in

23:40.200 --> 23:42.160
the Invoice Ninja software.

23:42.160 --> 23:46.640
And then I create a product, you know, like a podcast episode, for example, or something

23:46.640 --> 23:47.640
like that.

23:47.640 --> 23:51.280
And then I put in there, you know, what the product is, it could be a physical thing,

23:51.280 --> 23:52.760
it could be a service, whatever.

23:52.760 --> 23:57.960
And it has a rate attached to it, a standard rate, which I can go in and customize if I

23:57.960 --> 23:58.960
want to.

23:58.960 --> 24:02.160
But typically, it doesn't change that much between clients.

24:02.160 --> 24:06.400
After that, it automatically generates the invoice based on my information and the client's

24:06.400 --> 24:08.040
information.

24:08.040 --> 24:12.820
And if you get fancy and set up email with it, which I've never done, I always just download

24:12.820 --> 24:18.040
the PDF once it's generated the invoice and stick it in my email manually, but it can

24:18.040 --> 24:23.000
actually send emails directly from the Invoice Ninja software to the client, which is a really

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
nice feature.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.600
Alex, you're right to include me because I have a lot of questions.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.080
Okay, far away.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.040
Okay, you've been using this for how long now?

24:31.040 --> 24:33.160
I think it's been like two years if I remember.

24:33.160 --> 24:38.120
Two years plus however long it is since I set you up with your instance that is probably

24:38.120 --> 24:39.720
dead by now.

24:39.720 --> 24:40.920
You did send me a backup.

24:40.920 --> 24:42.160
So thank you for that.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.160
Okay.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.160
Okay, good.

24:44.160 --> 24:48.120
Yeah, Alex, you you shared with me invoice into I think when you first found it, or maybe

24:48.120 --> 24:51.600
you were a few months in and you were crazy excited about it, and I did get the chance

24:51.600 --> 24:52.600
to try it.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.600
Yeah, it's it's years old in my workflow.

24:55.600 --> 25:00.120
Now at this point, everything you described your introduction just there is not something

25:00.120 --> 25:02.300
that I think is unique.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.600
I'm curious from your perspective.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.360
What are the things that you're really loving about this?

25:06.360 --> 25:07.360
Is it that?

25:07.360 --> 25:10.160
Is it the fact that you can self host it really easily?

25:10.160 --> 25:12.240
Is it the fact that it's really responsive?

25:12.240 --> 25:13.640
Is it the interface?

25:13.640 --> 25:14.960
What is it about it that really grabs you?

25:14.960 --> 25:19.120
Yeah, I didn't touch much on the actual mechanics of hosting this thing.

25:19.120 --> 25:24.360
The invoice ninja project actually has hosted options which you can pay monthly for.

25:24.360 --> 25:29.160
However, I don't do that I have a fully self hosted version that lives on my server.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.120
This thing requires three containers.

25:31.120 --> 25:35.280
So there's the app container, there's a database container, which in my case, I'm using my

25:35.280 --> 25:36.420
sequel.

25:36.420 --> 25:40.000
And then there's a front end, which in my case, I'm using nginx, which I then proxy

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
through traffic.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.560
So I tell you what I like about it just as a piece of software.

25:45.560 --> 25:46.840
It looks nice.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.680
Yeah, I'll agree with that.

25:48.680 --> 25:52.760
I like the fact that when I create an invoice, it gives me a little chart that says you're

25:52.760 --> 25:55.680
owed $500 this month.

25:55.680 --> 26:01.840
And then until you mark that invoice as received or paid, it will show you a pending number

26:01.840 --> 26:07.600
versus a last 30 day number versus a, you know, 90 day number or whatever you want.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.960
So I could see this being very useful for people who are actually sending hundreds of

26:10.960 --> 26:16.800
invoices every day, less useful for me who sends maybe one a month or two a month.

26:16.800 --> 26:21.760
But it's still nice to have a record of everything I've ever sent in one place.

26:21.760 --> 26:28.240
The other thing that I like about it too, is that I can tweak stuff.

26:28.240 --> 26:33.000
And I feel like I'm using a really, I'm driving a really powerful sports car.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.280
And I'm okay, I'm only puting down the road at 30 miles an hour.

26:36.280 --> 26:40.760
But it's nice to know that it's got all of that other stuff there should I ever need

26:40.760 --> 26:41.760
it.

26:41.760 --> 26:42.760
Yeah.

26:42.760 --> 26:46.640
And I think too, it's it's pretty quick that the pricing on a lot of the hosted invoicing

26:46.640 --> 26:49.720
can get really expensive.

26:49.720 --> 26:53.760
You know, I have been a customer of FreshBooks for a long time.

26:53.760 --> 26:58.000
But I think I'm paying some somewhere near 50 bucks a month or something like that 60

26:58.000 --> 27:02.600
bucks a month for the package, well, JB does not me, but it's actually kind of a good deal

27:02.600 --> 27:03.740
for a lot of these things.

27:03.740 --> 27:08.360
People pay astronomical prices for QuickBooks and the invoicing components.

27:08.360 --> 27:13.360
So there's that aspect of invoice, besides the UI, and besides the self hosting and tinkering,

27:13.360 --> 27:15.300
there's the cost savings too.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.760
In addition, it does a whole bunch of other stuff.

27:17.760 --> 27:23.240
So I can set up things like recurring invoices, if I want to in a separate area from individual

27:23.240 --> 27:24.240
invoices.

27:24.240 --> 27:29.600
I can record manually all the payments that come in and attach those to specific invoices

27:29.600 --> 27:30.800
if I want to.

27:30.800 --> 27:36.000
I can also do things like quotes and proposals and set up specific projects and attach different

27:36.000 --> 27:41.760
things within invoice ninja to different projects and what have you which, you know, if I was,

27:41.760 --> 27:46.100
I don't know, let's say running a home improvement company, that could be quite useful to have

27:46.100 --> 27:51.080
different quotes for the same person within a single project, for example, something like

27:51.080 --> 27:52.080
that.

27:52.080 --> 27:55.600
I can also do things like track different vendors.

27:55.600 --> 28:00.240
So I can say, well, this vendor, I've sent them this money for this product.

28:00.240 --> 28:05.640
And like I say, it's, it's an incredibly powerful piece of software that I'm really only scratching

28:05.640 --> 28:11.200
the surface of by pretty much only using the invoice portion of it.

28:11.200 --> 28:15.440
But it has the ability to run some pretty sophisticated reporting as well.

28:15.440 --> 28:19.640
So again, if I was a bit more of a serious small business owner or something like that,

28:19.640 --> 28:25.440
which I'm not, I could, you know, let's say give me the last, you know, every invoice

28:25.440 --> 28:29.240
this year to a specific client or something like that.

28:29.240 --> 28:32.040
And it'll just show me all those things in one place.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.920
Now, Alex, have you used anything else for invoicing or is this kind of your first foray

28:35.920 --> 28:39.400
into this style of software to help you accomplish things?

28:39.400 --> 28:44.160
I used to just have a Google sheet that I've, you know, manually changed and filled out

28:44.160 --> 28:47.160
things for a long time.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.960
Which is also very powerful.

28:48.960 --> 28:54.400
It can be, but it's also, you know, you don't really have a record unless you do a new sheet

28:54.400 --> 28:57.440
per invoice or something of what you've done.

28:57.440 --> 29:03.240
But this is the first kind of invoicing suite, I guess, that I've used.

29:03.240 --> 29:06.880
Because many of the features you described are, yeah, they're great.

29:06.880 --> 29:07.880
They're not unique.

29:07.880 --> 29:12.400
But what I have found when I used Invoice Ninja was that they're very well implemented.

29:12.400 --> 29:16.640
And like you mentioned, they allowed you to really tweak a lot of things.

29:16.640 --> 29:23.120
I have been using for many years a piece of software called Invoice Plane, and it is far

29:23.120 --> 29:24.120
more basic.

29:24.120 --> 29:29.920
It is self-hosted, and I have some automated emails and stuff sending out of there.

29:29.920 --> 29:35.160
But I do find after having used Invoice Ninja, thanks to you, that I feel it's lacking now.

29:35.160 --> 29:38.120
And every time I use it, I'm like, oh, God, I really gotta switch over.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.840
I gotta change this.

29:39.840 --> 29:44.560
So I think you made probably a really nice choice in choosing your first piece of software

29:44.560 --> 29:49.400
because often, the hardest part is taking all that information out of these pieces of

29:49.400 --> 29:51.440
software and switching to something new.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.000
That's one thing I really struggle with.

29:53.000 --> 29:59.940
And so have you investigated at all what the importing and exporting parts of this database

29:59.940 --> 30:03.480
might look like and what that's like to port to something new, if you so choose?

30:03.480 --> 30:11.260
Well, I just, whilst we were talking just then, exported a CSV report of every invoice

30:11.260 --> 30:12.260
that I've sent this year.

30:12.260 --> 30:14.200
So let's just take a quick look at that.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.920
All numbers, of course, is gonna be a real fun time.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.120
So the CSV is exactly what you'd expect.

30:20.120 --> 30:24.920
It's just a bunch of this client, this date, this invoice number, this amount, status,

30:24.920 --> 30:26.500
all that kind of stuff.

30:26.500 --> 30:33.880
And so if you can get it out to a format that you own, like a CSV file, there's no QuickBooks

30:33.880 --> 30:37.960
or FreshBooks kind of proprietary license required.

30:37.960 --> 30:42.240
That's a huge thing for me, given I just do this as a spare time thing.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.680
But yeah, I think CSV seems to be pretty good.

30:44.680 --> 30:48.320
I haven't actually done anything with importing though.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.760
Well, I have another question for you.

30:50.760 --> 30:55.920
I overheard when I was at your place last that your wife, Catherine, has been using

30:55.920 --> 30:56.920
it as well.

30:56.920 --> 31:00.280
Did you get any feedback from her using it in her business?

31:00.280 --> 31:07.720
Yeah, I think it's massive overkill for just invoicing a few music students, parents, but

31:07.720 --> 31:08.720
she likes it.

31:08.720 --> 31:09.720
I mean, she has her own login.

31:09.720 --> 31:13.920
You know, has a shortcut on her browser's bookmarks.

31:13.920 --> 31:17.800
She just logs in and just does the thing and like I do once a month, I guess, and just

31:17.800 --> 31:21.360
sends the invoice out and it's all good.

31:21.360 --> 31:26.160
I've just found the import data pane, by the way, and it supports a huge number of different

31:26.160 --> 31:27.160
formats.

31:27.160 --> 31:30.840
You've got CSV, JSON, FreshBooks, blah, blah, blah.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.120
Invoice plane is one of them, I would just say.

31:33.120 --> 31:40.160
There's about 10 or 12 different options for importing and exporting is CSV, XLS or JSON.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.160
Sounds like you've got me hooked.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.160
Yeah, there's no downside.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.160
I can see.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.160
Next.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.160
Yeah.

31:45.160 --> 31:46.520
And even if you try it and you don't like it, it sounds like it's pretty easy to get

31:46.520 --> 31:47.520
out.

31:47.520 --> 31:50.360
So it's no real downside to trying it.

31:50.360 --> 31:54.280
I know a lot of people listening to this show probably love their Yubikey.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.800
I've heard from some of them.

31:55.800 --> 31:59.640
And it sounds like Cloudflare is going to work with Yubikeys.

31:59.640 --> 32:04.320
I didn't know they didn't tell us all about this one, Alex.

32:04.320 --> 32:09.120
Well, the first thing about Yubikeys, we should explain what they are for those that don't

32:09.120 --> 32:10.120
know.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.480
They're a hardware two-factor authentication token.

32:12.480 --> 32:18.240
So essentially what that means is whenever you log into a specific login portal, website,

32:18.240 --> 32:23.440
piece of software, whatever that needs 2FA, that six digit code or whatever, it could

32:23.440 --> 32:27.480
be an alphanumeric string in the case of a Yubikey.

32:27.480 --> 32:33.600
You have to physically plug in a USB device into your computer or your phone via NFC.

32:33.600 --> 32:38.240
The two-factor piece is stored in the hardware of the Yubikey.

32:38.240 --> 32:42.640
That has a few benefits, obviously, unless someone has physical access to my hardware

32:42.640 --> 32:46.240
two-factor token, they can't log in.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.800
The downside is that includes me.

32:48.800 --> 32:57.600
And what I found when I got a free Yubikey back at DockerCon in 2015, I think, because

32:57.600 --> 33:02.120
they were doing some push to get people to sign Docker images back then.

33:02.120 --> 33:06.160
So I tried it for a while because you can load SSH keys onto this thing as well.

33:06.160 --> 33:10.400
Secrets can include a private key, all that kind of stuff.

33:10.400 --> 33:15.080
Even your Bitwarden two-factor authentication token can be stored and set up to work with

33:15.080 --> 33:16.600
a Yubikey.

33:16.600 --> 33:21.400
The trouble is my Yubikey is always at the wrong end of the house.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.820
It's always at the opposite end of the house from where I am.

33:23.820 --> 33:28.220
And so whenever I want to log into something, I'm like, damn it, I have to run from one

33:28.220 --> 33:32.400
end of the house to the other or just have multiple Yubikeys.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.780
I feel like there's some universal law about two-factor and the device you're using is

33:35.780 --> 33:37.440
always at the other end of the house.

33:37.440 --> 33:38.720
Yeah, that's true.

33:38.720 --> 33:42.360
I remember our friend Noah wears it around his neck for that very reason.

33:42.360 --> 33:46.640
I mean, so it's not to say that they're not good because they're incredibly useful in

33:46.640 --> 33:47.720
the workplace.

33:47.720 --> 33:52.200
For example, you want to give someone access to some privileged secrets.

33:52.200 --> 33:57.680
You give them this hardware token and at work, typically that's the most common use case

33:57.680 --> 33:59.440
for it, I would say.

33:59.440 --> 34:05.320
And so what Cloudflare are doing is they're running a promotion with Yubikey to provide

34:05.320 --> 34:12.800
these security keys at air quotes, good for the internet end quotes pricing and they start

34:12.800 --> 34:15.120
as low as $10 per Yubikey.

34:15.120 --> 34:19.720
Now typically these things are 30, 40 plus each.

34:19.720 --> 34:23.680
So actually that could be a huge boon if you've been looking to get involved with the YubiCo

34:23.680 --> 34:29.520
Yubikey stuff, sign up to this offer that's in the show notes with Cloudflare, it's not

34:29.520 --> 34:35.280
sponsored or affiliated, it's just a Cloudflare thing and get yourself a cheap Yubikey.

34:35.280 --> 34:40.160
Good for the internet pricing is adorable.

34:40.160 --> 34:43.280
I thought we're supposed to hate Cloudflare, but I can't help but think this is a good

34:43.280 --> 34:44.280
idea.

34:44.280 --> 34:46.880
This is truly good for the security of the internet.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.880
You know, Chris, I did find a Yubikey in your closet one time.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.920
I think the last time I was here, um, Brent, you're going through my closet?

34:53.920 --> 34:57.800
No, no, I just, well, we'll talk about it later.

34:57.800 --> 35:03.760
You know, there used to be lots of reasons not to use Yubikey's laziness, being at the

35:03.760 --> 35:07.880
wrong end of the house is one of them, but they didn't used to make a USB-C specific

35:07.880 --> 35:10.880
one that was low profile for like MacBooks and stuff.

35:10.880 --> 35:11.880
They fixed that.

35:11.880 --> 35:15.080
That's now a low profile one for MacBooks.

35:15.080 --> 35:19.800
They didn't used to work on mobile devices, but they now do through NFC.

35:19.800 --> 35:26.360
So really there's no real reason if you're curious not to try one at a $10 entry price.

35:26.360 --> 35:27.880
That is a really good point.

35:27.880 --> 35:32.980
I've looked at these keys many times, both the Yubikeys and alternatives, and I've always

35:32.980 --> 35:38.480
hesitated to pull the trigger on price because actually you kind of need two of them.

35:38.480 --> 35:41.000
One is your main, one is the backup.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.200
But the other reason was always that I couldn't quite figure out all of the different features

35:45.200 --> 35:48.840
and you know, which, is it Fido that I need to support everything?

35:48.840 --> 35:54.240
It's like, it seemed like 12 websites use this one proprietary way of doing it, and

35:54.240 --> 35:55.920
the other 12 use this other method.

35:55.920 --> 36:01.380
So I always got lost in all of those details and complexity, and I hope that maybe that's

36:01.380 --> 36:02.380
been solved recently.

36:02.380 --> 36:06.320
Do you have any sense of whether they're easier these days than they were maybe five years

36:06.320 --> 36:07.320
ago?

36:07.320 --> 36:10.660
I think they're more mature and they support a lot more stuff than they used to.

36:10.660 --> 36:14.480
I don't know whether that makes it simpler or more approachable though.

36:14.480 --> 36:17.880
If anything, it makes it worse because there's more options.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.880
That's where I kind of debate, like maybe the, maybe the sweet spot is like an authenticator

36:20.880 --> 36:26.440
app on your phone, but I do kind of, I love that idea of you plug in a hardware device

36:26.440 --> 36:31.080
that does something and it feels like you'd really want to combine a two factor code on

36:31.080 --> 36:36.260
an authentication app with a hardware device with a password potentially.

36:36.260 --> 36:40.200
Or as a backup, you know, when places do SMS phishing attacks and stuff, that's one of

36:40.200 --> 36:47.520
the most common attack vectors is people steal your SMS access, send a two factor code there

36:47.520 --> 36:51.440
whilst they have the temporary access before you notice.

36:51.440 --> 36:54.560
And this would completely negate that as an attack vector.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.320
But only if supported.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.500
Only if supported.

36:57.500 --> 37:03.160
This takes me back to a few years ago where the company I worked at used Yubikeys and

37:03.160 --> 37:08.280
in Slack multiple times a day, different people accidentally touched their Yubikeys and put

37:08.280 --> 37:16.760
in their, you know, 40 character long string, most of the days.

37:16.760 --> 37:17.760
I have seen that.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.680
I see that in our chat room sometimes too.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.540
I did it one time.

37:21.540 --> 37:25.960
And Alex, you've, you've sent some of your passwords to GitHub if I remember correctly.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.240
Oh, well that's, that's different.

37:27.240 --> 37:30.360
That's just me being, being an idiot, but that's different.

37:30.360 --> 37:31.920
What's the difference?

37:31.920 --> 37:35.360
Well these strings aren't useful on their own because they're attached to a specific

37:35.360 --> 37:38.240
service and they're time limited and all that kind of stuff.

37:38.240 --> 37:42.960
So if you happen to know exactly what service I'm logging into at that specific moment in

37:42.960 --> 37:49.560
history, maybe it's useful for about the next 25 seconds, but otherwise it's useless.

37:49.560 --> 37:53.840
Well I want to talk about something you came across that really piques my interest because

37:53.840 --> 37:59.080
I'm often using Reddit as a way to discover topics that seem like might be worth discussion.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.840
And you found essentially an automatic archiver for Reddit.

38:01.840 --> 38:02.840
I did.

38:02.840 --> 38:06.680
I haven't actually tried it out yet, but there's a piece of software in the show notes linked

38:06.680 --> 38:09.080
called Expanse.

38:09.080 --> 38:15.000
And this builds itself as a fully self-hosted multi-user web app, which allows you to externally

38:15.000 --> 38:20.880
store Reddit items such as things you've saved, created, upvoted, downvoted and hidden.

38:20.880 --> 38:26.760
And this bypasses Reddit's 1000 item listing limit, which I didn't know was a limit.

38:26.760 --> 38:32.400
And so essentially there's a quick demo in the GitHub repo, short YouTube video, and

38:32.400 --> 38:33.400
that was enough to sell me.

38:33.400 --> 38:34.400
I'm hooked.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.880
I will set this up the earliest opportunity.

38:35.880 --> 38:36.880
Same.

38:36.880 --> 38:41.280
What the video really demonstrates is it creates like a mirrored environment of Reddit.

38:41.280 --> 38:46.800
So you kind of create some of the same categories of saved post, upvoted post, downvoted, submitted,

38:46.800 --> 38:47.800
commented.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.720
You know, that same kind of thing you get from your Reddit history.

38:49.720 --> 38:55.320
It mirrors that UI in a cleaner way and just presents all that information to you.

38:55.320 --> 39:00.460
And it just continues to just suck that information into your own local instance as you use Reddit

39:00.460 --> 39:01.840
like you normally might.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.560
You don't have to do anything special.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.480
Pretty much like Pocket for Reddit.

39:05.480 --> 39:06.480
Yeah.

39:06.480 --> 39:10.160
Like if, but like if everything you read just automatically went to Pocket or something,

39:10.160 --> 39:13.400
because it's everything you do on Reddit just automatically gets backed up to this thing.

39:13.400 --> 39:14.400
It's kind of brilliant.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.000
I wish I had that for all the services.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Yeah.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
Can we get that for Hacker News?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
Yeah.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
Well, we can give you that.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.780
We can give you anything that's really like all the services for everything.

39:23.780 --> 39:27.280
Have you heard of RSS?

39:27.280 --> 39:34.840
I see you found out that Bitwarden has integrated Fastmail email aliasing.

39:34.840 --> 39:42.460
So that way, when you sign up now you can generate a fastmail unique email address for

39:42.460 --> 39:44.360
a service.

39:44.360 --> 39:45.360
How great is this?

39:45.360 --> 39:46.680
Well, this is amazing.

39:46.680 --> 39:52.040
know that Google supports the plus delimiter in their email

39:52.040 --> 39:58.040
addresses. So you can say, Alex KTZ plus Twitter at Gmail or

39:58.040 --> 40:04.500
whatever, and it will send every email that Twitter has to that

40:04.500 --> 40:09.200
specific email address. The trouble is it relies on the

40:09.200 --> 40:13.120
service that's in question Twitter or whoever, to respect

40:13.120 --> 40:16.280
that. And then also when they sell that information to third

40:16.280 --> 40:22.000
parties at whatever point Elon decides to in the future, they've

40:22.000 --> 40:25.080
also got to include that plus in there because everybody knows

40:25.080 --> 40:29.040
that plus is just a delimiter. And so the real email address is

40:29.040 --> 40:33.000
just a bit before the plus. What this fast mail integration

40:33.000 --> 40:39.360
allows me to do is set up a genuine email alias. So you

40:39.360 --> 40:42.240
know, becomes two or three random words and a couple of

40:42.240 --> 40:47.520
random numbers instead of my actual email address being semi

40:47.560 --> 40:51.840
obfuscated. And it's built directly into the Bitwarden

40:51.840 --> 40:55.560
clients. So they have that generate password feature. If

40:55.560 --> 40:58.760
you if you look at the checkbox, the next one down is now a

40:58.760 --> 41:02.360
generate username box, which we've talked about before. But

41:02.360 --> 41:05.240
if you look just a little bit further down than that, there's

41:05.240 --> 41:08.120
three or four services in there and one of them is now fast

41:08.120 --> 41:13.400
mail. And so just by creating or generating an email address

41:13.440 --> 41:17.640
alias in the Bitwarden client, it will go and talk to the fast

41:17.640 --> 41:21.000
mail API create the email alias. And then from that point in

41:21.000 --> 41:26.160
history, you have a routable email address that is not your

41:26.160 --> 41:29.960
real email address, but is the alias. It's it's brilliant.

41:30.520 --> 41:35.360
You know, it feels to me like we are creating a huge void between

41:35.360 --> 41:38.960
two worlds. We now have, you know, most of us hopefully, who

41:38.960 --> 41:41.160
are well educated about passwords using password

41:41.160 --> 41:43.840
managers, you know, you mentioned YubiKey earlier, all

41:43.840 --> 41:46.560
of these things that are really great, but then I feel like most

41:46.560 --> 41:50.000
people are just not even anywhere close to using a unique

41:50.000 --> 41:54.680
email address for each service. I think we need to figure out

41:54.680 --> 41:55.680
how to bridge that gap.

41:55.800 --> 41:58.400
Well, the tooling helps, you know, building the tooling to

41:58.400 --> 42:00.440
do it. I think that's what this I think that's what this is

42:00.440 --> 42:01.760
trying to do, isn't it? Mm hmm.

42:01.760 --> 42:06.120
Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah. Okay, you win. I've been

42:06.160 --> 42:08.080
I mean, this is not a sponsored thing. I've been trying to get

42:08.080 --> 42:12.200
Brent on Bitwarden for weeks. The man loves his key pass.

42:13.480 --> 42:16.760
You know, what I like about it is that it's worked for the last

42:16.760 --> 42:20.840
15 years, and I don't need to question it. And but I've been

42:21.320 --> 42:25.160
trying to find that key reason that will make me switch and

42:25.160 --> 42:25.920
maybe this is it.

42:25.920 --> 42:30.000
I think the key reason will be when you decide it's time. If I

42:30.000 --> 42:32.720
know anything about about you, Brent, it's that you have to

42:32.720 --> 42:34.560
decide it's a good idea before you'll do something.

42:34.760 --> 42:35.760
Shouldn't that be all of us?

42:35.800 --> 42:39.840
Yeah, technically, technically. I think it might be time for some

42:39.840 --> 42:41.480
feedback, gentlemen. What do you think?

42:41.720 --> 42:45.480
Bring it on. We've been getting a lot of various tail scale

42:45.480 --> 42:49.360
alternatives sent into the show. And at first, I was like, okay,

42:49.400 --> 42:54.120
okay. But what's coming a couple of times has been net-based

42:54.120 --> 42:56.400
and I don't know if either one of you guys have seen this, but

42:56.720 --> 43:00.160
netbird is trying to check all the boxes. And I hope the tail

43:00.160 --> 43:02.400
scale team takes this as a compliment because this is

43:02.400 --> 43:05.360
clearly an indication that they're on to something that all

43:05.360 --> 43:09.960
of these open source projects have cropped up. And I suppose

43:09.960 --> 43:12.680
for a lot of folks, headscale has not been sufficient, I

43:12.680 --> 43:17.400
guess. But the netbird folks are attempting to get as close as

43:17.400 --> 43:21.360
you can to a WireGuard based mesh network. They're supporting

43:21.360 --> 43:24.480
single sign on and multi-factor authentication like tail scale

43:24.480 --> 43:27.600
does. They have some simple controls. I don't think they

43:27.600 --> 43:30.960
have the install down quite as smooth as tail scale does, but

43:31.440 --> 43:34.840
really, who would right? But you get a lot of it, you get a lot

43:34.840 --> 43:41.080
of the advantages. But you know, it's 100% a well, it doesn't

43:41.080 --> 43:43.520
have to be actually, they're also offering their own hosted

43:43.520 --> 43:46.840
implementation as well, of course, which then I'm not even

43:46.840 --> 43:49.480
sure why it's even better than tail scale. But they do have a

43:49.480 --> 43:51.920
by default, a host implementation, but they make it

43:51.920 --> 43:54.360
really clear how to do all your own self hosting if you like.

43:54.680 --> 43:57.960
This is why we were also excited about WireGuard being put in the

43:57.960 --> 44:01.960
Linux kernel a few years ago. It legitimized the project. And we

44:01.960 --> 44:05.400
hoped at the time that it would lead to this proliferation of

44:05.880 --> 44:10.480
solutions based upon it for VPN stuff. I'm so pleased to see

44:10.480 --> 44:12.280
that that's coming true. Aren't you?

44:12.520 --> 44:15.960
Yeah, absolutely. And it looks like, you know, we're gonna have

44:15.960 --> 44:20.560
a spoil of choices. So I wonder if we'll go through a period of

44:20.560 --> 44:23.480
some of these sort of proving themselves out and tail scale

44:23.480 --> 44:26.640
will probably be a leader for a while. Because they got a huge

44:26.640 --> 44:29.880
start. They have a commercial entity behind them that has some

44:29.880 --> 44:32.920
money. And they got a good product, right. But so now

44:32.920 --> 44:38.320
you're gonna see a lot of, I'd say, kind of not clones, but

44:38.360 --> 44:41.480
this kind of kind of what they are, right. And we're gonna have

44:41.480 --> 44:45.360
to see which one kind of wins out. And I think that's going to

44:45.360 --> 44:48.640
be interesting to see which one wins out. And which one ends up

44:48.640 --> 44:51.120
being the most popular in the community? Will it be tail scale

44:51.120 --> 44:54.360
and headscale for those that want self hosting? Or will it be

44:54.360 --> 44:56.960
something like netbird? So if you tried something like this

44:56.960 --> 44:59.760
out there, let us know send us a boost or go to self hosted that

44:59.760 --> 45:03.600
show slash contact and let us know your thoughts. I am just so

45:03.600 --> 45:06.480
happy with tail scale. And now that I'm doing subnet routing,

45:06.680 --> 45:10.600
and all of that I I'm really, I'm really quite pleased. I don't

45:10.600 --> 45:14.800
really see any particular reason to switch. And I'm also totally

45:14.800 --> 45:17.840
in managing some of the authentication and some of the

45:17.840 --> 45:21.080
connecting that's fine for me because I want this to work like

45:21.080 --> 45:24.840
a rock. We talked a little bit about the subnet routing at the

45:24.840 --> 45:28.360
Airbnb in Pasadena with our questionable Wi Fi situation.

45:28.880 --> 45:33.400
That's generous. And it's fascinating. I use the heck out

45:33.400 --> 45:37.040
of the subnet routing. It's amazing. Oh, it's so handy,

45:37.040 --> 45:41.240
especially for devices that aren't PCs or Raspberry Pi is

45:41.240 --> 45:44.680
that you something you can't install software on like my

45:44.680 --> 45:48.160
Victor on solar equipment and battery equipment. I can't

45:48.200 --> 45:51.360
install tail scale on that it's an appliance. But I have tail

45:51.360 --> 45:54.520
scale on my Raspberry Pi that's on the same land and I have

45:54.520 --> 45:58.160
subnet routing on. So now I'm like checking the solar when

45:58.160 --> 46:02.040
we're at the Airbnb making sure jupes is doing okay. And then

46:02.040 --> 46:04.920
you know, I wanted to check the temperatures at the studio. So I

46:04.920 --> 46:08.280
have tail scale installed from hacks on Home Assistant with

46:08.280 --> 46:11.040
subnet routing turned on. And so I'm checking the temperatures in

46:11.040 --> 46:13.680
the garage to make sure the server is okay. And I'm just

46:13.680 --> 46:19.280
using local IPS for all of it. And I'm pleased to say that I I

46:19.280 --> 46:23.000
did hope one day that this would exist that this world would be

46:23.000 --> 46:28.760
real. And so I preemptively set the RV network to a 17 to 16

46:29.400 --> 46:36.560
subnet. And the studio is a 192 168 seven subnet. And so the two

46:36.560 --> 46:39.400
are very different. And that has made life like so just made it

46:39.400 --> 46:40.360
ready to go. Yeah,

46:40.360 --> 46:43.900
when Brent was here, I had to completely re change my retool

46:43.900 --> 46:48.180
my cider my IP range in the house because there was some

46:48.180 --> 46:51.860
overlap between my house here and my dad's Starlink network

46:51.860 --> 46:54.460
because remember, I moaned in an episode, I couldn't change the

46:54.460 --> 46:57.820
ACP range. So I had to completely retool. So that's

46:57.820 --> 47:00.540
some good foresight from you there, Christopher. I tell you

47:00.540 --> 47:00.820
what,

47:01.220 --> 47:04.700
the old days, the old days of VPNing like an animal building

47:04.700 --> 47:08.060
flat networks. But let us know if you try out netbird, I'd be

47:08.060 --> 47:09.500
really curious to hear how it goes.

47:09.500 --> 47:12.400
Yeah, same. And I think in a future episode, we might do a

47:12.400 --> 47:16.120
bit bit more of a deep dive into the subnet routing that that I'm

47:16.120 --> 47:19.400
doing and the split DNS between different sites, because I think

47:19.400 --> 47:22.080
that'd be of interest to folks. So if you're interested in that,

47:22.080 --> 47:24.600
let us know at self hosted dot show slash contact.

47:24.800 --> 47:28.200
I agree. Having chatted a little bit about it at the Airbnb, I

47:28.200 --> 47:31.120
think it would be a great topic. We got some boosts into the show

47:31.120 --> 47:36.480
two and have boosted in with over 9000 9001 sats. And we also

47:36.480 --> 47:40.600
got 1024 sats from Amar, who's having some trouble getting

47:40.600 --> 47:43.120
their audio whole home audio working. So these are these are

47:43.120 --> 47:46.200
our whole home audio boosts that I wanted to follow up on. So

47:46.200 --> 47:49.020
we'll start with Nav and he writes, whole home audio as a

47:49.020 --> 47:54.240
concept has existed as long as human history. So there are

47:54.240 --> 47:57.240
plenty of solutions moving around. Rather than getting

47:57.240 --> 48:00.920
fancy with software, I might present an alternative he

48:00.920 --> 48:06.600
writes, pulse audios, network streaming, and Cody. Now why

48:06.600 --> 48:10.320
Cody, because Cody has a rich app ecosystem for remote

48:10.320 --> 48:14.680
controls and a web GUI. Plus, it supports Plex jellyfin MB, and

48:14.680 --> 48:19.000
even aircast. This solution I have been using for years now,

48:19.080 --> 48:22.880
I would never have thought of Cody, would you know, and I

48:22.880 --> 48:25.760
think it's probably worth a mention because a lot of people

48:25.760 --> 48:30.040
love Cody that listen to the show. And pulse audio network

48:30.040 --> 48:32.960
streaming has been around for years, and I never think to

48:32.960 --> 48:35.700
mention it. But I constantly hear feedback from the audience

48:35.700 --> 48:39.280
that it works pretty well. Just anything with pulse audio gives

48:39.280 --> 48:44.480
me PTSD, I think rustic as diverse boosted with 2000 sats.

48:44.760 --> 48:47.180
And he echoed a sentiment we heard from multiple people out

48:47.180 --> 48:51.440
there. What about vol milio or volumio? Sorry, I'm butchering

48:51.440 --> 48:56.360
that. But it acts as an Airplay Chromecast endpoint. He says if

48:56.360 --> 48:59.000
you want a lot of them synced, you'd have to pay but it's a

48:59.000 --> 49:01.240
good projects was worth paying for. I had a couple of

49:01.240 --> 49:04.320
recommendations for volumio. Actually, the pricing doesn't

49:04.320 --> 49:07.120
put me off too much. I don't mind necessarily paying for the

49:07.120 --> 49:10.960
right solution. I mean, the alternative would be just giving

49:10.960 --> 49:14.560
up and going for a Sonos based deployment, right and that that

49:14.560 --> 49:18.880
ain't gonna be free, is it? So the other thing that came in as

49:18.880 --> 49:22.400
a recommendation was there's a chap on YouTube called Darko

49:22.440 --> 49:24.860
that does he's got beautiful production quality on his

49:24.860 --> 49:31.800
videos. He is a hi fi audio file nerd. And he talks occasionally

49:31.800 --> 49:34.920
about how he streams music around his house. One of the

49:34.920 --> 49:37.840
recommendations I had come in was something called rune audio.

49:37.840 --> 49:41.320
It's not open source, I don't think. And it is paid does cost

49:41.320 --> 49:45.200
quite a bit per month. But you know, this will support along

49:45.200 --> 49:49.680
with volumio multiple rooms based off of Raspberry Pi and

49:49.680 --> 49:53.640
that kind of thing. I'm still stuck though, on how to actually

49:53.640 --> 49:57.400
automate the speaker component. The Raspberry Pi bit I think is

49:57.400 --> 50:00.080
actually the easy bit. I mean, there's a few options, you know,

50:00.080 --> 50:04.760
snapcast is another one out there. It's just controlling the

50:04.760 --> 50:08.160
speaker component. That's the tricky bit. The Broadlink

50:08.160 --> 50:11.640
infrared emitter blaster that I talked about in the last episode

50:12.440 --> 50:16.920
sort of kind of is behaving itself. But I've ordered the

50:16.920 --> 50:20.200
components to build myself a blaster based off an ESP device

50:20.200 --> 50:22.920
as well. See if that's any better than the Broadlink stuff

50:22.920 --> 50:26.560
because it's not, it's just not reliable enough. Yeah, thanks

50:26.560 --> 50:30.000
for the recommendation. I'll take a look at volumio a bit

50:30.000 --> 50:32.040
more seriously over the next next few weeks when I'm not

50:32.040 --> 50:33.040
traveling to LA.

50:33.320 --> 50:35.560
The shame to hear you're having some trouble with the IR blaster

50:35.560 --> 50:37.680
because when you're doing the music stuff, and you just you

50:37.680 --> 50:39.760
just want to hit a button and have it go, you know, you want

50:39.760 --> 50:43.160
it to be a really kind of chill experience. That's not, it's not

50:43.160 --> 50:44.560
when you want to do the troubleshooting.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.680
It seems to me like the intersection of two very

50:46.680 --> 50:51.880
different worlds, you know, the the hardware button, audio file

50:51.880 --> 50:55.440
grade box that's sitting, you know, next to your TV or your

50:55.480 --> 50:59.520
entertainment system feels like maybe high end technology of a

50:59.520 --> 51:03.200
very different era. And you're trying to kind of marry the two.

51:03.200 --> 51:07.080
So I understand there's clearly some some challenge there. But

51:07.080 --> 51:09.560
wouldn't it be great if they just made friends?

51:12.640 --> 51:15.600
Quick code wanted to know if anybody has any tips on content

51:15.600 --> 51:18.040
request systems for music, you know, how there's things out

51:18.040 --> 51:22.000
there like overseer and other tools for like books and stuff

51:22.000 --> 51:25.840
like that. If anybody has suggestions for music, send them

51:25.840 --> 51:30.960
into the show. And then drew oof, or Dr. oof, boosted in with

51:30.960 --> 51:36.960
5678 sats. And he wanted to give a plus one to the zoos z wave

51:36.960 --> 51:40.640
switches, specifically the 700 series. Thank you very much for

51:40.640 --> 51:42.960
that detail. He says I've been through a bunch of different

51:42.960 --> 51:45.840
brands of smart switches over the years. And the zoos have

51:45.840 --> 51:49.520
been that zoos have been the most reliable, affordable and

51:49.520 --> 51:52.880
configurable to date. I'm a network security engineer by

51:52.880 --> 51:55.720
trade. And I've an enterprise grade Wi Fi throughout my house

51:55.720 --> 51:59.920
and property for different APS. And even that can't keep up with

51:59.920 --> 52:03.640
my smart switches. Interesting. My house is long and narrow. So

52:03.640 --> 52:06.520
it just turns out 900 megahertz mesh network works better than

52:06.520 --> 52:11.480
Wi Fi. Thanks for the great podcast. I do love 900 mega

52:11.480 --> 52:17.560
hertz. I love 900 megahertz radio so much. I wish we could

52:17.560 --> 52:20.360
have stayed there. mega strike three boosted in with 3000 sats

52:20.360 --> 52:23.200
Hey, Chris and Alex love the show. I picked up an IKEA ZigBee

52:23.200 --> 52:26.320
light bulb. As I begin to build out my smart home. Any

52:26.320 --> 52:29.080
recommendations for a home assistant ZigBee router?

52:29.280 --> 52:32.800
Currently, I'm looking at the con be two thanks, as always.

52:32.840 --> 52:36.600
Well, he's already got my recommendation that can be I use

52:36.600 --> 52:43.600
the really cheap sewn off one to start with. And it was it was

52:43.640 --> 52:49.200
not good. It was just not good. But the con be two has been my

52:49.200 --> 52:52.400
favorite phrase rock solid since I installed it.

52:54.160 --> 52:57.480
You know what, though, I agree. In fact, I don't even have like

52:57.480 --> 52:59.760
mine hanging off a dongle. It's just like hooked up right to the

52:59.760 --> 53:02.680
back of my home assistant blue in the studio. And I'm talking

53:02.680 --> 53:05.920
to devices that are on the other end of the house. I will also

53:05.920 --> 53:11.160
link to the Zalesh ZigBee 3.0 stick that cloud free.shop sells

53:11.160 --> 53:14.080
because I would imagine if cloud free is selling that that's

53:14.080 --> 53:17.880
probably a pretty good device. But I to own the con be two USB

53:17.880 --> 53:20.680
ZigBee gateway and have been very happy with it and home

53:20.680 --> 53:24.280
assistant just picked it up right away. So that was really

53:24.280 --> 53:24.840
nice.

53:25.200 --> 53:27.640
Don't forget, we still got a coupon code over at cloud free

53:27.640 --> 53:30.280
dot shop. If you put self hosted in there, you'll probably get a

53:30.280 --> 53:31.440
dollar off whatever you're buying.

53:31.440 --> 53:36.960
At user 3513 boosted in with 8192 sets. I'd love to know how

53:36.960 --> 53:40.240
Alex is running Proxmox and Docker on a systems. Are you

53:40.240 --> 53:45.120
running an Ubuntu VM on top of Proxmox? Or containers? Did you

53:45.120 --> 53:48.280
use a bare metal Linux and then somehow hack the packages to

53:48.280 --> 53:52.800
install Proxmox onto it? Tell user 3513 Alex,

53:52.960 --> 53:53.360
you know,

53:53.680 --> 53:57.880
this question has been coming up in discord a lot in the last

53:57.880 --> 54:03.360
month or so. And it's like something has changed and people

54:03.360 --> 54:06.240
just need to need to know exactly what I'm doing to copy

54:06.240 --> 54:07.360
it, which I don't understand.

54:07.840 --> 54:10.640
They can't buy pies anymore. So they're finally giving in and

54:10.640 --> 54:12.920
buying x86 systems and going Proxmox.

54:12.960 --> 54:15.360
They are very sensible people, you know, they should, you know,

54:16.040 --> 54:21.240
you should you should consider doing that. Perfect media

54:21.240 --> 54:23.880
server.com would be where I'd send people for actual

54:23.880 --> 54:28.280
documentation on what I'm doing. I put a new page up there in

54:28.280 --> 54:33.760
May, I think badgers stack in in May, just to just to tell

54:33.760 --> 54:36.560
because I got was getting so many questions. What are you

54:36.560 --> 54:39.280
doing, Alex? What are you doing? And I'm like, well, okay, here

54:39.280 --> 54:41.440
it is. Here's the hardware. I'm using the exact hardware, the

54:41.440 --> 54:45.480
CPU, the the OS, all that kind of stuff. So in the original

54:45.480 --> 54:48.400
perfect meter server guides, I used to recommend virtualizing

54:48.400 --> 54:52.640
Ubuntu, and then passing through all of the drive

54:52.640 --> 54:57.200
controllers to those virtual machines. That was in the days

54:57.200 --> 55:02.480
before I was an absolute quick sync snob. And if you recall in

55:02.480 --> 55:06.880
the show, a long time ago, also, I've written blog posts about

55:06.880 --> 55:11.040
it. And it's on perfect media server.com. I was I was trying

55:11.040 --> 55:16.880
to do something called GVTG to split the quick sync GPU, the

55:16.880 --> 55:20.920
IGPU up between multiple virtual machines and pass it through

55:20.920 --> 55:24.120
and all that kind of stuff. It just didn't work. The

55:24.120 --> 55:27.720
performance was no good. And the complexity was off the charts.

55:27.760 --> 55:32.480
And you know how it goes. So essentially, I decided at that

55:32.480 --> 55:36.920
point, I've got no option if I want hardware transcoding using

55:36.920 --> 55:40.560
quicksync, rather than having my Jules Eon box pull 400 watts, I

55:40.560 --> 55:43.760
only want to pull four watts when I'm doing a transcode. And

55:43.760 --> 55:47.880
who wouldn't want that? I've got to run Plex on the host. And

55:47.880 --> 55:52.480
that's it. That really drove the next wave of my builds, which

55:52.480 --> 55:55.800
I've been doing now for about 18 months, I would say. All of my

55:55.800 --> 55:59.040
containers run directly on the host. Home Assistant itself

55:59.040 --> 56:03.760
runs as a has OS VM, or whatever they call it these days. That's

56:03.760 --> 56:08.200
the only VM I have in Proxmox is literally just Home Assistant.

56:08.200 --> 56:11.840
It's a bit of a waste. I mean, occasionally I spin up a, you

56:11.840 --> 56:16.440
know, an Ubuntu thing for testing or fedora thing or

56:16.440 --> 56:19.080
whatever, just literally for testing. But in terms of

56:19.080 --> 56:22.480
production, everything's on the Proxmox host. It's all done in

56:22.480 --> 56:25.080
Ansible in my GitHub repo, which I'll put a link to in the show

56:25.080 --> 56:28.200
notes as well. And it's just really simple. It's just an

56:28.200 --> 56:32.040
install of Debian with Proxmox installed on top of it. I used

56:32.040 --> 56:35.880
the Proxmox documentation to achieve that. There's not much

56:35.880 --> 56:39.040
to it. It's just Linux, really. It's very boring.

56:40.440 --> 56:42.800
I think that's a good thing. I was we were talking before we

56:42.800 --> 56:44.320
hit record. I'm like, you know, there's a lot of things about

56:44.320 --> 56:46.680
Linux are getting boring, but that's what you need when it

56:46.680 --> 56:50.240
becomes like this layer in the industry. It just needs to work.

56:50.280 --> 56:53.400
So that's great. And we'll have a link to Alex's high level

56:53.400 --> 56:58.680
overview in the notes, including some links to also, as Alex is

56:58.680 --> 57:00.840
adding them right now to documentation on how to get

57:00.840 --> 57:02.480
Proxmox running on Debian 11.

57:02.560 --> 57:03.520
The Badger Stack.

57:03.800 --> 57:05.040
The Badger Stack.

57:06.280 --> 57:10.160
Well, it can be confusing because Proxmox provide an ISO

57:10.200 --> 57:13.000
directly so you can install Proxmox directly from an ISO

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
just, you know, from the project. Or you can install

57:18.000 --> 57:21.200
Debian and then install Proxmox on top of it. And that can

57:21.200 --> 57:24.560
confuse some people. Either route is completely valid. One

57:24.560 --> 57:28.360
is slightly more hands on there than the other. There's no real

57:28.360 --> 57:31.360
preference in my mind as to which one works better. Just do

57:31.360 --> 57:33.280
whatever makes you feel warm and cozy.

57:33.600 --> 57:35.960
I'm wondering how you feel about this next one, Alex, John A

57:35.960 --> 57:40.600
boosting with 10,000 SATs. And he after listening to the last

57:40.600 --> 57:44.840
episode is yoloing into setting up his own email server. No.

57:44.880 --> 57:47.960
Yeah, yeah. He also was checking out pod verse, which is awesome

57:48.000 --> 57:52.240
new podcast apps. And we also heard from P4 P4, John, who

57:52.240 --> 57:55.280
says, I've started self hosting my own email server this year.

57:55.320 --> 57:58.720
I got a business Comcast connection with a static IP. And

57:58.720 --> 58:02.400
I'm using, you know, host. It's going great. We're somehow when

58:02.400 --> 58:04.600
we say, I don't know if it's a good idea. People are like,

58:04.880 --> 58:07.880
thanks, guys. I'm doing it. You guys are crazy.

58:08.120 --> 58:10.440
I don't think it's a good idea to send us a million dollars.

58:10.440 --> 58:12.240
That would be an awful idea, don't you?

58:12.600 --> 58:18.480
Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely a bad idea to know. So I see, you

58:18.480 --> 58:19.760
know, I just think it's interesting.

58:19.800 --> 58:22.320
So John, you can send us an email from your shiny new email

58:22.320 --> 58:24.920
server to tell us how it's going, huh? And if we receive

58:24.920 --> 58:27.640
it, we'll let you know. Right?

58:28.320 --> 58:30.640
Yeah, definitely. Also, let me know how the pod verse

58:30.640 --> 58:33.640
transition goes, John, I'm gonna expect a boost from pod verse in

58:33.640 --> 58:36.480
the future. Also, I just want to give a quick shout out. We got

58:36.480 --> 58:40.760
5555 sats from soul trust, sending in just some love for

58:40.760 --> 58:43.360
the show just wanted to wish us well, I thought that was nice.

58:43.840 --> 58:48.360
And then, right, you got this one right. Schmitzfeld, I think

58:48.360 --> 58:52.040
it was mitzvah, he says that he just want to send us a series

58:52.040 --> 58:56.440
of ducks, Huey, Louie, and Dewey. And we got 3000 sats from

58:56.440 --> 59:01.400
four legged emu, who says he's loving calyx on his pixel. So

59:01.400 --> 59:04.960
we get it. I switched to graphene. And now I'm hearing

59:04.960 --> 59:08.680
about calyx constantly. I heard you were testing graphene. So

59:08.680 --> 59:11.360
maybe you need to switch and text calyx. Maybe I should just

59:11.360 --> 59:13.920
go back to the iPhone because this is just it's too much. It's

59:13.920 --> 59:16.680
too much. But we do love the boost. We read all of them. We

59:16.680 --> 59:19.000
only feature some of them on the shows now just to keep things

59:19.000 --> 59:22.160
tight. But we do appreciate everybody who sends one in. If

59:22.160 --> 59:24.240
you'd like to boost the show, you can grab a new podcasting

59:24.240 --> 59:27.200
app new podcast apps.com. Or if you don't want to switch

59:27.200 --> 59:32.760
podcast apps, you can use breeze br ez. technology and keep your

59:32.760 --> 59:35.800
dang podcast app. I think probably Albie deserves a

59:35.800 --> 59:38.280
mention as well. Albie is a way to do it from the web. If you

59:38.280 --> 59:41.400
don't want to use a mobile app at all. And the Albie team seems

59:41.400 --> 59:43.320
to be really solid. They're creating some great open source

59:43.320 --> 59:46.760
code. I had a little call with one of their co founders. I

59:46.760 --> 59:50.400
really like where they're going a l b y for that. Can we give a

59:50.400 --> 59:55.920
little pluggy pug to office hours dot hair? Yeah, it's

59:55.920 --> 59:58.280
something about plugs and hair but office hours dot hair.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.400
Lucky episode 13. I think it was we covered our our some of

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:07.200
the shenanigans on our trip. And then in the most recent Linux

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.840
unplugged, we covered our JPL trip to which how great was the

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:15.480
JPL trip? Alex, that was the JPL trip. I just can't process it.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.760
Did that really happen to us? Like we're just normal people.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.120
Something like that doesn't happen to normal people. Does

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.400
it? It was so cool. And and to see the clipper to see them

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:29.400
working on the next mission. The Europa clipper. Oh, so Chris

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.400
last night to tuning into the live cam that you can get for

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:36.480
there. Oh, cool. Yeah, on YouTube. Go look up the if you

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.400
look up the Europa clipper stream. It's on there. I've

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.640
checked it several times. And they've added a lot more to it

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.280
since we saw it. Wow, that's, that's so cool. I'm just so

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.920
grateful. I know I put a little clip in the next unplugged for

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.880
you, saying how great the audience is. And it sounds like

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.840
a cliche. But genuinely, I think you said it that it's amazing.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.360
We had, you know, 20 people show up for the tour and about double

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.400
that for the meetup. Not one person got lost. Everybody was

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.240
on time. Everybody was friendly. They brought stories

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.120
they brought, you know, I was just like, does any other

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:12.480
podcast network have such an amazing audience? I don't know.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.280
But ours is pretty great. I don't think so. How could they

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.200
because we took all the good ones.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:22.480
True. I also learned so much just by chatting with people.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.720
Alex, I know you were fascinated, but basically all

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.400
night because I was kind of hanging around you and learning

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.400
a bunch of stuff. But Chris, you were having a great time. And it

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.760
was almost like 10pm.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.440
Yeah, oh, we went for our meetup went for five hours

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.200
strong, and I still didn't get to everybody. But let's, let's

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.360
be clear here, Alex saved the night. Because our guest of the

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:47.800
night, Tim can from JPL brought a very exclusive little device,

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.760
he brought the computer from the Mars Copter, like that, you

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.320
know, the earth version, the test version, the prototype

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.880
version, he brought that for show and tell. So we can all see

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.720
like just the parts that we don't recognize. And so you

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.320
know, it's in this bag, and it's like secret top, or it's like

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.440
private property of NASA and JPL, like it's, and then it's

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.240
inside like this sealed case even, you know, and it was like

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.920
really a big deal. And Tim bless his heart. You know, I think

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.280
with everything going on, he got up, walked away, left it on the

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.920
bench. He left it on the bench.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.520
We very nearly had our own iPhone four moment, didn't we?

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.040
Very nearly. Yeah, you tapped him on the shoulder. And you're

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.000
like, I think you forgot something. And I think he was

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.720
extremely grateful. A little bit of history right there. Yeah.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.520
What a lovely guy. What a lovely guy. Yeah, it was really nice of

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.800
him to help us make all that happen. And then to make it to

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.680
the meetup as well and bring a little show and tell for

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.840
everybody. Just so cool. Really, really a great experience

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.600
something you'll never forget, you know? Yeah.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.280
Huge thanks to Tim. Huge thanks to everybody at JB. But of

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.080
course, thanks to Linode as well for enabling us all to go down

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.760
there and take the tour, you know?

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.320
Yeah, absolutely. They, they really came through for us. And

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.280
you know, we had some great swag, we got to give away swag to

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.120
people who came to JPL and came to all the meetups to Linode

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.880
gave us an updated shirt for the road with the new route on

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:15.280
there and all that and brighter, bolder colors. So awesome. You

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.000

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.160

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:54.160
meetups pretty heavily for the last few months. I will say if

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.520
you're going to be in Raleigh around Halloween at all things

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.440
open. I'm going to be in town obviously because I live here.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.640
But so is cheese bacon longtime friend of the network. I think

system 76 are sending him over to man a booth for the

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:11.560
conference. So we may do an informal meetup. Keep an eye on

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.400
the matrix rally room. And we'll talk about any stuff that's

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.320
going to happen in there. I mentioned in the shows too, of

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.200
course, but the details will be in the matrix room.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.520
