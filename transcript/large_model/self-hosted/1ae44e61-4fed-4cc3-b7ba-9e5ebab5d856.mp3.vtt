WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.400
Since our last episode I have been just every single night building something new trying something new for my home server setup

00:08.400 --> 00:15.820
I feel like I've I've really rebounded from the death of my Raspberry Pi and now I'm just like trying out different setups

00:15.820 --> 00:21.080
I'm really just going out having fun live in life experiencing different things

00:21.080 --> 00:28.900
I'm not getting committed to any serious configurations or setups. I'm just dabbling and experimenting and really enjoying myself

00:28.900 --> 00:32.300
Sowing your seed in the field of Linux. I take it

00:33.460 --> 00:36.440
Absolutely, and things were just going really great

00:37.820 --> 00:39.820
Until last night. Oh

00:40.180 --> 00:42.100
But we'll get to that we'll get to that in the show

00:42.100 --> 00:47.020
There's so much to get into today that I want to save it for a little bit because I know you've been at an event

00:47.020 --> 00:53.220
Recently, we also have been thinking about doing a little shout out to the community trying to get somebody who might be a discord

00:53.220 --> 00:55.960
Bot wizard to help us come up with a title bot for the show

00:55.960 --> 01:01.920
So there's a lot to cover today plus towards the end of the show. We've got some great feedback some good questions

01:01.920 --> 01:07.760
I've got some new hardware updates. So I said, well, I'll tell you about it later. Okay. Oh, it's such tease

01:07.760 --> 01:12.560
I think I'll stick around see see what see what's been happening. Stay tuned and find out Alex

01:13.200 --> 01:18.900
Exactly. Well very quickly. Let's just cover the title bot first shall we very simple requirements

01:18.900 --> 01:21.640
We want something that you type, you know bang, you know

01:21.640 --> 01:29.340
Exclamation mark start show and that starts the timer running and then ideally publishes any any bang suggest

01:29.600 --> 01:34.040
Titles to a little web page which we can rank by a number of votes

01:34.040 --> 01:37.760
I can add a voting thing if you've been with JB for a while

01:37.760 --> 01:42.080
You remember JB titles comm something like that that we used to have in IRC

01:42.480 --> 01:45.220
but for the modern age in discord would be

01:45.220 --> 01:52.620
Bang tidy. Yeah, cuz we've been live streaming now for weeks over at Jupiter tube every other Wednesday, and we put our discord up there

01:53.300 --> 01:56.380
we've got a live chat room in our discord and

01:57.820 --> 02:05.020
The thing is we've been podcasting for so long our title making happeners are broken and we just cannot title these things

02:05.020 --> 02:09.460
So we need to crowdsource that and it gives people a chance to participate live and come up with a title if you want to

02:09.460 --> 02:13.380
Help us build a bot reach out and let us know. Yeah, if it was up to me every episode would be called

02:13.380 --> 02:15.380
Linux and stuff

02:15.780 --> 02:22.020
Our buddy Joe's approach and just drop titles all together. He convinced me to do that with Linux action news best thing ever

02:22.020 --> 02:27.140
Yeah, well news is kind of yeah, that's what I different. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right

02:27.140 --> 02:30.260
So I'm a little jelly you've been at all things open today

02:30.260 --> 02:34.380
I have right on my right on my doorstep a great big open source for

02:35.060 --> 02:40.940
5,000 person open source conference right on my doorstep for four to five thousand. Yes

02:40.940 --> 02:46.820
That's what I've been told. Yeah, I kind of almost feel like maybe this is the new Linux fest. Am I right?

02:46.820 --> 02:50.980
Is it worth going to should I travel to this? Give me your take well, it's a sort of semi

02:51.620 --> 02:55.580
Commercial conference. It's it's in a bit of a weird spot. If you ask me it's not like

02:56.860 --> 03:03.340
Linux fest Northwest which is completely hippie and free open-source love fest and it's not something like kubecon

03:03.340 --> 03:08.660
Which is just almost entirely sales pitches. It seems to be to be somewhere in the middle

03:08.660 --> 03:15.940
like it's it's mostly commercial sponsored stuff and there's a handful of talks given by real people and

03:15.940 --> 03:20.660
The rest are given by employees of companies who would like you to go and use their service mesh

03:20.660 --> 03:27.140
Implementation for example, or whatever it might be but on the whole the quality of the sessions was okay

03:27.140 --> 03:34.740
I think probably about half of the sessions I went to were good and the other half were really not good

03:34.740 --> 03:36.740
What made them really not good?

03:36.740 --> 03:42.020
Were they sales pitches? Yeah, a mixture of stuff like that. Like it was clearly just I mean a

03:42.660 --> 03:50.500
45-minute long infomercial or the presenter was an intern and had never spoken to an audience before

03:50.500 --> 03:56.900
Or you know that those kinds of things really so maybe the bar was a little low on who was accepted to speak

03:57.460 --> 04:02.420
Yeah, well, I mean the reason I was interested in going was because Jim Salter was down to talk about ZFS

04:02.420 --> 04:04.420
And who doesn't want to go and listen to Jim

04:04.420 --> 04:08.420
Say how bad every other file system in the world except ZFS is, right?

04:08.420 --> 04:12.340
Poor guy wasn't feeling terribly well though. So he pulled out at the last minute and

04:13.380 --> 04:19.540
We were left hanging unfortunately, no Jim Salters ZFS lovefest. You got to get your updated ZFS talking points

04:19.540 --> 04:24.340
What are you gonna do? Yeah, I know. Well, what I could do instead is talk about WSL 2

04:24.900 --> 04:27.300
Scott Hanselman who is a Microsoft employee

04:28.020 --> 04:32.980
I have to say was probably the best presenter that was at the conference and he did a great job

04:32.980 --> 04:36.820
at the conference and he just had this wonderful way with him where

04:37.460 --> 04:44.580
He was funny and actually engaging and obviously clearly knew that the subject he was talking about extremely well

04:45.140 --> 04:51.540
And he did a very slick demo of how WSL 2 and github and vs code and windows

04:52.180 --> 04:53.700
are actually

04:53.700 --> 04:56.180
the perfect developer platform these days

04:57.380 --> 05:00.500
And who would have thought who had on their bingo card 10 years ago

05:00.500 --> 05:04.020
that Microsoft would nail the developer experience

05:04.660 --> 05:05.620
on

05:05.620 --> 05:09.940
Linux on windows and just make it all work seamlessly together. I mean

05:10.740 --> 05:12.500
mind blown

05:12.500 --> 05:13.940
well

05:13.940 --> 05:18.660
Yes, and no, I mean they have I I think actually to give credit where credit is due

05:19.300 --> 05:21.780
I think Microsoft's pivot to focus on

05:22.660 --> 05:25.780
Linux open source and I would say broader

05:25.780 --> 05:32.420
Development tools and development platforms, which I think is really what they've done. That has been very impressive

05:33.220 --> 05:37.300
They deserve all the credit. You very rarely see these empires these

05:38.100 --> 05:41.860
massive corporations make these huge pivots

05:42.740 --> 05:47.380
a lot of times companies just get locked into a way of doing business and they just

05:48.260 --> 05:52.180
Only have tunnel vision and they fight everything else to try to protect that business model

05:52.180 --> 05:55.300
Microsoft figured out that they had to sacrifice a little bit of windows

05:55.940 --> 06:00.900
And adopt and embrace a little bit more Linux open source and things like that to that to that end

06:00.900 --> 06:04.580
I give them total and absolute compliments. I think they've done very well

06:05.300 --> 06:07.300
And I think it's legitimate in a lot of ways

06:07.700 --> 06:12.920
But I think the Achilles heel to this dream fantasy that they're saying where you can have windows with your compatibility

06:13.300 --> 06:19.460
And your corporate integration and you have WSL and you just using github and vs code and everything's great because edge is based on chrome

06:19.460 --> 06:20.980
So let's have fun

06:20.980 --> 06:22.980
the problem is

06:23.300 --> 06:28.100
It's still windows. It's still got the registry. It's still using NTFS

06:28.420 --> 06:34.020
It still has an onion layered approach to the control panel and all the legacy stuff that comes in there

06:34.100 --> 06:38.180
It still does all of the things that windows does it's still

06:39.140 --> 06:46.580
Absolutely subject to the corporate tax strategy of Microsoft and whatever thing they're pursuing for that particular release cycle

06:46.580 --> 06:52.980
for that particular release cycle windows is absolutely still influenced by it and as a user you have to put up with it and

06:52.980 --> 06:56.340
Wait for the next fad so they can swap it out and put the other thing in there

06:56.580 --> 07:02.500
I mean like right now right they're bundling in teams or the bundle in Cortana or they'll put ads in the start menu

07:02.740 --> 07:07.640
It just doesn't matter because they're always doing something else because one of the fiefdoms in Microsoft

07:08.180 --> 07:14.260
Has finally gotten their chance their moment and they're going to get the numbers and they get something built into windows and you will always

07:14.260 --> 07:19.160
Always have to put up with that corporate strategy tax with the windows workstation

07:19.220 --> 07:26.180
And despite what they say the driver model on windows still blows the printing subsystem on windows still blows

07:26.260 --> 07:29.380
The disk io subsystem on windows still blows

07:29.460 --> 07:36.180
The windows ui is still bloated old and has lots of legacy if you go just one layer below their new lacquer

07:36.580 --> 07:42.100
And so yeah, you can you can run a linux kernel in a really great hyper virtualized environment good for you

07:42.100 --> 07:45.780
And vs code is a pretty good product, but I could run vs code on linux

07:45.860 --> 07:50.820
I could have a real linux subsystem with a real linux kernel that has real file systems

07:51.060 --> 07:58.100
And doesn't have all that windows legacy bullcrap. And so it's close. Yeah, but your your audio wouldn't work though. Yeah. Yeah, right

07:58.660 --> 08:05.140
I mean you're right and there are absolutely there are situations where like linux doesn't cut it and I acknowledge that

08:05.860 --> 08:09.140
And that's why I think it is really great. The wsl is as good as it is

08:09.140 --> 08:11.620
Because there are people that just have no choice, too

08:12.180 --> 08:15.300
And I have to use windows and for them the subsystems there

08:15.380 --> 08:19.700
Well, if I want to run flight sim, there is no other way for me to run flight sim than to run windows

08:19.780 --> 08:22.740
Yeah, and there's uh, you know, like, uh, I can't remember the name of it

08:22.740 --> 08:28.900
But there's some game that my son dylan loves and so he's you know, he's snuck in a dual boot into windows now

08:28.980 --> 08:32.900
so that way you can play that one game and it kills me, but I have to acknowledge like

08:33.940 --> 08:37.540
If you want to run that application, you got to have windows. So it absolutely has its place

08:37.540 --> 08:39.940
But this utopia that they're painting for developers

08:40.980 --> 08:45.860
You know, I just can't I can't I can't subscribe to it. I can't say as I disagree with anything you said

08:45.940 --> 08:48.900
but uh, they did they have solved an

08:49.540 --> 08:54.180
Absolutely huge problem, which is encapsulated development environment. So

08:55.140 --> 08:59.160
Uh scott in his talk showed us something called development containers

08:59.700 --> 09:06.260
And these essentially are a json manifest of all the requirements. You need to develop a specific project in his example

09:06.260 --> 09:09.220
It was uh, an oh, oh my posh

09:09.780 --> 09:13.860
Power shell kind of candy looking to a terminal pretty fire thing

09:15.380 --> 09:18.340
And he downloaded the he cloned the git repo

09:18.980 --> 09:23.140
Vs code automatically picked up the json file that was stored in the correct folder

09:23.540 --> 09:29.060
It pre-installed all the dependencies in the container a docker container on windows running in the linux subsystem

09:29.700 --> 09:32.900
For windows or whatever the hell it's called. Yeah, and uh,

09:32.900 --> 09:39.060
Within, you know a minute of cloning this repo. He was working or well hypothetically presentation working

09:39.140 --> 09:43.140
You know what? I mean that that does sound really slick. I gotta be I mean that does sound slick

09:43.220 --> 09:46.660
I mean a good part of my master's degree sort of five six seven years ago was

09:46.980 --> 09:54.180
Trying to solve this encapsulated development environment thing and that was what led me to docker containers back then and uh, you know

09:54.180 --> 10:00.020
We were looking at packer vms and and you know sending q cow two images around to people and having like a special

10:00.020 --> 10:04.340
university version of linux just for this, uh computer science course and

10:05.220 --> 10:10.340
God damn it microsoft went and figured it out microsoft. It's crazy. They did

10:11.060 --> 10:16.100
Uh, it's pretty legit and I have to say too like they recognized they needed a better terminal

10:16.180 --> 10:19.860
They absolutely did they created the windows terminal. They made it an open source project

10:19.860 --> 10:26.100
And it seems like it's a pretty good terminal like directx accelerated terminal. I mean, it's crazy. Yeah

10:26.100 --> 10:30.820
That's so funny. It really it truly is it's I have to mention that this is something my buddy

10:30.900 --> 10:36.500
Michael dominic and I have been talking about for a while on coder radio because we often talk about the tooling for development workstations

10:36.980 --> 10:39.300
And he's kind of been through this whole journey

10:40.020 --> 10:42.020
mac to windows

10:43.220 --> 10:50.260
Wsl and like the mecca that that opened up for him and also of course vs code and also integration with azure and just like

10:50.500 --> 10:52.020
He went all in for a bit

10:52.020 --> 10:56.500
And now he's actually back on linux as his primary development workstation. And so the whole journey

10:57.140 --> 11:01.380
I I think has been really interesting at coder.show if you are interested

11:01.700 --> 11:04.100
But I want to hear about the meetup. I know you had a chance to

11:04.740 --> 11:09.860
Go say hi to some audience members you guys coordinated in the matrix chat. It sounded like it went pretty well

11:10.580 --> 11:13.220
Absolutely. Yeah. Well, I I bumped into a couple of listeners

11:13.780 --> 11:17.780
Throughout the the day who somehow recognized me from my voice like it's distinctive

11:17.780 --> 11:21.940
Uh, so we've got a little clip from a couple of listeners that we met up with for lunch

11:22.500 --> 11:26.740
So i'm here at all things open with reed and john. How are you like in the conference so far john?

11:26.900 --> 11:30.820
It's been pretty good learned a lot. Uh been to a bunch of different

11:31.780 --> 11:33.620
sessions and

11:33.620 --> 11:38.660
Gotten to meet some cool people and meet up with uh, the the jb crowd here

11:39.140 --> 11:42.980
Yeah, and we've been working on a lot of stuff. We've been working on a lot of stuff

11:42.980 --> 11:47.460
uh and getting a lot of people and meet up with uh, the the jb crowd here

11:47.940 --> 11:49.940
Yeah, and we use the element

11:50.020 --> 11:54.820
To jb matrix to kind of have a little mini meet up in the lobby of the conference. Didn't we?

11:55.540 --> 12:00.660
And uh reed. I know you've been listening for a little while. How are you liking the conference as well? Oh, it's great. Yeah a very

12:01.620 --> 12:09.220
wide range of people here from uh, community to corporate uh, and and lots to learn lots to

12:09.220 --> 12:11.680
Lots to see and lots of great people to meet.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.920
Any standout sessions for either of you?

12:14.920 --> 12:20.120
There was a beer brewing with IoT and JavaScript

12:20.120 --> 12:24.400
that I knew almost nothing about any of those subjects.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.600
And now I know a little bit about all of those subjects.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.760
You're at the Dunning-Kruger effect style moment, right?

12:29.760 --> 12:32.000
Where you don't realize how little you actually know.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.520
You feel vaguely competent.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.400
Completely.

12:34.400 --> 12:35.560
How about you, John?

12:35.560 --> 12:38.800
There was a great, it was half of a two for one

12:38.800 --> 12:40.120
that was on burnout.

12:40.120 --> 12:43.600
And it was a really good just kind of think

12:43.600 --> 12:47.760
about not burning out and ways to kind of handle that stress

12:47.760 --> 12:50.200
and take breaks and things like that.

12:50.200 --> 12:50.840
Yeah, very good.

12:50.840 --> 12:55.240
I've certainly found burnout myself at times

12:55.240 --> 12:57.240
can be quite challenging to deal with,

12:57.240 --> 12:59.160
particularly during the last couple of years.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.080
So it's very good.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.920
Well, I wish you all the best for the rest of the afternoon.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.840
And I hope you enjoy the rest of the conference.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.680
Thank you.

13:05.680 --> 13:07.560
I do hear what you're saying in there, though,

13:07.560 --> 13:10.120
that it's a pretty wide range that All Things Open

13:10.120 --> 13:11.120
is trying to cover.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.880
Although I like the idea about having sessions on burnout.

13:14.880 --> 13:18.280
And who doesn't like a session about automating beer brewing

13:18.280 --> 13:21.840
with Linux and open source technologies, huh?

13:21.840 --> 13:25.200
So the nice thing was the Raleigh downtown

13:25.200 --> 13:27.880
is a pretty small little place if you've never been.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.240
And Red Hat Tower, as we call it, The Tower,

13:31.240 --> 13:34.200
is only two blocks from the convention center,

13:34.200 --> 13:35.320
a short five minute walk.

13:35.320 --> 13:39.240
So I was able to meet up with these listeners, Reed and John,

13:39.240 --> 13:41.920
and take them to lunch at The Tower today, which,

13:41.920 --> 13:44.360
as we record, is Wednesday.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.400
Oh, good, did you get more sauce while you were there?

13:47.400 --> 13:49.200
Alex likes to pick up a little extra sauce

13:49.200 --> 13:50.880
while he's at the Red Hat Tower.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.000
So I think what Chris is referring to there

13:54.000 --> 13:56.240
is Boar's Head, you know the sandwich company?

13:56.240 --> 13:56.920
You think.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.320
You know what I'm referring to.

13:58.320 --> 14:02.800
Make this absolutely delicious, gourmet, spicy mayonnaise,

14:02.800 --> 14:04.400
chipotle mayonnaise style thing.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.480
Yeah, no, it's great.

14:05.480 --> 14:05.960
It is.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.600
And I cannot get enough of it on turkey and provolone sandwiches

14:08.600 --> 14:10.000
when I'm at home during the day.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.960
So what I used to do at The Tower before COVID

14:11.960 --> 14:13.400
was any time I went in The Tower,

14:13.400 --> 14:17.000
I used to go in and buy a bottle of this sauce off the vendor

14:17.000 --> 14:19.360
for, I don't know, like $10.

14:19.360 --> 14:24.200
To put it in context, a tiny little tub of this stuff

14:24.200 --> 14:26.320
from the supermarket is $5.

14:26.320 --> 14:30.160
But a commercial catering size bottle of this sauce,

14:30.160 --> 14:32.200
he gave me for $10 a time.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.280
So I used to just slather this stuff on.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.920
Whereas now I have to treat it like gold dust

14:35.920 --> 14:39.720
because we've got different vendors now after COVID.

14:39.720 --> 14:40.320
That's a bummer.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.400
OK, all right.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.760
So lunch at The Tower, that's awfully nice.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.640
That sounds great.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.480
Yeah, it was nice.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.120
We also met up with Jay from Learnernix TV.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.040
Not going to mess up the creative process.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.240
I'm here with Jay from Learnernix TV.

14:53.240 --> 14:53.760
Hello, Jay.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.360
How are you?

14:54.360 --> 14:54.880
Doing well.

14:54.880 --> 14:55.640
How are you?

14:55.640 --> 14:59.080
Yeah, I went to your talk yesterday on RetroPie

14:59.080 --> 15:03.040
and how you're saving retro gaming from oblivion.

15:03.040 --> 15:07.920
Yeah, so basically my setup is such that sync thing

15:07.920 --> 15:09.640
syncs all of my RetroPies together.

15:09.640 --> 15:13.000
So if I'm on my handheld RetroPie or the one on the TV,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.720
I could play a game, save the game, then go to the couch.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.080
And it's the same save file.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.360
The ROMs and everything all sync to each other.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.880
So it's just like this thing where my save files just

15:21.880 --> 15:22.680
follow me around.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.640
It's just one of the amazing things

15:24.640 --> 15:26.680
that you could do with technology that you might not

15:26.680 --> 15:28.120
think about right off the top of your head.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.000
But if you put your mind to it, a little bit of creativity,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.160
you'd be surprised what you could come up with.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.320
Turns out if you try hard enough, you can, huh?

15:34.320 --> 15:34.720
Yeah.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.520
You're one of the few people on planet Earth

15:36.520 --> 15:39.400
that's got their hands on the CM4 module, right?

15:39.400 --> 15:40.600
How's that working out for you?

15:40.600 --> 15:42.200
What are you using that for?

15:42.200 --> 15:44.040
So actually, I have a Turing Pi.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.760
So I have four of those in there.

15:45.760 --> 15:48.040
And then I have one in the handheld RetroPie.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.680
So it's actually working out really well.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.600
And the one that I have in the RetroPie,

15:52.600 --> 15:54.120
if it wasn't for Jeff Gehrling, I

15:54.120 --> 15:55.840
wouldn't have it because he actually

15:55.840 --> 15:58.560
messaged me on Twitter like, hey, they have inventory over here.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.400
So if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have it.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.760
But I actually got the first ones before they got hard to find.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.280
And then later on, like right now, what are they going for?

16:05.280 --> 16:07.520
Some crazy amount of money?

16:07.520 --> 16:08.320
I dread to think.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.240
I haven't looked.

16:09.240 --> 16:13.560
But it's more than double, I think, MSRP.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.560
It's ridiculous, especially the people

16:15.560 --> 16:18.360
that just want to have fun, set up something in their home lab.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.320
They have to navigate scalpers and everything

16:20.320 --> 16:23.040
just to work on the fun projects that they want to work on.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.080
I think that's terrible.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.960
We just want to have fun with our technology.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.580
So how are you finding all things open?

16:27.580 --> 16:29.240
Is this your first one?

16:29.240 --> 16:30.080
Very first one.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.920
So it is very fun.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.000
We have a lot of cool people here.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.960
System76 is here, Red Hat, AlmaLinux,

16:36.960 --> 16:38.960
like a bunch of open source projects.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.320
There's GitLab, Moodle, like countless others.

16:41.320 --> 16:44.640
It's just so much fun to just network with people,

16:44.640 --> 16:45.260
especially you.

16:45.260 --> 16:47.120
I haven't met you in person until this time,

16:47.120 --> 16:48.360
until this event too.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.160
So I'm meeting really cool people.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.320
And I wouldn't trade it for anything.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.840
Yeah, there's something special about an open source

16:53.840 --> 16:54.600
conference, is there?

16:54.600 --> 16:56.040
Well, thank you very much, Jay.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.160
And enjoy the rest of your conference.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.960
I agree with Jay.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.760
SyncThing for the win.

17:01.760 --> 17:05.160
Absolutely one of the MVPs of the last few years for me

17:05.160 --> 17:06.400
has been SyncThing.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.840
Just my background ambient file system sync.

17:10.840 --> 17:11.640
I have Dropbox.

17:11.640 --> 17:12.600
You know, I have Nextcloud.

17:12.600 --> 17:14.100
I've tried these different things.

17:14.100 --> 17:18.480
I think of that as active, persistent syncing.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.040
You see it.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.160
It's got a status.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.880
You know it's happening.

17:21.880 --> 17:22.960
You can bring up the app.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.520
You can look at what's synced.

17:24.520 --> 17:25.680
I kind of look at SyncThing.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.600
You can do all those things with SyncThing.

17:27.600 --> 17:29.560
There's even system tray icons you can get.

17:29.560 --> 17:33.360
But I kind of think of SyncThing as this ambient background

17:33.360 --> 17:36.440
sync that's actually syncing file systems around.

17:36.440 --> 17:39.480
And it doesn't care where you store something.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.400
It doesn't have to be in a particular directory

17:41.400 --> 17:43.440
like Nextcloud or Dropbox does.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.380
It can be anything, anywhere on your file system.

17:46.380 --> 17:47.040
It's pretty cool.

17:47.040 --> 17:50.400
And Jay was using it to sync his Steam Deck emulator

17:50.400 --> 17:55.160
progress with his RetroPie TV emulator progress.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.720
So that no matter where he was, his retro games

17:57.720 --> 17:59.400
were in sync, which is pretty cool.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.800
That's a great idea.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.880
That's a great idea because you don't

18:03.880 --> 18:06.320
want to lose progress when you move between devices.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.840
So maybe next year, I'll see you at all things open.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.460
And in the meantime, keep an eye on the Meetup page

18:11.460 --> 18:16.160
at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.280
lino.com slash SSH.

18:18.280 --> 18:20.600
That's where you go to get $100 on a new account

18:20.600 --> 18:21.520
and support the show.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.680
lino.com slash SSH.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.400
We were just talking about events.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.320
That's how I discovered Linode.

18:27.320 --> 18:30.360
It was at a Texas Linux Fest many years ago

18:30.360 --> 18:32.160
in the before times.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.520
And I could tell Texas Linux Fest was special

18:34.520 --> 18:39.480
because it was small, but the signal was very strong.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.360
You know what I mean?

18:40.360 --> 18:43.880
The talks were by heavy hitters who knew their stuff.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.040
They were passionate about their projects.

18:46.040 --> 18:49.560
But the vendors weren't taking it very seriously,

18:49.560 --> 18:51.600
except for Linode.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.900
Linode had a real serious setup.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.200
They were clearly participating.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.440
They would swap so somebody could be at the booth

18:58.440 --> 19:00.180
while somebody could actually attend the sessions.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.080
You could tell they were into it.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.000
And that's when I made a mental note.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.560
I need to check out Linode.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.880
That's almost four years ago now.

19:09.880 --> 19:10.900
And now here they are, right?

19:10.900 --> 19:13.360
They've been sponsoring the self-hosted podcast

19:13.360 --> 19:16.800
from the get-go because it's just the perfect combination

19:16.800 --> 19:19.560
of performance, features, price.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.240
I mean, 30% to 50% cheaper than all the hyperscalers

19:22.240 --> 19:23.080
out there.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.600
And if you like to go to events, and I know you might,

19:25.600 --> 19:26.800
if you're gonna go to the Web Summit,

19:26.800 --> 19:29.360
November 1st through the 4th, Linode's gonna be there.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.320
IT Nation Connect in Orlando, Florida,

19:31.320 --> 19:33.880
the 9th through the 11th, Linode's gonna be there.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.840
There's actually a whole list of events

19:36.840 --> 19:38.060
that Linode's going to.

19:38.060 --> 19:38.900
But try it out.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.400
Even if you're not going to an event, try it out

19:40.400 --> 19:41.720
because it's great performance.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.280
They have systems with super fast CPUs,

19:44.280 --> 19:47.680
MVME hard drives, 40 gigabit connections,

19:47.680 --> 19:49.760
and they're spinning up like a dozen new data centers

19:49.760 --> 19:52.300
next year, so there's just gonna be more and more choice.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.880
So go get the $100 and actually kick the tires

19:54.880 --> 19:58.960
because with that $100, you can actually try it.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.200
You can really see what works and what doesn't work.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.080
Like, you really can try any feature you want

20:03.080 --> 20:04.280
with that $100.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.060
So go with just about, I would imagine.

20:06.060 --> 20:06.900
I don't know.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.360
If you're out, you could probably come up with a way

20:08.360 --> 20:10.000
to spend that $100 in like one day.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.840
But you could also stretch it out for like 60 days.

20:12.840 --> 20:16.480
So go to linode.com slash SSH, sign up, try it out,

20:16.480 --> 20:17.600
and support the show.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.100
Linode.com slash SSH.

20:22.040 --> 20:26.880
Rumor has it that the HA Yellow is in production?

20:26.880 --> 20:27.960
It's here, Alex.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.920
It's here, it's live, and it's glorious.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.580
The Home Assistant Yellow finally arrived

20:34.580 --> 20:37.260
about a year after I crowdfunded it.

20:37.260 --> 20:39.720
I decided, when I saw that it was shipping,

20:39.720 --> 20:42.580
I decided to order an MVME drive for it.

20:43.740 --> 20:46.240
Mine came with a CM4.

20:46.240 --> 20:50.080
I could have sworn I ordered it without a CM4,

20:50.080 --> 20:54.020
a Compute Module 4, but it came with one, which is okay.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.440
My CM4s have eight gigs of RAM, but whatever.

20:58.980 --> 21:01.280
So this one only has four, but that's fine, or maybe two.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.380
I don't know what it is.

21:02.380 --> 21:04.720
It's not enough, but we're getting by.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.400
I hit that, but the first thing I did

21:06.400 --> 21:08.480
is I put that MVME disk in there.

21:08.480 --> 21:13.220
I powered the thing up and discovered very quickly

21:13.220 --> 21:16.400
that it was just running off of the built-in eMMC

21:16.400 --> 21:18.760
and wasn't using my MVME disk.

21:18.760 --> 21:23.160
And I thought, well, now, what am I supposed to do with this?

21:23.160 --> 21:25.320
Just throw it in the garbage.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.160
Get rid of it.

21:26.160 --> 21:26.980
Bye-bye.

21:26.980 --> 21:29.200
And I was digging through the system settings,

21:29.200 --> 21:30.860
and I go in the storage area,

21:30.860 --> 21:33.440
and in the hamburger menu, there's this migrate option.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.960
So I hit that, and it says,

21:34.960 --> 21:37.920
we're gonna move your data over to another disk.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.560
What disk would you like to use?

21:39.560 --> 21:42.760
And the only disk I had available was the new MVME,

21:42.760 --> 21:43.640
about a terabyte.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.700
It says, okay, well, this will take about 15 minutes,

21:47.700 --> 21:50.720
and then we're gonna reboot, and we'll see you then.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.820
So I say, okay, go ahead.

21:53.820 --> 21:55.440
I hit that button.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.560
Little thing starts spinning.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.400
And I just couldn't watch it.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.280
I couldn't, it was too stressful,

22:01.280 --> 22:02.280
because I didn't know what it was doing.

22:02.280 --> 22:06.200
Because again, when it's all like web UI and their own OS,

22:06.200 --> 22:07.940
I have no idea what's happening.

22:07.940 --> 22:10.160
If they told me to go like, you know,

22:10.160 --> 22:13.360
repartition a disk and format it, mount it,

22:13.360 --> 22:15.400
and then update your configuration file

22:15.400 --> 22:17.000
to point to the new mount point,

22:17.000 --> 22:18.240
I'd feel like really solid.

22:18.240 --> 22:21.380
Like, okay, all right, I know I'm done.

22:21.380 --> 22:23.320
But you know, that's not gonna work for most people.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.900
They wanna make it all a gooey option.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.520
So okay, I'll try it.

22:26.520 --> 22:30.460
So I go to bed, and I wake up the next morning,

22:30.460 --> 22:33.320
and I go to the storage area in the settings.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.800
Everything's working, by the way.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.320
I go to the storage area in the settings,

22:36.320 --> 22:38.720
and now it just says like 900 gigs free.

22:38.720 --> 22:42.760
I think it moved everything off of the eMMC,

22:42.760 --> 22:45.040
and it moved everything to the MVME.

22:45.040 --> 22:48.320
I'm not sure exactly what happened,

22:48.320 --> 22:51.120
because it's kind of, it's all kind of abstracted for me.

22:52.320 --> 22:57.040
But the performance is so much better.

22:57.040 --> 23:01.280
And I have to say, I am very happy with the results.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.560
I could not ask for anything better.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.660
And I also decided to just start fresh.

23:05.660 --> 23:08.720
I went clean, I did not restore my backups.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.040
I didn't try to import my old settings.

23:11.040 --> 23:15.040
I just said, I'm gonna burn three or four days straight,

23:15.040 --> 23:16.440
and I'm just gonna reset it up.

23:16.440 --> 23:20.620
And I literally probably spent three days resetting it up.

23:20.620 --> 23:22.180
There is a good argument to, you know,

23:22.180 --> 23:24.880
nuking and paving systems every now and again.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.140
I remember back in the day,

23:26.140 --> 23:30.560
I used to nuke and pave windows every six weeks sometimes,

23:30.560 --> 23:33.080
you know, because it was just that crusty.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.880
You still have to, hasn't changed.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.160
And then, you know, when I get a new phone these days,

23:37.160 --> 23:39.280
still out of force of habit,

23:39.280 --> 23:41.560
I'll start from scratch with a new phone.

23:41.560 --> 23:45.000
But I don't know, like my MacBook here

23:45.000 --> 23:47.720
has got the same install on it as when it came with it.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.460
Like, I don't feel the need to do that anymore.

23:50.460 --> 23:55.340
But Home Assistant, huh, there's so much stuff in there

23:55.340 --> 23:57.120
that I've painstakingly created.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.900
I don't think I could do it.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.280
I don't think I could do it.

24:00.280 --> 24:03.200
I had a couple of moments, I think, that saved me.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.080
One was, I downloaded my old backup

24:06.080 --> 24:08.120
from the Raspberry Pi that died,

24:08.120 --> 24:10.760
and I extracted it manually,

24:10.760 --> 24:13.140
and I opened up my configuration YAML,

24:13.140 --> 24:15.840
and I kind of grabbed a few key things

24:15.840 --> 24:20.060
that I knew I wanted, like my generic thermostat stuff,

24:20.060 --> 24:22.620
all of my integrations for my cameras.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.320
I just grabbed that stuff.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.020
So I didn't take the whole config file,

24:26.020 --> 24:27.560
but I just took the bits

24:27.560 --> 24:30.200
that I didn't want to have to recreate from whole cloth.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.080
That was one thing that I think helped a lot,

24:32.080 --> 24:34.960
is I still used my old config file quite a bit.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.540
But the other thing was,

24:37.680 --> 24:39.040
the Z-Wave migration turned out

24:39.040 --> 24:41.460
to be a lot easier than I expected.

24:41.460 --> 24:43.620
The Z-Wave controller had everything

24:43.620 --> 24:45.380
on the network paired to it.

24:45.380 --> 24:47.360
And so when I took that USB dongle,

24:49.080 --> 24:51.520
and I plugged it into the new Home Assistant Yellow,

24:53.160 --> 24:56.160
all of the nodes were still paired to that controller.

24:57.100 --> 25:00.480
They all showed up as brand new devices to Home Assistant.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.280
But all of the networking was already done.

25:02.280 --> 25:06.880
All the node order, all of that was already done.

25:06.880 --> 25:10.160
And so Home Assistant, just using the new integration,

25:10.160 --> 25:14.160
just said, oh, look at all these Z-Wave devices you have.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.400
This is incredible.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.920
And so the only part that was a pain in the butt

25:19.920 --> 25:21.640
was I did have to sit there,

25:21.640 --> 25:24.640
and this was one of the seriously labor-intensive tasks,

25:24.640 --> 25:28.440
and rename every entity, every device entry,

25:28.440 --> 25:29.520
just sit there and rename them,

25:29.520 --> 25:31.960
because it just generates these stupid-ass names.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.760
You know what would be really great?

25:33.760 --> 25:37.600
Imagine if Home Assistant had this paperclip in the corner

25:37.600 --> 25:39.560
that popped up and said,

25:39.560 --> 25:42.200
hey, I noticed you've got some new devices.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.080
Do you wanna set those up?

25:44.080 --> 25:45.800
I mean, super helpful.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.120
I don't think anyone's done that before, have they?

25:47.120 --> 25:48.080
Just something that said,

25:48.080 --> 25:51.520
hey, would you like to just say what you wanna call it now,

25:51.520 --> 25:53.360
so that way you don't spend the next two days

25:53.360 --> 25:54.200
renaming all these things?

25:54.200 --> 25:56.120
Because of course, my sensors,

25:56.120 --> 25:57.680
every single one of my sensors

25:57.680 --> 26:01.600
has eight different entities that it puts in there, right?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.240
All of my power switches

26:03.240 --> 26:05.040
have three or four different entities

26:05.040 --> 26:05.880
that they put into there.

26:05.880 --> 26:08.800
So it's just so, so many items.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.640
That's a good point.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.360
The onboarding workflow of a new device,

26:11.360 --> 26:14.200
I think, could actually use some work in that respect.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.680
Some kind of a wizard or something.

26:16.680 --> 26:17.760
I should say.

26:17.760 --> 26:20.840
So that's my criticism, but I should say,

26:20.840 --> 26:25.360
wow, it has gotten so much easier to set up Home Assistant.

26:25.360 --> 26:28.480
There's so many more UI options for stuff now.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.040
Like scripts, when you're writing a script,

26:31.040 --> 26:32.360
you know, the script thing.

26:32.360 --> 26:34.280
You can just reorder items now.

26:34.280 --> 26:37.040
Oh God, I used to have to rewrite the script

26:37.040 --> 26:39.120
or I'll do it in YAML in the past.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.400
Now you can just reorder items.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.560
It's incredible, the stuff,

26:43.560 --> 26:47.600
just the friction that they, over time, have smoothed out.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.680
It reminded me of like, if you've been playing an MMO

26:50.680 --> 26:53.080
since it launched, like say, Star Trek Online,

26:53.080 --> 26:54.800
and you've been playing it since it launched,

26:54.800 --> 26:56.560
and you've been playing it for like 10 years.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.920
And so like, you're just at the end game

26:58.920 --> 27:00.880
and you've been at the end game for years.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.780
And then you decide to go create an alt account

27:02.780 --> 27:04.200
and you start over from the beginning

27:04.200 --> 27:06.760
and you realize they've completely redone

27:06.760 --> 27:08.040
the beginning of the game.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.600
A totally new tutorial,

27:09.600 --> 27:11.480
a totally new introduction to the game,

27:11.480 --> 27:12.760
a whole new story arc.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.340
And you're like, wow, this is so much better

27:15.340 --> 27:17.440
than when I tried this years ago.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.160
That's where Home Assistant is at now.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.600
It is so much easier to set up.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.440
Interesting.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.240
Well, maybe I should do a new compave.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.120
Just in the interests of science and the show

27:26.120 --> 27:27.120
and stuff like that, huh?

27:27.120 --> 27:29.120
I feel like it was a lot simpler.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.120
I mean, yeah, I had to go through the whole rename thing.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.480
Here's the other thing that's been a lot easier

27:32.480 --> 27:34.000
this time around.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.440
As of right now, I don't have a single automation.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.480
You look smug about that.

27:38.480 --> 27:39.720
Why do you look smug about that?

27:39.720 --> 27:40.560
Oh, I don't know.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.240
My last box, I probably had like 15 automations

27:43.240 --> 27:45.120
and now I don't have a single automation.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.960
And I mean, if you think about it,

27:46.960 --> 27:48.800
I'm sure I will have one eventually.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.600
It's so much simpler.

27:50.600 --> 27:54.960
So I have used the scheduler card custom component

27:54.960 --> 27:58.080
that lets me schedule things in a UI

27:58.080 --> 28:00.960
that is so much more intuitive than using an automation,

28:00.960 --> 28:03.760
that controls the lights and the outdoor stuff,

28:03.760 --> 28:05.160
so much simpler.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.520
And then I've gone all in on thermostat.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.840
So I use the generic thermostat,

28:08.840 --> 28:12.440
which combines a temperature sensor with a smart plug.

28:12.440 --> 28:17.080
So the temperature sensor is used as the thermostat data

28:17.080 --> 28:19.480
and the smart plug gets toggled on and off.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.720
And I just set the temperatures

28:21.720 --> 28:26.000
using generic thermostats now, it's so much easier.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.920
My first pass, they didn't have generic thermostats.

28:28.920 --> 28:32.600
And so I was doing automations based on temperature ranges

28:32.600 --> 28:35.240
and sensor data and it was all manual.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.560
And now it's just so smooth.

28:37.560 --> 28:40.200
And so that made it a lot easier too.

28:40.200 --> 28:43.880
Not having to like rebuild my automations

28:43.880 --> 28:46.120
was a huge time saver.

28:46.120 --> 28:48.360
And so using the scheduler card,

28:48.360 --> 28:49.920
which I will link in,

28:49.920 --> 28:51.280
it's not the scheduler integration,

28:51.280 --> 28:52.520
that's something different.

28:52.520 --> 28:53.840
You want the scheduler card,

28:53.840 --> 28:55.480
I'll have a link to that in the show notes.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.760
And the generic thermostat,

28:56.760 --> 28:59.000
that is just something built into Home Assistant.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.320
Those two things together saved me a ton of ache.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.520
And because the scheduler card allows for things

29:04.520 --> 29:08.880
like presence detection, sunset information,

29:08.880 --> 29:09.720
those types of things,

29:09.720 --> 29:12.040
I was able to avoid creating automations

29:12.040 --> 29:13.440
for things that I used to do all the time.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.280
Nice.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.880
Yeah, oh, it's so great.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.200
It's so great and it's so fast, Alex.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.360
Well, that's what happens when you have real storage,

29:20.360 --> 29:21.640
like an NVMe disk.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.960
Home Assistant is making a lot of little transactions,

29:26.960 --> 29:31.160
which an SD card or even something hanging off the USB bus

29:31.160 --> 29:32.920
just isn't optimized for.

29:32.920 --> 29:34.680
It didn't feel like a problem,

29:34.680 --> 29:37.600
but now it's so fast that like,

29:37.600 --> 29:38.440
have you ever had that thing

29:38.440 --> 29:39.480
where you accidentally like double tap

29:39.480 --> 29:40.320
or something like that?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.360
Like you just kind of like have a finger spasm

29:42.360 --> 29:44.120
and you tap twice when you mean to tap once

29:44.120 --> 29:45.880
or something like that?

29:45.880 --> 29:46.720
Yes.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.920
It's so fast that like, it'll hit it.

29:48.920 --> 29:49.760
It'll boom, boom.

29:49.760 --> 29:52.240
Like when I do that double tap spasm,

29:52.240 --> 29:54.120
light on, light off, just boom, boom.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.480
It's incredible.

29:55.480 --> 29:59.160
There's just, there's literally no delay at all.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.440
And I am so happy with the Home Assistant Yellow

30:01.440 --> 30:03.240
using NVMe storage.

30:04.120 --> 30:06.480
I don't even mind that it's running

30:06.480 --> 30:07.640
its own operating system.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.600
I'm all in right now.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.440
And it's been funny watching my snapshots

30:10.440 --> 30:11.960
as I've configured this thing

30:11.960 --> 30:15.040
when I first started like a 300 kilobyte snapshot

30:15.040 --> 30:16.560
and then a megabyte.

30:16.560 --> 30:17.600
And then two megabytes.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.600
And now my snapshots are like 60 megabytes, right?

30:20.600 --> 30:22.600
It's just as I keep building the system out,

30:22.600 --> 30:25.040
like the backups keep getting bigger and bigger.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.640
I love it, but you are such a nerd.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.920
On my old Pi, I think like the Home Assistant backups

30:29.920 --> 30:32.160
were like 1.2 gigabytes.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.720
And now they're like 70, 80 megabytes

30:34.720 --> 30:35.560
or something around there.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.720
They're just totally, it's a totally leaner, meaner system.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.320
Well, there's a lot of advantages to that.

30:40.320 --> 30:43.560
And I had to take some remedial action

30:43.560 --> 30:45.760
with one of my shellies this week.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.840
My Shelley 2.5 that Brent, the wonderful Brent

30:48.840 --> 30:51.320
helped me install whilst he was here,

30:51.320 --> 30:54.160
that controls my outdoor rear floodlights.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.280
We were down at the fire pit

30:55.280 --> 30:56.840
and I had the lights on the back of the house.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.120
So it was lighting up the yard a little bit.

30:59.120 --> 31:03.360
Every 30 to 60 seconds, they would just turn off

31:03.360 --> 31:06.080
for a second and then turn back on for 30 seconds

31:06.960 --> 31:09.360
and then turn off and then turn back on.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.760
And I'm like, what are you doing?

31:10.760 --> 31:12.160
That's not good, no.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.400
So I go in the Shelley app and then for some reason

31:14.400 --> 31:17.360
the device is rebooting and resetting itself.

31:17.360 --> 31:20.480
So I have to catch the Shelley app just at the right time

31:20.480 --> 31:22.000
where the device is on the network

31:22.000 --> 31:23.800
to even get network connectivity,

31:23.800 --> 31:25.920
to get it to load in the app properly

31:25.920 --> 31:28.200
before it resets itself.

31:28.200 --> 31:30.760
Turns out it only did that when it was under load

31:30.760 --> 31:31.600
with the lights on.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.520
So my guess is there was some kind of a threshold

31:34.520 --> 31:37.600
of maybe temperature, I don't know, being met.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.760
So I did a bit of research and this led me to

31:41.760 --> 31:42.840
something I've done in the past

31:42.840 --> 31:44.160
on a couple of my other shellies,

31:44.160 --> 31:46.320
which is replace the stock firmware,

31:46.320 --> 31:48.960
the Mongoose OS that comes on the Shelley

31:48.960 --> 31:52.280
with one of the more open firmwares,

31:52.280 --> 31:54.360
Tasmota or an ESP home.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.600
There's a link in the show notes,

31:55.600 --> 31:58.240
but essentially the gist is this.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.780
The Shelley is shipped with non-standard

32:00.780 --> 32:04.360
Dupont pin-sized, I don't know what you call it,

32:04.360 --> 32:07.880
jumper pins, where you see you can connect them over USB

32:07.880 --> 32:10.780
with a serial device and reprogram the Shelleys that way

32:10.780 --> 32:13.520
and manually flash the firmware onto them that way.

32:13.520 --> 32:16.760
But this Shelleys already in my wall neatly tucked away

32:16.760 --> 32:18.660
and I don't want to be pulling it out

32:18.660 --> 32:21.960
and doing that kind of thing, really, if I can avoid it.

32:21.960 --> 32:23.640
So I thought I'd try and find a way

32:23.640 --> 32:25.560
that does it over the air.

32:25.560 --> 32:30.120
And in the linked blog post, there is a tool called MG2X.

32:31.320 --> 32:35.100
And this thing allows you to put Tasmota

32:35.100 --> 32:36.980
directly onto the Shelley,

32:36.980 --> 32:39.880
just by using an over the air firmware upload.

32:39.880 --> 32:44.880
And within about 45 seconds, I'd replace the default OS

32:45.080 --> 32:47.640
with a single command in my browser.

32:47.640 --> 32:48.480
That's great.

32:48.480 --> 32:52.160
Is it using a built-in tool or is it an exploit?

32:52.160 --> 32:53.000
I think it must be.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.120
There's no, you know, we've talked about

32:55.120 --> 32:56.640
two-year convert in the past,

32:56.640 --> 32:59.940
which basically created a man in the middle

32:59.940 --> 33:02.020
for these third-party updating things,

33:02.020 --> 33:04.840
which then spoofed the update server.

33:04.840 --> 33:05.920
None of that stuff is needed

33:05.920 --> 33:08.400
because the Shelleys are a lot more open than that.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.760
So I think all it was doing was just providing through,

33:10.760 --> 33:12.080
you know, when you go to a website

33:12.080 --> 33:13.240
and you have like the question mark

33:13.240 --> 33:15.960
and then a few parameters after the question mark,

33:15.960 --> 33:18.160
essentially what it was doing was providing the URL

33:18.160 --> 33:21.680
for the update to this custom firmware, minimal firmware,

33:21.680 --> 33:25.360
to the over the air URL update feature

33:25.360 --> 33:28.080
built directly into the web server of the existing Shelley.

33:28.080 --> 33:32.040
So no weirdness, no hackery going on.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.400
It's just a really cool project.

33:34.400 --> 33:37.880
I see the Shelley plug S is supported.

33:37.880 --> 33:40.080
I actually wasn't really planning to say this,

33:40.080 --> 33:43.960
but I have noticed my least reliable device

33:43.960 --> 33:46.640
in my new setup right now is my Shelley smart plug.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.080
I've just had it go offline a couple of times.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.320
None of my other devices have done that.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.800
And I wonder if it isn't the OS

33:52.800 --> 33:54.920
because the hardware seems pretty solid.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.640
Well, I thought I'd put Tasmotor on there

33:56.640 --> 33:58.600
because it has a temperature monitoring.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.760
And that was, you know, where my mind went to originally

34:00.760 --> 34:03.080
was well, is this device resetting

34:03.080 --> 34:06.880
because there's a temperature limit set in the Mongoose OS

34:06.880 --> 34:08.520
that Shelley ship on these things.

34:08.520 --> 34:11.640
Uh oh, is my house about to catch fire and burn down.

34:11.640 --> 34:12.920
Don't ignore this.

34:12.920 --> 34:16.320
And when I, you know, throw both the light switches on

34:16.320 --> 34:18.400
and put all the juice through this thing,

34:18.400 --> 34:20.920
the maximum temperature it gets to is about 50 Celsius.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.320
So it's totally fine.

34:22.320 --> 34:25.800
It's nothing to worry about from what I can tell.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.840
I don't really have anything negative to say

34:27.840 --> 34:28.880
about Tasmotor on this thing.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.800
I think my original goal was to actually put ESP home

34:31.800 --> 34:34.400
on the Shelley, but I like Tasmotor so much,

34:34.400 --> 34:35.680
I'm just gonna leave it there.

34:35.680 --> 34:37.440
Yeah, why not, right, if it works.

34:37.440 --> 34:38.560
Sometimes you compromise.

34:38.560 --> 34:39.720
I did that.

34:39.720 --> 34:44.560
There was one device that I completely forgot about this,

34:44.560 --> 34:45.400
but it did happen.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.680
There was one device I just had to toss out.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.320
It was a HomeKit device.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.640
It was an LED light strip I bought

34:51.640 --> 34:52.640
that worked with HomeKit.

34:52.640 --> 34:53.680
But you know what the issue was,

34:53.680 --> 34:56.160
is I lost the HomeKit pairing code.

34:56.160 --> 34:59.100
Not only did I lose the HomeKit pairing code,

34:59.100 --> 35:01.480
but I cannot figure out for the life of me

35:01.480 --> 35:03.680
how to get this thing to try to like reintroduce itself

35:03.680 --> 35:04.640
to the HomeKit network.

35:04.640 --> 35:09.200
And I just, I didn't want Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Z-Wave,

35:09.200 --> 35:10.520
and HomeKit, right.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.200
Like I just don't need all of it.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.160
And so I went over to Amazon

35:15.460 --> 35:20.460
and I picked up the Zengled ZigBee smart LED light strip.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.260
It's a 16.4 foot smart light strip.

35:25.260 --> 35:29.700
Now I know guys, I know, I know.

35:29.700 --> 35:34.640
There are ways you can build Z-Wave or ZigBee devices

35:34.640 --> 35:36.320
for pennies on the dollar compared to this.

35:36.320 --> 35:38.000
I understand that.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.180
Here's the situation.

35:40.420 --> 35:44.320
I deployed my new system and the kitchen light strip,

35:44.320 --> 35:45.560
this is the one that my wife uses

35:45.560 --> 35:47.800
while she's cooking to get a little extra light,

35:47.800 --> 35:49.440
wasn't working.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.000
Cause it's a HomeKit one.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.760
And she wanted something fast.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.040
And the wife approval factor was declining

35:56.040 --> 35:58.200
with the new server quickly.

35:58.200 --> 36:03.040
So I snapped up this Zengled ZigBee smart LED strip.

36:03.040 --> 36:04.200
I don't know if I'm saying it right.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.800
It's got LEDs in it and it's got smarts in it.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.560
And it says it's for Alexa and Google.

36:08.560 --> 36:11.940
It's just a ZigBee device.

36:11.940 --> 36:15.720
And so you just, if you have a ZigBee controller,

36:15.720 --> 36:18.600
you just get it, you know, doing the ZigBee thing

36:18.600 --> 36:20.960
and you can control it immediately with Home Assistant.

36:20.960 --> 36:21.980
It picks it up.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.640
You can control the colors, the brightness,

36:24.640 --> 36:27.520
everything works, talks to it natively.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.680
It's 60 bucks from Amazon,

36:29.680 --> 36:32.460
but it is one of these things that you can just buy

36:32.460 --> 36:34.840
and pair immediately natively to Home Assistant.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.680
And we got it up and running in 15 minutes.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.840
And man, did that solve the problem.

36:39.840 --> 36:42.580
And now she's a hundred percent in on the new system.

36:42.580 --> 36:44.080
So I just wanted to give that a plug.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.640
If you're looking for an LED light strip

36:45.640 --> 36:47.620
that you can hook to a ZigBee network

36:47.620 --> 36:49.200
that works with Home Assistant,

36:49.200 --> 36:50.760
I can vouch for this guy

36:50.760 --> 36:52.520
and I'll put a link in the show notes.

36:52.520 --> 36:56.920
It also comes with a remote, which I have not tried yet,

36:56.920 --> 36:58.840
but I believe is also a ZigBee device.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.760
It's just an on and off and brightness.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.000
So it's a little physical remote

37:02.000 --> 37:03.680
that you can mount anywhere.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.760
And I would imagine once you tie it to Home Assistant,

37:05.760 --> 37:06.880
it could control anything.

37:06.880 --> 37:09.760
And the kit I got from Amazon for 60 bucks includes that.

37:09.760 --> 37:13.280
It also includes a ZigBee hub, which I do not need.

37:13.280 --> 37:16.440
Well, tell me about your jellyfin exploits this week.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.620
You've been a busy boy.

37:17.620 --> 37:18.720
Oh, geez.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.540
Oh, geez, you wanna hear about this?

37:20.540 --> 37:21.380
I mean.

37:21.380 --> 37:22.320
Well, I don't know, do we?

37:22.320 --> 37:25.160
You tell me, you tell us, let the audience be your guide.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.200
All right, so it was going real well.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.880
I mean, I thought to myself, here's what I'm gonna do.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.040
I got this whole no container theory.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.300
I think this is gonna work really well.

37:34.300 --> 37:37.400
I'm gonna just install everything natively on Nix.

37:37.400 --> 37:41.240
I'm gonna use the Nix package manager to manage everything.

37:41.240 --> 37:44.080
And I wanted to get a sense of what this would be like

37:44.080 --> 37:46.620
before I actually deployed it on my Odroid,

37:46.620 --> 37:49.200
because I was waiting for an SSD hard drive

37:49.200 --> 37:52.200
and a power cable for that hard drive,

37:52.200 --> 37:54.760
which was a custom order piece.

37:54.760 --> 37:55.920
So I thought in the meantime,

37:55.920 --> 37:57.960
I'll deploy it on my HP dev one,

37:57.960 --> 37:59.520
which already runs Nix OS.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.760
And I'll just start reconfiguring that dev one,

38:02.760 --> 38:05.760
like I would configure a home server.

38:05.760 --> 38:09.580
So I took a external SSD that I had

38:09.580 --> 38:12.680
from the old Raspberry Pi, and I connected that.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.240
So that way I'd have some storage to work with

38:14.240 --> 38:16.800
for a little bit, because it's just an experiment.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.680
And I got that all mounted,

38:18.680 --> 38:21.300
set up with ButterFS like a gentleman,

38:21.300 --> 38:24.760
and set up Jellyfin on Nix OS,

38:24.760 --> 38:27.340
set up Infuse on the Apple TV,

38:28.240 --> 38:31.400
and I was really, really in a good spot.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.960
I tried out Infuse this week because of you.

38:33.960 --> 38:34.940
Oh yeah.

38:34.940 --> 38:36.480
We went to the mountains last weekend

38:36.480 --> 38:39.200
and LNE did a bit of entertainment in the car on the way.

38:39.200 --> 38:42.840
So I thought, oh, well, Chris recommended Infuse on iOS.

38:42.840 --> 38:44.720
So I downloaded a few YouTube videos

38:44.720 --> 38:47.960
and copied a few files across.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.840
Infuse is great.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.240
Oh, you like it, good.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.320
I really like it, yeah.

38:53.320 --> 38:54.160
It's nice.

38:54.160 --> 38:55.120
It is so nice.

38:55.120 --> 38:58.160
And for me, it was a big, I felt like this was a,

38:58.160 --> 39:00.900
this was my best shot for a Jellyfin adoption,

39:00.900 --> 39:05.900
because we're using Infuse on Apple TV for Plex.

39:06.480 --> 39:09.360
And so if I just changed the backend out to Jellyfin,

39:09.360 --> 39:11.520
it's the same exact UI for the family members.

39:11.520 --> 39:13.400
Like nobody would probably notice, right?

39:13.400 --> 39:14.960
And now I could be using Jellyfin, right?

39:14.960 --> 39:16.940
Ooh, you're a smart cookie.

39:16.940 --> 39:18.320
I set it all up on the Nix box.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.640
I got it all working with Infuse.

39:20.640 --> 39:21.480
It was great.

39:22.460 --> 39:25.960
Then one night, we spent one night out in the woods,

39:25.960 --> 39:27.860
just recently, just like a couple of days ago.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.160
We had one night to spend out,

39:29.160 --> 39:30.720
just the wife and I in the woods,

39:30.720 --> 39:33.560
between Halloween and other things going on.

39:33.560 --> 39:36.900
And we get it all set up, candles are lit.

39:36.900 --> 39:40.840
We had an excellent dinner, shared a bottle of wine.

39:40.840 --> 39:45.040
We go back in the bedroom, turn on the television,

39:45.040 --> 39:47.360
decide to watch a little TV.

39:47.360 --> 39:50.920
I launched the Jellyfin app, and it auto-discovers,

39:50.920 --> 39:52.560
like it has on all my other devices,

39:52.560 --> 39:55.120
auto-discovers my Jellyfin instance.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.160
I select the Jellyfin instance.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.000
The wife looks over at me,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
appreciating my hard work on setting all this up,

40:02.000 --> 40:03.720
thinking how great I am.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.600
I say, select that server,

40:05.600 --> 40:07.960
and I get back an error message that says,

40:07.960 --> 40:09.660
incompatible server version.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.600
Now I'm in the woods where there's really no cell signal,

40:12.600 --> 40:13.800
so there's no streaming.

40:14.720 --> 40:16.480
I've got the room in romantic mode.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.600
The wife's back there, she's thinking I've done great

40:18.600 --> 40:20.140
getting this whole system rebuilt,

40:20.140 --> 40:22.420
and I cannot get anything to play.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.600
And the Jellyfin app just says, go screw yourself,

40:25.600 --> 40:27.280
your server is out of date.

40:27.280 --> 40:30.360
Because of course, and this happens every now and then,

40:30.360 --> 40:33.940
Nix is really pretty much a bleeding edge

40:33.940 --> 40:38.300
rolling distribution, but it depends on maintainers.

40:38.300 --> 40:42.060
And Jellyfin is just currently out of date on Nix OS.

40:42.920 --> 40:44.720
It's close to getting updated.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.820
They have the next version in testing right now,

40:46.820 --> 40:48.800
as of two days ago, it's really close.

40:48.800 --> 40:52.280
I could technically install it if I wanted to right now.

40:52.280 --> 40:55.160
But you know, if I wanna start playing with goodies,

40:55.160 --> 40:57.040
like skip intro,

40:57.040 --> 40:58.380
well, I'm gonna have to play with plugins,

40:58.380 --> 41:02.440
because Infuse may not even support it if I do,

41:02.440 --> 41:05.000
but Jellyfin doesn't seem to really have native support,

41:05.000 --> 41:08.780
so I'm gonna have to get a plugin that does intro detection

41:08.780 --> 41:11.520
and then automatically skips it server side

41:11.520 --> 41:13.360
and then just streams that to Infuse.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.840
I gotta like hack it around to get it all working

41:15.840 --> 41:19.320
and to do that, I also need their fork of FFmpeg

41:19.320 --> 41:20.960
and I also need everything

41:20.960 --> 41:22.200
to be the absolute latest version.

41:22.200 --> 41:24.080
All of a sudden, I'm pretty much just looking

41:24.080 --> 41:26.240
at like the Linux server IO Jellyfin container

41:26.240 --> 41:28.200
and thinking, why don't I just deploy that?

41:28.200 --> 41:30.820
I'm right back at the container situation.

41:30.820 --> 41:32.920
I'm right back where I began.

41:32.920 --> 41:35.900
And then on top of that, I kinda missplex.

41:35.900 --> 41:38.920
Like the skip intro stuff, huge for me.

41:38.920 --> 41:42.280
I'm watching Star Trek Enterprise right now and I refuse.

41:42.280 --> 41:45.240
I refuse to watch that intro.

41:45.240 --> 41:48.920
I will never watch that intro again, ever.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.680
I've watched it twice in my life,

41:50.680 --> 41:53.980
when it premiered and when I played it for my wife.

41:53.980 --> 41:56.040
And after that, I will never watch that intro again,

41:56.040 --> 41:56.920
I refuse.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.320
And the third time when you loaded up Jellyfin

41:59.320 --> 42:00.160
and there wasn't this skip intro button.

42:00.160 --> 42:03.040
Yes, yeah, oh my God, I came running across the room

42:03.040 --> 42:04.680
for the remote, I'm like, no.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.380
Yeah, and I had to fast forward like an animal.

42:08.380 --> 42:09.800
And so, like I missed that.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.400
Also, if you're using the native apps,

42:12.400 --> 42:14.240
and I think you'll agree, Alex,

42:14.240 --> 42:16.120
the Plex app is way better.

42:16.120 --> 42:19.240
It's not perfect, but yeah, it is better.

42:19.240 --> 42:22.420
Just the layout's better, the design, everything.

42:22.420 --> 42:23.260
It's a shame.

42:23.260 --> 42:25.360
If you're using Infuse, it's exactly the same.

42:25.360 --> 42:29.440
But yeah, so I realized that this NixOS package

42:29.440 --> 42:30.840
is gonna get updated.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.160
And this won't be an issue for much longer.

42:33.160 --> 42:35.200
But it could be an issue again.

42:35.200 --> 42:40.200
And sometimes the TV breaks at absolutely

42:40.320 --> 42:43.160
the worst moment possible.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.400
And that's what happened to me, you know?

42:45.400 --> 42:47.840
You know, and that's why I adopted Plex

42:47.840 --> 42:49.320
and the Nvidia Shield as kind of like

42:49.320 --> 42:52.300
the default media setup in the house.

42:53.560 --> 42:58.560
Most of the time, and I would say more than 95% of the time,

42:59.840 --> 43:03.920
Plex and the Nvidia Shield just get the job done reliably.

43:03.920 --> 43:07.880
I am enjoying the real-time updates of Adia's face

43:07.880 --> 43:10.840
in the Discord chat, are you enjoying that too?

43:10.840 --> 43:13.760
They're having a good time, aren't they?

43:13.760 --> 43:15.720
For the listeners, there's a picture of a lady,

43:15.720 --> 43:20.720
it's not Adia, but just pulling a completely straight face

43:20.760 --> 43:22.920
of, I asked him to put on Netflix.

43:22.920 --> 43:24.840
He glances at me and starts fumbling

43:24.840 --> 43:27.440
with some weird cable on his TV and laptop.

43:27.440 --> 43:30.480
We sit there while he does something on his laptop

43:30.480 --> 43:32.800
with a trembling finger and mumbles something

43:32.800 --> 43:35.200
about torrents.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.640
This one's hitting close to home.

43:37.640 --> 43:38.480
Yes, it is.

43:38.480 --> 43:41.080
Yeah, yeah, oh man.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.840
Yeah, so, you know, the ironic thing is,

43:42.840 --> 43:44.120
I mean, I do follow what you're saying,

43:44.120 --> 43:46.520
but the ironic thing is, if we were watching

43:46.520 --> 43:48.240
on the Apple TV with Infuse,

43:48.240 --> 43:49.200
it wouldn't have been a problem,

43:49.200 --> 43:51.800
but because we are on the Nvidia Shield

43:51.800 --> 43:54.720
and it had auto-updated the Jellyfin app,

43:54.720 --> 43:56.720
I just got this incompatible error.

43:56.720 --> 44:00.760
But I will say, every time I try Jellyfin,

44:00.760 --> 44:02.340
it gets a little bit better.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.440
Of course, Plex is moving on as well at the same time,

44:04.440 --> 44:05.680
which doesn't help.

44:05.680 --> 44:09.200
But, you know, I think in the next year or two,

44:09.200 --> 44:10.640
the tipping point will come.

44:10.640 --> 44:14.280
We're really close to where Jellyfin will be good enough

44:14.280 --> 44:16.480
to have that Chrome, you know, like skip intro,

44:16.480 --> 44:20.000
that, you know, those little things that I really value.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.480
And once we're there, I won't look back when I switch,

44:22.480 --> 44:26.120
you know, when it's ready, it's gonna be amazing.

44:26.120 --> 44:28.880
I think it's there for me now, we're using Infuse.

44:28.880 --> 44:32.320
And so my plan is to absolutely deploy it

44:32.320 --> 44:35.680
at home and then keep Plex at the studio.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.520
So I'm like not giving up Plex,

44:37.520 --> 44:39.340
I'm gonna have Plex running here at the studio

44:39.340 --> 44:41.560
on the studio server where we have like,

44:41.560 --> 44:45.520
JB Media, My Archived Media, we share it with people,

44:45.520 --> 44:47.000
like that'll be the core Plex setup.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.920
But then at my home setup,

44:48.920 --> 44:50.920
that I'm gonna keep with Jellyfin.

44:50.920 --> 44:52.400
And I haven't tried it yet,

44:52.400 --> 44:57.400
but there is a plugin that lets you scan and skip intros.

44:57.880 --> 45:00.200
It has a couple of limitations, but I think it makes sense.

45:00.200 --> 45:04.700
The intro has to be within the first 25% of an episode

45:04.700 --> 45:06.240
or the first 10 minutes.

45:06.240 --> 45:09.720
And the intro has to be between 15 and two minutes long,

45:09.720 --> 45:11.960
15 seconds and two minutes long.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.120
And if it meets those criteria,

45:13.120 --> 45:15.360
supposedly it can detect it and then mark it.

45:15.360 --> 45:18.000
And then on the setting side,

45:18.000 --> 45:21.440
you can just tell the Jellyfin server

45:21.440 --> 45:22.840
automatically just skip it.

45:22.840 --> 45:25.560
Don't even ask the client, just skip the intro.

45:25.560 --> 45:28.280
And I think that'll be fine, that'll work for me.

45:28.280 --> 45:29.720
And if that's the case,

45:29.720 --> 45:32.000
then overall I'm very happy with Jellyfin.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.040
I think it'll be good.

45:34.040 --> 45:35.440
A lot of the work that Plex did

45:35.440 --> 45:37.560
with their sonic fingerprinting

45:37.560 --> 45:40.360
and all that kind of stuff to detect the intros

45:40.360 --> 45:42.740
was extremely impressive,

45:42.740 --> 45:45.720
but I think just given a bit more time.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.960
And Jellyfin is not a commercial project like Plex,

45:47.960 --> 45:50.560
of course, so they are gonna be in a different class

45:50.560 --> 45:54.600
of speed of development and polish and all that kind of stuff.

45:54.600 --> 45:57.080
I'm willing to accept those compromises

45:57.080 --> 46:01.920
for my media library being air quotes free.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.720
And perhaps not monitored.

46:03.720 --> 46:05.240
I mean, I can't make that claim.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.480
I don't know if Plex is gonna monitor,

46:06.480 --> 46:07.960
but I could see how commercial interests

46:07.960 --> 46:11.760
would persuade them to, but also just that aside,

46:11.760 --> 46:14.160
Jellyfin works a little better offline than Plex does.

46:14.160 --> 46:17.200
And I am ultimately always trying to build this system

46:17.200 --> 46:20.440
to operate as seamlessly as possible

46:20.440 --> 46:22.460
with no internet connection.

46:22.460 --> 46:25.200
And with Plex, that sometimes falls down.

46:25.200 --> 46:28.080
Well, like we talked about with Rune last week,

46:28.080 --> 46:32.160
for you, where your internet connectivity comes and goes,

46:32.160 --> 46:34.720
something like Rune where it just has zero minutes

46:34.720 --> 46:39.680
of guaranteed offline playback is just not an option.

46:39.680 --> 46:41.140
I didn't renew my Rune.

46:41.140 --> 46:44.120
I didn't buy Rune after my free trial, by the way,

46:44.120 --> 46:45.360
in case anybody was interested.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.500
I thought about it long and hard after the episode,

46:47.500 --> 46:50.120
but in the end, I just couldn't do it.

46:50.120 --> 46:53.240
Yeah, Jellyfin is just that, it's like, what was it?

46:53.240 --> 46:57.480
Kodi, XBMC, it's like what that project could have been,

46:57.480 --> 47:00.120
you know, turned into, it's like the modern version of that.

47:00.120 --> 47:01.760
And I'm so happy to see it's moving

47:01.760 --> 47:03.440
from strength to strength.

47:03.440 --> 47:06.780

only available to our members at Jupiter.party,

47:25.680 --> 47:29.220
and of course, our Self-Hosted SREs.

47:29.220 --> 47:31.440
All right, time for some feedback, I think.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.800
Julian F. writes in via matrix,

47:33.800 --> 47:36.860
I was excited to hear about the Mycroft Mark II,

47:36.860 --> 47:39.840
but then discovered Mycroft STT service

47:39.840 --> 47:42.400
is a proxy for Google's STT.

47:42.400 --> 47:44.840
I think that means speech to text.

47:44.840 --> 47:47.760
Has anyone found a comparison of various home assistants

47:47.760 --> 47:51.560
and how relatively good and private each system is?

47:51.560 --> 47:53.400
I noticed there's a Mycroft integration

47:53.400 --> 47:56.160
for home assistant, but is it any good?

47:56.160 --> 47:58.160
This is a tough problem.

47:58.160 --> 48:03.160
The voice assistant stuff is kind of necessary in my house.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Like that's how my kids prefer to interact

48:07.000 --> 48:09.080
with home assistant, and honestly,

48:09.080 --> 48:13.200
I'd say my wife probably 50% of the time-ish,

48:13.200 --> 48:14.480
somewhere in that range,

48:14.480 --> 48:17.840
she likes to interact with home assistant through voice.

48:17.840 --> 48:20.400
You guys know my solution has been the HomePod.

48:20.400 --> 48:24.840
The downside there is HomePods require internet

48:24.840 --> 48:26.160
to do the voice transcription,

48:26.160 --> 48:29.040
and they're doing it on Apple servers.

48:29.040 --> 48:33.300
The upside is that once it figures out what you're saying,

48:33.300 --> 48:35.180
it executes that over the LAN,

48:35.180 --> 48:37.200
where some devices use like an API

48:37.200 --> 48:39.360
and a cloud system and all that.

48:39.360 --> 48:41.080
I don't know if that's same for Mycroft,

48:41.080 --> 48:42.320
other than it sounds like they're using

48:42.320 --> 48:44.560
Google speech to text, which that's not ideal.

48:44.560 --> 48:46.080
Do you have a sense of this one, Alex?

48:46.080 --> 48:49.040
There are zero voice assistants deployed in production

48:49.040 --> 48:52.200
in this house, because as we've talked about several times,

48:52.200 --> 48:55.280
they are just getting worse and more annoying

48:55.280 --> 48:57.480
and more naggy, and hey, by the way,

48:57.480 --> 48:59.640
did you know that you, no, no, shut up.

48:59.640 --> 49:01.120
I just want to know what the weather is,

49:01.120 --> 49:04.240
or I'm not interested, okay?

49:04.240 --> 49:05.520
I've never really played around with it

49:05.520 --> 49:07.520
until just this most recent build,

49:07.520 --> 49:10.960
but when you subscribe to Nebuchadnezzar Cloud

49:10.960 --> 49:14.120
for Home Assistant, one of the features you get

49:14.120 --> 49:18.040
is their text-to-speech service.

49:18.040 --> 49:19.720
I don't know if you've tried it,

49:19.720 --> 49:22.040
but it sounds better than Google's.

49:22.040 --> 49:24.580
I did a little A-B comparison and had the family say

49:24.580 --> 49:25.880
which one they liked better.

49:25.880 --> 49:28.840
They all picked the Nebuchadnezzar text-to-speech service,

49:28.840 --> 49:30.640
and I mean, it's on their servers,

49:30.640 --> 49:32.320
so I don't know how, maybe they're just

49:32.320 --> 49:35.160
proxying somebody else, but I've been using that,

49:35.160 --> 49:37.120
so I have nighttime scripts,

49:37.120 --> 49:39.000
like we've talked about in the show before,

49:39.000 --> 49:41.620
and now, when the script kicks off,

49:41.620 --> 49:45.680
it uses the Nebuchadnezzar text-to-speech service

49:45.680 --> 49:49.160
to play on all the HomePods that the bedtime mode

49:49.160 --> 49:50.720
is starting, and everybody's got 15 minutes

49:50.720 --> 49:54.000
to get their ass to bed, and it sounds great,

49:54.000 --> 49:55.460
but it's not local.

49:55.460 --> 49:58.260
I imagine it's more private than using the Google one,

49:58.260 --> 49:59.600
but it's not local.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.460
I'd love something local.

50:01.460 --> 50:03.520
It's something that could tie into a speaker.

50:03.520 --> 50:05.680
I don't care if I have to build the device for it,

50:05.680 --> 50:07.280
a little microphone.

50:07.280 --> 50:09.760
In fact, in a way, I'd prefer to build my own device

50:09.760 --> 50:11.480
because I could build it with badass microphones

50:11.480 --> 50:12.920
positioned right where I need them.

50:12.920 --> 50:15.920
That's the key, isn't it, local, local, local.

50:15.920 --> 50:17.320
Yeah, absolutely.

50:17.320 --> 50:20.600
We did link to the integration for Mycroft

50:20.600 --> 50:23.440
that Julian also included.

50:23.440 --> 50:25.400
If you know, let us know.

50:25.400 --> 50:28.880
If you've seen a comparison of Home Assistance,

50:28.880 --> 50:31.040
if you have a little bit of experience you've done,

50:31.040 --> 50:33.000
or if you have a Mycroft that you've tried

50:33.000 --> 50:36.120
with Home Assistant, let us know.

50:36.120 --> 50:37.780
Selfhosted.show slash contact,

50:37.780 --> 50:40.140
or you can send us a boost with a new podcast app,

50:40.140 --> 50:43.960
and speaking of boosts, Gene Bean came in this week

50:43.960 --> 50:48.480
with a really generous 20,480 SATs,

50:48.480 --> 50:50.360
and Gene has a question.

50:50.360 --> 50:52.240
How do y'all back up your Nextcloud?

50:52.240 --> 50:55.560
I'm running the snap version on Debian for now,

50:55.560 --> 50:58.400
it's just simplicity, but I'm totally game to change it

50:58.400 --> 51:01.240
as I have to migrate servers at some point anyways.

51:01.240 --> 51:02.680
So how do you back up your Nextcloud?

51:02.680 --> 51:03.920
Well, all of my containers,

51:03.920 --> 51:06.680
and I run Nextcloud in a container, of course,

51:06.680 --> 51:09.840
is they're all backed, all of their app data,

51:09.840 --> 51:11.960
which is what I call a kind of persistent data

51:11.960 --> 51:15.320
of these containers, they're all ZFS volumes,

51:15.320 --> 51:17.680
and then I just replicate those across the world

51:17.680 --> 51:19.160
to various different servers that I have.

51:19.160 --> 51:23.040
I've got one upstairs, so my main server's in the basement.

51:23.040 --> 51:26.920
I use ZFS Send, which is wrapped in Jim Salter's

51:26.920 --> 51:30.680
Sanoid and Syncoid tooling, to send it to a box

51:30.680 --> 51:32.120
that I have under my desk up here,

51:32.120 --> 51:34.700
which has just got a couple of 10 terabyte drives in it,

51:34.700 --> 51:37.920
as a full ZFS replication of what's in the basement

51:37.920 --> 51:40.480
in case of a pipe burst or something,

51:40.480 --> 51:42.360
and then I don't have to rely on the internet

51:42.360 --> 51:44.080
to get that data back.

51:44.080 --> 51:46.720
If this house blows down for whatever reason,

51:46.720 --> 51:48.680
then I've got stuff on the other side of the Atlantic

51:48.680 --> 51:50.200
that I can recover from.

51:50.200 --> 51:54.000
And then as a third prong to that backup strategy,

51:54.000 --> 51:57.640
I use Autoresstick as a wrapper around RESTIC

51:57.640 --> 52:00.640
to send my stuff over to Synology as well,

52:00.640 --> 52:03.120
and that does all the app data on a file level

52:03.120 --> 52:05.080
as opposed to ZFS's block level.

52:05.080 --> 52:08.080
So I've got kind of a two-prong approach

52:08.080 --> 52:10.480
to how I back up that data.

52:10.480 --> 52:12.720
I'm wondering what people do when they want to back up

52:12.720 --> 52:16.180
like 25 terabytes of data.

52:16.180 --> 52:18.800
Well, the only option realistically

52:18.800 --> 52:21.320
is to either pay through the nose for Glacier

52:21.320 --> 52:23.480
or something like that with AWS,

52:23.480 --> 52:26.240
or to build a server and stick it at a friend's house.

52:26.240 --> 52:29.880
I mean, once you're getting above the sort of 20, 50,

52:29.880 --> 52:33.440
100 terabyte numbers, the monthly payments on that

52:33.440 --> 52:36.120
would pay for a server somewhere else pretty quickly.

52:36.120 --> 52:37.120
I think you're right.

52:37.120 --> 52:38.200
I think you're right.

52:38.200 --> 52:40.480
GeneBean also sent another 2048 SaaS just

52:40.480 --> 52:43.020
to say that he's really been enjoying the random live feeds

52:43.020 --> 52:45.720
over at jupyter.tube, and he's looking forward

52:45.720 --> 52:47.600
to deets on the Odroid.

52:47.600 --> 52:49.360
We don't mention it all the time.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.960
I hope we've mentioned it frequently,

52:50.960 --> 52:53.480
but if you don't know, we have been live streaming over

52:53.480 --> 52:58.080
at jupyter.tube, which is our own JB self-hosted instance

52:58.080 --> 53:00.840
of PeerTube, which is like a YouTube in a box.

53:00.840 --> 53:03.920
We mostly just use it to just record

53:03.920 --> 53:05.800
how we make the live show, or how we record

53:05.800 --> 53:07.000
the shows live and all that.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.240
But you could use it if you are an open source

53:10.240 --> 53:14.000
project, or a church, or like a city council,

53:14.000 --> 53:15.600
or a school district.

53:15.600 --> 53:18.300
You could use it as your own private YouTube instance

53:18.300 --> 53:21.480
with playlists, and accounts, and all that kind of stuff.

53:21.480 --> 53:25.760
User 9014, using Fountain, hasn't set their username.

53:25.760 --> 53:27.240
Boosted it with 1,200 sats.

53:27.240 --> 53:29.200
Tinkers will be tinkers.

53:29.200 --> 53:31.200
I'm trying to boost thing with the Fountain app.

53:31.200 --> 53:32.900
So far, I'm not really a fan of the app.

53:32.900 --> 53:34.800
I love the concept of value for value,

53:34.800 --> 53:36.920
but the app coming from Pocket Casts, to me,

53:36.920 --> 53:38.180
it's just not the same.

53:38.180 --> 53:41.080
Maybe it's just me being an asshole Android developer.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.080
I'll keep trying the other 2.0 apps.

53:43.080 --> 53:44.280
Thanks for the shows, though.

53:44.280 --> 53:44.880
I love them all.

53:44.880 --> 53:46.680
Sending love from Spain.

53:46.680 --> 53:49.680
Una Cerveza, por favor.

53:49.680 --> 53:52.560
I agree, it's an uphill adoption.

53:52.560 --> 53:53.920
I'm not going to lie to you.

53:53.920 --> 53:57.680
It took me a solid month to wrap my head around Fountain.

53:57.680 --> 54:00.600
Really, what made Fountain stick for me is I started discovering

54:00.600 --> 54:02.720
new podcasts through their clips feature.

54:02.720 --> 54:04.560
And then I was like, I was on board.

54:04.560 --> 54:06.120
But I've been hearing from some people,

54:06.120 --> 54:07.720
they'll stick with their favorite app,

54:07.720 --> 54:10.080
and they'll use Podverse.fm, the web app,

54:10.080 --> 54:11.360
to boost into the show.

54:11.360 --> 54:14.440
User 1692 wrote in with 1,500 sats.

54:14.440 --> 54:17.280
I just wanted to let you know that the Rune Lifetime used

54:17.280 --> 54:20.320
to only be $499.

54:20.320 --> 54:22.460
The CEO has threatened to pull it at some point,

54:22.460 --> 54:23.840
as it's not sustainable.

54:23.840 --> 54:26.560
And so I buckled and bought the Lifetime.

54:26.560 --> 54:30.040
A one-off purchase for me is way better than $10 a month.

54:30.040 --> 54:31.800
I just thought you'd like to know.

54:31.800 --> 54:33.880
I'm a bit more inclined for that kind of thing, too.

54:33.880 --> 54:36.080
I mean, $499 is a little rich for my blood.

54:36.080 --> 54:37.640
Well, it's $699 now.

54:37.640 --> 54:39.040
Yeah, and sometimes every now and then,

54:39.040 --> 54:40.680
those things have a Black Friday sale.

54:40.680 --> 54:46.120
Probably not Rune, but $500 for a Lifetime, I'd have to use it.

54:46.120 --> 54:49.520
I'd have to use it for at least five years consistently for me

54:49.520 --> 54:51.260
to start to at least.

54:51.260 --> 54:53.760
In the time since the last episode,

54:53.760 --> 54:56.360
my free trial has expired, as I mentioned.

54:56.360 --> 55:02.160
But the feature voting section of the Rune forum,

55:02.160 --> 55:06.240
re-enabling offline grace period for the server

55:06.240 --> 55:09.040
has become their most requested feature ever

55:09.040 --> 55:11.600
in the space of a week, which I just think is amazing.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.400
That tells you something, doesn't it?

55:13.400 --> 55:15.700
It does, and it will be really interesting to see

55:15.700 --> 55:16.960
whether they listen or not.

55:16.960 --> 55:20.320
And that will dictate, for me, the posture of the company

55:20.320 --> 55:21.720
and the product moving forward.

55:21.720 --> 55:22.440
Huge signal.

55:22.440 --> 55:23.920
Depending on how they react to this

55:23.920 --> 55:26.440
will depend as to whether I become a customer or not.

55:26.440 --> 55:28.080
Yeah, you're right.

55:28.080 --> 55:29.840
This is a defining moment for them.

55:29.840 --> 55:31.120
It really is, yeah.

55:31.120 --> 55:34.000
I'm really grateful DexSword boosted in with 901 SATs,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.300
because I probably heard about this five times

55:36.300 --> 55:37.640
in this last week since I started

55:37.640 --> 55:38.680
talking about the Odroid.

55:38.680 --> 55:41.380
He says, have you guys looked at the Ximura board?

55:41.380 --> 55:44.320
I've been tempted to get one instead of a Raspberry Pi.

55:44.320 --> 55:47.060
I think we've talked about this on the show before, Alex.

55:47.060 --> 55:48.960
We've had some feedback about it, definitely.

55:48.960 --> 55:52.480
It's one of those boards that just looks really cool,

55:52.480 --> 55:55.720
but I don't personally have a use case for it,

55:55.720 --> 55:57.000
so I haven't bought one.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.400
But the more of you becomes SREs,

56:00.400 --> 56:03.440
maybe we can think about buying one.

56:03.440 --> 56:04.840
How about that for a plug?

56:04.840 --> 56:05.720
There you go.

56:05.720 --> 56:11.440
I am just too skeptical to spend my own hard-earned money

56:11.440 --> 56:12.600
on this thing.

56:12.600 --> 56:14.800
I don't know, I think I've been burned too many times.

56:14.800 --> 56:19.780
It is a Intel quad core based system

56:19.780 --> 56:24.160
that is wrapped inside a, like it

56:24.160 --> 56:27.600
looks like it's a ruggedized case that has

56:27.600 --> 56:29.400
a heat sink that's built into it.

56:29.400 --> 56:30.960
And so it's almost something like you

56:30.960 --> 56:32.280
could install in a vehicle, which

56:32.280 --> 56:34.840
I think is one of the reasons why people have hit me up

56:34.840 --> 56:36.240
so much about it, because it looks

56:36.240 --> 56:39.480
like it's meant to be installed in a vehicle,

56:39.480 --> 56:41.240
because it's so ruggedized.

56:41.240 --> 56:43.880
So a company like Odroid has a track record,

56:43.880 --> 56:46.480
but the Zima people, Z-I-M-A, I don't

56:46.480 --> 56:47.680
know anything about them.

56:47.680 --> 56:48.760
I don't know if they're going to be around.

56:48.760 --> 56:50.720
It doesn't seem like many people have this.

56:50.720 --> 56:52.920
And if this thing isn't successful,

56:52.920 --> 56:55.440
does the company begin and end right here?

56:55.440 --> 56:57.400
Like I have so many questions about this device,

56:57.400 --> 56:59.520
too, in terms of performance and storage.

56:59.520 --> 57:02.640
And I just don't trust it enough to spend my own money

57:02.640 --> 57:04.280
to try it.

57:04.280 --> 57:06.560
I agree, it looks perfect for somebody like me.

57:06.560 --> 57:10.960
And it does have a PCI slot, which I would love.

57:10.960 --> 57:12.600
It's really strange, isn't it?

57:12.600 --> 57:19.600
So it's got a PCI 2.0 X4 PCIe slot, and two SATA ports,

57:19.600 --> 57:21.520
and two gigabit LAN ports.

57:21.520 --> 57:22.680
Yeah, it looks really good.

57:22.680 --> 57:26.320
So it would make a pretty good NAS kind of brain.

57:26.320 --> 57:27.840
I agree.

57:27.840 --> 57:30.600
It's just that the Odroid looks like a complete solution that's

57:30.600 --> 57:31.160
ready to go.

57:31.160 --> 57:33.480
And to this, this just looks like it's a Kickstarter.

57:33.480 --> 57:34.280
But I know it's not.

57:34.280 --> 57:35.760
Well, it was.

57:35.760 --> 57:36.840
Yeah, it was.

57:36.840 --> 57:39.360
It was, but it's been fulfilled now, I think,

57:39.360 --> 57:42.400
which is not guaranteed with Kickstarter, is it?

57:42.400 --> 57:44.000
I've just been burned so many times

57:44.000 --> 57:46.400
to spend $120 on something like this.

57:46.400 --> 57:49.920
But I really like the look of it.

57:49.920 --> 57:52.960
If the Odroid wasn't a thing, I may be tempted.

57:52.960 --> 57:54.760
It is close to that.

57:54.760 --> 57:56.680
But now, it just feels silly.

57:56.680 --> 57:57.680
I don't need it.

57:57.680 --> 57:58.680
And yeah.

57:58.680 --> 58:02.440
I mean, with a PCIe 4X slot, you could do quite a lot

58:02.440 --> 58:03.120
with this thing.

58:03.120 --> 58:07.200
You could stick a couple of extra SSDs in there.

58:07.200 --> 58:10.640
You could put a 10 gig ethernet in there.

58:10.640 --> 58:12.800
I mean, you could do a lot of cool stuff with it.

58:12.800 --> 58:14.640
It's a bit of a weird form factor as well.

58:14.640 --> 58:16.640
It's kind of like got a heat sink built into it,

58:16.640 --> 58:18.840
and then the PCI slots hanging off the side.

58:18.840 --> 58:23.040
And what form factor is this designed for?

58:23.040 --> 58:27.240
It looks a little bit odd in that respect.

58:27.240 --> 58:29.880
But it's certainly something I'm keeping an eye on.

58:29.880 --> 58:30.400
All right.

58:30.400 --> 58:32.080
I'm going to try to move fast because we

58:32.080 --> 58:32.880
got some great ones.

58:32.880 --> 58:35.840
But I want to give a mention to MG boosted

58:35.840 --> 58:38.640
in a row of ducks, 222 SATs.

58:38.640 --> 58:41.480
So they've been very happy with LMS and Squeeze Light

58:41.480 --> 58:42.720
running on Pi's.

58:42.720 --> 58:44.760
So there's some more feedback there.

58:44.760 --> 58:46.640
J Cube sent their first boost this week,

58:46.640 --> 58:49.520
and they just started the show at episode 73.

58:49.520 --> 58:51.000
That's amazing.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.680
Neve came in with 2004 SATs.

58:53.680 --> 58:55.960
2004 is the year of NGINX.

58:55.960 --> 58:57.240
That's when it was created.

58:57.240 --> 58:59.360
Ubuntu's first release.

58:59.360 --> 59:01.160
I didn't realize those two things.

59:01.160 --> 59:03.480
Gen 2 was not for weirdos at the time.

59:03.480 --> 59:06.260
That was the year Neve's car was built,

59:06.260 --> 59:08.880
and the first time they ever saw a terminal emulator.

59:08.880 --> 59:11.000
And they just wanted to share.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.320
And then Acorn wanted to know your favorite terminal app.

59:14.320 --> 59:17.600
They say they like Lazy Docker Project, Htop,

59:17.600 --> 59:18.520
those types of things.

59:18.520 --> 59:20.640
Do you have a terminal app that's

59:20.640 --> 59:23.600
one of your go-tos, besides the obvious Emacs?

59:23.600 --> 59:27.480
I think it must be Hollywood, that kind of one

59:27.480 --> 59:29.720
that makes me look like a legit hacker

59:29.720 --> 59:32.080
in the background with some of my live streams.

59:32.080 --> 59:33.200
That's a great answer.

59:33.200 --> 59:34.440
We got to put a link to that.

59:34.440 --> 59:35.280
Hollywood snap.

59:35.280 --> 59:37.440
I'll put a note right there.

59:37.440 --> 59:38.000
Check it out.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.120
There's a snap for it that makes your computer look

59:40.120 --> 59:41.760
like it's doing amazing things.

59:41.760 --> 59:43.120
That's a great answer.

59:43.120 --> 59:45.920
Bashtop is also a really great one,

59:45.920 --> 59:49.080
just in terms of just visualizations and whatnot.

59:49.080 --> 59:53.240
And then Thumbs comes in with our last boost, 10,000 SATs.

59:53.240 --> 59:56.880
Do you guys ever have memories of what you were listening

59:56.880 --> 59:59.560
to at a specific place?

59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.840
I just pulled into a parking lot I haven't

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.860
been to in a couple of years, and I

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.560
was taken back to the moment.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.440
I was listening to episode two with Wendell.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.720
Thanks for the years of memories and great content.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.120
I'm a network member, but I thought

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.600
you deserve some extra value for that memory.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.040
You know, for me, I can think of a JB memory.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.240
This was when I was doing my computer science masters

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.880
back in 2015, 13, 14 period.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.080
And I was listening to you and Mike on Coda

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.240
talk about whatever nonsense it was you

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.000
were talking about at the time.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.360
And I thought, you know what?

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.240
I actually know a little bit about this stuff.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.760
Maybe I should get a career in it.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.120
The funny thing about Coder, that

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.880
might have been around the time we were interviewing

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.320
the two co-founders of Docker before it was called Docker.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.120
I remember, yeah.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.920
And that is an old, if somebody can find that in the archives,

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.520
that's a great, that's a really great old interview.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.840
Before it was even called Docker,

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.920
I forget the name right now.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.720
Yeah, Mike always remembers.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.240
So that's my job is just to remember

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.280
that we did the interview, and then he

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.600
remembers what they called it.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.720
But they didn't start with Docker.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.640
It's fascinating, too, because we asked them

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.520
a little bit about their business ideas.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.240
People are still asking some of the questions we

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:06.120
asked them in that interview.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.520
Thank you to Hannegan, or Hannegan, don't know,

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.480
sent 3,000 sats, 5,000 sats from a Ninja Mort.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.560
No messages with those.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.200
They just sent them in when they were listening.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.400
We also got a few other boosts in there

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.560
that didn't quite make it to the show,

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.960
because we got to keep it tighter.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.840
But I just want to say thank you, everybody.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.760
It's a big motivator.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.160
It really is a nice boost to morale,

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.160
and it's also a great way to show value.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.800
Go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com,

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.200
or become a member.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.360
You can go to selfhosted.show slash SRE,

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.200
and invest in the ongoing production.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.000
A boost is a great way to say good job,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.840
or get a message on the show.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.400
And the membership is a great way

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.120
to invest in ongoing production.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.840
Selfhosted.show slash SRE.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.520
We should probably mention The Matrix.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.920
I mean, we do have a Discord, too.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.520
That's been rocking the whole episode

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.160
at selfhosted.show slash Discord.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.320
But maybe honorable mention for The Matrix,

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.600
because it was useful for the meetup.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:03.360
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Matrix for deets on that.

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.040
Thank you, Alex, because I know early this morning,

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.080
when the OpenSSL patches went out,

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.080
you got out and got the JB infrastructure all updated.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.600
So thank you for doing that for us.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.920
By the time this comes out, people know about that.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.480
Yeah.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.280
Well, there was a big vulnerability released

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.160
this morning in OpenSSL.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.960
Only the second ever, I think, critical marked CVE,

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.720
something to do with remote code execution.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.560
Actually, it turned out I didn't have to do a whole bunch,

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:33.040
because I had already set up unattended upgrades

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.200
in all of our Ubuntu boxes that we use.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.120
So by the time I'd logged in, it had already

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.400
gone and done the unattended upgrade

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.200
for the security patches.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.600
It was just an example, I suppose, of good sysadmining.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.080
But I went on to check anyway, just in case.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.240
You heard it here.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.640
You heard it here, everybody.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.680
Alex recommends using Ubuntu systems with auto updates.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:57.160
Yeah.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:57.680
All right.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.160
Well, it's still good to have it done, so thank you.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.360
If you'd like to send us your feedback, like I said,

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.240
new podcast app or self-hosted.show slash contact.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.080
And you can go and find me over on Elon's latest play

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.520
thing at Twitter.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.240
I am at Ironic Badger.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.720
I'm over there at Chris LAS.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.400
And the podcast is at Self-Hosted Show.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.480
$44 billion for a toy.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.280
Can you imagine?

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.880
For a pain in the neck.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.800
Yeah, crazy.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.280
Anyway, thanks for listening, everybody.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:56.240
That was self-hosted.show slash 83.
