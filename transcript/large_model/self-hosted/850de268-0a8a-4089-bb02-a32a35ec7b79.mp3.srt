1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
I went to the dentist this week for the first time in about 15 years.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,080
Oh, that sounds rough.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,680
It was not pretty. No, no, I came home with a fat lip or a pair of fat lips like a flowerpot man.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,840
I want a selfie next time that happens.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,720
I took a funny video, which I might share with you,

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,840
but it's definitely never to be published to the public.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,000
I definitely would never do that.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,120
Yeah, I don't know. So I had this horrible like cleaning procedure done. It wasn't that bad,

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,440
actually. I'd psyched myself up that it was going to be awful. And in the end, you know,

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,120
I was laying back in the chair and there was a TV on the ceiling and I watched some like

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,400
Dwayne the Rock Johnson skyscraper movie and I don't know, it wasn't so bad.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,120
You know, my daughter recently went in and they gave her like goggles

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,440
to have video screens in them.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,600
Yeah, what are we doing here, boys?

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,320
We need goggles. Hold your breath. No, they got like screens in them and she's like watching

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,080
a movie while they go to town on her mouth.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,440
That's the way to do it.

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,240
I know.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,520
If they just gave me a little happy gas while I'm at it, we got ourselves a deal.

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,960
That's VR, happy gas. I'll be in that dentist seat anytime.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,960
Don't know how I haven't told you this. I bought a Valve Index last week.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,160
You what?

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,360
And I haven't told you.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,520
You what? Have you hooked it up?

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,600
Speaking of VR, yeah. Yeah, I have.

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,000
What's your first impressions?

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,080
Beat Saber is my new favorite game. Have you played Beat Saber?

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,480
No, but if I got VR, I would. If I got a Quest, which I know is not nearly as awesome,

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,000
could we still hang out in the same places? Is that a thing?

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,320
I don't know. I mean, I run the game from Steam on Windows.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,160
Yeah, I think anything on the Quest runs from Mark Zuckerberg's bedroom,

32
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,920
but I'm not sure about that.

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,840
Well, including the building access systems.

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,880
Right. Oh, too soon. I got big dreams, though, of us hanging out in a virtual

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,880
studio while we're doing these shows. Something really sweet. The coolest studio you ever saw

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,400
on MTV Cribs or whatever, virtually, and then we'd have this ginormous stadium that

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,040
the live audience could hang out in. All in VR.

38
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:18,240
Well, Steam VR has this... It's sort of like the holodeck brought to life. It is awesome.

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,760
Awesome. So you load up Steam VR and you put the headset on and you're stood in this kind of

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:31,520
feng shui room with concrete and wood and glass and birds flying and you're on the top of this

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,640
mountain and you just feel like you've just transported yourself. It's a bit like that

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,160
scene in The Matrix where they open the door and suddenly they're in a completely different

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,320
part of the world. It's pretty amazing and the immersion is very, very impressive.

44
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,640
So the Index has a couple of headphones that kind of fold down. They don't touch your ears,

45
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,400
but they sound really pretty good. It's like a pretty solid set of open back headphones

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,960
that you're wearing. And the nice thing is it means my wife and I, we can share the headset

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,360
without needing... Because I prefer in-ear headphones that go in my ear canal. She prefers

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,320
AirPod styles that don't. And so we always had to have two sets of headphones if we wanted to

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:19,280
share before, but with the Index we don't. And you just hook it up to your PC and

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,560
does the rest, huh? Yeah, a USB port and a DisplayPort is all you need.

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,520
See, I'm trying to, if I get into VR, I'm trying to figure out if that's the route I want to go,

52
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,640
or if something like the Quest is the route I want to go where there's, if I want, there's no

53
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,200
PC at all and it's portable, which might make it easier for the kids to use too. You do need a good

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,640
amount of space for the Index, you know, sort of six feet by about 10 feet. Oh yeah, sure, sure.

55
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,760
Yeah, so that would sort of be a studio device, whereas the other one might be better in the RV.

56
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,280
Yeah, I could see it, you know, in the room behind you in the studio. It would probably

57
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,080
fit in there just fine. I mean, you know, mostly I just want to play Super Mario,

58
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,760
so if I could just get Super Mario working on these things, I'm set.

59
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,920
I did have a moment though where I loaded up Microsoft Flight Sim and I was sat in the cockpit,

60
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,040
I've got a joystick, several years ago, Flight Sim in VR and I'm flying and I came into one of

61
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,360
these scenarios they set up for you, like a sightseeing scenario, and I was transported

62
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,160
instantly to this plane flying over Loch Ness in Scotland. And I looked down and I thought to

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,840
myself, I stayed in that caravan site as a kid. Wow. And I then looked it up on Google Maps

64
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,400
afterwards and I was like, holy crap, I was right. That was the caravan site. And you know,

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,000
there was the Jacobite steam train going along the bottom of the campsite and all that.

66
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,200
So the graphics in Flight Sim are truly remarkable and I was quite struck by it because I remember

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:02,800
thinking the first Flight Sim I played was probably MS 2002. I think Concorde was in that one. And I

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,080
remember, I think it was just before Concorde was retired. And you know, I lived in the south

69
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,280
of England and Concorde used to fly over my house every day. It was awesome. And I just remember

70
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,760
thinking back then, oh, these graphics are amazing. How could they possibly get any better?

71
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,800
And then I was struck wearing the VR headset as I flew past Ben Nevis, you know, at the same height

72
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,480
as Ben Nevis, the tallest mountain in the UK. And I sort of looked to my side and I was like,

73
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,080
huh, there's a mountain there and there's the campsite there. And I was sort of moving my head

74
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,720
around in real time thinking, wonder where we'll be in 20 years. Oh, no kidding. I've heard that

75
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,120
I've never seen it, but I've heard that the team also really nailed the Pacific Northwest because

76
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,480
obviously Redmond, their hometown area. So if you want to fly around my neck of the woods,

77
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,040
I guess it's supposed to be pretty accurate. Yeah, they use this photogrammetry thing,

78
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:02,080
which is based on the famously good Bing maps, although actually it is pretty impressive. Like

79
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,160
the 3D modeling and stuff of certain cities is truly spectacular. There's a few things like

80
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,800
bridges over the River Thames, for example, that are definitely in need of some work, but they're

81
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,640
issuing patches all the time and it's improved hugely since launch. So, you know, if you have a

82
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,000
VR headset, you're thinking about buying one, I would say Flight Sim is probably a must play.

83
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,240
Well, now you really made me want one. Alex, you do that. We do these episodes and I'm like,

84
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,920
I got to get that. It's easy to spend other people's money. I'll tell you that.

85
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,440
You know, I think we have a theme though today that could save people some money.

86
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,000
But I was about to say, you know, we're on the topic of gaming and a listener wrote in with a

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,520
project called RetroNAS. And I thought with the Steam Deck coming out soon that we might see

88
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,760
a resurgence of handheld gaming, of retro gaming, you know, people playing Mario Kart on handhelds,

89
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,960
as well as, you know, Grand Theft Autos and all sorts of cool stuff. I know the Steam Deck can

90
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,480
play some AAA titles, but I doubt that will be the primary use case for a lot of folks.

91
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,800
Oh, really? Hmm. Okay. I do like the idea of getting some of my retro games on the deck.

92
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,000
So you're right. I would I will be getting like a Super Nintendo emulator on that one handheld

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,880
device that can play Nintendo games, Sega games, PC games, anything you can think of pretty much

94
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,280
because it's just a computer, right? It's just a laptop, essentially, in a little handheld

95
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,120
switch size device. And once you think within a short period of time, the Linux community is

96
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,560
going to have respins of SteamOS with emulators baked in and whatnot. The community for this thing

97
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,440
is going to be bonkers. You think how big it is for the Switch. Now, the Switch is a lockdown

98
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,960
platform. Think how big it's going to be for the Steam Deck that is free and open and running

99
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,840
Linux, baby. I mean, how cool is that? It might be the most exciting thing that's happening on

100
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,880
the Linux desktop at the moment, period. Yeah, it could be, you're right, because it's also a

101
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,320
plasma desktop. So anyway, we were talking about RetroNAS briefly, and this is a project which

102
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:15,200
allows you to use any kind of Linux computer, so a Raspberry Pi, an old PC, a VM, whatever it might

103
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:22,320
be, as a network storage device for different gaming consoles and emulators. And at first,

104
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:30,000
I was like, isn't RetroNAS basically just Samba? What is this project doing that a network share

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,800
wouldn't do? And it turns out, actually, it's doing loads. So a lot of these older consoles

106
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,760
require things like Samba version one and Apple file protocol and all sorts of stuff that's been

107
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,560
a long time deprecated for security reasons. And so what RetroNAS does is it very clearly states,

108
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,960
we are doing stuff that is insecure, here be dragons. But what they're doing is they're

109
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,160
actually serving games up over the network using all these old protocols to all these old game

110
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,800
consoles. And one example, we have several links in the show notes of the project founder, his

111
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,840
YouTube channel, Dick Freaks. There's one example here where he's actually loading up games and

112
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:17,120
ripping ISOs from his PlayStation 3, storing the ISO on his NAS, and then streaming the ISO back to

113
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,600
the PlayStation without the disk in it to play it offline and basically DRM freeing the game forever.

114
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,040
Oh, that's the dream. You know, when the very first Xbox came out, I got on board that hacking

115
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,960
train as fast as possible because you could get the games on the hard drive and avoid having to

116
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,240
fetch the disk and the load times. This sounds like the sweet spot because you could get a

117
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,160
Pi-powered NAS and then you could go pick up a used PlayStation, like a PS3 right now,

118
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,360
how much could that be? And you could basically have trouble-free appliance gaming.

119
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,000
100, 150 bucks, something like that. Yeah. You know, it's funny, I don't even think retro.

120
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,800
When you say retro gaming, I think even older than that, but I guess that is retro.

121
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,560
PS3 is 10 years ago? Maybe more? So the list of consoles that's supported,

122
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,680
there's quite a few. So MS-DOS and clones, like FreeDOS and PC-DOS, Windows 95 and up.

123
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:22,400
We've got Apple GS and classic Mac systems. Atari ST is supported. Amiga's the Nintendo 3DS.

124
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,120
So it's pretty cool to see a Nintendo console on this list. The PS2, the PS3, Xbox 360,

125
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,880
as well as many more are planned in the future. That is pretty neat. You know, I know I'm a bigger

126
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,680
retro gamer than you are in part because I've just never really moved on. But also I like retro

127
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,840
gaming for the exact reason you don't like it, Alex. I so rarely have any time to play.

128
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,560
And games like Mario are so easy to pick up and play for 15 minutes and then put down again.

129
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,120
And so I've kind of been biased towards some of the older Marios because I can load them up on

130
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,320
low-power devices and they're great for road trips. Yeah, I mean, I still play an awful lot of some of

131
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,960
my favorite older games, retro games, but I've always been a PC gamer first rather than a console

132
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:22,560
guy. My kind of god tier list of games is Factorio, Open Transport Tycoon, or the original

133
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,120
Transport Tycoon I did used to play before Open TTD. Rollercoaster Tycoon, Sim City 4 is great.

134
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,600
I'd say those four are probably my top ones. As far as PC games go, I've always, always preferred

135
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,840
games that support some kind of LAN play. I don't generally finish games, but if I can co-op or group

136
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,120
play a game, I will finish that thing all the way to the end every time. I love that kind of stuff.

137
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:55,520
And I've done some of these early games that required IPX. I want to say the first Starcraft

138
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:03,280
I played wasn't over TCP IP on a LAN, but I want to say it was over Net Buoy or IPX or something

139
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,400
that's just totally not even supported anymore. Showing your age there, bro.

140
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,560
I know! You're right, actually, right? Do people even know the struggles that we had to deal with

141
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,880
with Net Buoy and the pain that Microsoft inflicted upon the networking world back in

142
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,920
the day? No, nobody even cares. I don't even remember a time before TCP IP, I'm afraid.

143
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,640
Yeah, and then WINS came along. WINS was just supposed to solve it, but they had to have their

144
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,000
own thing. They couldn't choose to use DNS. Oh my goodness, you got me all upset. The very first

145
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,880
game, I think there's two that come to mind, the very first games I ever played, there was Stunt

146
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:46,800
Car Racer. My nan had a computer with a five and a quarter inch floppy bay in it. That was on a,

147
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,920
I can't even remember what the OS was. There you go, it was that long ago. But then the next one,

148
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,680
the first game that I ever had really of my own besides Lemmings at school was Monster Truck

149
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:06,400
Madness. Oh, okay. The first game I really saw take off, oh my God, I'm doing it again. This

150
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,960
is your fault. It was Oregon Trail. Oregon Trail was really big when I was in school. And we had

151
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,720
just green screens, green and white monochrome type screens, but it was green. And I remember

152
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,680
playing Oregon Trail on that to the point where, and there was a buddy in me and we'd play on it

153
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,920
and then we'd leave it on and it burned in on the school screen. The CRT guy, Oregon Trail burned

154
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,160
in on it. Oops. I remember seeing that like betting screens in the UK used to have like

155
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,800
CFAX pages. I don't know if you know what CFAX was, but it was like a version of the internet

156
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,160
before the internet, but it came through the TV. I don't know a better way to describe it than that.

157
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,880
It was kind of fun. Like everybody knew their favorite page number. Like a 606 for me,

158
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,520
for example, was like now and next on the TV channels. Like it came out with a little

159
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,240
like end curses style display. It was pretty cool. Now I think about it. Yeah, that sounds

160
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,560
really rad. But anyway, all the betting shops, they used to be like sports scores on CFAX as

161
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,120
a whole section. And they used to have these CRTs burned in with these CFAX logos and stuff.

162
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,360
Oh yeah. Yeah. The CRT burning thing was real in the library and the school too.

163
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Um, and of course the other game that was a hit back in the day was Where in the World

164
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,880
is Carmen Sandiego. It's coming out on- Yes. Oh, I do remember that one.

165
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,680
Played that on DOS all the way into Windows. I played that from the text era into the graphical

166
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,200
era. I was so young. I didn't really know where any of the places were or how to even pronounce

167
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,440
like Budapest. I remember I was like, where is that? Well that's miles away. It's Hungary.

168
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,040
Goodness me. You know, it'd be fun to fire that up again though. The nostalgia factor

169
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,840
helps make up for the lackluster graphics. I don't mind a game with low graphics because

170
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,680
I can play it on a computer and the computer won't turn into a ball of liquid metal on my lap.

171
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:06,720
That's nice. True. Yeah, very true. Linode.com slash SSH. Go there to get $100 and 60 day credit

172
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,680
on a new account and you go there to support the show. Just think of it like this. Linode is fast,

173
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,080
reliable cloud hosting. You just, you got to go try it and that's why they're giving you $100

174
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,240
to really go kick the tires. That's like Linode just showing you that they're confident that when

175
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,720
you go try it and you really get a chance to use it for a bit, you're going to stick around.

176
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,280
And I think you'll like it. They have a good mix of performance. They have 11 data centers

177
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,880
around the world. They have customer support that's going to help you when you need it.

178
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,720
They're available 365. They've been upgrading their infrastructure. So a little bit ago,

179
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,160
they started rolling out bare metal systems. Of course, they have invested heavily in their

180
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,960
networking over the years. So they are their own ISP. And most recently they're rolling out PCI

181
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,440
and BME storage on some of their systems. And not too long ago, they upgraded their

182
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,920
Optron processors and some of their high-end CPU rigs. I mean, they're just, they're constantly

183
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,960
trying to make sure you get the best performance for your buck. They got a great UI. And if you're

184
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,600
ready to kind of get fancy, they also have an API that it's pretty straightforward to use. It's

185
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,600
well documented. And they have a command line client that you can get on any OS. I have installed

186
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,720
on my systems. And you can do simple things like take snapshots and reboot. You can create systems.

187
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,880
You can upload files to the object storage, all from the command line. And that's kind of like a

188
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,840
power way to use Linode. We have just about every critical system we've built with the exception of

189
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,760
a rig here at the studio that runs a few things in the last couple of years. We look at it as a

190
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,560
balance of like some things we decide to self-host and a lot of things we decide to manage ourselves

191
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,720
on Linode's cloud. Because it strikes the balance of security, performance, and ownership and control.

192
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,800
I love all of that. Plus, I also like taking advantage of the backup options. Before we go

193
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,040
make a big change on a server that's in production, I'll go take a backup on Linode. And I have

194
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,680
automatic backup set too. And the thing that's great about it is you can easily review where

195
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,640
they're at, when the last backup was, and all that kind of stuff. And you can also use that

196
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,800
command line client to initiate a quick backup if you want to go that route as well. And having

197
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,280
those kinds of tools there, plus things like S3 compatible object storage, they've brought a

198
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,600
small businesses game up to like a next level that we couldn't have achieved otherwise. And

199
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,720
the pricing is 30 to 50 percent lower than the big hyperscalers that just want to lock you into

200
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,480
their crazy complex platforms. So go try it out and support the show and see what 19 years of

201
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,480
working on something is built. That's Linode. And you can get it for 60 days and $100 and

202
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,120
support the show. That's like a trifecta of awesome. Linode.com slash SSH.

203
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,640
All right. So our very own, the orange one, is going to be hosting this weekend a matrix

204
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,480
setup party. So for those of you who aren't quite sure what matrix is, we're talking about the

205
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,240
messaging system, not bullet time, bullet dodging, dodgy reboot, matrixes, matrices, matrix I

206
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,440
matrices, matrixes. I like matrices. I think that sounds better. OK, well, if you're not sure what

207
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,520
one of those is in the chat context, come along this Sunday, the 13th of February at 12 p.m.

208
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,760
Eastern, and we will take you through or certainly the orange will take you through

209
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,200
how to set up matrix and elements and all that kind of good stuff and try and figure out exactly

210
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,760
what decentralized chat is all about. I mean, that's pretty exciting. You know,

211
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,400
matrix has so much damn potential, but it needs more users and the chat clients just need more

212
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,840
time. We have a matrix server at Colony.JupiterBroadcasting.com. And one of the things

213
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,760
you can do is you can self host your own matrix server at your own domain, and then you can come

214
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,240
join and hang out our matrix server using the account from your server. You also could just

215
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,480
create an account on our server. We have that open to the public as well. But I kind of love it

216
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,800
because I can go hang out like I'm in a Red Hat matrix room and I'm in there as Chris at

217
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,760
JupiterBroadcasting.com. Right. Everybody knows it's me and it's my domain and it's all I love

218
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:18,320
that aspect about matrix. It's also it's it's a slack killer. It integrates with Jitsi and it'll

219
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,440
do video conferencing and screen sharing and you can have individual channels and you can have

220
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,040
spaces that are groups of rooms and and and individual channels all in different kind of

221
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:35,200
categories. So we have like a self hosted channel. We have a couple of them in our on our matrix

222
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,520
server and we have a channel for each one of the shows. We have even have a channel for

223
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,840
cryptocurrency all on our matrix server. That's sort of like how we do it on Discord as well.

224
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,200
And then the last thing I'll just say about matrix and the orange one could probably tell you way

225
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,040
more. The last thing I'll just say is they offer this technology called bridging and it's hit and

226
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,480
miss. But one platform it's actually pretty good bridging with is Discord. So you can bridge some

227
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,960
of the rooms and this is how theoretically we may want to do it one day. We could bridge the SSH

228
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,520
feedback room on matrix with the SSH feedback room on Discord. Right. You just bridge like

229
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,840
couple of the rooms together, not all of them, but like a couple of them. And that's totally

230
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,360
something we might be able to do one day. And matrix has bridges for lots of other services,

231
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,800
pretty much anything you can think of with various success and hosting a matrix server that has lots

232
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,880
of users is kind of a complicated thing that we're always tweaking with. Even just this week,

233
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,800
Wes and I are troubleshooting a few things on our matrix server, which has always been an

234
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,920
educational process. So I would totally say it's worth checking out because even if you don't do

235
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,960
anything with matrix, it's probably something you should know about. That's just it. So I came into

236
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,920
the chat room a couple of weeks ago and said, Hey, I want to go to the FOSDEM talks because

237
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,800
they were running that through matrix this year. What's an element? What's a matrix? Like, what's

238
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,000
a riot? What's all the, how do all these different things plug it? It's really quite confusing,

239
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,040
to be honest with you. So yeah, this Sunday, 13th of February at 12 PM Eastern, ironically enough,

240
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:17,600
we're going to host this on the self hosted discord server. I thought so. Okay. Hey, you know

241
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,880
what? I totally acknowledge discord is way simpler and has much simpler onboarding too. So it's easier

242
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,320
for the admins and the users. Matrix is just, it's self hosted and it's decentralized. And I find

243
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,920
that extremely appealing. There'll be a link in the show notes. Don't worry too much.

244
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,800
Now, did you see this week that NABU CASA have increased their prices by 30%?

245
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:45,920
Yeah. So, hmm, this, I have mixed reactions because, uh, I have been recently going through

246
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,960
a period of reducing all of my subscriptions and trying to minimize how many subscriptions I have.

247
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,840
And they, they've gone and raised the price right as I'm doing the math on absolutely everything.

248
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,800
Um, I've decided to stick with it because, uh, I think they've already made some of the

249
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,080
infrastructure improvements that they claim the money's going to go to. I think that's already

250
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,880
been done and I've already noticed things are better. And, um, to be honest with you,

251
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,600
I almost feel like I should be giving them more money, you know, because I use the hell out of

252
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,240
home assistant. So what they're doing is they're taking the $5, the optional $5 a month subscription

253
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,320
for home assistant that you can pay to enable some cloud features, remote access, that kind of stuff.

254
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:34,080
They're taking it from five to $6.50 per month. They've also introduced a new annual tier of $65

255
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:41,520
a month, $65 a year. I mean. Right. $65 a year. And these prices all seem really quite fair to me.

256
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,280
And if they had another tier, I may even, or, or if they had some sort of annual donation drive or

257
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,960
something like that, because I get utility out of home assistant in my RV and in my studio, and I,

258
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,880
I use it here in the studio to help control and manage lighting. When I get here and I get to work,

259
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,120
home assistant manages that and home assistant manages the lighting in my office as well.

260
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,200
Like you say, I don't really want to see the price go up, but also now I stop and think about it and

261
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,080
talk through it with you. I sort of think. Yeah, $6.50 for the amount of money that you're going to

262
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,800
I sort of think. Yeah. $6.50 for the amount I use something. I mean, every day, multiple times a day,

263
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,560
I'm opening that app or doing something and it's, it's a huge part of my life. And I think, um,

264
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,960
future houses, like the, the house, my dad's buying, I mentioned on the last episode,

265
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,680
we're talking about temperature sensors and lighting and, you know, it's going to be the

266
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,760
heart of everything, you know, around houses and RVs and yeah, I do for the next 10, 20 years. So

267
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,800
I want to see this project succeed and stick around. And yeah, if $6.50 a month is the price

268
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:54,160
to do that, then make it sustainable, then great. You know what, if they had a plan that was

269
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,440
nine bucks a month, that let me connect to home assistant instances, because that's a problem.

270
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Like, how do I do this when I have two different home assistants in two different locations? And

271
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,200
I'd like them both to be on the cloud, but I don't want on the Nebuchadnezzar cloud,

272
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,320
but I don't want to have two different Nebuchadnezzar accounts. I just don't really

273
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,680
bother with one of them, but yeah, exactly. Exactly. Also noteworthy, they've hired two

274
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,720
more individuals, um, working on different aspects of a home assistant, including ones

275
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,120
are going to be working on more like YouTube channel stuff, uh, and some home assistant front

276
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:37,840
end. Um, I'll be frank with you. It's probably the old man in me. I have been doing internet

277
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,520
content for 15 years and I never like it when projects directly get into content creation.

278
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,040
There is a space for it in terms of how to's and guides, and if they're done correctly,

279
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,520
I think they're useful. But, uh, a lot of times it creates an echo chamber and it's a hard thing

280
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,920
to kind of wrap your head around, but there's a long-term effect when the project sort of becomes

281
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,360
the source of the content creation. It kind of has a knock-on effect, a kind of an ecosystem effect

282
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,600
on the places that cover it, usually for the negative, unless they get it just right. We'll

283
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,720
see. It's a weird use of the funds too, but we'll see. What if rather than directly putting out

284
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,440
content under the home assistant brand, this person almost becomes a consultant for other

285
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,720
YouTubers to reach out to directly. You know, if they want to create a video about a certain topic,

286
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,960
they reach out to this person and say, how do I have all these sensors average and connect to

287
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,080
a thermostat or something like that? I would just adjust that slightly to just say media outreach,

288
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,960
because you've got a lot of people writing about home assistant. You've got a lot of people

289
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,840
podcasting about home assistant. I would, I would open it up beyond, you know, what,

290
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,760
now that you say this and again, we're talking through this, it's, it's the limitation on

291
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,960
YouTube. Like the YouTube community creates a distorted reality of the user base. It does this

292
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,840
to Linux. It does this for any project. The YouTube audience doesn't reflect the entire user base.

293
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,160
And so you want to get out to other media outlets as well. And there's going to be a lot of people

294
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,520
as home assistant grows, they're going to want to learn and start writing about it or start

295
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,080
podcasting about it. And so I think if they had somebody who was there to help those people get

296
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,600
that stuff right, because a lot of times it happens to somebody will come along. They're

297
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,280
going to start covering home assistant for the first time. They'll get something wrong.

298
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,280
They won't understand why, what, what decision, you know, three years was made. And so they'll

299
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,040
interpret something that happens today and they'll get it wrong and they won't have the context.

300
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,760
Because they're still learning. And that's just what happens and doesn't prevent people

301
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,400
from making videos. And so if there was somebody at home assistant that had the time, the bandwidth

302
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,320
and the skillset to interface with those creatives and help guide them in the right direction,

303
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,480
I could see that being useful. That could be a good use of time and money.

304
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,440
Now, the other thing we should mention about the subscription price increase is that those changes

305
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,560
don't come into effect for existing accounts for three months. So you get three months

306
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,760
grandfathered in at the old price before things start to go up.

307
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,080
And just a last couple of notes about this home assistant release that came out along with the

308
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,760
announcement on February 2nd about the price increase. They now show the size of your backups

309
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,840
in the backup view. That's a nice little tweak. Apple TV users, the integration has been updated

310
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,400
to support OS 15 and now can also launch apps from home assistant.

311
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,200
That sounds kind of cool. If you think about like some automations or something like, you know,

312
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,360
set up TV time and have an auto launch plex or infuse. Yeah, because that extra click is real

313
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,480
difficult. Oh, come on. Come on. You would be trying it if you if you hadn't got rid of your

314
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,080
Apple TV. Come on. Oh, maybe, maybe. I mean, I've been able to do it on the shield for years and I

315
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,840
never have. So maybe not. I'm moving in the new house, Chris. You know what I'm saying? That's

316
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,560
true. I do know what you mean. Google Assistant integration can now be set up to use local

317
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:02,240
fulfillment. Hey, oh, I am still waiting, though. I was just telling you before we started the show,

318
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,520
I'm still waiting for updates on the home assistant yellow or amber or whatever they want

319
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,000
to call it. And like when we could kind of expect that for those of us who threw some money in,

320
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,800
because I'm looking at my home assistant setup and I'm thinking that's probably going to be the

321
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:23,520
time I redo it is when I get that home assistant amber and or yellow. And I just love to kind of

322
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,960
know what kind of timeline I should be thinking of the home assistant burnt sienna 2042 edition.

323
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:37,280
That's what it will be. Tailscale dot com slash self hosted. Go there to get a free personal

324
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,280
account for up to 20 devices and it supports the show. Tailscale dot com slash self hosted. I

325
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,240
probably don't have to tell you about tailscale because you guys probably already know and just

326
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,320
have been waiting for an opportunity to try it out. Well, this is it. You can get it set up on

327
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,440
any device in minutes, manage firewall rules, and of course it'll even bust through that dreaded

328
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,000
double net. I can tell you from experience, your devices connect directly to each other,

329
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,280
not through tailscale, but directly to each other in a mesh wire guard network. It's so slick. And

330
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:15,600
Alex and I are both daily users. I often will connect back to lady jupes and manage something

331
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,520
from the studio now, like getting in over a VPN was like the thing that was super hard for me to

332
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,840
solve with my carrier nat. And now it's like I just pop on each one of my boxes, get things started,

333
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,320
get things thinking. It's so awesome, Alex. And that mesh network portion is so cool. So,

334
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,360
you know, picture this, right? I wanted to back up about three terabytes worth of data to England

335
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,720
across the ocean to that Synology box that I took back there to my mom's house a few months ago.

336
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,960
She has a BT home hub, which is a famously crappy router. And you know, I don't want to do port

337
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,520
forwarding in there. I don't want to have to talk her through anything. So what did I use? I've been

338
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,120
using tailscale for this for the last few months and it's just been absolutely perfect. Every time

339
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,200
I fire up restic boom straight through the tunnel, it does the script. I have tailscale up. It connects

340
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,160
through a dedicated IP address on a specific subnet and using the magic DNS feature that's

341
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,560
built right into tailscale. I don't even have to remember any numbers or anything like that. It's

342
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,720
just boom, boom, boom, done, simple. And it's, it's been so reliable. I almost forget that I'm using

343
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,000
it. It's always up. It's always on. And I like the fact that every machine now essentially has a

344
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,480
static IP in my brain. You know, it doesn't matter where I'm at. They all just have a static IP I

345
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,320
connect to. I threw it on my iPad. I connect to LTE. I can get on my system super quick. I'd love

346
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,480
it. You got to check it out. If you've been waiting to try it, this is your opportunity. You're going

347
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,560
to be shocked how fast you're going to get this up and going. I mean, I, I even have it running

348
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:56,720
on my raspberry pies. It's so great tailscale.com slash self-hosted. Mike writes, I've been loving

349
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,920
your show so far. You guys seem to have some pretty elaborate setups, which brings me to a

350
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,280
question as someone just starting out in the self-hosting world. How do you balance progress

351
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,800
and perfection? I frequently find myself at a roadblock in my setup because I feel like I need

352
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,960
to be doing something the optimal way the first time. And as a consequence, I just never do it at

353
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:27,280
all. Hmm. I can feel that for sure, because, uh, when we, when we decided to start the show, I also

354
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,640
had been working on this concept in part from a conversation we had with Wendell about craftsmanship.

355
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,880
And I had decided that I wanted to take real craftsmanship in my self-hosted stuff that I do.

356
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,160
And so I, I really got in my head with that forbidden also sort of struggled with perfection.

357
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,720
And that saying is so true that perfection is the enemy of the good enough really. Uh,

358
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,400
and here's what I came to. And I wonder if what you do, Alex, in this case, but what I realized

359
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:01,280
about myself is that I'll get into something deep. I will become I I I'm so smart, Alex,

360
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:08,400
I a galaxy size brain here. I will become so informed on a topic. It's unbelievable. And then

361
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:15,040
I know all of it now. And I, I arrogantly assume that I will remember all of it. And then six

362
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,640
months later, I have forgotten 98% of everything I learned. And I am a total smooth brain idiot.

363
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,880
And that, and I realized that about myself and now have decided that I must document while I'm at

364
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,040
peak knowledge. So I must document. And then I have also, if I hit a roadblock and I don't

365
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,080
implement the perfect solution, I document what I thought I wanted to do and why I couldn't do it

366
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,200
and what I did instead. So I can always work back if I, if I ever want to revisit the project and

367
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,640
get it right. Yeah. That was why I started linux server.io was it was actually just my personal

368
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,160
blog writing down how I compiled that kernel where I think I was doing unraid on top of, uh,

369
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:01,680
arch or something back in the day. And documentation is just so important, but, uh, I was

370
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,800
laughing so hard whilst you were saying that, like I'm the world expert on this topic. And then six

371
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:14,480
months later, I can't remember any of it. It's so true. Yeah. And you just gotta like, you gotta

372
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,320
like learn that about yourself if that's how you operate. And like the guys that are probably, you

373
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,200
know, like really a level above us are the ones that retain it all right. Those people, I don't

374
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,120
know how people like Wendell do it. And you mentioned him in your, in your little bit and

375
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,360
like he can just rattle off model numbers and cereal and, and, you know, specific kernels and

376
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,320
builds. And I'm like, how do you remember all that stuff? I can't even remember, you know,

377
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,000
I bought a bag of pumpkin seeds to put in my banana bread this morning. I can't even remember

378
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,480
where that is. It's been half an hour. How do you remember anything? Um, it's really impressive.

379
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,400
So I think if you document where the shortcomings were in your setup and then you just, it kind of

380
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,920
gives you permission to proceed because like, it's like, okay, I've written it down. I've

381
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,600
captured my thoughts. And you'll also find that you think through things a little more clearly,

382
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,640
at least in my case, and then you move forward. There is a phrase, isn't there? And this doesn't

383
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:13,680
just pertain to it, but it's analysis paralysis. And you know, you can go down this rabbit hole

384
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:19,680
with anything, you know, buying a car, buying a house, building some infrastructure for your home,

385
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:25,520
self-hosted needs, whatever it might be. And at some point you've just got to stick a pin in it

386
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,840
and say, right, this is the way I'm going to do it. It might not be the best, most optimalist way

387
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,920
to do something, but at the end of it, you will have built something and you'll have gained some

388
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:43,920
experience along the way of doing it. And, you know, in six months time, you may well decide,

389
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,280
well, actually I shouldn't have exposed that particular service over the internet without

390
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,600
a password. For example, maybe I should put it behind a VPN or put it at least like a rough

391
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,800
lesson. Right. Exactly. But I mean, you know, I've admitted on this show before I ran remote desktop

392
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,760
open to the internet and the password was two, two, that was it. The numbers, two, two.

393
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,360
What could go wrong? What could go wrong? Bizarrely nothing. But I mean, a lot could have,

394
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:17,360
you know, and nowadays it makes me rather scared. I did that for as long as I did that. But anyway,

395
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,400
oh man, so many things, so many things back in the day, Alex, so many things, you know,

396
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,480
the internet was a different place back then. It truly was. Now, Mike, you've got to think about,

397
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,920
is there any value in just sitting there, twiddling your thumbs, thinking about stuff?

398
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,600
Yeah, some, but there's going to be a lot more value in making mistakes. You'll learn to fail

399
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,960
faster. You'll learn that, you know, this particular building block doesn't fit with that one. And

400
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,280
actually I need to do it this completely different way. And you'll just learn so much more by doing

401
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,600
it. So my advice, such as it is, would be start small, solve a real problem that you have, and

402
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,800
then just start building on top of it. Maybe write a little bit of automation to do it as well,

403
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,720
if you want to, once you've done it a few times manually and kind of got the hang of it. And

404
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,000
after then you'll be surprised within, you know, a few weeks just how quickly these things start

405
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,320
to snowball and start to build on top of each other. You know, to tie it all together,

406
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,680
if you wanted a project, if you've been wanting to get into something like this or take your skill

407
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,800
set up to the next levels, you mentioned automation there. And the orange one is doing that get to

408
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:32,480
no matrix session. There is a super popular deploy matrix on a system using Ansible going around

409
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,040
right now that does a pretty good job. Wes and I were taking a look at it and we think we may

410
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,600
actually use it in the future. And so that could be a great opportunity to combine your peanut

411
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,040
butter and your chocolate and, you know, learn a little something about Ansible, learn a little

412
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:56,320
something about matrix. I ate my first PB&J this week. Your first? First one. I'm not even shitting

413
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,000
you. Like I've never had one before. All right. Okay. Okay. Tell me. Okay. Hold on now. Hold on.

414
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,400
Tell me about the bread. I got it. We got to start at the beginning. What kind of bread was it?

415
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,560
Where was it? Was it at home? Homemade bread. You know, after the pandemic, I'm a bread bro now.

416
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm a world expert on bread, you see. What kind of peanut butter? Jif. Okay. Crunchy or smooth?

417
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,440
Crunchy. Yeah. All right. Now, did you have any problems tearing the bread?

418
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,360
Tearing? Why do I need to tear it? Well, sometimes when you apply the peanut butter,

419
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,080
the bread can tear if you're new. It's proper bread with a good gluten structure, dude.

420
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:38,960
Tell me about the jelly. It was grape jelly. It was very nice. Although the English people

421
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,120
are probably sat here going, jelly. It's actually jam. You know, it's what we would call jam.

422
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,320
I mean, grapes are right. Grapes are right. It's okay. So how thick is the bread?

423
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,120
About the thickness of a finger. Okay. All right. So not too thick. Chunky. Not too thick. Nice crust.

424
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:02,960
Now, what's your ratio of peanut butter to jelly? I just did one slice covered in a reasonable

425
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:10,400
thickness of PB and then the other slice covered in a reasonable thickness of J. Slam those bad

426
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,560
boys together. Now, I need to know what a reasonable thickness is because I actually

427
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:21,040
go a little heavy on the jam. Oh, about 37 microns. I don't know. How do we measure this?

428
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,520
Were they equally proportioned? It's important because you need slightly more jam to get the

429
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,560
moisture ratio right. Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. We don't have a standardized jam measurement

430
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,240
system in this country though. I mean, you like to measure things in feet and inches.

431
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:41,200
Maybe we should say I scraped my jam in eight elbows thickness. You measure an American. What

432
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,320
you do is just put some on there and then put a little bit to where it seems like too much.

433
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,920
And then that's just right. Okay. That's how you do it. Okay. So what'd you think of it though?

434
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,440
Consider it a beta, but don't consider it the final word on peanut butter and jelly because

435
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,080
let me tell you, you can really take those things up to 11. Like there's some toasting

436
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,560
techniques you can do and stuff that'll really take it up a notch. But what'd you think?

437
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:14,480
It's a delicious, delicious sandwich. It is a beautiful mix of sweetness and gooeyness. And

438
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:21,520
oh, where has it been all my life? Budget-friendly, quick to make. You could take the loaf

439
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,720
and the peanut butter and the jam and you can just bring it to work or bring it with you. I mean,

440
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,320
just the port, it's just, it's great. Kids love it too. So anyways, moving on. I just,

441
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,720
that's amazing. Thank you for sharing that. That was great.

442
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,760
I'm still trying to assimilate into your culture.

443
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,800
Yeah. I mean, I don't know what you haven't done yet. That's a big one. I wish I could have been

444
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,120
there for that. I didn't know. Had I known, I would have been there, but I'm sure we'll find

445
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,240
some others. Well, I've never bought any tactical pants. I've still got to do that. Okay. All right.

446
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,920
That is something. You're going to love tactical pants. It's all about the phone storage capacity.

447
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,880
Okay. You ever wanted to have your wallet in your pocket and not even feel it? Tactical pants.

448
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,120
Well, my wallet is about the thickness of three credit cards as it is. So.

449
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:14,240
Oh yeah. Yeah. You've worked on it. Good. Good. All right. Well, Luke liked it last week when

450
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,040
we talked about self-hosted music options, but he says, I just wanted to add one thing.

451
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,520
The subsonic compatible clients are a lot more polished than the jellyfin ones. So he says,

452
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,040
check those out. There's some shims that let you use the clients with jellyfin on iOS or Android,

453
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,640
and gives us a couple of links that we'll toss in the show notes. You know what? I have good memories

454
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,400
of subsonic and I know that that's gone a couple of different directions over the years, but for

455
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,680
just a brief period of time, I had subsonic downloading all of my podcasts and then I was

456
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,720
streaming them using apps from the subsonic server. And so I could kind of keep my play

457
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,640
position sync across, synced across all my devices using that. It was so great.

458
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,760
Now, Sam writes in, and I think this is a question for you, Chris. My partner and I are about to

459
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,560
embark on our first ever week-long road trip around the North coast of Scotland, the Scottish 500.

460
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,080
We've rented a van conversion for it and we'll be out of reliable cell service for much of it.

461
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,360
I've got about three weeks of time and a drawer full of raspberry pies and USB hard drives.

462
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,760
Do you have any recommendations for a quick and dirty mobile media server

463
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,360
to keep us entertained in the evenings after a long day's drive?

464
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,080
Hmm. So you're going to need a mobile power. So you're probably going to want to look at like one

465
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,920
of those Yetis or not Yetis. What do they call it? The blue Yeti.

466
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,480
Jackery.

467
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,960
Jackery is another one. Yep. There's several of those portable power units. You're going to want

468
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,760
something that is easy for you to charge while you're driving. Like you could plug it into the

469
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,960
cigarette lighter while you're driving. And then I assume they have them over there and then you

470
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:01,760
just run it over, you know, you have full charge and you just run it while you're parked. And then

471
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:10,000
I think you're also going to want a LTE router like the, I can't remember what we recommended

472
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,280
before. You probably do Alex, that little slate router that we've recommended before that you

473
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,480
can actually use to do Wi-Fi and also manage the LTE connection.

474
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,520
The GIO Inet.

475
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,880
Inet. Yes. Thank you. Cause you're going to need networking. And then you could connect

476
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,640
the Raspberry Pi directly to the TV using HDMI out if you're adventurous like that.

477
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,640
Or you could get something like the fire stick or some of the other, or maybe if you already have

478
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,520
a set top box at home, you just bring it with you. And cause you'll need something to get the

479
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,480
picture onto the TV. And that's it. So you'd need power, networking, and a way to get it on the TV.

480
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,920
And then for the Raspberry Pi, what I would recommend, since you're only going to use it

481
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,520
for a road trip, right? It's not like it's going to be like your setup for five years,

482
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,520
load the thing up with some USB storage on a hub. It works. I know it's crazy, but you can,

483
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,520
you can take a USB hub, you can plug a couple of like one terabyte disc or two terabyte discs in

484
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,720
there. And then like a maniac, what you do is you just use butter FS on those because it's

485
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,600
Raspberry Pi. You're not going to want to use CFS, trust me. And you can just join those two

486
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:26,560
discs together as one volume. So if you got to say, for example, two, one terabyte external disc,

487
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,800
I recommend SSDs. If you're in a van, it'll show up as a two terabyte volume and you could get those

488
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,800
off Amazon or if you maybe already have them, something like that. And that'll work great.

489
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,000
What about even more simple than that? Just a laptop.

490
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,600
Yeah. And especially if you don't have a TV in the van, right? Or a tablet.

491
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:49,600
It's got speakers. It's got a battery in it already. You won't need any networking.

492
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,320
If you got an iPad too, you could do like the Plex sync thing.

493
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,680
Yes. Plex sync. Does the iPad support playing videos back from USB storage?

494
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,880
But imagine it will, right?

495
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,000
You could use Infuse on the iPad to do that.

496
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,760
Yeah. Lots of options.

497
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:04,960
Yeah.

498
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,160
And the speakers on the iPad pro are particularly good, I must say.

499
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,480
Yeah. Really depends on what you already have.

500
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,760
Depending on what you have, if you've got the Pi's, I mean, really, if you've got two Pi's,

501
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,160
you could have one be the NAS and you could have one set up as, you know,

502
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,720
connected to a television playing the videos.

503
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,840
Not everybody's a double Pi wielding maniac like you, Chris.

504
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:34,480
Some of us are. Yeah. Well, he says he's got a drawer full, actually, right? So are she?

505
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,680
Say they've got a drawer full.

506
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,040
He does, in fairness, say that in the question.

507
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,720
In the question.

508
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,240
So I actually kind of feel like I might consider then

509
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,840
setting up like a Kodi or something like that on a Raspberry Pi.

510
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,680
I mean, unless you already have a set top box, then I'd probably go that route.

511
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,800
Thanks for the question though, Sam.

512
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,720
Lots of feedback this week. So thank you all very much for writing in.

513
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,080
Several more of you wrote in about the East Coast spring meetup that I kind of floated

514
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,000
as a vague idea in the last episode.

515
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,320
So enough of you wrote in. I think we're actually going to do this provisionally.

516
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,920
I'm thinking somewhere around the start of April in Raleigh.

517
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,480
I'm not entirely sure when what type of food we'd have, probably like a brewery where we can

518
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,080
always go and get snacks and beers and that kind of thing and be outside.

519
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,200
So it's all safe right in these times.

520
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,480
And yeah, so just keep an eye out on the meetup page for that.

521
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,240
I'll obviously announce it in the show as well and see if I can't convince a certain

522
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,080
Mr Fisher to fly out as well, maybe.

523
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,200
I imagine it's pretty, pretty nice there in April, right?

524
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,160
Apart from the pollen, the pollen can be pretty bad, but it's...

525
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,440
I don't know if that gets me too bad.

526
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,400
It's beautiful weather.

527
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,360
Yeah, like a self-hosted fest kind of thing, which normally in April, like I'm gearing

528
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,080
up for Linux Fest, but there's no Linux Fest this year.

529
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,680
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. We need our Linux meetup in April.

530
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,160
Yeah. Well, thank you to our members, our SREs who keep the show going.

531
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,720
You help keep it independent. We get to be choosy about the show.

532
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,840
We get to be independent. We get to be choosy about our sponsors.

533
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,520
We truly like and use Linode and Tailscale.

534
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,640
So we can wait until the right sponsor comes along and pick to work with the sponsor we

535
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,200
think is a good fit for us and our audience.

536
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,840
Our members give us the leverage to do that.

537
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:25,280
And when you sign up at selfhosted.show.com you get an ad-free version of the show and

538
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,720
an extended version of the show with a post-show at the very end.

539
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,640
You can also support the entire network and get access to all of the network shows,

540
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,400
at jupyter.party.

541
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,760
And as you well know by now, selfhosted.show.com is the place to go to get in touch with us.

542
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,920
You can find me on Twitter at ironicbadger.

543
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,960
You can find me on Matrix at ChrisLAS.

544
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,720
Boom! Oh! I think.

545
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,200
I don't really know how you find me on there, but join me on there and say hi.

546
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,680
And as always, thanks for listening, everybody.

547
00:46:51,680 --> 00:47:06,400
That was selfhosted.show slash 64.
