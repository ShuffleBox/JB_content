00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
I knew what happened, Alex, I rolled the Starlink dice and I came up snake eyes.

00:04.800 --> 00:10.240
I came back to a location after being on the road for about three weeks, set up the

00:10.240 --> 00:16.880
Starlink and went to update my service address and I got the dreaded no more capacity at your area.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.200
And this is an area I frequent a lot.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.560
It's like home base territory and Starlink says, sorry, no room for you.

00:24.560 --> 00:25.600
So what happens now?

00:25.600 --> 00:28.160
Are you out of luck until further notice?

00:28.160 --> 00:28.960
It's weird.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.240
I'm only like 15 miles from the other location I was at.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.800
It's kind of working and not well.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.880
It's like losing and dropping packets from time to time and connection.

00:40.880 --> 00:44.560
But when it works, I'm getting like 30 megabits, which is pretty slow for Starlink.

00:45.040 --> 00:50.640
But I did see some YouTubers reporting that Starlink seems to be testing a roaming mode

00:50.640 --> 00:56.320
that lets you move around and maybe use it outside your service address.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.520
So I'm hoping that happens to me soon.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.880
And I'm just going to keep checking the website every few days.

01:03.440 --> 01:08.800
There is a website I just found as you were talking here, satellite map dot space, and

01:08.800 --> 01:12.400
it seems to like divide the entire country up into hexagons.

01:12.400 --> 01:16.320
And then they've got the actual Starlink satellites flying in real time over the top of it.

01:16.320 --> 01:22.000
And it looks like the entirety of the Pacific Northwest Redmond's right at the middle of a cell.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.920
So I don't understand, you were on the coast and then you came back to the studio.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.560
That's not far enough to cross a boundary even.

01:28.560 --> 01:29.360
What's going on?

01:29.360 --> 01:32.160
I think it's more nuanced than that website makes it look.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.400
I think the cells are actually more divided.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.120
I've seen another website that gives you a different view.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.880
It's not as fancy as that one.

01:38.880 --> 01:45.200
It shows hexagons that are basically 20, 30 mile in sizes that overlay over the Google map.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.480
Either way, I knew I was rolling the dice because you're not supposed to move the Starlink.

01:50.480 --> 01:55.280
When you're in a service area, they provision for capacity because these require downlink stations too.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.240
Come on, they know exactly who's going to use this thing.

01:58.240 --> 02:08.080
People in rural places that have no other option, or people, you know, not connected to the real world like you that lives in a bus.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.680
Out there in the virtual world.

02:09.680 --> 02:19.280
When I reviewed Starlink on Linux Unplugged, I didn't really mention the fact that the Ethernet cable doesn't disconnect from the dish.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.880
It's built in.

02:20.880 --> 02:35.120
So every single time I tear it down in the snow, in the rain, in the mud, I have to like spool this big cable that I can't detach from the dish and I have to like carry them both around soaking wet and dry them off together and load them up.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.560
It is the worst.

02:36.560 --> 02:39.200
At least you got a router with an Ethernet port.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.400
You can stop complaining.

02:40.400 --> 02:40.880
That's true.

02:40.880 --> 02:41.680
They're taking that away.

02:41.680 --> 02:49.360
But when SpaceX does come out with the Starlink designed for mobile use, which they have patents for, I'm all over it.

02:49.360 --> 02:56.480
I mean, I was even tempted by the $500 a month Starlink Pro, but I'm glad I didn't pull the trigger on that.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.480
It would be really SOL.

02:58.480 --> 03:04.480
Yeah, it's interesting, you know, like obviously it has the power to completely change the game, but so does 5G.

03:04.480 --> 03:16.480
Like you look at what bandwidth that's capable of and you know, the number of subscribers that a single tower can support on 5G versus LTE significantly different proposition.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.680
It's going to be really interesting to see which technology wins out.

03:19.680 --> 03:29.680
Obviously, you know, in rural America where, you know, it's a pretty different use case to what I'm used to in England, right, where everything's really dense and connected with cables pretty well.

03:29.680 --> 03:34.880
But like rural America, you're in the middle of the wilderness pretty quickly in America if you're not careful.

03:34.880 --> 03:41.680
And those places, those are the ones where Starlink will change the game for people like me that work fully remotely.

03:41.680 --> 03:50.880
I think, well, I live near Raleigh right now because, you know, I have access to good schools, one thing for my daughter, but I also have access to a good job market.

03:50.880 --> 03:58.080
Well, that kind of thing has gone away because I could move anywhere and get a remote job I wanted in my industry.

03:58.080 --> 04:10.480
I'm very lucky. And then you think, well, Internet's another one because you start trying to look at buying 20, 30 acres worth of land in the middle of West Virginia and good luck getting anything above one meg DSL.

04:10.480 --> 04:22.080
Yeah, I think it's a mix of all of them at once, at least for the nomadic use case, because you can't, I would imagine, ever really use Starlink mobilely because I don't think the way it works.

04:22.080 --> 04:26.080
I don't think you can be, say, going down the road at 60 miles per hour.

04:26.080 --> 04:31.280
I've seen Dwayne the Rock Johnson on a sat phone, you know, they could do they could do these things in the movies.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.280
Maybe it could. Maybe that'd be awesome.

04:33.280 --> 04:44.280
But I imagine for quite a while it's going to be a mix of different wireless tech, LTE, 5G, and then you park when you're stationary.

04:44.280 --> 04:49.580
You go Starlink or if you're out like at a piece of property, you know, a farm, it's all kind of hit and miss.

04:49.580 --> 05:00.680
There's a guy I work with who is working for a government contract and he lives on a boat off the East Coast and he just sails up and down the East Coast, depending on where the weather's nice all year.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.780
And he's on a 4G, works great.

05:02.780 --> 05:08.080
I had a buddy that did that, but he gave it up, I think, when the boat just started falling apart.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.480
Well, they do do that. They're a boat.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.380
You know, there are two good days when you own a boat.

05:12.380 --> 05:15.080
You know that, Chris? The day you buy it and the day you sell it.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.080
And the day you sell it. Yep.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.680
I think that might be true for an RV too, Alex.

05:19.680 --> 05:29.480
And I'm looking at what's coming down the road for Home Assistant, which I have deeply integrated into my RV and I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

05:29.480 --> 05:37.580
So I had some time away from Lady Joob's. Not recently, but this is about a month and a half ago. Strictly platonic time away, I hope.

05:37.580 --> 05:46.380
Yeah, when our buddy Brent was in town, we were staying at the studio to let Lady Joob's defrost from a stay we had in the winter wilderness.

05:46.380 --> 05:51.880
I spent some time here at the studio and I just realized how little I've integrated Home Assistant.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.280
It's just so much the basics.

05:53.280 --> 05:59.280
It's like motion sensor stuff, a couple of NFC automation tag stuff, and you know, smart lights.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.780
It's really fine. It's fine.

06:01.780 --> 06:10.280
I'm not trying to denigrate that setup, but compared to what I've done in my primary home in Lady Joob's, it's just really night and day.

06:10.280 --> 06:18.680
And I came to realize just how much we rely on Home Assistant. It is an integral part of operating our home now.

06:18.680 --> 06:25.380
And I don't know how to describe that. I describe it as important as some of the machinery in the engine.

06:25.380 --> 06:30.480
You know, it is an absolute critical part of the operation of the vehicle now.

06:30.480 --> 06:37.780
So when I see things that are coming down the pipe that are going to break Z-Wave, man, I just don't know what I'm going to do.

06:37.780 --> 06:45.180
So this is really for any of us out there who are on the OG Z-Wave support, like I'm talking the old Z-Wave stuff.

06:45.180 --> 06:50.280
It seems going by the beta release notes than in a couple of releases in the 22.4.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.380
So not the next one, but the one after.

06:53.380 --> 07:03.180
They are going to deprecate the old Z-Wave support simply because they have to move on in Python versions and no one supports that old Z-Wave stuff.

07:03.180 --> 07:07.980
And the dev team is recommending instead that you migrate to Z-Wave JS.

07:07.980 --> 07:12.080
And you know, Alex, we've talked about this. I tried it and it went badly.

07:12.080 --> 07:22.280
It's one of the few times I had to hit the escape hatch and do a full restore from backup and bail out of what I had done because my migration went so poorly.

07:22.280 --> 07:28.380
That just about everything from automations to timers and buttons all broke. Everything broke.

07:28.380 --> 07:31.680
How many sensors do you have? How many devices on that network?

07:31.680 --> 07:33.680
I think it's somewhere like a hundred devices.

07:33.680 --> 07:40.180
I don't remember how many of them are sensors because it's tricky because each sensor actually shows up as an individual device.

07:40.180 --> 07:44.280
And there are like seven in each one of those little Z-Wave sensors.

07:44.280 --> 07:49.480
And when you migrate, do you have to repair each device one by one?

07:49.480 --> 07:52.480
Because I had to do that with my Zigbee thing when I changed my channel.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.480
I think it's actually stored in my Z-Wave controller.

07:55.480 --> 08:04.480
However, it seems like the new versions of Z-Wave JS, and I haven't done this for about six months, but it's like a bunch of missing devices show up.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.980
Like the names don't line up.

08:05.980 --> 08:12.280
And so I don't know exactly what went wrong when I looked at it, but it was, yes, it stored the pairings.

08:12.280 --> 08:18.080
But it was almost irrelevant because I'd have to wipe the slate and repair it anyways to fix everything.

08:18.080 --> 08:24.080
I'm not ready to go there when matter is probably about a year away.

08:24.080 --> 08:27.880
And I'm going to then just start replacing all of this with matter devices.

08:27.880 --> 08:34.480
And I was really hoping to hold out, just kind of hold out until matter arrived and then just switch over.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.980
And it seems like I'm not going to get that opportunity because they want to move on.

08:37.980 --> 08:40.980
They got to get a newer version of Python in their stack.

08:40.980 --> 08:47.180
I'm playing devil's advocate a little bit here, but I mean, how do you propose that Home Assistant solve this problem?

08:47.180 --> 08:49.080
I mean, time moves on.

08:49.080 --> 08:53.580
Python 2 has been on the ropes for a long time now.

08:53.580 --> 08:55.580
I mean, it's not like this is a new problem.

08:55.580 --> 08:57.080
What's the alternative there?

08:57.080 --> 09:00.080
I'm not really sure there is one looking at it objectively.

09:00.080 --> 09:07.280
I think to myself, isn't there some way they could supply this as a container so it is unaffected by the base system.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.580
But these integrations are just that they are integrated.

09:10.580 --> 09:17.080
They don't run as separately isolated containers, but it's a shame because right now I really wish they could.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.280
This is really going to screw me.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.180
And there is people already online, of course.

09:20.180 --> 09:24.680
And of course, the Internet doesn't recommend you do what the developers suggest you do.

09:24.680 --> 09:33.680
The Internet wants everyone to go install Z-Wave JS to MQTT and go set up an MQTT broker and go learn all of that.

09:33.680 --> 09:38.280
Which perhaps is a great idea, but it's like not what the developers are recommending.

09:38.280 --> 09:42.780
And when something like a breaking change like this comes along and the community needs to know what to do,

09:42.780 --> 09:45.180
having all this mixed messaging just makes things worse.

09:45.180 --> 09:47.080
So I just that stuff drives me crazy.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.480
And what you start seeing people say they're going to do is just not upgrade.

09:50.480 --> 09:57.580
They're basically going to upgrade to 22.3 and then they're going to hold until something else comes along,

09:57.580 --> 10:01.480
which, you know, it sucks because that's probably what I'm going to have to do.

10:01.480 --> 10:07.180
I'm grateful that I have a separate Home Assistant instance here in the studio that I'll be able to keep up to date so I can follow along on development.

10:07.180 --> 10:15.180
But in my RV where I consider it mission critical, I and I think a lot of people are just going to stop upgrading now.

10:15.180 --> 10:16.780
Yeah, I think a lot of people get burnt out.

10:16.780 --> 10:17.780
There was a thread on Reddit.

10:17.780 --> 10:24.580
I think it was about a week ago complaining about the state of the Home Assistant documentation.

10:24.580 --> 10:29.780
The complaint itself is neither here nor there for purposes of this discussion.

10:29.780 --> 10:34.180
What I wanted to talk about was the general consensus in the comments of that thread.

10:34.180 --> 10:41.680
The Home Assistant, despite its best efforts for now, at least, is geekware.

10:41.680 --> 10:50.780
You know, my dad's a smart guy, but I can't imagine giving him a vanilla Raspberry Pi with nothing except Home Assistant even flashed onto it and say,

10:50.780 --> 10:52.880
here, go automate your house.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.980
I can't imagine that going very well.

10:55.980 --> 11:01.080
And I look at things like the HomeKit integration that Apple are doing.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.980
I look at the Alexa stuff.

11:02.980 --> 11:04.980
I look at the Google Home app.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.180
That's what you need to do.

11:06.180 --> 11:12.680
That's the level of integration that you need to get to in order to make it more approachable and more accessible for people.

11:12.680 --> 11:21.380
Home Assistant's biggest strength is how modular it is and how customizable it is and how geeky it is.

11:21.380 --> 11:28.380
That's the thing I love about it the most is the fact if I want to go and tweak a specific knob three degrees to the left,

11:28.380 --> 11:31.480
I can go and do that one specific change.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.380
Probably similar to the reasons why I like Linux as well, you know?

11:34.380 --> 11:34.880
Yeah, I do.

11:34.880 --> 11:35.880
I do know what you mean.

11:35.880 --> 11:44.180
And, you know, we're trying to compare, I think, Apple's, you know, kind of, you will like this approach that they do on Mac OS to Linux.

11:44.180 --> 11:46.680
You know, I'm comparing Alexa to Home Assistant here.

11:46.680 --> 11:55.080
And I don't know, like, I just think about where does the Home Assistant project go to address complaints like yours,

11:55.080 --> 12:00.980
like the ones in this Reddit thread and complaints of my own as well, where, you know, I get fatigue.

12:00.980 --> 12:05.280
I get fatigue maintaining my own Home Assistant instance.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.980
Stuff just breaks for no apparent reason.

12:08.980 --> 12:13.780
And, you know, I stay on top of updates and I do try and figure stuff out.

12:13.780 --> 12:17.880
And I don't know, like, it's just difficult.

12:17.880 --> 12:24.280
I don't know that Home Assistant is quite grasping the problem that faces them quite yet.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.680
They're solving the technical problems really, really well.

12:27.680 --> 12:34.180
But I do think on the whole, there's still a lot of work to be done on the kind of people side of the problem that they're solving,

12:34.180 --> 12:40.880
like the education, the documentation, making things more bite-sized and more accessible to folks.

12:40.880 --> 12:47.680
I feel like there is a period of time where it's reasonable for Home Assistant to introduce breaking changes,

12:47.680 --> 12:50.480
to get things built right for the long term.

12:50.480 --> 12:54.480
And when a project's new, you decide to do a few things and you got to make a few changes.

12:54.480 --> 12:59.680
I think to their credit, it's not like Z-Wave JS came out yesterday, right?

12:59.680 --> 13:01.580
And part of the reason is because I saw where this was going.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.380
There was multiple options and I just wanted to hold off.

13:03.380 --> 13:10.880
But anybody who's adopted Home Assistant in the last year just started off with Z-Wave JS, right?

13:10.880 --> 13:12.880
They don't have to deal with this.

13:12.880 --> 13:19.680
And so I think something we have to keep in mind is even though you and I have been using it for a few years,

13:19.680 --> 13:25.780
I think the vast, vast, vast majority of users that Home Assistant will ever have are still yet to come, right?

13:25.780 --> 13:28.280
They start arriving when there's hardware devices.

13:28.280 --> 13:33.780
So we're still the early adopters that are actually helping kind of bang out some of the rough edges on this thing.

13:33.780 --> 13:41.280
And so we are more likely to get exposed to those issues that cause fatigue that both you and I are feeling right now.

13:41.280 --> 13:50.280
But what gives me hope is if you zoom out a couple of years and look at the Home Assistant project's trends,

13:50.280 --> 13:52.480
the break-in changes are slowing down.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.080
I think you'd agree there's less.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.380
Absolutely are, yeah.

13:55.380 --> 14:01.780
Also, they're making things more and more automatic as time goes on.

14:01.780 --> 14:08.980
Like when you throw Home Assistant on a network for the first time, you know, just like say you're a new user and you take a look at it.

14:08.980 --> 14:15.480
It'll often suggest four or five or six integrations automatically just by noticing what's on your network.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.080
They've gotten really good at like saying, hey, you got an Apple TV.

14:18.080 --> 14:22.180
Hey, you got an HP printer, you know, like, would you like to set that up?

14:22.180 --> 14:33.280
The fundamental appeal that Home Assistant has that will always be a unique value proposition for at least these open source type systems is that it's multi-vendor.

14:33.280 --> 14:40.180
It works with all the different third party products and cloud devices that you got on a whim and to your thing.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.580
Somebody bought you for Christmas and it works with all of it, right?

14:43.580 --> 14:45.680
Whereas Apple stuff, it only works with the HomeKit stuff.

14:45.680 --> 14:51.480
The Echo stuff only works with the devices that, you know, work with the Echo and same with the Googs and all of that.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.180
It's different in that way.

14:53.180 --> 14:56.180
It's a finally a way to just bring it all home, bring it all on the land.

14:56.180 --> 15:03.380
And once that starts connecting with people and there's a piece of hardware and some of these transitional things are worked out, I think it's going to be fine.

15:03.380 --> 15:09.680
But the reality is when you're living in the in the now and this stuff still getting hashed out, it kind of sucks.

15:09.680 --> 15:14.180
And I'm not a big fan of doing the I'm not updating thing.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.980
That's sort of my last worst case scenario.

15:16.980 --> 15:19.180
I'm much more of a keep my systems up to date.

15:19.180 --> 15:24.280
Like if I'm going to run a box when I decide to deploy something, I'm committing to keep it maintained.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.980
I don't just deploy something and not maintain it.

15:25.980 --> 15:27.780
So that bothers me a lot.

15:27.780 --> 15:35.280
Additionally, this is why I'm really glad I'm not running their OS because I will keep the Ubuntu base up to date, right?

15:35.280 --> 15:42.380
Where I don't know if that's safe when I'm running their OS if I kept the OS upgrading all the time, but didn't upgrade Home Assistant Core.

15:42.380 --> 15:43.880
I don't know if something breaks.

15:43.880 --> 15:51.380
Possibly I could see that being an issue, especially if it's like a year before any matter devices ship or maybe even longer.

15:51.380 --> 15:57.880
But because I've installed it myself on an Ubuntu system, I know I can keep that 2004 system up to date.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.980
So at least that'll be secure.

15:59.980 --> 16:02.380
Can you believe I got an opportunity to work the OS rant in there?

16:02.380 --> 16:03.580
It's been a few episodes.

16:03.580 --> 16:06.680
And I was almost worried that you weren't going to come up for air then.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.680
And then I realized you were going on an OS rant.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.580
Somehow you managed to work that angle.

16:10.580 --> 16:11.880
Good job.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.580
It's been a while.

16:14.580 --> 16:16.880
Linode.com slash SSH.

16:16.880 --> 16:22.180
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the show.

16:22.180 --> 16:23.280
Yeah, I mean $100.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.780
You can really go kick the tires at Linode.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.280
It's the Geeks Cloud.

16:27.280 --> 16:35.280
They're not going to try to lock you into some crazy esoteric hyperscaler proprietary platform where your skill set only applies to that.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.380
Oh, I don't like that business model at all.

16:37.380 --> 16:38.280
No, that's not Linode.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.380
They got 11 data centers worldwide.

16:40.380 --> 16:44.780
They've been working at this for 19 years to create a great experience to run applications on the cloud.

16:44.780 --> 16:46.780
You can build it from the ground up yourself.

16:46.780 --> 16:48.780
I mean really all the way down to the image.

16:48.780 --> 16:54.280
Or you can pick one of their ready to go application stacks and get it deployed in just one or two clicks.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.080
And the performance is great.

16:57.080 --> 17:02.880
Anything that faces the JB audience that we've built in the last, I don't know, two and a half years.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.380
We've built it on Linode.

17:04.380 --> 17:10.880
And I would imagine now as being a part of Akamai, they're going to get access to Akamai's CDN.

17:10.880 --> 17:16.180
I was quite surprised when I heard the news, but I contacted a couple of our friends that we know that work there at Linode.

17:16.180 --> 17:17.480
And they seem pretty excited.

17:17.480 --> 17:23.880
In fact, they're working on a new secret product, a new Linode product offering that'll be coming out soon.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.380
That's still all in the works.

17:25.380 --> 17:32.680
And you know another thing that's really cool is the day that announcement dropped, we actually have Linode employees on the self-hosted Discord.

17:32.680 --> 17:37.480
And they were there answering our audience's questions about what does this mean for the future of the company?

17:37.480 --> 17:40.080
And I think a lot of fears were kind of put to rest that day.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.980
Yeah, they really have been part of the community for a while.

17:42.980 --> 17:48.180
I met them the same time I met you at Texas Linux Fest, you know, years ago now.

17:48.180 --> 17:49.880
Feels like a hundred years ago.

17:49.880 --> 17:53.680
That was when I really realized they're actually in it because they wanted to be.

17:53.680 --> 17:58.280
Like they were passionate about being at Texas Linux Fest and made a good impression on me.

17:58.280 --> 18:03.180
So if you're ready to go spin something up, you want to go experiment or do a little R&D, go try it out on Linode.

18:03.180 --> 18:07.780
Go to linode.com slash SSH.

18:07.780 --> 18:12.880
So in the news this week, TrueNAS Scale is finally at release.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.780
Can you believe it, Alex?

18:14.780 --> 18:16.880
This was like announced in the summer of 2020.

18:16.880 --> 18:22.980
It has been a very methodical development process to get us here.

18:22.980 --> 18:27.880
And the big news with Scale is it's based on Debian 11, not FreeBSD.

18:27.880 --> 18:28.380
Right. Yeah.

18:28.380 --> 18:35.180
I mean, back in the old days, TrueNAS is the product formerly known as FreeNAS, of course.

18:35.180 --> 18:38.380
In fact, there is still a variant based on FreeBSD.

18:38.380 --> 18:40.080
That's TrueNAS Core.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.080
This one, TrueNAS Scale, is based on Linux.

18:43.080 --> 18:50.080
And obviously this is made possible by some of the amazing work that's been done by the ZFS on Linux project.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.280
This TrueNAS product is still ZFS first.

18:53.280 --> 18:58.580
It's still the primary storage file system that they recommend and kind of push in the OS.

18:58.580 --> 19:04.080
And everything else around that is kind of orthogonal to that original premise of ZFS first.

19:04.080 --> 19:07.280
Yeah, ZFS with Gluster.

19:07.280 --> 19:17.980
They kind of position TrueNAS Scale as a product that works great if you want to scale out your storage across multiple systems.

19:17.980 --> 19:23.380
And they use Helm on the back end to manage all of this with a Kubernetes system.

19:23.380 --> 19:28.680
So you could see how when you scale that out, that back end management system scales with it.

19:28.680 --> 19:35.780
When you're deploying a Docker container on TrueNAS Scale, it's actually being orchestrated with Helm on the back end.

19:35.780 --> 19:36.880
I think that's fascinating.

19:36.880 --> 19:39.980
It must have been a ton of work to get all that working right too.

19:39.980 --> 19:44.480
They really are pitching this as a ZFS plus Gluster.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.980
And I'm curious what you think of that.

19:45.980 --> 19:46.580
Well, it's interesting.

19:46.580 --> 19:50.080
I mean, I've done a lot of work with Gluster through my OpenShift stuff at work.

19:50.080 --> 19:57.280
And all I can tell you is that with version 3 of OpenShift, we used to ship Gluster to customers.

19:57.280 --> 20:08.880
To end customers using a tool called Hickety to do a lot of the automated volume management of persistent volume claims and stuff like that on top of the underlying Gluster storage.

20:08.880 --> 20:17.880
All I'll say about it is we don't ship Gluster with version 4 of OpenShift because it wasn't very reliable.

20:17.880 --> 20:18.780
Gotcha.

20:18.780 --> 20:20.980
Based on customer feedback, you might say.

20:20.980 --> 20:21.480
Yeah.

20:21.480 --> 20:30.180
I mean, you got to say, like, you look at the scale that Red Hat operates at and, you know, we battle test our stuff in development.

20:30.180 --> 20:44.880
But the real test is when you put it into production on customer sites and the reality at least for some of the incredible scale at which the OpenShift clusters that I work on operate at is it just wasn't up to the job.

20:44.880 --> 20:48.380
Now for smaller deployments, sure, it's okay.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.280
I'm thinking it'll be fine.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.380
It'll get the job done for a handful of servers.

20:51.380 --> 21:08.280
I mean, the thing with Kubernetes in particular is it can spin up hundreds of pods within a space of a minute or two, and sometimes each of those pods is making a request to the API underneath to request certain things and just things.

21:08.280 --> 21:15.480
They're not really designed to handle that kind of scale, but I don't necessarily think that TrueNAS is kind of going after that particular market.

21:15.480 --> 21:27.380
I mean, we look at the marketing materials and you could be forgiven for being given a bingo card and sort of crossing things off, looking at the things they've got, you know, Docker, KVM, Kubernetes, scaling, all this kind of stuff.

21:27.380 --> 21:30.580
And I just, I look at it and wonder who it's for.

21:30.580 --> 21:45.280
It's a serious storage appliance product, but if I'm looking for a serious storage appliance product, wouldn't I go to NetApp or Dell EMC or insert other major storage vendor here?

21:45.280 --> 21:48.980
I don't know what niche is TrueNAS aimed at.

21:48.980 --> 21:52.180
Is it home users like FreeNAS started out being?

21:52.180 --> 21:54.780
Is it small, medium businesses?

21:54.780 --> 22:03.180
I'm genuinely curious if you use TrueNAS as part of your daily workflow and you're not just a home user, let me know.

22:03.180 --> 22:05.280
selfhosted.show slash contact.

22:05.280 --> 22:18.680
I think this is targeted at like your Linus Media Group sized companies that have a lot of storage needs and they also want to do KVM virtualization with GPU pass-through and that kind of stuff.

22:18.680 --> 22:34.880
Or JB, you know, we have three physical x86 servers now and you could see using this to turn all three systems into one large storage system and take advantage of running applications across them and VMs.

22:34.880 --> 22:39.580
I mean, I'm almost talking myself into it, just actually, you know, saying it right now.

22:39.580 --> 22:43.380
The reality is, I think small to medium business.

22:43.380 --> 22:51.980
I think people who were maybe buying a high-end QNAP or Synology or what is that NAS software that Linus Media Group uses?

22:51.980 --> 22:52.680
Unraid.

22:52.680 --> 22:57.880
Unraid, we've talked about Unraid on the show, like they may be going after a little bit of Unraid's market as well here, I think.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.980
Yeah, Unraid was where I cut my teeth in Linux, darling, you know?

23:00.980 --> 23:02.280
Yes, I remember.

23:02.280 --> 23:07.880
In fact, I think we both, you know, we both are actually kind of fond of Unraid, even though neither one of us have used it in quite a while.

23:07.880 --> 23:15.480
But it definitely serves a market niche and Freenaz scale feels like it's going after that market.

23:15.480 --> 23:19.180
But they also say, we also have a way to go even bigger.

23:19.180 --> 23:24.980
And, you know, so maybe if your storage needs ever start really getting big, we've got other solutions here for you as well.

23:24.980 --> 23:26.880
It's an interesting pitch for sure.

23:26.880 --> 23:30.380
And I'll be curious to see how it plays out over the next few years.

23:30.380 --> 23:36.980
Now, I thought I'd spin it up in the name of science slash content and see how it performs.

23:36.980 --> 23:42.280
So I built a new backup server in January, which somehow I haven't talked about on the show yet.

23:42.280 --> 23:43.480
Oh, criminal!

23:43.480 --> 23:44.480
I've kind of been meaning to.

23:44.480 --> 23:47.080
Anyway, I'll go into more detail in a future episode.

23:47.080 --> 23:55.780
But the quick pitch is it's a local box on my LAN that just duplicates the ZFS array from my basement to my attic, right?

23:55.780 --> 24:02.280
So it's opposite ends of the house, if a pipe bursts or something happens at one end of the house, it's okay at the other.

24:02.280 --> 24:06.680
Obviously, I've got offsite backups in England for the rest of my backup methodology.

24:06.680 --> 24:14.080
But this is to save me having to mail a hard drive from England instead of uploading eight, nine, ten terabytes, whatever it is.

24:14.080 --> 24:14.980
Yeah, pipe bursts.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.480
You don't really want to have to go through all that.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.780
And if you got the hardware, why not?

24:17.780 --> 24:18.480
Exactly.

24:18.480 --> 24:24.280
So what I thought I'd do for the purposes of this segment was install TrueNow Scale on that backup box.

24:24.280 --> 24:30.080
So I fired it up yesterday evening, installed the ISO, pretty painless.

24:30.080 --> 24:33.780
I did it through the IP and my interface of the ASRock board I'm using.

24:33.780 --> 24:36.980
Install was six minutes, something like that.

24:36.980 --> 24:40.380
Really fast, painless, ZFS on route.

24:40.380 --> 24:42.980
Great, done, booted, got an IP address straight away.

24:42.980 --> 24:43.980
Everything was detected.

24:43.980 --> 24:45.980
All my drives could be seen.

24:45.980 --> 24:51.780
First thing the operating system tells me when it boots is update available.

24:51.780 --> 24:55.180
I'm like, it was released yesterday.

24:55.180 --> 24:59.580
I just downloaded the ISO and we're not talking small updates.

24:59.580 --> 25:02.880
We're talking, you know, the ISO is two gig or something.

25:02.880 --> 25:05.580
We're talking another 1.3 gigs worth of updates.

25:05.580 --> 25:10.180
And I'm like, couldn't you have just rolled that into the ISO that you released yesterday?

25:10.180 --> 25:12.180
That's the whole thing.

25:12.180 --> 25:13.680
Yeah, yeah.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.180
Maybe they froze the image a little bit ago or something.

25:16.180 --> 25:17.080
Maybe, right?

25:17.080 --> 25:18.380
I was like, fine, screw it.

25:18.380 --> 25:19.280
Doesn't matter.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.780
I'll do the update, press the button.

25:21.780 --> 25:25.680
Then I'm presented with an error message that says cannot downgrade.

25:25.680 --> 25:35.380
Release 22.02.0 cannot be downgraded to release 22.0.release.

25:35.380 --> 25:39.880
And I think, man, if this is a sign of things to come, they just haven't checked the string,

25:39.880 --> 25:44.580
you know, logic that's doing the passing of the logic about which updates the newer one there.

25:44.580 --> 25:48.680
I'm thinking, okay, that's a fairly basic mistake to make.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.080
But sure, fine.

25:50.080 --> 25:50.680
We're human.

25:50.680 --> 25:51.280
Okay, cool.

25:51.280 --> 25:52.480
No problem.

25:52.480 --> 25:57.880
I go to the storage tab next and I think, right, I need some storage before I can actually

25:57.880 --> 25:59.580
even test out any of the features.

25:59.580 --> 26:06.480
I need a ZFS pool in which to put my KVM virtual machines and my containers that I can now

26:06.480 --> 26:10.980
run on top of TrueNAS scale because it's a proper operating system.

26:10.980 --> 26:12.980
Just trying to trigger the BSD nerds there.

26:12.980 --> 26:14.780
Wait, that was a totally factual statement.

26:14.780 --> 26:16.280
What's that?

26:16.280 --> 26:19.280
Fortunately, my ZFS pool showed up straight away.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.980
You know, the backups pool was there.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.680
Both drives were detected.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.680
I click import.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.780
It looks like it's doing something.

26:26.780 --> 26:33.080
And on Proxmox, this process takes 20 seconds at most, 25.

26:33.080 --> 26:40.080
That time elapses and I'm sort of, you know, watching the progress bar spin.

26:40.080 --> 26:44.780
And then another minute goes by and I'm like, okay, this is taking a bit longer than I thought.

26:44.780 --> 26:49.080
Another minute goes by and nothing's happening.

26:49.080 --> 26:54.680
So then I drop to the command line, try and figure out what's going on, do a zpool import

26:54.680 --> 26:58.080
list and it shows me all the available pools, including my backups pool.

26:58.080 --> 27:04.580
And I'm like, okay, I'll reboot the box just in case that failed update did something silly.

27:04.580 --> 27:06.780
I didn't do the GUI this time.

27:06.780 --> 27:10.680
I just went straight to the command line, did a zpool import backups.

27:10.680 --> 27:13.780
It imported the pool and I'm like, okay, cool, no problem.

27:13.780 --> 27:15.580
Zpool list bang straight, straight away.

27:15.580 --> 27:16.780
There it is.

27:16.780 --> 27:19.580
Go to the UI, nothing.

27:19.580 --> 27:23.080
So I reboot just in case there's some kind of mismatch there.

27:23.080 --> 27:24.780
Nope, need to import the pool again.

27:24.780 --> 27:28.080
And I'm like, oh, is it because you're doing it on the command line?

27:28.080 --> 27:31.180
Is there some GUI command to import a pool that maybe you have to use?

27:31.180 --> 27:31.880
Who knows?

27:31.880 --> 27:35.580
I mean, good luck Googling anything for this thing right now because it's so brand new

27:35.580 --> 27:42.180
and obviously the SEO behind TrueNAS is the last five years of TrueNAS core and FreeNAS before it.

27:42.180 --> 27:47.380
And if I'm honest with you, Chris, I love the audience, but I don't love them enough to

27:47.380 --> 27:50.480
waste more than three or four hours trying to figure this thing out.

27:50.480 --> 27:54.480
And eventually after that time elapsed, I was like, screw this.

27:54.480 --> 27:55.480
I'm going about the Proxmox.

27:55.480 --> 27:58.780
I'm going to run my Ansible script and get things back up and running.

27:58.780 --> 28:02.880
So yeah, ultimately TrueNAS scale was a massive fail for me.

28:02.880 --> 28:08.180
I have typically struggled with these types of products and I often end up just going

28:08.180 --> 28:14.280
back to basics and I think it's kind of unfortunate because in some ways these guys can unlock

28:14.280 --> 28:16.680
stuff for me that I don't even know how to do.

28:16.680 --> 28:20.580
I also feel like there's a spectrum of user that probably prefer something like this,

28:20.580 --> 28:23.280
you know, and it works better for them as well.

28:23.280 --> 28:26.080
And I wish I could kind of get my head in that space.

28:26.080 --> 28:30.280
I was tempted for a brief moment to deploy it here at the studio and base our stuff on all

28:30.280 --> 28:33.780
that because, well, you know, we were just going to build this YOLO setup.

28:33.780 --> 28:38.480
It was like this crazy cross three system storage array.

28:38.480 --> 28:43.580
And, you know, maybe even no redundancy, just tons of disks and stupid stuff like that.

28:43.580 --> 28:46.380
That just has no sensible use.

28:46.380 --> 28:48.580
And then we started thinking, well, what if we wanted to the opposite?

28:48.580 --> 28:51.180
What if we really wanted to build this thing to be reliable?

28:51.180 --> 28:54.080
We're like, you know, there's failover and all that kind of stuff.

28:54.080 --> 28:58.280
And I got to say it's on my list of things to consider.

28:58.280 --> 29:06.580
But what my preferred route would be to just build it really simple, build it basic and

29:06.580 --> 29:09.080
probably, you know, manage it with something like Ansible.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.880
The simpler you go, the easier it is to recover from a failure too.

29:12.880 --> 29:19.380
Like in my pipe burst scenario, all I have to do is a ZFS send from one box to another

29:19.380 --> 29:21.180
and I'm back to where I was.

29:21.180 --> 29:26.880
I think it's very likely too that if you were to check back in, say, I don't know,

29:26.880 --> 29:32.280
in episode 85 and see where TrueNAS scale is at, I bet you'd be in a totally different

29:32.280 --> 29:33.280
state, right?

29:33.280 --> 29:37.980
Even though they've been working on this since 2020, this is a massive reworking of the product

29:37.980 --> 29:43.980
and it's going to be a little while before it's probably fully, fully cooked.

29:43.980 --> 29:47.380
And I think they even consider it that, like, if you look at like their presentations on

29:47.380 --> 29:51.480
this, they're kind of positioning it for more early adopters at this point.

29:51.480 --> 29:55.180
There's a difference between fully cooked and not importing the basic storage pools

29:55.180 --> 29:57.680
there.

29:57.680 --> 30:00.580
TailScale.com slash self-hosted.

30:00.580 --> 30:03.320
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.660
And of course you support the show.

30:05.660 --> 30:08.620
What I love about TailScale is that it's zero config VPN.

30:08.620 --> 30:12.980
I think it's going to blow your mind how fast you can get this thing set up and then it

30:12.980 --> 30:15.040
just runs.

30:15.040 --> 30:19.320
It connects all your devices directly using WireGuard's noise protocol.

30:19.320 --> 30:23.880
So it's as tough as WireGuard, but it's a mesh network.

30:23.880 --> 30:29.420
I was using it today to connect back to LadyJuice to check in on the Raspberry Pi because I

30:29.420 --> 30:32.620
started getting some errors with the Uptime Kuma.

30:32.620 --> 30:36.780
I was getting errors because I have Uptime Kuma running here in the studio and it connects

30:36.780 --> 30:40.000
back to LadyJuice over TailScale and checks on stuff for me.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.420
And sure enough, yep, I was having an outage, it turned out to be Starlink though.

30:44.420 --> 30:47.380
But it was nice to know that I could go check on everything and I've created like my own

30:47.380 --> 30:53.640
LAN that goes wherever I go and it can connect my servers, my workstations, my mobile devices

30:53.640 --> 31:01.220
even when you're separated by firewalls or even double NAT, TailScale just works.

31:01.220 --> 31:05.800
I'm using it on my family's computers to help provide remote support now as well.

31:05.800 --> 31:10.680
And I just love that every device essentially gets a static IP address, at least in my world.

31:10.680 --> 31:11.680
It's pretty nice.

31:11.680 --> 31:15.980
I really like the fact that you can use different nodes as exit nodes as well.

31:15.980 --> 31:21.180
So if you want to come out in a different state or a different country for some reason,

31:21.180 --> 31:22.180
you can totally do that.

31:22.180 --> 31:27.420
So you use the advertise exit node feature and you know, for me and my iPlayer habit,

31:27.420 --> 31:28.420
that's very handy.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.460
Yeah, that's a power move right there.

31:30.460 --> 31:31.780
That really is.

31:31.780 --> 31:36.420
And the other thing that's great is that TailScale supports your authentication system, your

31:36.420 --> 31:37.420
identity provider.

31:37.420 --> 31:41.860
So you can enforce multi-factor authentication, you could deauthorize employees or devices

31:41.860 --> 31:46.200
and stuff when people move on, like you get access and control over all that as well.

31:46.200 --> 31:52.100
So go try it out for free for up to 20 machines and support the show by going to TailScale.com

31:52.100 --> 31:56.440
slash self-hosted.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.820
So David asks about keeping Nextcloud going.

31:58.820 --> 32:02.280
Hey, Chris and the Badger, I've been listening for a while now and I've just started my journey

32:02.280 --> 32:03.280
with Nextcloud.

32:03.280 --> 32:06.020
It seems to be a perfect fit for my home lab.

32:06.020 --> 32:10.740
And as I progress with my journey, I can see myself getting more into the, how do I say

32:10.740 --> 32:17.580
it, enterprise-y way of doing things, specifically I'm talking around monitoring and security.

32:17.580 --> 32:21.960
So what are some of your must-haves when you're deploying things like Nextcloud for that kind

32:21.960 --> 32:23.940
of stuff, like monitoring and security?

32:23.940 --> 32:29.060
I'm sure your first answer will be everything sits behind WireGuard, but outside of that,

32:29.060 --> 32:31.740
it can be a bit overwhelming to newcomers.

32:31.740 --> 32:36.460
Maybe everything sits outside of TailScale, right?

32:36.460 --> 32:37.460
You know, it's funny.

32:37.460 --> 32:42.700
I actually would go the other way, you know, I mean, so David asks, what would you install?

32:42.700 --> 32:49.620
My top Nextcloud tip is only load the apps you need and then double check if you really

32:49.620 --> 32:51.060
are using them and need them.

32:51.060 --> 32:53.540
And if you don't, unload them, all right?

32:53.540 --> 32:54.540
So that's my top tip.

32:54.540 --> 32:59.200
But as far as turning stuff on, if you're going to expose Nextcloud to the internet,

32:59.200 --> 33:04.060
turn on two-factor authentication and it integrates with probably any two-factor authentication

33:04.060 --> 33:06.660
system that you love and know.

33:06.660 --> 33:07.820
It's really easy to do.

33:07.820 --> 33:08.880
They've made this simple.

33:08.880 --> 33:11.500
There's an app you can install as well as some settings and I'll put a link in the show

33:11.500 --> 33:16.160
notes for how to get that going because I think if you just keep Nextcloud up to date,

33:16.160 --> 33:22.700
you keep it super lean, you turn on SSL and you turn on two-factor authentication.

33:22.700 --> 33:26.040
I think that just doing those things, you'd probably be all right.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.300
What's your feeling about updates for Nextcloud?

33:28.300 --> 33:32.340
I think I'm probably five versions behind at this point.

33:32.340 --> 33:34.460
I am a version behind myself.

33:34.460 --> 33:38.340
You know, that's tricky here at JB is we run two Nextcloud instances.

33:38.340 --> 33:43.260
One that you guys interact with up on the node and then we run another instance here

33:43.260 --> 33:48.140
in the studio and it is kind of a pain in the butt to keep it updated if I'm honest

33:48.140 --> 33:50.460
because sometimes there is some work that has to be done.

33:50.460 --> 33:55.220
So what I do is I just wind to Wes and usually get him to do it, but we do it all through

33:55.220 --> 34:01.460
Docker Compose now and I'll do it on occasion, but I have to tell you, it slips and I don't

34:01.460 --> 34:02.500
like that.

34:02.500 --> 34:05.620
Not everybody has a Wes at their disposal, you know that, right?

34:05.620 --> 34:08.180
Wes, you just do it like that.

34:08.180 --> 34:12.820
Thankfully if you run it all through a container or some other system you're comfortable with,

34:12.820 --> 34:15.500
I know some of our listeners use the snap.

34:15.500 --> 34:18.180
Some of those methodologies are actually pretty easy to keep it up to date.

34:18.180 --> 34:22.740
I'm only a version behind, I just checked on version 22, 23 is the latest, came out

34:22.740 --> 34:23.740
in December.

34:23.740 --> 34:24.740
It's not too bad.

34:24.740 --> 34:25.740
Yeah.

34:25.740 --> 34:31.500
In my head I'm like three behind, in reality I'm only one behind, but I feel that pressure.

34:31.500 --> 34:36.860
Another important thing, David, would be to make sure that you are really cognizant about

34:36.860 --> 34:40.020
how you actually deploy Nextcloud in the first place.

34:40.020 --> 34:43.820
As Chris mentioned, some people use a snap, other people use a container, other people

34:43.820 --> 34:47.140
do it by running it on the host itself.

34:47.140 --> 34:51.580
And one of the most common ways I've seen listeners lose data is by not remembering

34:51.580 --> 34:57.220
how they set something up six months, a year, two years ago, and then their server goes

34:57.220 --> 34:58.380
down for some reason.

34:58.380 --> 35:02.980
They've got a copy of the data from the sync client on their local system, but they don't

35:02.980 --> 35:08.180
have a way to reconstruct the database and the users and everything as it was.

35:08.180 --> 35:13.940
So use something like Docker compose, it would be my recommendation for a repeatable deployment

35:13.940 --> 35:14.940
method.

35:14.940 --> 35:19.500
Whatever you do, whether it's compose or whatever, make sure you write it down somewhere.

35:19.500 --> 35:20.500
Well said.

35:20.500 --> 35:21.860
Well said.

35:21.860 --> 35:22.860
Plus one on that.

35:22.860 --> 35:25.500
John writes in, looking for a simple way to get started.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.860
He says, I hope you guys can help me here.

35:27.860 --> 35:31.940
I'm starting to dive further into self hosting and I have a couple of Mac mini servers at

35:31.940 --> 35:36.540
home and I was thinking about setting up the M1 box with either Docker, maybe with Portainer

35:36.540 --> 35:41.700
or Unraid to start and learn about implementing containers for apps such as Plex Media Server,

35:41.700 --> 35:45.020
Home Assistant, TDR, et cetera, et cetera.

35:45.020 --> 35:49.380
I want to have a GUI as I'm not a coder apart from following how-to videos from YouTube

35:49.380 --> 35:50.780
and using terminal commands.

35:50.780 --> 35:51.780
What would you suggest?

35:51.780 --> 35:52.780
Cheers, John.

35:52.780 --> 35:57.800
Well, I think Unraid is a bloody brilliant place to start, to be honest with you.

35:57.800 --> 36:05.340
It's a really great mix of UI, community, and documentation, and I think those three

36:05.340 --> 36:09.580
things together make a perfect mix for newcomers.

36:09.580 --> 36:17.100
A lot of people that are running Unraid do so because they are new to serving stuff at

36:17.100 --> 36:19.940
home, you know, media servers, what have you.

36:19.940 --> 36:24.740
By this point, Unraid has been around for, I want to say like 15 years.

36:24.740 --> 36:30.260
So not only do you have that mix of noobs, for want of a better word, but you've also

36:30.260 --> 36:35.780
got that mix of really experienced, passionate users that want other people to be as excited

36:35.780 --> 36:41.520
about their special little thing that they found 10 years ago and has been working perfectly

36:41.520 --> 36:43.700
for them ever since, you know?

36:43.700 --> 36:48.200
And there's very few products on the market that do what Unraid does.

36:48.200 --> 36:52.580
One of the things that makes it so great is the fact that you can stick any kind of hard

36:52.580 --> 36:55.340
drive in there, you know, like a JBOD style.

36:55.340 --> 37:00.640
There's no real kind of constraints around like there is with ZFS, for example.

37:00.640 --> 37:05.620
You've got to do a matched pair for a VDEV, and if you exceed the VDEV, you lose data

37:05.620 --> 37:07.660
and yada, yada, yada.

37:07.660 --> 37:08.940
Unraid's really simple.

37:08.940 --> 37:14.900
If you have a parity disk, it has to be the biggest disk in the array or as big as.

37:14.900 --> 37:21.300
If that fails, you've lost your fault tolerance, and if any further drive fails, you lose the

37:21.300 --> 37:22.500
data on that drive.

37:22.500 --> 37:26.660
And that's really simple to understand, and I think just that simple thing hooks a lot

37:26.660 --> 37:28.460
of people into Unraid.

37:28.460 --> 37:30.260
But then you start looking at things like the community.

37:30.260 --> 37:33.740
There's lots of videos from a chap called SpaceInvader1 on YouTube.

37:33.740 --> 37:38.180
He does really great simple-to-follow tutorials where you click here, you do this, you do

37:38.180 --> 37:40.020
that, and off you go.

37:40.020 --> 37:45.520
As you grow, you might find the guardrails that Unraid has are a little bit restrictive,

37:45.520 --> 37:48.180
but as a new user, that's a good thing in my opinion.

37:48.180 --> 37:54.020
I don't know if I've heard of anybody running Unraid on a Mac Mini, especially not an M1

37:54.020 --> 37:55.020
Mac Mini.

37:55.020 --> 37:58.220
I also don't know if Portainer works on Mac OS.

37:58.220 --> 38:02.100
You'd probably end up using Docker Desktop on Mac OS.

38:02.100 --> 38:07.340
He talks about wanting a GUI, and Unraid's definitely an option, maybe FreeNAS Scale

38:07.340 --> 38:10.680
is an option, if you want to manage some disks.

38:10.680 --> 38:15.020
If you're just going to have like one disk and you just want to run some applications,

38:15.020 --> 38:20.560
you know, Alex, I almost wonder if it's worth considering the whole Home Assistant stack,

38:20.560 --> 38:25.180
because if ultimately he wants Home Assistant anyways, when you install Managed Home Assistant,

38:25.180 --> 38:29.940
you get an app store essentially that lets you install things like Plex, and it just

38:29.940 --> 38:31.820
does it all through Docker containers.

38:31.820 --> 38:35.820
The only trick is you have to install it, I mean, generally like they release a Raspberry

38:35.820 --> 38:42.660
Pi image or something like that, but it does offer a way to run a lot of these popular

38:42.660 --> 38:47.300
open source self-hostable applications with just a few clicks, because Home Assistant

38:47.300 --> 38:53.020
itself has a supervisor part that can manage all these containers.

38:53.020 --> 38:59.020
Otherwise yeah, probably something like Unraid or FreeNAS, or there's also just the option

38:59.020 --> 39:04.940
of doing something like CentOS or Ubuntu and using something like Cockpit on top of that.

39:04.940 --> 39:09.260
I know that's getting a little more advanced, but he did say he was comfortable using terminal

39:09.260 --> 39:10.260
commands.

39:10.260 --> 39:14.300
So that's another choice, but let us know how the journey goes, John.

39:14.300 --> 39:21.020
I'll do a final shameless plug for PerfectMediaServer.com if you want to just do things from the command

39:21.020 --> 39:22.020
line.

39:22.020 --> 39:23.020
I think that's probably the way to go.

39:23.020 --> 39:32.500
Well, behind the scenes, we are making secret, not so secret plans for a JB East Coast meetup.

39:32.500 --> 39:36.300
And of course, in the planning phase, what's come up is like, how the hell are we going

39:36.300 --> 39:38.260
to pay for this?

39:38.260 --> 39:41.100
And it got us talking, and I don't think we're going to do it for this.

39:41.100 --> 39:44.620
But down the road, there may be a project or something like a special edition of a show

39:44.620 --> 39:47.420
or maybe some special trip.

39:47.420 --> 39:49.340
How would we, if we wanted to, do crowdfunding?

39:49.340 --> 39:53.500
And we thought, well, we'd like it to be open source and self-hostable.

39:53.500 --> 39:57.500
I went out there and did a little looking around, and it looks like a lot of those projects

39:57.500 --> 39:59.820
have died or become abandoned over the years.

39:59.820 --> 40:05.700
So if you know of a self-hosted crowdfunding application that's alive and well, maybe you're

40:05.700 --> 40:09.580
using it, let us know about it, self-hosted.show slash contact.

40:09.580 --> 40:13.220
Because if it was ever something JB did want to get into, we'd like it to kind of align

40:13.220 --> 40:14.220
with our values.

40:14.220 --> 40:17.900
I can't believe it's taken us until this point in the show to actually even mention this.

40:17.900 --> 40:24.780
But I know April the 9th in Raleigh, we're going to have an East Coast JB meetup.

40:24.780 --> 40:32.020
And rumor has it that a certain RV dwelling podcaster might be joining us there.

40:32.020 --> 40:33.020
It's true.

40:33.020 --> 40:34.020
Although I'm going to fly in.

40:34.020 --> 40:40.020
I think, I'm hoping it'll be a life goal if it's like one part mini vacation with the

40:40.020 --> 40:46.900
fam because it'll be my son's 13th birthday and spring break.

40:46.900 --> 40:48.940
And he is a Bitcoin nut.

40:48.940 --> 40:53.020
So we're hoping we could fly into Miami, go to the Bitcoin conference for a couple of

40:53.020 --> 40:58.900
days, and then fly up and hang out with you and the family and then go to a meetup.

40:58.900 --> 41:00.860
It's all in the planning phase.

41:00.860 --> 41:07.940
But Alex, we have needed to do an East Coast JB meetup for about 15 years.

41:07.940 --> 41:11.540
I mean, it's embarrassingly bad.

41:11.540 --> 41:14.820
And you and the community just were like, screw it.

41:14.820 --> 41:16.420
We're just going to get something started.

41:16.420 --> 41:22.980
And I was talking behind the scenes thinking, you know, I'm feeling like I really need to

41:22.980 --> 41:23.980
take a little bit of a trip.

41:23.980 --> 41:24.980
I am really feeling burned out.

41:24.980 --> 41:26.700
Like I need to do something.

41:26.700 --> 41:30.100
And this Bitcoin conference came up and this meetup came up and it's like, this is almost

41:30.100 --> 41:31.220
too perfect.

41:31.220 --> 41:33.020
So behind the scenes, we're trying to figure it out.

41:33.020 --> 41:37.740
Well, of course, normally you're busy planning for Linux Fest Northwest, but for obvious

41:37.740 --> 41:39.580
reasons that's still on hiatus.

41:39.580 --> 41:40.580
Right.

41:40.580 --> 41:43.460
And that was actually how the conversation started, because that's usually like a nice

41:43.460 --> 41:46.660
little way for us to connect with the community once a year.

41:46.660 --> 41:48.720
And we're going on two years now of not having it.

41:48.720 --> 41:50.340
It's like our big event.

41:50.340 --> 41:52.520
And you found a great spot, too.

41:52.520 --> 41:55.900
So it's like, God, it just all seems like it's coming together, like a nice spot and

41:55.900 --> 41:58.400
great weather on the East Coast.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.420
Right on Dylan's birthday spring break.

42:00.420 --> 42:02.180
I'm like, oh, let's do it.

42:02.180 --> 42:03.180
So we're figuring it out.

42:03.180 --> 42:05.540
Let me paint a picture for the audience.

42:05.540 --> 42:06.540
Right.

42:06.540 --> 42:12.020
So prime barbecue is a Texas style barbecue joint that's just opened out just outside

42:12.020 --> 42:13.020
of Raleigh.

42:13.020 --> 42:16.920
It's a place called Nightdale and it looks out over this big park.

42:16.920 --> 42:21.100
And on the other side of the park is a place called Oak City Brewing.

42:21.100 --> 42:25.100
So what I'm thinking is two, three o'clock in the afternoon, something like that.

42:25.100 --> 42:29.260
We'll put all the details on meetup.com closer to the time, but something like two or three

42:29.260 --> 42:32.700
o'clock in the afternoon on the Saturday, we'll meet at the barbecue place, go get some

42:32.700 --> 42:37.580
food, sit on the lawn, go and eat and mingle with people.

42:37.580 --> 42:42.060
And then as the evening progresses, we can head across the brewery and go and get some

42:42.060 --> 42:43.060
drinks.

42:43.060 --> 42:46.580
And I've been racking my brains for the last few weeks about where we could go in town

42:46.580 --> 42:49.660
that was kind of a COVID safe location.

42:49.660 --> 42:54.300
And the beauty of this place is we can all congregate in this place together, but we're

42:54.300 --> 42:55.300
outside.

42:55.300 --> 42:56.300
Right.

42:56.300 --> 42:59.780
And the weather in Raleigh in April is going to be lovely, of course, apart from the pollen,

42:59.780 --> 43:04.700
maybe that might be a thing, but on the whole, I think it will be a lovely day for everybody.

43:04.700 --> 43:07.340
And it's going to be right next to some great stuff.

43:07.340 --> 43:08.340
Yeah.

43:08.340 --> 43:11.980
So the thing to do would be to join our meetup.

43:11.980 --> 43:15.580
We don't have like one set for this, but you could join the group at meetup.com slash Jupiter

43:15.580 --> 43:21.060
broadcasting or join the discord, selfhosted.show slash discord if you have questions.

43:21.060 --> 43:26.140
But when we get our details solidified, which we're really close to, hopefully, we'll probably

43:26.140 --> 43:27.940
make a proper meetup post about it.

43:27.940 --> 43:34.660
The provisional plan, like I say, is Saturday, April 9th, 2 or 3 p.m. until we all get bored

43:34.660 --> 43:36.620
and want to go home, something like that.

43:36.620 --> 43:41.260
If you're anywhere in the area, we don't make it out to the East Coast too often.

43:41.260 --> 43:42.260
So come join us.

43:42.260 --> 43:43.560
It'll be a lot of fun.

43:43.560 --> 43:45.700
And also thank you to our members.

43:45.700 --> 43:49.460
You know, you guys really help us keep the show on the road and you also give us the

43:49.460 --> 43:53.660
freedom to wait until a great sponsor like Talescale comes along.

43:53.660 --> 43:57.820
You know, like you give us leverage there to make wise choices.

43:57.820 --> 44:00.420
You give us runways, they say in the business.

44:00.420 --> 44:04.580
Selfhosted.show slash SRE if you'd like to join as a perk, you get more show.

44:04.580 --> 44:06.100
You get a post show.

44:06.100 --> 44:09.620
You can also support the entire network, just like the cost of two memberships and you support

44:09.620 --> 44:14.580
all the shows and you get all the shows ad free plus that post show.

44:14.580 --> 44:17.700
That network support is at Jupiter.party.

44:17.700 --> 44:21.660
And as you all know by now, the place to go to get in touch with us is selfhosted.show

44:21.660 --> 44:22.660
slash contact.

44:22.660 --> 44:28.060
You can find me on the Discord at Alex KTZ and you could find me on matrix.

44:28.060 --> 44:30.340
Come join us in the self-hosted matrix.

44:30.340 --> 44:33.460
Our matrix server is Colony.JupiterBroadcasting.com.

44:33.460 --> 44:36.300
I didn't mention it in the show and it's just a very quick addendum.

44:36.300 --> 44:40.400
Big thanks to Jake, the real orange one, the orange one, whatever his handle is this week

44:40.400 --> 44:45.500
for running our matrix party thing, set up party that we had a couple of weeks ago.

44:45.500 --> 44:46.500
It went really well.

44:46.500 --> 44:48.060
We had about 30 people show up.

44:48.060 --> 44:50.300
It was a fun time on a Sunday.

44:50.300 --> 44:52.900
Big thanks to Jake for setting that up.

44:52.900 --> 44:55.140
And as always, thanks for listening everybody.

44:55.140 --> 45:17.260
That was self-hosted.show slash 65.
