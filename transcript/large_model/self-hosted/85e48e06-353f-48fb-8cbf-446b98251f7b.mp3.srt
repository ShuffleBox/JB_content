1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Well, we've got a special interview for episode 45 today.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,360
We're gonna have our guest coming up in just a moment.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,520
So I wanna thank our sponsor, A Cloud Guru.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,120
They are the leader in learning for the cloud,

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,800
Linux and other modern tech skills.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,200
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,080
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,560
So today, instead of a bunch of different segments,

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,040
we're really kind of just doing one thing, Alex?

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,680
We are indeed.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,440
Yes, we've got Paulus who is the founder

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,600
of Home Assistant on the episode today.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,400
And Chris and I talked to him about all sorts of different subjects

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,160
from how Home Assistant's becoming more turnkey ready

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,400
through to the ESP Home acquisition.

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,320
And there's a couple of interesting tip bits

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
about the future in there as well.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,640
Well, I don't know if you remember,

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,240
but you and I chatted back in 2017

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,800
on a Linux action show special about Home Assistant

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,280
what feels like a hundred years ago now.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,240
Yeah, no, I do remember.

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,880
Well, I remember it was somebody from Jupiter broadcasting.

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,920
I didn't realize it was you.

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,960
Yeah, and man, have things come a long way.

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,480
So thank you for joining us to catch us up on stuff.

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,640
I am the happy owner of a Home Assistant Blue device.

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,360
Love it.

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,080
Awesome.

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,480
I put the order in during the live stream,

31
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,480
so I got it fairly early.

32
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,560
And I got to say, months into it,

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,880
the performance holds up compared to the Raspberry Pi 4.

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,440
I think it is outperforming the Raspberry.

35
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,120
I mean, it's a beast.

36
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,520
The M2 is just like, it's amazing.

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,040
So are there any plans for more expansions in that direction?

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
Is that going to be a focus going forward?

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,840
Because it really seems like a pretty sweet integration.

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,760
Yeah, so there are definitely plans.

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,760
Nothing to announce just yet.

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,560
We realized with the M2 Plus,

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,880
like we only made the case, right?

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,720
So it's just a board.

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
And when people think of home automation,

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,680
they obviously think of like ZigBee or Z-Wave or Chip

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,720
or Matter, whatever it's going to be called.

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,280
And so that's something that we want to address.

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,560
We want to include that as well.

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,480
And I think the Home Assistant Blue

51
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,680
was really like the ultimate race car,

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,200
but it was not very accessible in that the price was not...

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,440
The price was pretty steep for a device

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,280
that also you needed to add like a ZigBee stick

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,080
and these kind of things.

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,520
So I think we are definitely going to look into something

57
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
as a successor.

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,040
Nothing to announce just yet,

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,800
but it will also be hopefully lower priced

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,600
and more capable out of the gate to be used for smart home.

61
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,240
Yeah, I can absolutely see how that would be way simpler

62
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,960
for new users to get into the space as well.

63
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,520
Yeah, and I think when we look at these things,

64
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,640
we don't just want to create a box that competes

65
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,560
with like Philips Hue or anything, right?

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
Like we're Home Assistant,

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,280
so it needs to be kind of hackable, playful, open.

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,240
Like it just needs just like the Odroid N2 Plus

69
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,200
or the Home Assistant Blue.

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,600
I mean, you can flash anything on it that you want, right?

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,080
We're not interested in building a lockdown box

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,800
that will just keep the users out.

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,160
That is completely understandable,

74
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,760
especially now having used one.

75
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,680
But so what about guys like me

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,760
who will always have a use case

77
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,520
where I'm going to want to run it on a server?

78
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,480
Like here at the studio,

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,240
we have a server that's doing like 100 other things.

80
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,800
And so running Home Assistant in a container

81
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,080
is perfect for the use cases

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,600
of just controlling studio lights.

83
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,440
And we're not really using any integrations

84
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,480
and stuff like that.

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,960
How do you see that user base being addressed in the future?

86
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,600
Right now, we have four installation types.

87
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,120
We have the Home Assistant operating system.

88
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,880
We have the Home Assistant supervised,

89
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,160
the Home Assistant container,

90
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,520
and then Home Assistant core,

91
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,240
which is just like running it in Python yourself.

92
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,720
And all the other three installation approaches

93
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,200
all rely on containers.

94
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,040
And so they all use the same image.

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,680
So it's like the core technologies are all very similar.

96
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,200
Yeah, it's all the same thing, really.

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,680
The only one that's different is core

98
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,360
because you maintain your own Python virtual environment.

99
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,880
The other three are all Docker based.

100
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,400
So it's all the same thing.

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
So those four installation types

102
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,760
are pretty much set in stone right now.

103
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,640
I think that if you, in your studio,

104
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,560
you can either run the container

105
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,240
or you can run a virtual machine

106
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
with a Home Assistant operating system.

107
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,720
The benefit, of course, of the virtual machine

108
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,920
is that you have one-click updates of Home Assistant.

109
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,880
Well, with the container,

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,840
it really depends on your container management software,

111
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,800
which can be Unrate or Portainer or Synology or whatever.

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,040
That software then has to do the update of the container.

113
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,560
I think that's the only real difference.

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,480
In the end, all of these containers,

115
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,480
they're all run Alpine, they run Python,

116
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,680
and we maintain that, right?

117
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,560
So we have a big wheel server.

118
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,680
We make sure that all the dependencies work and compiled

119
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
and are just up to date and running.

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,480
And that's just a big benefit as a user.

121
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,400
And I think that moving forward,

122
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,240
you just wanna run Home Assistant container,

123
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
that will be possible.

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,400
I see.

125
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
So it's not like it's ever gonna go away,

126
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,160
but you just feel like there's a lot of benefits

127
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,720
to Home Assistant managing the entire stack

128
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,200
because of all of the interdependencies.

129
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Yeah, I mean, there's just so many moving parts.

130
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,560
I think that if you look at our requirements.txt,

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,120
which is where we define the Python dependencies,

132
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,800
it's like over a thousand, right?

133
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,920
Because each integration comes with its own Python library,

134
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,520
which is a requirement we made ourselves.

135
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,800
So it's obviously our own guidelines.

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,280
But the reason we always do this is that

137
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,480
we want integrations to rely on an SDK.

138
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,200
So an SDK is a Python package at the standalone

139
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,880
that translates the protocol into Python objects.

140
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,640
And that way, other Python projects,

141
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,200
not just Home Assistant, can also use this package, right?

142
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,840
So we don't want protocol-specific information

143
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,320
inside Home Assistant because we wanna make sure

144
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,440
that other Python-based home automation systems

145
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,240
or just one-off scripts can use these protocols as well.

146
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
Wow, so it kind of sounds like to me

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,080
what you guys did as a team as you looked at the,

148
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,000
kind of, if you will, the whole problem and you said,

149
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,800
quite frankly, it is easier for us as a team

150
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,720
to just do a whole OS than say,

151
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,200
you must have considered, well, bless Ubuntu LTS

152
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,120
as the supported Home Assistant platform.

153
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,320
And anything else is DIY, but if you want our official way

154
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
or our official image, it's all Ubuntu-based.

155
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,240
Yeah, but the problem with that is that

156
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,120
your virtual environment that runs Python

157
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,880
is going to be, has to be maintained as well.

158
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
So, I mean, this is, of course, how Home Assistant started.

159
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
It was just a Python application

160
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,400
that we distributed through PyPI.

161
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,960
Sure.

162
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,080
And people would run into, like, they would do pip upgrades.

163
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,160
And then, of course, some people will upgrade

164
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,280
from the last release.

165
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,840
Some people will update from, like, six releases ago.

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,240
And people got stuck all the time.

167
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,080
And the way it works with our Docker containers

168
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,120
is that we install all the Python dependencies

169
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,320
fresh in each container.

170
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,760
And so, when you update your container,

171
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,160
all your old dependencies are thrown away.

172
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
We make sure you have the latest and greatest

173
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,480
and the dependencies all work together.

174
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,000
And that way, it just works.

175
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,960
Yeah, that makes sense.

176
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,520
I could see how that also is just much more manageable

177
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,600
and supportable by you guys as well.

178
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,760
And I got to say, you know, on the blue,

179
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,640
it's working really great.

180
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,720
I kind of am, I'm a user of both use cases,

181
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,280
just the core version and the whole OS stack.

182
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,320
And I do really like the snapshots.

183
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,120
I feel like the more recent updates that have also set it

184
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,200
so you can have a snapshot right before you upgrade

185
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,840
is brilliant.

186
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
All that kind of stuff just keeps getting better.

187
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,080
Yeah.

188
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,000
And I think, you know, the features are really driven.

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,560
You know, we look at the way people use Home Assistant

190
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,000
and we look at the issues we see on our forums

191
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,960
and our Discord.

192
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,000
And then we just ask ourselves, like, why is this?

193
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,560
What can we do to make it easier and better?

194
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,840
And we just constantly try to, like, kind of tackle this.

195
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,160
And, you know, we're really focused on making

196
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,840
Home Assistant easier to use while still also,

197
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,080
you know, making sure that our power users,

198
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,440
of course, can do their things.

199
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,640
And, you know, it's been really paying off.

200
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,880
I think that, like, we launched Home Assistant analytics,

201
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,240
like, a month ago, two months ago already, right?

202
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,480
And I think, like, around, we didn't do much promo,

203
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,040
but, like, 45,000 people have opted in.

204
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,880
And you can actually see our operating system

205
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,800
is, like, 65% of our users.

206
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,680
Oh, okay.

207
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,160
I mean, that was pretty unexpected.

208
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,760
Like, we knew it was high.

209
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,080
I think, you know, internally, we were like,

210
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,840
ah, that's probably, like, 50%.

211
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,520
But it's actually 65%.

212
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,280
And I also understand it because it's just convenience, right?

213
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,480
Like, if you want to be a system administrator at home,

214
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,840
you can be, of course.

215
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,720
But if you want to be, like, automating your home,

216
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,520
you can be that, too.

217
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,040
Linode.com slash SSH.

218
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,160
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on your new account,

219
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,960
and you support the self-hosted podcast.

220
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,720
Linode is my playground to learn,

221
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,040
and it can be yours, too, without $100 credit.

222
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,480
And sure, maybe, ultimately,

223
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,040
you decide to self-host something on your LAN.

224
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,320
But every now and then, and that's more and more these days,

225
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,120
there's a job that's really perfect out in the cloud

226
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,600
on a service provider you can trust,

227
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
and you have full control.

228
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,800
That's one of the things I like about Linode

229
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,040
is unlike entry-level hosting services,

230
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,760
they don't try to lock you into their platform with gimmicks.

231
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,680
Linode gives you full back-end access

232
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,000
to customize and control your server to fit your needs.

233
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,440
And their DNS manager allows you

234
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
to easily switch your domain to your new server.

235
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,680
You can manage SSL certificates with breeze

236
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,760
and deploy applications with a single click

237
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,160
or build the server up from scratch if you want.

238
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,960
If you need a simple personal server for a blog or portfolio

239
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,160
or maybe a game server,

240
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,480
in fact, they make that really straightforward.

241
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,040
Or maybe you want to set yourself up a next cloud server

242
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,920
and sync your own files.

243
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,480
Whatever the scale of your task or your business,

244
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
or even when your app goes viral,

245
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,680
Linode is going to reliably serve to millions of users.

246
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,160
It can be just you and your friends and family,

247
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
or it can be millions of users.

248
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,520
And we've really put it to the test here

249
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,880
at Jupiter Broadcasting.

250
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,600
And like I say, it really is a fantastic playground

251
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
to learn as well.

252
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,560
And that $100 credit means you can play around

253
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,000
with all kinds of different hardware

254
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,360
and configuration stacks,

255
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,600
which has been a massive advantage for me.

256
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
Before I deploy something in production,

257
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,280
I'll sometimes spin up a couple of versions of it

258
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,480
on different stacks.

259
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,640
Maybe this one's on NGINX and this one's on Apache.

260
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,960
Maybe this one's on Ubuntu, maybe this one's on CentOS.

261
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,640
I'll try them out and test them right there.

262
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,720
And then I'll just keep the winner and destroy the others.

263
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,800
That kind of flexibility and not having to mess around

264
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,040
with some slow VM software on my laptop

265
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,520
to test that stuff out, it's just brilliant.

266
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,960
And then of course, there's the perk as a listener

267
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,040
of supporting this here podcast too.

268
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
And we use our S3 compatible object storage

269
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,960
as the backend storage for our next cloud,

270
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,200
which means we're not constantly managing disk space

271
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,920
all the time.

272
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,360
They've really got this stuff dialed in

273
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,120
because they've been doing it since 2003.

274
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,400
So I want you to go try it.

275
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,880
So go to linode.com slash SSH.

276
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,160
Go there, get that $100 in credit and support the show.

277
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,080
linode.com slash SSH.

278
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,160
Yeah, so I mean, Home Assistant's been headed down

279
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,040
the more turnkey route for quite a while now.

280
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,880
And I think hasOS is, or am I calling it the right thing?

281
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,640
I'm still confused by the name change.

282
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,000
It's been headed down the turnkey route for quite a while.

283
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,560
What else do you have planned in that space?

284
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,520
I mean, there's been a lot of work

285
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,360
around automations recently,

286
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,360
as well as some other aspects of the experience.

287
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,120
So I think that our goal really like in the longer term

288
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,480
is that we wanna make sure that a lot of people have access

289
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
to having like great home automation at home

290
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,640
that focuses on local control and privacy.

291
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,440
And so having Home Assistant be accessible

292
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,280
is important to us, but for example,

293
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,720
we've also, the company behind Home Assistant,

294
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,240
my company Nabucasa, we've also recently acquired ESPHome.

295
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,280
ESPHome is a firmware for ESP devices that runs on a,

296
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,560
which is a firmware that can run on a lot of products

297
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,240
that come from China, like light switches, lights.

298
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,200
And with ESPHome, we are also trying to make it easier

299
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,680
for people to get access to devices that work locally

300
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,800
and work private and work with Home Assistant.

301
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,920
So yeah, our long-term goal is really just to make it

302
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,200
accessible to everybody.

303
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,280
And I think that launching hardware

304
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,840
was a really obvious step.

305
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,600
I feel that for a long time,

306
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,800
I didn't wanna go down that route because logistics,

307
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,560
just like all that stuff.

308
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,280
But at the end of the day, we were looking at it

309
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,200
and we were like, we've been working on making it

310
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,040
so much easier to use.

311
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,600
But then the first step of instructions is,

312
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
download Azure, download this image

313
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,680
and flash it to an SD card.

314
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,840
And most people don't even know those words.

315
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,120
Yeah, it's true.

316
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,880
That has me thinking about something like,

317
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,800
you know, the made for iPhone program?

318
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Yeah.

319
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,440
It makes me think with ESPHome in particular,

320
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,600
I know it's aimed primarily at hackers

321
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,240
and people that wanna build and make and solder

322
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,080
and all that kind of stuff.

323
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,160
But it's got me thinking, it's acquisition of ESPHome,

324
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,800
why isn't there a made for Home Assistant program?

325
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,520
Well, I think that the main thing about making it

326
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,720
a made for Home Assistant,

327
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,840
is that we don't have an API ourselves, right?

328
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,240
Like we always integrate with the other products.

329
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,720
I did consider like starting one

330
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,880
or like having like at least some certification

331
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,640
and more official certification,

332
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,520
but we see that there's not much interest in it

333
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,800
in a way that like, you know,

334
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,880
manufacturers will come to us and be like,

335
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,120
well, what's your API, we'll integrate.

336
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,880
And I'm always like, no, that's not what we want.

337
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,960
We want you to create an open API.

338
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,240
We will integrate with it,

339
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,640
but other projects should also be able to allow

340
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,080
to be integrated with it.

341
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,600
And then we see a lot of companies be like,

342
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,360
ah, that's not in our interest.

343
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,840
Or, you know, we were talking to Ring

344
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,320
because, you know, they wanted to say like,

345
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,880
hey, can we get like a partnership going?

346
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,000
And then we looked at it and the first step is sign NDA

347
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,640
to make sure that you don't expose their APIs.

348
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,960
And like, we're open source, this is not gonna happen.

349
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
And the same thing happened to us with Sonos,

350
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,640
who also was like, yeah, we wanna keep it to partners only.

351
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
It's like, ah, okay, that doesn't work.

352
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,880
Oh, that's super frustrating to hear that kind of stuff

353
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,040
because some of those companies you listed,

354
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,240
you know, Ring and Sonos,

355
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,720
they're big players in this space.

356
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,600
And that's kind of frustrating to hear

357
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,800
that they're not compatible with an open source ethos yet.

358
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,160
Well, their partnerships are not,

359
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,560
but I mean, we still integrate with them, right?

360
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,840
It's just less official because they still have APIs

361
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,240
and people have been able to figure out those APIs.

362
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
And so we will still integrate with them.

363
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
It's just, if you are a partner,

364
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,320
they will make sure it stays working

365
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,400
or they will give you a heads up so you can adjust.

366
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,560
And that's something we don't have, right?

367
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,640
So we sometimes get caught off guard,

368
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,920
like some brand will change an API,

369
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
Home Assistant stops working,

370
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,520
we have to update our code, ship a hotfix

371
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,640
and it will work again.

372
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,400
Which leads me nicely into my next question,

373
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,160
which is about the velocity of change.

374
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,920
Now, I've been using Home Assistant

375
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,360
for a couple of years myself,

376
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,160
so I've been through quite a few breaking config changes

377
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,960
over that time.

378
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,640
I feel like, and this is just anecdotal personal experience,

379
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,480
that that experience has gotten better,

380
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,200
that the pace of change hasn't decreased,

381
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,480
but the amount of changes that break stuff,

382
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,840
that has decreased significantly from my perspective.

383
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,480
What things are you doing from a Home Assistant side

384
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,760
to make that velocity of change more easy for people to handle?

385
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,560
So the biggest change there, and this is actually,

386
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,160
it started out with a policy change,

387
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,800
and then it resulted also in code changes.

388
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,480
So there's this thing called Convid flow.

389
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
So through the UI, you can set up an integration.

390
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,280
And what we said is that this is going to be mandatory

391
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,080
moving forward.

392
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,720
So it used to be that you could go into YAML,

393
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,840
and then for example, let's say for your Philips Ubridge,

394
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
you would say, this is the IP address.

395
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,880
And then, well, Philips used maybe a bad example,

396
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,800
because you would still have to press a button in the UI

397
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,320
and it was storing some extra data.

398
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,000
But for some things you have to like,

399
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,840
here's the username, here's the password,

400
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,240
username, password, and IP address of a device

401
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,880
on my network.

402
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,280
But then when the IP address would change,

403
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,280
Home Assistant wouldn't work.

404
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,600
And Home Assistant couldn't find the new IP address

405
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,240
because you had it hard coded in your configuration files,

406
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,160
and we're not changing your configuration files.

407
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,120
And so those cases, we really had to handle through UI.

408
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,760
We had to like say, hey, this is a temporary IP address,

409
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,200
but we still have an identifier.

410
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,080
So if your Chromecast changes IP address,

411
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,000
we can still find it and we will set it up again,

412
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,080
or your Shelly or whatever you have.

413
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,280
And then we realized that,

414
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,000
oh, actually a lot of our breaking changes

415
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,200
is because people are adding support

416
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,440
to having to like go from one device,

417
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,320
support multiple devices, or these kinds of things.

418
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,040
And so when we go for a config flow,

419
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,680
Home Assistant is responsible for how it is written to disk.

420
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,320
So Home Assistant knows exactly the configuration format.

421
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,640
And if we have to change it,

422
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,960
because we are going to support multiple devices,

423
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,880
we can actually migrate that data

424
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,560
because we own how it is stored.

425
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,560
If it is a configuration file,

426
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,960
and this is kind of silly,

427
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,040
but we kind of programmed our way

428
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,200
into like a corner we can get out of.

429
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,000
Because if you look at configuration.yaml,

430
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
we have all these advanced structures

431
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,280
to break up your configuration files.

432
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,040
There's packages with includes,

433
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,320
include their names, include their list,

434
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
and there's all these different types.

435
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,600
And what that means is that Home Assistant

436
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,000
cannot go update your configuration file anymore

437
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,560
because it doesn't know where your configuration file is.

438
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,360
We would have to reverse track all your includes,

439
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,000
and then we need to find like a yaml writer

440
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,440
that respects your comments

441
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,920
and respects your indentations exactly how it was.

442
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,640
And it's just, it's impossible.

443
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,200
I think safe mode was a really good invention.

444
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,960
Well, not invention, idea, right?

445
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,040
Where Home Assistant still starts

446
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,360
and then just goes back to a safe mode.

447
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Yeah, so safe mode was really driven by the blue, right?

448
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,880
So we had the blue in mind

449
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,600
and we were like, okay, we're gonna have a box.

450
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,720
We're gonna sell this people,

451
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,680
like it will actually allow more people to use Home Assistant

452
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
that previously were not using Home Assistant.

453
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,640
So how can we make sure that they can always boot

454
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,920
and always have a UI?

455
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,240
That shows you just how long it takes

456
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,200
to develop a product

457
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,920
because they were released a long time apart,

458
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,800
those two things.

459
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

460
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,400
I mean, it took us a year to make that case for the blue.

461
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,760
So it's, I mean, a pandemic happened

462
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,040
and like what other stuff,

463
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,560
but yeah, it took us a year on all to just get a case.

464
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,480
So I hope our next product will not take that long

465
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,640
at least, I mean, we'll see, but yeah.

466
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,680
Yeah, it is very tricky.

467
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,960
It's fascinating though how thinking about

468
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,320
from a developer perspective,

469
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,240
how to ship something for an end user,

470
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,840
we got a feature like that.

471
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,640
I think that's kind of telling how created that use case.

472
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,200
So I'm curious, let's shift gears to the personal side.

473
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,760
If you do have some self-hosted services,

474
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,440
what are you running on your LAN

475
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,680
and roughly how much storage do you have

476
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,080
on this quote unquote LAN?

477
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,440
So I run Unrate at home

478
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,040
and I made a server that must've been like

479
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,760
six, seven, eight years ago or something.

480
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,360
Like now it's six years.

481
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,240
It's getting really old.

482
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,840
It's like a core I5 still.

483
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,240
And I think it takes up way too much power

484
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
compared to what it does.

485
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,520
You know, and I chose Unrate

486
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,840
because this was during the beta phase of Unrate.

487
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,080
So beta phase of Unrate 5.

488
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,040
And Unrate 5 was where they introduced the Docker containers.

489
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,720
So that was like almost kind of right away,

490
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,960
I kind of shifted into like this perfect world

491
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,480
of having all these containers at home.

492
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,160
And so I'm actually still the maintainer

493
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,960
of the Home Assistant core templates for Unrate.

494
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,460
Love that.

495
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,320
So that's how I used to run Home Assistant for a long time.

496
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,160
I was like, I just have my container at home.

497
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,880
And then I have like, I have Plex running

498
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,920
and some other stuff.

499
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,040
And then you had to go and make it a whole OS.

500
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,600
No, I'm kidding.

501
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,760
Yeah, I hear Plex in there.

502
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,560
Interesting.

503
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,520
What's that set up like?

504
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,080
I mean, so I mainly use Plex

505
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,640
because there's a bunch of that.

506
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,160
So I'm from the Netherlands,

507
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,680
but I live in the United States.

508
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,080
And there's a bunch of content from the Netherlands

509
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,200
that is geo-blocked.

510
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
And so I cannot access it in the United States.

511
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
So I have to jump on a VPN

512
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,520
and download either stuff from YouTube

513
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,320
or whatever.

514
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,400
And then I also don't want my son

515
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,320
to be on YouTube unsupervised.

516
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,480
So that's also why I pull in some videos.

517
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,640
And then I'll just have a Plex account for my son

518
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,280
and he can kind of just browse through it.

519
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,960
I do that same thing for my kids.

520
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,680
Yep, exactly.

521
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,360
It's a great use case for Plex.

522
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:09,920
Well, that's it.

523
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,240
And then how much storage roughly would you estimate?

524
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,680
I think it's like eight terabytes.

525
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,000
I just got some smart errors the other day.

526
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,520
Two months ago, some CRC smart check error.

527
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
So I just...

528
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,720
But then, I mean, with Unrate,

529
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,760
you have this parity disk.

530
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,840
Your parity disk needs to be the same size

531
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,920
or bigger than your biggest disk.

532
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,160
And so my biggest disk were like four terabytes.

533
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,800
And so it's like, wow,

534
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,680
I should really update to like eight terabyte disks.

535
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,400
And so I only updated my parity disk now.

536
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,480
And that took like more than a week, right?

537
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
Because you have to like pre-clear it

538
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,440
and all that stuff.

539
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:43,940
Yeah.

540
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,960
And then I still have one disk

541
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,400
that is like on riser FS.

542
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
And I think they stopped using riser FS

543
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
and they're using something else.

544
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,600
And I was looking into, should I migrate this?

545
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,400
And then I was like, no, this is just like, no.

546
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,280
It's too much.

547
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,400
It still kind of works.

548
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,120
And so I actually only updated the parity disk.

549
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,120
And then I've...

550
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,840
The old parity disk I installed now as in my rate

551
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,400
because there's only a couple of errors.

552
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,600
And then I read online that like,

553
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,680
ah, it's okay if you have a couple of errors.

554
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,160
And that was already after I did my whole process.

555
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,360
But of course, I mean...

556
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,960
That just means it's time to start shopping.

557
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,760
Yeah.

558
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,040
Exactly. Yes.

559
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,760
I'm waiting for some like deals, right?

560
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,240
Because those disks are expensive.

561
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I was like, I use the Western Digital Red, I think.

562
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,480
Are you familiar with shucking drives?

563
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,320
Is that of any interest to you?

564
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,360
What is that?

565
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,440
So you buy a USB hard drive from Amazon

566
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,560
or Best Buy or something.

567
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,240
This is Alex's favorite thing to do.

568
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,240
I'll show you.

569
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,440
I've literally got one over here.

570
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,600
It's just like it sounds.

571
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,360
You grab the disk off Amazon

572
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,040
and you shuck it out of the case.

573
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,800
I paid for this Iron Wolf NAS Pro $170 for a 10 terabyte drive.

574
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,440
Oh, wow.

575
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,360
And all I had to do to get this was buy a USB enclosure drive

576
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,800
and pop it out the USB enclosure.

577
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,280
It took five minutes and it's a normal SATA drive.

578
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,080
There's nothing special about it once you get it out of the case.

579
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,360
If you look just on eBay, just for this drive on its own,

580
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,600
I could sell this thing for $350.

581
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,800
In fact, why don't I do that?

582
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,400
There you go.

583
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,000
You got to pay for that solar setup somehow.

584
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:20,960
Yeah.

585
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,800
So the shucking technique is Alex's favorite.

586
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,720
Sometimes it requires a little more work than that,

587
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,360
but it is a great way to get drives at a great price.

588
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,640
Oh, that's a good tip.

589
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,080
I heard you talking about solar, Alex.

590
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,560
Yeah.

591
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,080
We're actually working.

592
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,320
We have an intern at Home Assistant.

593
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,160
And well, he actually is an intern at Nabucasa,

594
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,000
but he's working on Home Assistant stuff.

595
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,920
And his focus right now is create a solution.

596
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,320
How do we use Home Assistant to give the user insight

597
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,880
into the energy usage and allow optimizing it?

598
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,440
So, of course, Home Assistant has been always very focused on home control,

599
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,520
home automation, and it's been our strength.

600
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,480
History has not been our strength that much, right?

601
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,400
Our database has been clunky and it's pretty shitty.

602
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,640
So, I mean, we're actually changing this right now.

603
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,840
So in the next release, it's going to be what we call statistics.

604
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,920
And it's going to be a new table in our database.

605
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,200
And it will take a snapshot every hour.

606
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,760
It will analyze certain entities that you have.

607
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Right now, it's temperature and energy.

608
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,400
We calculate the min, the max, the mean, the sum, all that stuff.

609
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,080
And then the goal is to start generating dashboards on your energy usage

610
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,280
and to show predictions and show comparing current period,

611
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,920
current week to last week, these kind of things.

612
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,400
Now, that second part is not going to be in the next release,

613
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,640
but we're already going to start generating statistics in the next release.

614
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,520
Sounds fantastic.

615
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,600
And I'll tell you, the solar company that's doing my install,

616
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,360
it's a local one in North Carolina.

617
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,240
They want to charge me $800 for energy monitoring.

618
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,680
So I'm using the, I think SolarEdge is the manufacturer of the panels.

619
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,960
And they have a cloud API, which Home Assistant can poll every 15 minutes,

620
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,080
I think, to get the data.

621
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
But I'm like, it's in my house.

622
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,040
Why do you need to go to the cloud to get this stuff?

623
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,440
So I'm thinking I might get one of these Shelly energy monitors.

624
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,760
And then with everything you've just said, I think I might be in business.

625
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,440
No kidding, right?

626
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,960
You know, Paul, I know too, I got to speak up for the van lifers out there.

627
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,720
The Victron Venus system speaks MQTT.

628
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,960
And so I know there's guys out there that are pulling that information

629
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,120
into their Home Assistant setup as well.

630
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,360
Yeah.

631
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,320
And so we're really been looking at, or we have, I don't know if you,

632
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,960
we tweeted it from the class tweeted like two weeks ago, I think.

633
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,120
But he has already has a lot of paper mockups.

634
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,400
And he's been like playing.

635
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,640
I think he has interviewed like 20 different people.

636
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,200
And he's been really focusing on, can we kind of gamify it?

637
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,880
Where like, for example, if you know your yesterday's usage

638
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,520
and we show your today's usage, can we tell you like, hey, tone it down a little?

639
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,120
Because otherwise you're going to use more than like yesterday.

640
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,480
I've actually had an idea.

641
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,160
A friend of mine, I've just had my first kid, by the way.

642
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,920
A friend of mine was telling me they were doing that,

643
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,520
automating nap time, a light in the nursery with Home Assistant.

644
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,560
You know, certain times if the light bulb's green,

645
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,000
then the kids are allowed out of the room.

646
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,440
And if it's red, they're not.

647
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,840
I'm thinking we could play games with colored light bulbs

648
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,120
and children at this point.

649
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,640
That's where my brain's going.

650
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,280
Oh, I do it.

651
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,680
I do it.

652
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,360
That's, you know, I train my kids with a series of light changes at night for bedtime

653
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,840
and then noisemakers come on throughout the rig.

654
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,280
It's real.

655
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,160
It's brilliant.

656
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,520
I can't wait to play with that.

657
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,240
And gamifying, it feels like that's an idea that could be applied to a lot of things.

658
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,000
As somebody who uses Home Assistant to manage an off-grid setup,

659
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,880
I would love something around energy history

660
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,000
and a gamification system that would encourage the family to maybe conserve energy.

661
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,320
Because one of the things I did that really encouraged family adoption was

662
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,560
we got a fire tablet and we just put Home Assistant up on it all the time.

663
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,160
It's on the wall and it's always there so the kids can see what's going on.

664
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,520
And once I did that, it like it clicked for everybody.

665
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,240
So to get something up on that screen would, man,

666
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,560
they just take my off-grid game to like the next level.

667
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,360
Yeah, I think honestly just getting people inside in it is like step one.

668
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,840
Then all of a sudden they start to realize it's like,

669
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,760
oh, I can actually, you know, we can generate more energy than we use today.

670
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
Let's go for it, right?

671
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,560
I think that's going to be fun.

672
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,480
So my last question, I think, before we let you go is about automations.

673
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,880
This kind of goes back to the turnkey aspect, I suppose, and simplification.

674
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,000
There's been a lot of work around making the YAML automation interface

675
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,600
built into Home Assistant easier.

676
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,880
But I always find myself for the more complex things reaching for Node-RED.

677
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,200
And I wondered how you felt about people like me doing that.

678
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,960
Do you want us to all be using YAML all the time or do you not really care?

679
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,000
I don't really care.

680
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,120
In fact, I think it's great that our APIs are so generous that you can get anything out

681
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,440
that you can actually build Node-RED and do a full automation engine

682
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,440
without being part of the Home Assistant integrations.

683
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,240
And I think that, you know, each has their own.

684
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,440
And I think because Node-RED exists, we don't have to make a lot of things ourselves, right?

685
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,560
A lot of feature requests that would normally come to us are now,

686
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,080
ah, I will just use Node-RED.

687
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,720
And I just saw a pull request, I guess it's been like one and a half months ago,

688
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,040
from the maintainer of the Node-RED Home Assistant integration,

689
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,920
who makes the nodes for Node-RED.

690
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,080
And I think he's been working on getting the triggers from the Home Assistant automation

691
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,480
YAML into Node-RED as well.

692
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,640
So we have a lot of triggers that are not very accessible yet,

693
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,760
a lot of advanced triggers that are not accessible in Node-RED yet.

694
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,960
But that would allow Node-RED to use anything that a normal YAML automation can,

695
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,800
would be possible inside Node-RED, which I think is really cool because

696
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,840
all of a sudden it makes Node-RED a lot more powerful or any other automation engine.

697
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,280
And, you know, in the end, one way or the other, if you have like local control,

698
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,760
local data, we succeed.

699
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,800
Yeah, I totally agree.

700
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,360
And I think my number of input booleans could use some spring cleaning.

701
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,880
So I'm happy to hear that.

702
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,120
ProvadoVPN.com slash SSH.

703
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,840
That's P-R-I-V-A-D-O-V-P-N.com slash SSH.

704
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,080
Go there to try out Provado for free and of course support the show.

705
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,760
ProvadoVPN is a zero log VPN.

706
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,400
That means there's no records of your activity.

707
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,720
We looked into this for you guys and we wouldn't feature them unless it was this way.

708
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,960
And even in the event of a legitimate authority requesting logs associated with your activity

709
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,480
when connected to Provado, they got nothing to give.

710
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,360
And even better, they're backed by Swiss privacy laws.

711
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,160
In addition to having that strict zero log policy, ProvadoVPN is based in Switzerland.

712
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,000
That means you're protected by the absolute strongest consumer privacy laws

713
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,720
in the world.

714
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,200
And Provado has the tech where it matters.

715
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,560
They own and operate their own data centers and fiber lines.

716
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,880
And the network is composed of hundreds of servers physically located in 45 countries

717
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,040
and 58 cities around the world.

718
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,280
What that means for you is you can connect in seconds and no matter what server you choose,

719
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,480
you're going to get incredibly fast speeds every time you connect.

720
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,800
ProvadoVPN's network was built from the ground up and fully optimized for lightning fast speed.

726
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,280
And they also have an unlimited plan with hundreds of servers,

727
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,600
P2P traffic support and more.

728
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,240
So go check it all out at ProvadoVPN.com.ssh.

729
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,560
So I mean, if you buy a Chromecast or whatever,

730
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,080
then sometimes you have to like connect to an access point and then like your phone.

731
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,280
And then sometimes it crashes and you're like lost and you don't know how to set up the Wi-Fi.

732
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,760
So we're building a Bluetooth spec that is going to be built into ESP home.

733
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,520
It's going to be built into the Home Assistant apps.

734
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,320
So if you buy it, well, I mean, if eventually we hope you're going to be

735
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,760
able to buy ESP home products.

736
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,600
But if you build an ESP home product and you give it to your friend,

737
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,760
they will just be able to go on with Bluetooth.

738
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,040
And we even have a web Bluetooth SDK, so you can use like a Chrome browser

739
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,720
to actually just set it up.

740
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,640
Oh, that is cool.

741
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,640
Yeah, right.

742
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,040
And I mean, I think I really want like, you know, they're like on tindy.

743
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,640
People are selling their creations.

744
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,920
I just want like more of that because those products are way cooler.

745
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,920
Like, it's just like, you know, we had the tech reader last year

746
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,360
and there's like actually for the energy meters in the Netherlands,

747
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,400
they actually have a protocol called P1.

748
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,120
And we're going to have an ESP home based device somebody's building

749
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,640
that like, you know, people can just plug it in and boom,

750
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,040
all the energy data is available in Home Assistant.

751
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,320
So I'm sure you do.

752
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,080
But do you realize just how perfectly positioned you are to uniquely so to do this?

753
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,720
No, no, definitely, definitely.

754
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,080
It's because, you know, ESP home, like we acquired it.

755
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,080
Maybe because like the original founder was like burned out and,

756
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,720
but he was still getting like all these donations, right?

757
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,960
So we couldn't really say, hey, we're going to hire somebody full time to make this great.

758
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,280
So we acquired it from him.

759
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,320
We have now Jesse working on a full time and like, you know, just we keep,

760
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,760
you know, pumping out cool stuff.

761
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,800
Yeah, a full time employee is going to, you know, they've got some time to fill.

762
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,800
You know, it's, yeah, well, the thing is, because we're so big, like, you know,

763
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,720
we are 13 people full time now.

764
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,080
And yeah, thanks.

765
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,440
Lucky 13.

766
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,400
But the thing is, they work all over the place, right?

767
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Like we have the operating system guy, we have the supervisor people,

768
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,920
we have the front end people.

769
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,080
And so we're actually very thinly spread because there's just so much happening.

770
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,600
For sure.

771
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,040
Yeah, yeah, it's both a lot of people from when you started at one,

772
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,840
but it's also not a lot of people for the scope of work there is out there.

773
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,320
Exactly.

774
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,480
Can you even imagine how many people, you know, a commercial entity,

775
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,640
let's just hypothetically say you are owned by EA or some,

776
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,120
some massive conglomerate like that, right?

777
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,800
How many people would they employ to write a piece of software like Home Assistant?

778
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,000
And it's just, to me, that speaks to the power of open source, right?

779
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,600
I mean, we definitely couldn't, we couldn't have things in the world like Home Assistant

780
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,640
without open source.

781
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,920
So, no, I think so.

782
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:07,200
I mean, there's just, you know, we, if you, we get people from like all over the place

783
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,000
that are brilliant programmers, but they have their day jobs.

784
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,160
And like, you know, it's, it's funny.

785
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,600
We have a couple of people.

786
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,920
One is a CEO of a company.

787
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,160
The other is like a director of software engineering.

788
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,320
So he's like a manager and like, they just don't get to code at work anymore, right?

789
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,360
So they come home and they're like, well, yeah, absolutely.

790
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:27,680
I agree.

791
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:33,040
And also those sorts of people who have had a lot of training in programming and stuff

792
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,320
like that in the past.

793
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,480
They've got a lot that they can bring to the table, but their motivation might be sporadic

794
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,280
and, you know, it's not really suitable to do a full-time job that way, but absolutely

795
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,360
can contribute, you know, a couple of weeks worth of evenings of your brain to an open

796
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,400
source project.

797
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,560
Well, that, I mean, that's how our core was originally all on threads and like we had

798
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,240
like deadlocks all the time.

799
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,320
And then somebody came along who was, who works in Mozilla and he had a lot of Python

800
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,880
experience.

801
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,600
He made like pylons in the past and yeah, he, he rewrote our core to async and that's

802
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,640
what we still run today.

803
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,760
And that's why we're so fast.

804
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,800
So that's just a random guy that came along.

805
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,400
You know what else I love as well about the number of people you've just shared work

806
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,920
from Nebuchadnezzar is the fact that that means that somebody like a Mozilla isn't

807
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,200
needed to come out and buy you out to keep you sustainable.

808
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,880
It's, it's a self-sustaining funding model you've created here.

809
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,920
I think that's great too.

810
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,280
No, it's been really great.

811
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,240
I think, you know, we have no investors and no loans and these kind of stuff because it

812
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,000
misaligns incentives, right?

813
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,160
Just, you know, they want like return on investment.

814
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:41,680
Yeah.

815
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,600
I mean, it's, it's, it's working great so far.

816
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,600
I mean, I expect as the pandemic like wheeze off that maybe people are spending less time

817
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,240
at home, maybe spending less time on home assistance, who knows?

818
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,960
But they might need remote access.

819
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,760
That's you know, I mean, I, I happily, happily pay that because I think it's a, not only

820
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,320
is it a fantastic service and I like how you are implementing it, but I also appreciate

821
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,440
sort of the virtuous cycle of it incentivizes the company to make home assistance better,

822
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,320
which just continues to drive more value to my subscription.

823
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,320
And it, it's legitimately one of those arrangements that I happily pay.

824
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,360
That's awesome.

825
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:19,600
Yeah.

826
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:19,840
Same.

827
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,040
I don't really need it.

828
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,640
I could quite happily set up my own reverse proxy with WireGuard and I used to, and then

829
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,920
Nebu Kassek came along.

830
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,000
That's the origin of the name, by the way, that, that word Nebu is, is quite unusual.

831
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,520
So Nebu is, it was some God of the wisdom in some, somewhere in some religion or language.

832
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,960
And so then we had like the word, yeah.

833
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,680
Okay.

834
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,280
I like it.

835
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,000
And then we also have the URL, nebu.kassek, right?

836
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,840
Cause that actually, we, we kind of set it on Nebu and then I was looking at domains

837
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,720
and all of a sudden I said Nebu Kassek and I was like, that's it.

838
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,920
So it's essentially comes down to Wise House.

839
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,280
Is that a trade?

840
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,000
That's great.

841
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,560
That is good.

842
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:00,800
Yeah.

843
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,000
And now we're, we're waiting.

844
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,200
Razer had a smartwatch called Nebu in 2015 or 16 or something.

845
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,720
I was just waiting for their trademark to lapse and then maybe we can

846
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,440
Get a little more, a little more mileage out of that name.

847
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,320
That's great.

848
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,040
I mean, I know, I know lawyers are, have a reputation, but can you confuse a house

849
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,200
automation system and a watch?

850
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,760
You know, smartwatches, smartwatches you can talk to nowadays.

851
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,080
And so, yeah.

852
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,520
Who wants to even worry about a fight?

853
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,640
Why just, yeah.

854
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:32,880
Yeah.

855
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,040
But boss, thank you so much for joining us and updating in on these things.

856
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,840
And also thank you and thanks to the team for making a piece of software

857
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,440
that has improved my family's quality of life on a daily basis.

858
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,120
I just, not much actually touches our lives in that way.

859
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,640
So we're just really grateful for that too.

860
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:50,960
Awesome.

861
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,600
Well, you're welcome.

862
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,880
So I hope you enjoyed that interview with Paulus.

863
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,040
Now we're not going to actually do any feedback this week, just in the interest of time.

864
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,760
But next episode, we're going to discuss the

865
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,400
distributed file system question that Chris posed last week.

866
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,680
We've had lots of feedback in the mailbag about that one.

867
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,040
Oh, I can't wait to see what people have suggested.

868
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,760
I feel like I'd be cheating if I read ahead, but now I kind of want to go in there and take a look.

869
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,240
But I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for the show.

870
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,000
So that way my reaction is fresh.

871
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,560
Awesome.

872
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:22,800
Yeah.

873
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,800
If you have any tips, selfhosted.show slash contact on how you could take advantage

874
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,200
of the random amounts of free space on the hard drives all around your land.

875
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,120
And thank you to our members at selfhosted.show slash SRE.

876
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,640

877
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,280
And you get a limited ad feed, full production, just a little bit tighter and cleaner.

878
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,160
Extra content at the end of the show as well with a special members only post show.

879
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,080
And thanks to our sponsor, a Cloud Guru.

880
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
You can find them on social media everywhere.

881
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,920
That's basically a social media site.

882
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,000
They're just slash a Cloud Guru.

883
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,960
That's really simple.

884
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,040
And as always, you can find me over on Twitter at ironicbadger.

885
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,320

886
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,720
Indeed.

887
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,600
I'm over on the Twitter as well at Chris Ellis.

888
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,840
And the podcast is over there too at self-hosted show for news and announcements.

889
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,880
Thanks for listening everybody.

890
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:33,440
