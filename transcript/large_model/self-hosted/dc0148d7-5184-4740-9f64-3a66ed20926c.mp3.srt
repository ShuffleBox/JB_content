1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
Think I've come upon the most American thing I buy on a regular basis that I should introduce you to is it a gun

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,000
Related item. Well, you could definitely hold your gun. They're 511 tactical pants

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,720
Tactical pants Alex all of the pockets you could ever need so, you know how you were saying you want to go on a walk

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,400
But you don't like to bring your phone. It's because you need a pair of tactical pants

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,040
They have pockets in places that distribute the weight so that you don't even feel it big old phones

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,120
Like the big old phones you get all go in the tactical pants. You need to try some of these

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,880
They're not that expensive

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,480
Hashtag no sponsor. I'll put a link in the show notes

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,720
What are they made out of though? Because I thought a lot of these tactical I can't say it tactical trousers

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,760
I can't say I can't I can't call them pants these tactical trousers

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,600
They they're often made out of the same material as like a sail, you know, like in a sailboat or something

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,880
Sure, like really thick. Yeah real thick doesn't doesn't wrinkle, man

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:04,100
These are constructed using a premium polyester cotton mechanical stretch tactile rip strop fabric. I don't know what that is

14
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,680
Sounds like a fancy marketing term to me it is but it's really great

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,440
I just I gotta say plus the other thing if you're like me they have elastic in the way

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,040
So it expands and detracts with you

17
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,120
Because that's something I'm always doing. Anyways, I'm just saying try it out. They're only 30 bucks

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,860
Are they revolutionary and were they made with courage mine were I don't know about yours

19
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,140
So I just think with your big phones. I think I think you'd appreciate it. I just one one American

20
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,660
Bit of life that I've adopted is tactical pants. Okay, I quite like I mean, you know in Raleigh over here

21
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,780
I need I need shorts from like March. I've been in perma shorts, which is lovely speaking of that

22
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,740
I just had a chance to see you you and I just got back from visiting

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,420
Wendell in Lexington and it was fantastic. We did some road tripping

24
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:58,900
It was a lot of fun. And we had a chance to really kind of look at business setups small and medium-sized business setups

25
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:04,620
So Wendell does some contracting and one of the things that he does for his clients is he backs up parts of their infrastructure

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,800
On his own. So if they're in the cloud, he'll back it up locally. And if they're local he'll back it up to the cloud

27
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,860
Well, we thought maybe we should chat about some lower cost setups today

28
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,900
Because this is an area that I have recently got into I used to be a

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,220
Build it as big and powerful as possible kind of guy, you know, I go to Unix surplus

30
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,980
I got a huge super micro box put all of the Xeons put all of the RAM put all of the disk in there and

31
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,840
Fire it up. You sent me the best text this week

32
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,180
Alex I've accidentally ordered to service

33
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,140
This is I really had a moment

34
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:46,100
I saw the Raspberry Pi 4 shows up on my doorstep in an envelope and I'm just thinking well my server shut up in an

35
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:52,100
Envelope, that's just that's just something else. I'm I'm picturing Steve Jobs MacBook Air manila envelope moment here, right?

36
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,860
Yeah, and I so I rip open the envelope and I realized there's two raspberry pies in there

37
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:04,020
And then I really was floored because not only had my home server been delivered in an envelope

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,600
But I had accidentally ordered two of them and I wasn't financially ruined

39
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,020
You know years ago I could spend for a client or for wherever I worked easily spend

40
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,100
$15,000 on an x86 rack mountable server

41
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:26,340
Easily sure. I mean even if you're looking at used enterprise gear the minimum price of entry is going to be three or four hundred dollars

42
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,420
I would have thought

43
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,220
Like an old think station maybe or you know anything with a Z on in it sure, you know

44
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,540
you can build them for two to fifty but

45
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,700
It's gonna be a bit of a potato at that point, right?

46
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,300
Well depending how you do it you could probably for well under a grand get a decent NUC setup with some storage

47
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,900
So there's a lot of ways you can go about this, but I actually am doing something kind of special

48
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,060
Little excited to announce here on the show that I'm beginning a new personal project

49
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,220
I am so serious about this that I'm actually taking time off throughout the rest of the year to work on this project and do little

50
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,020
Bits, it's called project off-grid. Well, you know, it's serious when it has a name. I know I've named it

51
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,660
As long time listeners will know I've got a I've got a 40-foot RV

52
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:16,140
That over the years I've been I've been experimenting with I've had a QNAP NAS in there

53
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,140
I've tried different things and I've really come to

54
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:26,180
This idea that I want to build a system where I can go completely off-grid and I've set myself some goals

55
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:32,460
But it starts at at the tech level. I want all of my home automation to be completely on the LAN

56
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,980
No cloud connectivity required because I often travel places that don't have connectivity now

57
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,300
That's an important thing right is not required. Although there are will be optional components

58
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,940
Which will interface with cloud services on occasion, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah hundred percent. Yeah

59
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,540
Yeah

60
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:55,020
It's sort of like it's sort of like I'll come back online and I'll sort of soak up the things that I needed

61
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,540
Maybe it's media files or articles and then and then as I drive down the road

62
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,700
I can sync those offline and then when I get to my destination, they'll be available for me

63
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:10,680
So this includes things like offline readers offline media and it means getting things like sensors and all of these that work on the LAN

64
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,020
But it also needs to be because it's in a very small living space. It needs to be quiet

65
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,420
It needs to be low power. In fact, ideally one day even run entirely off of DC which

66
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:28,200
Eventually would be powered by solar all part of this project. It's a multi-phase project this project off-grid

67
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,920
Currently, I'm trying to solve this traveling without signal issue

68
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,320
Also, I'm often double netted either by a campground or even just the ISP

69
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:45,080
I have in my hometown. I'm I'm on a 192 network all the time. It's horrible. It is so limiting

70
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,720
So that's why I'm gonna do a wire guard relay server, but we'll get to that in the future

71
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
because you have a really

72
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,560
interesting

73
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,720
Like life problem to solve here

74
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,660
I mean most of us most of our houses don't drive down the freeway and suffer a was it

75
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,860
A category 5 earthquake every time it does. Yeah, I think it's actually 4.7 on the Richter scales

76
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,540
What they say the scale category is hurricanes. Sorry, bro

77
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,900
Yeah, most of us don't have to deal with that

78
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,900
So I think it's a really unique set of challenges you're gonna have to deal with but on top of that

79
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:21,540
I've just solved my house in London. So I'm gonna be buying a house in America next year at some point

80
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,060
So a lot of these things that you're gonna solve

81
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,900
I'm just gonna lift and shift and copy and paste those into my my house solar is on my list

82
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:34,620
For example, I want to do some DIY Tesla Powerwall style stuff with old laptop batteries and things

83
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,740
So that that should be a lot of fun

84
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,260
But I'm really curious about this setup from a networking standpoint

85
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,620
So as it stands today you get your internet through a little antenna on your roof that comes from a hillside

86
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,480
Like two miles away, right? Yeah. Yeah, it's a wisp

87
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,780
So in my main what you could consider a home base where I've spent the most of my time and I have like full

88
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:04,660
Hookups and everything. I have a monthly ISP. That's just a local ISP that comes in over a wireless link

89
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,660
It's a decent. It's like a 15 megabit up and down connection

90
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,440
So it's not amazing but I can get things in and off my LAN at reasonable speeds

91
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,460
That thing comes into something that you tipped me off to that. I think it's a pretty great little device

92
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,220
It's the GL AR

93
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:29,140
750 s gigabit AC travel router. It's tiny or it's also called the slate. It's another term for it

94
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,300
It's about the size of a pack of playing cards. I would say maybe a little bit bigger, but not much

95
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,420
it's certainly in the same ballpark as a Raspberry Pi in a case and

96
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, this thing I tipped you off because I I stupidly left my predecessor to this in a hotel room in Florida last month

97
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,540
So I had to buy a replacement and this this little travel router is is wicked, right?

98
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:59,420
It has several cool features, but it supports out-of-the-box. No custom phone ways required wire guard. Mm-hmm

99
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,960
Huge as things run in an open WRT. It has wire guard support plus it has

100
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,500
BGN and AC 802 11 and

101
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,460
3 gigabit network ports. So here's my use case for this device. I

102
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,220
I'm traveling a fair bit. So I'm going around different hotels and things like that and I use this thing to

103
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,980
Make the captive portal experience less painful

104
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,420
so when I get to a hotel

105
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,300
I'll plug this little device into a USB battery bank or a wall charger or whatever it might be

106
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,300
it doesn't really need much power and

107
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,780
Then I will connect to the SS ID that this little box spits out

108
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,980
When I do that, I can connect to a local IP address, which I think is 192 168 8.1

109
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:53,080
That's the subnet by default that it has I then log into the admin interface of this little travel router thing and

110
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,260
Then go into what's called the Wi-Fi repeater section

111
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,620
And when you do that

112
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,980
What you're able to do is actually look at all the SS IDs are broadcast in the place that you're in

113
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:10,380
Select the one that you want the router to associate with and then perform the captive portal on your laptop as if you were

114
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:18,060
Connected directly to the access point and that has a few benefits because it means devices that don't support captive portals natively

115
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:25,940
will pick up that authentication token via the router because it's the router effectively that's authenticated via its MAC address and

116
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,140
Then it also means that hotels that try nickel and dime you through a two device limit

117
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,340
I can connect 20 30 40 not that I have that of course

118
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:41,660
But you know, I have five or six devices when I travel sometimes between my wife and I and a two device limits

119
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,140
Just so annoying and this little device gets me around it

120
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,280
But to add to all that as well when you add in a VPN support at the router level

121
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,060
It means that any traffic that traverses through that device

122
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:01,820
Then goes through a VPN as well. So most hotel Wi-Fi is open and leaky and

123
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,500
This device just solves that problem perfectly. So it supports open VPN and wire guard

124
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:14,820
So whatever your flavor is you can make it work with this device that wire guard supports a big deal for me because I'm often

125
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
on what I consider

126
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,460
Untrustworthy lands campground Wi-Fi is very commonly just sort of thrown together

127
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,700
it's it's one flat LAN everybody just has at it and

128
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:34,020
Being able to isolate my systems from that as well as use wire guard to protect the traffic is really nice

129
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,900
So I have it in

130
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:42,380
My standard home base mode. It's going into that wireless ISP over Ethernet

131
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,300
It actually is you know, it comes off the back of the antenna as Ethernet that goes into the slate and that's how I'm using

132
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,780
It right now

133
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:54,180
But when I travel I use that Wi-Fi repeater mode to either connect to a MiFi and I will just choose

134
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,300
Whichever MiFi has the best signal and then I just connect it to that or campground Wi-Fi and it's

135
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,640
Surprisingly fast the specs of it aren't incredible. It it has a

136
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,240
775 megahertz CPU, but

137
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,120
you know open wrt doesn't need much and

138
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,860
I've offloaded some of the larger network tasks to other devices, which I'll talk about here in a moment

139
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,300
But it's pretty neat and again, it's DC

140
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:25,420
So everything in my setup right now, although a lot of them are using AC to DC adapters, but all of them are

141
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,820
Capable of doing just straight DC in the future because I essentially have a power wall built into my RV

142
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:37,060
I've got two lithium ion batteries right now, which will last me about 16 hours

143
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,740
It's amazing, but I plan to double that in in the future. Maybe when I go to solar

144
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:48,740
So I could maybe get you know quite a bit of time and if I can save that cost of converting to AC

145
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,100
I'll get even more time I can go off-grid

146
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,580
Yeah, little 5 volt USB. I think it's it micro USB. It is all it needs

147
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,140
It's great. And you know, it's so this this little box has a couple of other tricks up its sleeve

148
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,480
It has three gigabit ports on the back

149
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,920
Two of them are designated as LAN ports out the box. And the third is what's called a one port. So

150
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,800
The example I gave in a hotel where you connect over a repeater to the Wi-Fi

151
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,740
you just plug in an Ethernet cable and you can then use this router as a

152
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,640
Wi-Fi to

153
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Ethernet adapter if you like. Oh, yeah

154
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,920
Also has a USB port on the side

155
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,840
So you could plug in a USB modem or an Android phone and use that to tether via this device to all of your other devices

156
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,120
And then the last trick that it has up its sleeve is it has a micro SD slot in the side of it

157
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,720
Additionally, it comes with a really easy to use GUI, but they include a more advanced power user GUI

158
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,960
That's just in the advanced section. So they don't they don't bury it

159
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,540
And then on top of that you can turn on SSH and then you're on the command line and you can do anything

160
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,760
So it's not limited either. It looks like a very bootstrap kind of UI to me. So it's it's quite modern. It's responsive

161
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,000
yeah, so this device I think I paid about 60 or 70 dollars for it and

162
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,520
We'll have a link to it in the show notes

163
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,360
It's a really great pickup to be honest

164
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,480
And I think I'm gonna try and keep hold of this one and not leave it in a hotel this time

165
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,060
Yeah, yeah, I really like it

166
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,500
I have had some compatibility issues with an AT&T MiFi where the MiFi would crash

167
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,480
But when I switched it over to use the 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi, it seemed to get a little bit better

168
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,280
So just test it but I love it and I'm keeping it. It's part of my network arsenal now

169
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,680
So that's I've got that set up and then I have a Wi-Fi system that I need to replace

170
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,280
Eventually, but we can save Wi-Fi for a future episode because it it works right now

171
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,680
What do you use at the moment? Can we name and shame it? I I really like it

172
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,520
So I don't want to shame it. It just has a fatal flaw

173
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,760
So I got before Amazon purchased them. I got the Eero system the Eero

174
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,900
Oh, mm-hmm. It's fatal flaw is that it does require some level of cloud connectivity

175
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:15,240
Occasionally to function properly. Is that not true of the ubiquity stuff as well? Because I know that I have to run my

176
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,320
ubiquity controller in a container and

177
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,560
To configure the access points. I mean I have never left it offline for more than a few days

178
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Is that true of the arrow too?

179
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,560
Well, so here's the way it works with the arrow and that's why it's a fatal fall

180
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,800
Like what you're talking about can be from like a licensing check-in or stuff like that

181
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,440
But with the arrow if it loses its state for some reason and it loses power

182
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,300
Which can happen when I'm say switching from one power source to another every now and then there's a hit to the system

183
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,480
maybe I'm going from generator to battery or from shore to battery and

184
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,960
That brief interruption can sometimes reset systems when that happens in some situations

185
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,060
If arrow cannot contact their cloud servers, it won't start the LAN

186
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,400
Why what possible reason could they have for that because it assumes its state is invalid

187
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,680
Because there's some there's some signing that has to happen between the communication of the head unit and the nodes

188
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,000
And when that signing can't be verified, it doesn't start up the LAN as a safety measure

189
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,460
Safety, right? I'm not buying that. I'm sorry. It's just a telemetry thing. If ever I heard of it

190
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:30,040
I knew this going in I knew was a bad call, but it is truly the fastest most reliable most problem-free

191
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,160
Wi-Fi I have ever used so going forward

192
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,920
It's the Wi-Fi systems I'll buy for all of my family

193
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,560
Like if like as a Christmas gift if they need Wi-Fi every now and then like every like five years

194
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,200
I'll do this. This is what I'm getting them and Amazon's bringing the price down even more now. It's so bulletproof

195
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,800
However, I got to go with something that's offline and the and the funny thing is the RV has a lot of interference

196
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,320
So I actually need a two node system to get great signal everywhere to do video streaming

197
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,840
It's bulletproof unless your internet goes out and then you're screwed

198
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,140
So, okay, I wasn't gonna go down that rabbit hole, but you made me do it

199
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,480
But it's it's it's otherwise a good system, but it eventually has to get replaced if I'm gonna go off-grid

200
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:13,040
But right now for the last few months almost coming on month three. I have I have gone down the route of

201
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,580
Decloudifying the RV and bringing everything on to a single Raspberry Pi

202
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:25,900
Of which I run home assistant smoke ping duplicati sync thing

203
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,980
Plex and

204
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,980
ranteo

205
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,180
Alright, so let's put let's break these down one by one

206
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:39,020
The one that stands out to me is being like a huh is plex because doesn't that need big CPU to transcode stuff

207
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,740
I am taking advantage of the of

208
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:47,940
Raspbian on the Raspberry Pi 4 and it does have hardware decoding and there is there is support now in plex for for that

209
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,660
But when you're just talking three televisions and a max of six users ever it's really

210
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:01,140
Surprisingly not that bad the Raspberry Pi has more overhead than you'd think with all of those services running on that

211
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,460
I'm around eight percent

212
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:11,140
CPU usage and then when I'm maybe doing like last night I was doing a docker compose update

213
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
watching Star Trek the original series

214
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,360
Blu-ray rip off of the Raspberry Pi plex direct play I assume a to an NVIDIA shield

215
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,060
So I'm pretty positive was direct play as well as doing package updates after the docker stuff was done

216
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,060
Like I was doing all of that on the host system

217
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,080
While also watching plex and I was tearing down a container as well

218
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,240
So I was doing quite a bit and it was really holding its own

219
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,920
The the biggest bottleneck is really the SD card

220
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,160
It makes all of the difference to spend a little bit more on that SD card. It really makes a difference

221
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,600
So I was experimenting during a lot recording this week with with my pi 4 and I copied the root

222
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,240
Directory so just slash like the bottom of root using our sink

223
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,280
I think I did was our sink tack AVX or something like that

224
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,080
And then you do slash and then the target of the SS USB SSD that I had attached

225
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,760
And I noticed that when I was doing package updates and stuff like that

226
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,840
It wasn't it wasn't night and day, you know, like going from a mechanical hard drive to an SSD was like, whoa

227
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,080
Holy moly, this is I'm never going back to spinning rust as my boot drive

228
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,520
It wasn't quite as night and day as I'd hoped on there

229
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,920
But you are right that the SD card is the major bottleneck at this point

230
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,680
Mm-hmm, and you can't yet USB boot the pie fully

231
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,640
So I must I must make it clear that my slash boot was still on the SD card

232
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,560
Even though slash was actually on the SSD, but yeah running you're running

233
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,600
What this is that six or seven six different containers that are fairly active really?

234
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,480
I mean they I mean including there's a couple of things on the host system like Samba and net data that aren't in containers

235
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,240
And only 8% CPU usage. I remember on the first pie

236
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:00,000
Trying to run. What was it called? XBMC with I think was RAS BMC with Sam Nazarko back in the day and

237
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,680
You know trying to run just a single HD video stream

238
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,640
It was so bad. The CPU was just pegged and I had the MPEG 2 decoder license

239
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
I paid extra for and it was just pegged

240
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,680
And yeah, we've come a long way with these pies how um, so I have a question for you about how warm

241
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,360
That your pies getting yeah, there's that so I think a couple of caveats here

242
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,400
I've gone with the flirt cases for my pies

243
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,520
And not only because I think it's a really sturdy case, but because it has some thermal management built in it

244
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,600
It comes with thermal paste and then the case actually makes contact with the CPU and that thermal paste and it acts as a heat

245
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,040
spreader and

246
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,040
I've watched a few reviews on YouTube and it you know brings it down an actual measurable noticeable worthwhile amount

247
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,520
I'm also using the flicker case and the whole thing is made out of well

248
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,320
The side of it is made out of aluminum

249
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:57,040
Machined aluminum and the uh, the inside of the case actually dips down to touch the CPU with a thermal pad

250
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,480
Yeah, that's a better way to put it

251
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,720
Yeah, and then the top and bottom are made out of this kind of soft touch rubber material and the case itself was 15 bucks

252
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,920
Which I paid 15 for a lego case a few years ago. So, you know price wise it's it's for what you're getting

253
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,360
It's fantastic. It takes the raspberry pi which on its own naked to sort of fit into the case

254
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,520
The raspberry pi which on its own naked just sort of feels like a hobbyist toy

255
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,800
And you put it in this case and now it feels like a premium consumer product

256
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,320
so I did that to help reduce heat also a big part of this is um,

257
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,080
I I really think having the ethernet on its own bus

258
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,680
And and having the network separate now from the disk made it wasn't just the cpu

259
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,560
But that was the other piece that made this really doable for me

260
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,480
gigabit is

261
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,520
Closer now to full gigabit than it ever has been but also when you're doing network traffic

262
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,640
It's not polluting the usb bus, which is where with a pie the majority of your storage is going to live

263
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:02,000
So yeah, I totally agree with that now, um in your list of applications. You mentioned something called ranteo. I've never heard of this

264
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,040
What is it?

265
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,700
Oh boy, this is one of those life-changing

266
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,200
Applications that I found uh-oh. It's like i've finally come home

267
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,480
I'm I finally have a note system

268
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,520
That truly works for me and it's fully offline

269
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
It supports markdown

270
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,520
I can bang out notes in any old dirty text editor. I want or I have a web ui

271
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:36,080
Hallelujah, this is changing my life and the secret that really brought it to the next level was when I combined it with sync thing

272
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Oh, man. Oh

273
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,160
Oh alex, this is such a game changer for me sync thing, huh?

274
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,960
Not next cloud sync, you know, it's neck

275
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,120
There's so many ways you can skin this cat really so that's perfectly acceptable if nextcloud works for you have at it

276
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,760
I I use nextcloud for my work stuff. I wanted

277
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,920
um something that was totally offline available as text in the rv at all times because i'm going to put

278
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,320
maintenance logs in there

279
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,160
Information about repairs all the documentation for my network

280
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,320
Uh family notes that hidea and I need to keep track of like doctor's names all that

281
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
I want to have available offline

282
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,000
And the way my brain works if I can dump out something in text i'm much more likely to capture it

283
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
And I prefer to use an actual text editor

284
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,520
So rantio or however you say it rantio, whatever it is is a

285
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
very simple web ui

286
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,200
That sits on top of a directory structure of markdown files

287
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,480
You can create arbitrary directories. You can just add markdown files. You can add markdown files to the root

288
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,360
And it will render and display it like notes

289
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,240
No database no database just flat files. That's great

290
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,600
That's where sync thing comes in because then I sync those flat files to a notes folder on all my systems

291
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,000
And wherever i'm at whenever something pops in my head

292
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,600
I just toss in that notes folder and then it's on my rv either when it comes back online or like right now

293
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
It's online. So it's just synced up immediately

294
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,720
And then when I want to retrieve it or more importantly when I want high spousal approval factor for retrieving information

295
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,520
It's got a nice web ui on top of it. I don't know why notes is such a difficult problem to solve

296
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,680
It seems to me that evernote solved it a long time ago

297
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,960
But you have to pay for that and it's a cloud service, right?

298
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,760
But in terms of the self-hosted space for note taking there's a few options

299
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,120
So there's joplin there's nextcloud has a notes thing built right in

300
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,320
I mean you could use git if you wanted to I mean literally the the options are endless

301
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,360
but I think a couple of things that you mentioned really

302
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,960
Spiked my interest and one of those is there's no database. So it's a flat file structure

303
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,600
A lot of apps seem to miss that fact because I want my notes to remain

304
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,540
agnostic to the application

305
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,520
Which they were written in or for or synced by also a perfectly usable

306
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,280
Uh scenario for me would be issh into my server and I just cat the file to get a quick like command

307
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
I need to copy or something totally

308
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,160
Uh, and then also I guess you could back it up with git and it still remains viewable by rantao or whatever it is

309
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,160
Does it support like rich stuff like pictures or screenshots or stuff like that?

310
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,600
Yep, it has a content folder and you can toss it has content

311
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,120
That's where you toss the markdowns and has images and that's where you toss the images and then you just you know

312
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,400
You link back one folder and it just it figures it out. It's really easy

313
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Well, you might have gone and done it you might have gone and found it

314
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,240
I think i've reached peak services to pie. Um a

315
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,120
It's now becoming a little mission critical and b

316
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,800
If any one of those were to go haywire could slow down the other so I think i'm going to stop about there

317
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,680
And now i'm going to go to a second pie and my plan is to go to three pies total

318
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,760
No more than three

319
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,520
And you're not going to run kubernetes on those and do some fun stuff with that

320
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,960
I might let you talk me into that in the future. I might we could

321
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,520
I need to buy a couple so I can figure it out first and then make myself look clever by telling you

322
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,320
Great good plan. I put my so I put my second pie into production last night

323
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,360
This will be a dedicated network services pie. So this now runs pie hole

324
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,120
And I may move smoke ping and a couple other just like network level infrastructure things to that pie

325
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,520
Smoke ping is pretty cool. You put me onto this way before you knew who I was

326
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,400
Um with the last episode about five or six years ago

327
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,400
And it was actually one of the first containers that linux server did back in the day

328
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,760
Such a good app you get the best insights and for me

329
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,840
It's really interesting to see how the different networks that I go to perform

330
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,120
I go to bed and I wake up in the morning. I check smoke ping and I go. Ah, okay. It's gonna be one of those days

331
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,560
Now there's another one that's actually come onto the scene fairly recently called stat ping

332
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:55,680
Um, so I have it running on a digital ocean droplet and I I use it to monitor things like service uptime. It's like a

333
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,340
Alert genie ops genie type thing where it will ping a certain ip over either tcp or http

334
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
And just tell you whether the service is up or down

335
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,560
You can also use it to communicate with family members that there is planned maintenance coming on the plex server for example, which can be nice

336
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,680
so

337
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,120
you know if some if i'm needing to swap out a hard drive or um

338
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,840
Um blow dust out of a fan or something and turn the server off for a half an hour

339
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,240
I can just put a note into stat ping to say server off between these times

340
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,160
Don't message me about this thing because it's it's not an accident

341
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,280
The other really cool thing about stat ping is it's a really quick way to see the last time a service had an issue

342
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,680
because it just tells you right there when you load the page the last time this went down was at this time and date and

343
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,880
We use that here in the in the studio to check on our services

344
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,280
If you want to see a quick demo, you can go to status.ktz.cloud. That's mine

345
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,960
And you can have a little look at that. Um, so what else you got on that list?

346
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,440
You've got home assistant, which I think definitely deserves its own episode. Yes

347
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,880
That's the primary function of the pi 4 really but duplicati. What are you using that for?

348
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm using that to back up my docker compose files and my config files and a little bit of data

349
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,800
to both dropbox and google drive

350
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,280
I don't really use either one of those very much

351
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,640
But this is kind of an I have you know amounts of storage in each one of them and we're talking text files here

352
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,200
So it does a aes 256 encryption. It, you know wraps it all up into into a nice locally encrypted

353
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:31,280
A bit bit of bundles essentially and then sends it up to the cloud and um, does it every single night?

354
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,600
So if I make just even the smallest line change, I make sure that gets captured and sent off site

355
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,680
I really like duplicati. I've been using it for over a year over here as well

356
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:45,840
And it's it's pretty bulletproof. I mean the error message can error messages can sometimes be a little bit

357
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:53,680
Vague but for the most part, it's it's pretty great and I use it to back up terabytes worth of data to google drive. So it's um,

358
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,040
Pretty good

359
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,560
I was considering putting my docker compose folders in the sync thing and then just syncing them to different folders on my laptop

360
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,280
And then doing the changes there. I have to say when you're working with docker compose

361
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:12,480
Which we'll talk about more in jupyter extras in the near future. We're going to do some container essentials in a future jupyter extras

362
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,480
So extras dot show for that, but I have to say when i'm working with docker compose files

363
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:23,600
Visual studio code blew my mind. I opened up the yaml file. It's like oh, hey, I noticed this looks like a docker compose file

364
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Would you like me to load docker support?

365
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,800
And then it it really helps with identifying where things need to go in the yaml file because if you just have it on

366
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
The wrong indent

367
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,360
It'll break docker compose and it won't launch and so this gives you a visual guide when you're kind of new to yaml

368
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,200
It's it's very nice. That's one of the primary complaints. I hear about yaml as a file structure is

369
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,560
People don't seem to like the tabs

370
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,960
Although without structure, there's no order and without order. It's just chaos. So yeah, quit whining because

371
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,440
Yaml's amazing and i'm not i'm not listening. It's readable, right? It's at least readable. It's better than json

372
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,840
It's better than json. Yes, which is the alternative. So yes very much

373
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,280
So down the road, uh

374
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,800
Which we'll do a future episode on I plan to set up my third and last pie

375
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,400
As a shinobi local camera capture because I have a couple of cameras in the rv now they go off to cloud storage

376
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
It's no good. It's going to go local

377
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,360
Um, but that's down the road. There are a couple of caveats. I want to make clear to people

378
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,880
I would not be able to do what i'm doing with raspberry pies

379
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,240
If I didn't have a big old x86 rig here in the studio doing some of my heavy lifting

380
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,600
Now that could have easily been a droplet or a linode vps. It doesn't have to be a local box

381
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,100
But for me some of the large job extraction and data processing

382
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,920
Is happening on the studio land and then i'm just syncing the essential bits that I need to the rv

383
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:55,200
And the storage too because you know a usb two and a half inch hard drives limited to about four terabytes, I think

384
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,840
Let's say I mean you could maybe have half a dozen on the pie, which is still impressive

385
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,240
Granted, but it's not it's not going to match what you can put into a big x86 box, right with spinning disks

386
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,360
That are you know, six terabytes or more each eight terabytes. Um, that is the other limiting factor

387
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,440
What i've gone with is i've tried i've tried to find good deals on

388
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,760
Uh usb3 ssds that are powered by the bus and I just hang that off the pie

389
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,400
So there's that those are the caveats there as well as of course in my opinion

390
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,080
Although feel free to tell me otherwise i'd love to know what's working for you out there

391
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
I think on a raspberry pi

392
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
for the for specifically

393
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,640
Raspbian is really your only bet if you're going to use it in production

394
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:45,840
For the moment anyway. Yeah, there's so many drivers and little itsy bitsy things here sentos just got basic boot support

395
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,080
But it's still not very stable. Um, I have reason to believe that the

396
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,880
Ubuntu folks may have some work in progress to make it

397
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,960
Um a little more doable including gpu support and whatnot. But right now

398
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,840
If you want to update the firmware on this thing

399
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,680
if you

400
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,520
Want to take advantage of the gpu and really have the most I think stable running linux system

401
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,320
It needs to be raspbian right now, which is debian based. What do you mean gpu support?

402
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,760
Oh, no, I just mean like the drivers for gpu acceleration are different. And in fact the architecture is completely different

403
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,160
But it's it's a it is a different. It is a really different product from the three

404
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,920
It it looks the same and it has it looks similar and it has a similar name

405
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,360
But it is an entirely different beast. So it does have those caveats

406
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,600
I don't want to come on here and say you can throw out your x86 box with a raspberry pi 4

407
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,160
But I do want to say as somebody who was a big metal make it as fast and big as possible kind of guy

408
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,320
I'm blown away what i'm doing with these two raspberry pies right now

409
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,160
And at this point i'm going with multiple raspberry pies just to sort of isolate things out

410
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,320
I I don't want my dhcp server and dns server to be on my application server

411
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,480
So I i'm choosing I ran pie hole

412
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,040
On my main raspberry pi for a bit just to see if I liked it and it worked perfectly fine

413
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,920
and then the other thing to bear in mind as well, of course is

414
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,720
Application availability the pi is of course an arm cpu not an x86 cpu

415
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,640
So not every piece of software that's ever been written has yet been ported or built for arm

416
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,640
Docker containers make it largely irrelevant to a certain degree these days

417
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,120
Although it depends whether your container maintainer

418
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,840
Supports arm builds, um most do but not all so that's just something to bear in mind as well

419
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,320
But I think you know the the overall kind of impressions of this device for me

420
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,760
Is that for the price you really are going to struggle to match this performance?

421
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,920
Any other way that in in this particular form factor and that's what really wins out with the pie is that

422
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,480
A couple of things is the form factor the price and the network effect

423
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,320
There are dozens and dozens of other projects based around the pie

424
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,400
So if you get bored of hosting these services on the pie, you could turn it into a full screen

425
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:08,320
Calendar that hangs by your front door so that all your family know when you're coming and going and it is so much the network

426
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,560
Effect like i i i'm really curious about systems like the atomic pie and other boards that are out there

427
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:22,400
People are really focusing on raspbian and raspberry pi so you can like just google anything and put raspbian on it

428
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,760
And you'll get a guide for it and that sort of um

429
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,240
Network effect makes it so much more approachable for people that are not

430
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,840
So much more approachable for people that are learning how to do this kind of stuff

431
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,720
I I really can't underestimate it and I I can see myself down the road

432
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,400
Maybe looking at things like atomic pie or or even saying ah, screw all these raspberry pies. I'm switching to a big knuck

433
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,320
but

434
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:53,280
Right now i'm i'm liking the set of compromises and advantages and with the pi 4 the price has really the price performance is just

435
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Blew my mind way beyond my expectations

436
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,280
Part of taking these things offline in the rv

437
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,680
It has been this feeling that I own this stuff again

438
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:09,440
And i've never been bothered by not owning it like never really was I don't have an issue with that kind of stuff generally

439
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:18,000
Having it back. I now appreciate it in a way that it gives me it sounds silly, but it gives me genuine happiness like I feel

440
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,120
Proud and i'm happy to have this stuff like I feel like it's mine like i've created something

441
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,400
But we're able to use technologies like containers to just stand up

442
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,280
instances of applications

443
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
exactly as the developer intended

444
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,640
with

445
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,520
almost no knowledge of the application itself, you know, so

446
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:42,240
Technologies 10 years ago just didn't permit us to be able to do this kind of stuff

447
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,560
No, it's it's it's enterprise grade stuff that i'm running on a raspberry pie

448
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,040
in my rv

449
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,800
Yeah going that can go that goes down the road at 65 miles per hour. It's it's mind-blowing and it's it's working

450
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,240
And it's only getting better. Uh, we've talked about this before but we're really at a really special time where web applications are decent

451
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,880
Container technology is prevalent

452
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
The hardware is cheap enough

453
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,680
And the motivation is there to self-host this stuff like it's such a great time to be doing this

454
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,840
So you heard us mention it a couple of times but be sure to check out xers.show. We'll have a special on reverse proxy

455
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,840
And a special on the basics of container technologies

456
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,120
So if if you want to understand some of these fundamentals a little bit

457
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,480
We wanted to cover those early in the in the lifespan of the show

458
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,880
And we're publishing those in the off weeks of this show at xers.show

459
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,160
And you can also join us in the jb telegram group. We're using a hashtag ask ssh both on telegram and twitter

460
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
for user questions

461
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,520
Um, we've had some really good ones come through and we will get to those over the next few episodes as well

462
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:57,120
But uh on twitter, you can find me at ironic badger and chris i'm at chris las and so thanks everyone for listening

463
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:12,480
That was self-hosted.show slash three
