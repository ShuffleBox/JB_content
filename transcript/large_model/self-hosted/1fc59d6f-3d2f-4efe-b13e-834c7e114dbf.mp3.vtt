00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Coming up on Self Hosted 14, Wendell's back, he joins us and we talk about the perfect low power

00:05.680 --> 00:12.880
home server, some great ideas for a firewall, and why Alex has orange knobs all over his office.

00:12.880 --> 00:13.680
I'm Chris.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.640
And I'm Alex.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.160
And this is Self Hosted 14.

00:17.440 --> 00:18.880
Welcome back to Self Hosted.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.480
It's great to be here with episode 14.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.480
And Alex, we have a special one today.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.200
Another one.

00:23.200 --> 00:23.920
I know.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.440
Another special episode.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.280
I feel like every episode is special.

00:27.280 --> 00:30.160
It's like I used to say every show was a big show, but now they're not as long.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.760
So now they're just special shows.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.800
But this one really is because Wendell is joining us.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.960
He was on episode one and we knew we'd want to have him back.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.200
So Wendell, welcome back to the Self Hosted podcast.

00:39.760 --> 00:40.640
How's it going?

00:40.640 --> 00:45.680
I've been following the show and it's very, there are so many people that are like, yes,

00:45.680 --> 00:46.320
self hosted.

00:48.160 --> 00:52.160
Before we start, Alex, we had something we had to cut from last week's episode.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.400
Do you want to just maybe start with that?

00:54.400 --> 00:58.000
A little tip you had with, I think it was SSH Shuttle or SSH Shuttle.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.320
SSH Shuttle is one of those tools.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.720
I've used it for several years now.

01:02.720 --> 01:09.520
And obviously this predates WireGuard being a thing and it lets me tunnel traffic over

01:09.520 --> 01:14.000
SSH and essentially creates a poor man's VPN over SSH.

01:14.640 --> 01:19.920
So I used to use it a lot when I worked in a bank and they had a very restrictive outbound

01:19.920 --> 01:21.440
SSH policy.

01:21.440 --> 01:26.960
So I used to use that in conjunction with Corkscrew out on port 443 to make all my traffic

01:26.960 --> 01:31.040
look like what was SSL traffic.

01:31.040 --> 01:37.120
And then I could route all my DNS through that tunnel as well and get to any website

01:37.120 --> 01:37.620
I wanted.

01:38.400 --> 01:43.440
The point for me being was I could actually get to my homeland very easily that way.

01:43.440 --> 01:49.120
I wasn't really too worried about going to silly sites at work, but yeah, it's a tool

01:49.120 --> 01:50.320
that I've used for many years.

01:50.320 --> 01:55.760
And I've had a blog post sat in drafts for what must be four years at this point.

01:55.760 --> 01:56.800
And I looked at it.

01:56.800 --> 02:00.560
I sat at Nashville airport last week and I thought, you know what?

02:00.560 --> 02:02.240
I need to publish this post.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.600
So here we go.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.320
Good.

02:04.320 --> 02:07.200
We'll link that up in the old show notes.

02:07.200 --> 02:07.680
That's a great tool.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.280
I might actually play around with that myself.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.240
So thank you.

02:10.240 --> 02:10.960
It's really nice.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.360
I use it a lot for Red Hat stuff.

02:13.360 --> 02:18.400
We have an internal VPN that we have to connect to and I have a droplet that's running that's

02:18.400 --> 02:20.400
perma connected to that VPN.

02:20.400 --> 02:25.440
And so when I want to route traffic through the internal VPN to view the intranet or whatever,

02:26.320 --> 02:32.080
I have a bash alias that routes all my traffic for those few minutes through the tunnel and

02:32.080 --> 02:34.160
then through the droplet into Red Hat.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.440
And it works really nicely.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.240
That's a great tip.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.840
That's something I'm going to check out.

02:37.840 --> 02:40.880
Now, I had a realization this week that I wanted to share with you guys.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.720
Curious if this happens to you.

02:42.720 --> 02:47.920
So at home, I have several Raspberry Pi 4s that I set up doing various different jobs.

02:47.920 --> 02:52.960
I think I've talked about it quite a bit on the show, but I had a realization that the

02:52.960 --> 02:56.080
details of how I set it all up are already beginning to fade.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.360
Do you have this happen where you just you go all out on something?

02:59.360 --> 03:01.920
It's like a passion project and then the details fade away.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.240
I'll give you one better.

03:04.240 --> 03:08.080
You go all out on a passion project and then you're like, oh, wait.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.960
And then this just random thought occurs to you.

03:10.960 --> 03:15.120
And then it's like, I know instead of putting this in the wiring closet with everything

03:15.120 --> 03:19.040
else, I'll put it here and then you open up that cabinet and there's already one there.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.560
And it's like, did I already do this and forget?

03:25.200 --> 03:28.800
I don't think that's ever happened to me that I've forgotten a piece of hardware exists.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.320
But I could, you know, having been to your place, I can imagine that that's happened

03:32.960 --> 03:34.080
once or twice.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.680
Yeah, it's sort of a reminder that you're kind of predictable in a sense because I've

03:37.680 --> 03:41.280
also done that with like, oh, I need to save something on the computer and I'll download

03:41.280 --> 03:44.800
a PDF and I'll go to put it in a very specific place so that way I can get to it later.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.640
And I'll open the directory and the PDF is already there and I've already done it.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.400
I just completely forgot that.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.360
Yeah, that's where I'm at.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.960
And I did do some documentation.

03:54.080 --> 04:00.400
So I'm not totally out in the woods, but I'm looking at it now and I'm thinking, I wish

04:00.400 --> 04:04.400
I would have done this through some sort of automated deployment because the scenario

04:04.400 --> 04:08.400
I now fear is I've become super dependent on this hardware.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.680
And I'm just concerned about hardware failure.

04:11.680 --> 04:16.800
And if there's a hardware failure because they are Raspberry Pis, they are swappable.

04:16.800 --> 04:21.440
So in theory, I could just take a dead one out, put a full who even cares what's wrong,

04:21.440 --> 04:21.920
right?

04:21.920 --> 04:26.960
Just buy an extra one, swap out the dead one, put in a good one and then have something

04:27.600 --> 04:31.200
reset it up completely as per some system.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.240
And I just haven't done that.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.440
And now I'm regretting it.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.760
Yeah, that's why that's where I am right now.

04:35.760 --> 04:40.640
I've got the four gig Raspberry Pi with the POE hat with the fixed USB-C power and all

04:40.640 --> 04:42.560
of that. And it's like, yes, finally.

04:42.560 --> 04:47.600
And I've been experimenting with the watchdog thing for about the last six months or so,

04:47.600 --> 04:48.960
like six or eight months.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.880
And the watchdog thing works really well.

04:50.880 --> 04:55.360
But you can also ethernet boot the Raspberry Pi.

04:55.360 --> 04:58.800
And so it's like, do I even need storage for the Raspberry Pi at this point?

04:58.800 --> 05:00.560
Because that's another point of failure.

05:00.560 --> 05:04.400
And maybe I can just be like, no, this Mac address boots and has this hat attached to

05:04.400 --> 05:04.960
it.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.200
And I can just sort of go from there.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.280
Do you still need the SD card for that, though?

05:09.280 --> 05:10.960
Even for pixie booting?

05:10.960 --> 05:14.720
You might just for like the bootloader or whatever.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.240
There's nothing actually stored.

05:16.240 --> 05:22.320
Like you wouldn't need to do anything, although it may be able to load from the EEPROM because

05:22.320 --> 05:25.840
some of the documentation online is like, oh, there's an EEPROM that blah, blah, blah.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.120
And it's like, does that actually work?

05:27.120 --> 05:27.600
I don't know.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.720
I haven't gotten there yet.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.160
Can I trace back a little bit?

05:30.160 --> 05:31.920
What's the watchdog thing?

05:31.920 --> 05:36.720
On the Raspberry Pi, you can load a kernel module that if you don't poke the watchdog

05:36.720 --> 05:40.000
every 10 seconds, it will hard reset the Raspberry Pi.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.640
So if the Raspberry Pi locks up or has some sort of hardware failure or overheats or something,

05:44.640 --> 05:46.880
it will just reset itself.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.720
And that's not going to cause any issues with the SD card corrupting itself or?

05:50.720 --> 05:52.320
Well, that's why I want a PXE boot.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.200
Ah, yes.

05:53.200 --> 05:53.760
Yep.

05:53.760 --> 05:58.720
If not PXE boot, the SD card should be completely read only, maybe mechanically read only.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.680
And just a super, super, super minimal boot environment.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.920
Although there's the security consideration with that.

06:03.920 --> 06:08.000
But I'd rather just completely raw boot and deal with it from there.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.320
Right.

06:08.320 --> 06:12.320
And then you could just have another SD card standing by if that one were to die for some

06:12.320 --> 06:12.720
reason.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.080
Just if it's such a minimal boot environment, doesn't need to do much.

06:16.080 --> 06:19.280
But how do I do all of this?

06:19.280 --> 06:21.360
Like, what is too much for a home project?

06:21.360 --> 06:24.960
I don't want to create another monster that within six months, I'll forget how it's set

06:24.960 --> 06:25.200
up.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.400
That's what I'm worried about.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.960
That's where I am, too, because it's like, I don't know.

06:28.960 --> 06:32.560
For me, most of the Raspberry Pi stuff is just information logging and monitoring in

06:32.560 --> 06:35.440
a tiny, tiny little bit of control.

06:35.440 --> 06:39.360
So like, you know, the amazing Grafana dashboard that's like, this is what the boiler is doing.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.080
This is the pressure.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.200
And this is the thing over time.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.640
And this is the other stuff that's happening.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.360
Yeah, it's not the end of the world if you lose it.

06:45.360 --> 06:48.400
What do you guys tend to use for that kind of thing?

06:48.400 --> 06:49.680
Like config management?

06:49.680 --> 06:55.120
You know, my personal flavor is Ansible and mixed with a bit of Terraform sometimes.

06:55.760 --> 06:56.880
What do you use?

06:56.880 --> 06:58.560
Ansible mostly.

06:58.560 --> 07:05.840
Although, there are a few scripts that are just a bash script piped into SSH with keys.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.880
That's my setup.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.480
That's me over here.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.480
I don't think there's anything wrong with that, really.

07:10.480 --> 07:15.200
I mean, if you're being a super elite hacker, like Popey last week was giving me a hard

07:15.200 --> 07:17.600
time that I'm an elite hacker because I like IRC.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.640
No, I don't think that's true.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.560
But I think bash scripts do have their place.

07:22.560 --> 07:27.360
And coming back to your point, Chris, sometimes if you build a complex house of cards that

07:27.360 --> 07:30.160
you don't fully understand, you then don't touch it.

07:30.160 --> 07:37.520
So the magic bullet to making config management work for me is that you have to ensure every

07:37.520 --> 07:42.480
change you make to a system is made through that config management tool.

07:42.480 --> 07:46.720
So if you want to install just one package, you add that to your dictionary of packages

07:46.720 --> 07:51.040
or whatever, run Ansible, and it goes and installs that one package.

07:51.040 --> 07:54.080
I'm going to explain Ansible very briefly for those that aren't familiar with it.

07:54.080 --> 08:02.160
It's an SSH-based tool that is a declarative state type tool.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.320
So you say, I want my system to look like this.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.080
I want it to have these packages.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.880
I want Samba config to look like this, et cetera.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.720
You run the Ansible playbook command.

08:11.840 --> 08:15.760
It SSHs out to all of your different hosts and does all of the stuff based on what's

08:15.760 --> 08:16.800
in the playbooks.

08:16.800 --> 08:21.440
Once the playbooks have executed, the host state should match what is declared in the

08:21.440 --> 08:24.720
playbook, hence the declarative state name.

08:25.520 --> 08:32.560
And so if you let that config drift on those nodes from the declared state in the infrastructure

08:32.560 --> 08:37.440
as code type playbooks that you've written, you end up with this config drift between

08:37.440 --> 08:42.640
the two and it becomes really hard quite quickly to reconcile those differences unless you're

08:42.640 --> 08:43.920
quite strict about it.

08:44.480 --> 08:50.000
Even things like just minor point upgrades to the underlying distro can cause a problem

08:50.000 --> 08:52.480
and then it's like, oh, I didn't really want to spend three hours troubleshooting this

08:52.480 --> 08:53.040
today.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.440
Yeah, that's a thing as that happens.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.320
So what are you thinking, Chris?

08:56.320 --> 08:58.240
You want to do that for your pies now?

08:58.240 --> 09:01.040
Yeah, although I am worried that's a bit much.

09:01.040 --> 09:01.840
But is it?

09:01.840 --> 09:05.040
So here's what my alternative is, is like an image-based approach.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.400
Once a month, I pull out the SD cards and it's very manual.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.840
So it's very unlikely, isn't it?

09:09.840 --> 09:12.800
I mean, even just saying it out loud, I started to think it's a bad idea, but that's what

09:12.800 --> 09:18.640
I was thinking was just images and then Duplicati gets the config data.

09:18.640 --> 09:24.480
Offsite and the actual large data is stored on a spinning disk, or actually it's a solid

09:24.480 --> 09:26.240
state disk, not an SD card.

09:26.960 --> 09:30.160
So the OS really just has to get back to base.

09:30.960 --> 09:37.360
Then I could pull down the latest containers, restore the configs with Duplicati, but it's

09:37.360 --> 09:38.320
a lot of manual work.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.920
That's probably a good couple of hours.

09:40.560 --> 09:45.920
And that's it for me, like containers have changed how disposable my hosts are.

09:45.920 --> 09:50.480
I don't really care if my host dies because all my data lives on some persistent storage

09:50.480 --> 09:53.600
somewhere else and the application is separated from it.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.600
So, yeah, I almost, yeah, I don't know.

09:57.600 --> 10:01.520
And I don't know what point I should pull the eject lever and just say, OK, I have to

10:01.520 --> 10:04.480
go to some massive management system or if I just...

10:04.480 --> 10:06.400
Ansible is not a massive management system.

10:06.400 --> 10:09.680
I think if you've never used it before, there is this kind of fog.

10:09.680 --> 10:14.400
Yeah, but it's like half a day's effort, I think, to, you know, demist the fog.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.960
Oh, really?

10:16.960 --> 10:18.880
Yeah, I'll give you some help.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.880
All right, then that might be the route I want to go.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.000
If you think it's not...

10:22.000 --> 10:22.640
See, that's kind of...

10:22.640 --> 10:25.840
I just didn't want to have to bite off like a whole new thing, but I actually don't mind

10:25.840 --> 10:27.040
picking up something new, really.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.920
If it's not so bad, I could do it.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.280
Now, let's talk about hardware whilst we have Mr. Wendell with us.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.080
One of your recent videos was all about the new Fractal case.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.520
They've gone in a really interesting way, really interesting direction.

10:41.520 --> 10:47.600
Yeah, well, it's the Fractal Define 7 XL and the 7.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.080
And the 7 XL, I wasn't expecting to like it.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.920
It's just a giant tower case.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.840
I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.960
But it was like, man, this case would be perfect if it had wheels.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.800
It's like, is there a wheels option?

10:58.800 --> 10:59.520
And they're like, no.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.240
And it's like, wait, I have a 3D printer.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.120
I can fix this.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.280
So I 3D printed my own adapters for the feet.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.120
And so I went through a couple iterations.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.360
Like, this is like an early iteration.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.480
But it sort of centers the wheel actually on the screw.

11:15.360 --> 11:18.160
Because I thought that would be a little mechanically stronger.

11:18.160 --> 11:22.880
But it turns out sort of this like saddle thing is a better approach.

11:22.880 --> 11:27.840
And then I ended up 3D printing a donut shaped hole in the foot

11:27.840 --> 11:29.920
so that you can feed a zip tie through it.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.760
And the whole thing will go inside the case.

11:31.760 --> 11:35.360
And you can screw and zip tie the foot to the case.

11:35.360 --> 11:38.560
And then you've got the wheel that will go in like this.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.440
And so you can have a really nice case on wheels.

11:41.440 --> 11:46.240
That just looks like an office chair caster, like a roller blade wheel or something.

11:46.240 --> 11:49.840
Yeah, that's literally this is like you can order these on Amazon.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.800
So like if you have hardwood floors, you're not supposed to use office

11:52.800 --> 11:55.040
chair casters on hardwood floors because it'll wear a hole in it.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.400
You get these.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.760
And that's literally what this is.

11:57.760 --> 12:02.240
It's just an office chair caster that goes in there.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.400
And then this screws into the bottom of the fractal case.

12:04.400 --> 12:09.600
And then you have a pretty nice full tower case that's really heavy and will roll around.

12:09.600 --> 12:14.960
Now, is there a way you could figure out a reason to charge $400 for those wheels?

12:14.960 --> 12:18.240
Because I knew you were going to go there.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.560
No, it's like $35 on Amazon and like a dollar of plastic.

12:22.560 --> 12:28.800
So hmm, OK, also 3D printed an M.2 hot swap.

12:28.800 --> 12:34.880
So like not really hot swap, but like for like a U.2 device and so you just zip tie

12:34.880 --> 12:40.720
the connector in the end here and then the U.2 two and a half inch NVMe SSD just slides in.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.840
And so I've got these laying in the bottom of the case as well.

12:43.840 --> 12:47.840
And so it's like, oh, I need to pop in a different Linux distro or whatever.

12:47.840 --> 12:51.600
I'll just pop out my main hard drive and pop in a new hard drive and it's PCIe connected

12:51.600 --> 12:53.200
and it's out of the way and it's nice.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.560
That is great.

12:54.560 --> 13:00.160
And these are those wonderful Intel, what, four terabyte SSDs that you found?

13:00.160 --> 13:01.680
Yeah, they're on eBay, right?

13:01.680 --> 13:02.960
Yeah, I bought a few of those.

13:02.960 --> 13:07.840
They're hard to get now, but yeah, yeah, it turns out they're they're kind of nice.

13:07.840 --> 13:12.880
And this has got standard two and a half inch drive, like screw holes in it.

13:12.880 --> 13:16.400
So you just screw this in the same way that you would a two and a half inch drive.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.160
And it's a lot taller, obviously.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.320
Doesn't that look like a TIE fighter to you, Chris?

13:20.320 --> 13:21.200
Yeah, I could.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.320
That's a good way to describe it.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.520
Yeah, visualize a TIE fighter, folks, and that's kind of what it looks like.

13:25.520 --> 13:26.320
That's a great idea.

13:26.880 --> 13:27.760
I got to get one.

13:27.760 --> 13:34.160
Yeah, I think zip ties are really underrated in kind of low, low budget things like this.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.160
I use them for all my drones and stuff.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.960
They're a major mechanical component of the Prusa 3D printers.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.480
Yes, they are.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.320
Yeah, yeah, I have two sat behind me.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.400
I have one of the minis and the i3.

13:45.120 --> 13:45.760
I love it.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.040
Yeah, that's what these were printed on.

13:47.040 --> 13:47.440
It works.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.520
It works really well for what it is.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.720
So slight tangent about 3D printing for a moment.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.360
How did you get into 3D printing?

13:56.080 --> 13:57.920
I needed to make things that didn't exist.

13:58.640 --> 14:03.280
When I got a 3D printer, it was very early in the MakerBot days when they were open source

14:03.280 --> 14:05.760
and you could kind of get it out of the laser cut wood.

14:05.760 --> 14:09.120
And the first 3D printer that I had was basically made out of laser printer parts

14:09.120 --> 14:10.960
because it was like, oh, step promoters, laser printer.

14:10.960 --> 14:11.460
Yeah.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.360
I thought that I would be doing a lot more creative stuff with it because I was pretty

14:15.360 --> 14:19.440
good with AutoCAD because I had some experience with CNC machining.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.280
Are you still using AutoCAD now?

14:21.280 --> 14:22.160
No, no.

14:23.040 --> 14:27.040
I made these with just Tinkercad, which is infuriating because it doesn't give you a

14:27.040 --> 14:28.320
CLI interface.

14:28.320 --> 14:32.640
With AutoCAD, it sort of taught me to just not even use the mouse, to just visualize

14:32.640 --> 14:34.960
the part that I wanted to build and start typing coordinates.

14:35.840 --> 14:39.920
Because using the calipers and doing the CNC thing, and that works brilliantly with AutoCAD

14:39.920 --> 14:40.720
when you're going to do that.

14:40.720 --> 14:44.160
But if you need to use the mouse, it's not good.

14:44.160 --> 14:50.560
90% of what I make in the 3D printer is parts for something that I've lost or something

14:50.560 --> 14:51.280
to fix something.

14:51.920 --> 14:56.000
So I've got a bookshelf, I've got a bunch of bookshelves that have adjustable shelves

14:56.000 --> 14:59.200
and sometimes I'll put tall things in and so I'll take a shelf out and then I'll rearrange

14:59.200 --> 15:01.760
and then it's like, OK, I need to put that shelf back in and the little plastic things

15:01.760 --> 15:02.720
are gone.

15:02.720 --> 15:06.720
And they're not just pegs, they're like the ones that the shelf snaps into it.

15:06.720 --> 15:11.200
And so I have about seven different models of those and it's like, oh, time to rearrange

15:11.200 --> 15:11.680
the shelf.

15:11.680 --> 15:15.840
I'll just go and 3D print some more clips and that's just what I do.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.680
Right next to me here, I have a pair of Ikea Lack tables.

15:20.240 --> 15:24.560
I'm going to point them on the webcam to you both and they are stacked together with two

15:24.560 --> 15:29.280
or no, well, obviously four, one for each leg, 3D printed things with a couple of screws

15:29.280 --> 15:30.080
and it is brilliant.

15:30.080 --> 15:34.960
And then my 3D printer station behind me, you can see all the orange, everything orange

15:34.960 --> 15:39.680
is 3D printed and designed in, I use Fusion 360, which...

15:39.680 --> 15:42.640
Oh yeah, the hobby license for that is nice.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.320
The hobby license only lasts a year.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.520
It's the education license that's in perpetuity.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.960
So you've got to be careful with that.

15:48.960 --> 15:54.240
But it's annoying because it tethers me to windows and I've got Adobe stuff and Fusion

15:54.240 --> 15:59.120
360 that tethers me to windows, which gives me an excuse to do PCI pass through, but I'd

15:59.120 --> 16:00.080
really rather not have to.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.400
You know, it could be worse.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.880
Yeah, at least it works, Alex.

16:06.880 --> 16:07.600
For the most part.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.280
It's funny you say anything orange was 3D printed.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.240
There's just your whole office is covered in orange little things everywhere.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.560
You put it all together.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.680
Yeah, kind of is.

16:18.800 --> 16:24.400
I've got a few videos that are coming out and the first one is on something called the

16:24.400 --> 16:29.760
Iron Fireman and I think I'm going to take an old thermostat because it's literally,

16:29.760 --> 16:33.520
it's a coal loader for the boiler, but the thermostat part of it still works, but it's

16:33.520 --> 16:37.360
mercury switch on a spring, so it's not super sensitive.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.800
I think I'm going to retrofit that.

16:38.800 --> 16:42.880
Did you see the Hackaday mod that was the rotary dial cell phone?

16:43.600 --> 16:49.520
I'm going to try to take a Raspberry Pi W and shove it inside this thermostat and modernize

16:49.520 --> 16:52.560
it and 3D print all the stuff to make it actually kind of nice.

16:53.200 --> 17:01.360
But there's a tiny, tiny little OLED SPI screen that is just about as wide as the thermostat

17:01.360 --> 17:06.720
and it is taking every fiber of my being to resist having some kind of a thing to where

17:06.720 --> 17:11.120
when you get close there's a proximity or something and a servo causes the screen to

17:11.120 --> 17:12.320
lift out of the thermostat.

17:13.440 --> 17:18.880
But it's so anachronistic because it's just a brass cover with some knobs for setting

17:18.880 --> 17:22.160
day and night temperature, but it's like you get close to it and I want an OLED screen

17:22.160 --> 17:27.680
to just pop up out of it and then powered from a piece of Cat 6 or something and that

17:27.680 --> 17:28.720
would be amazing.

17:28.720 --> 17:29.920
That would be really great.

17:29.920 --> 17:30.720
I want that too.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.720
That does sound awesome.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.840
I want that.

17:35.840 --> 17:41.280
Well, I kind of have a hardware question that's a bit of a conundrum, so maybe I could pick

17:41.280 --> 17:42.400
both your brains on this one.

17:43.120 --> 17:48.960
I think my next piece of hardware for my home setup, it's got to be my edge device, my

17:48.960 --> 17:49.440
firewall.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.080
So right now I have that GL, what's it called?

17:52.080 --> 17:56.560
The GL Net, those little tiny routers, Alex, that we've talked about before on the show?

17:56.560 --> 18:01.200
Yeah, the new version that we mentioned, I forget what episode it was, like two or three

18:01.200 --> 18:02.720
or something, the Slates.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.840
Yes, the Slates.

18:03.840 --> 18:04.720
That's it.

18:04.720 --> 18:10.720
Which I really like because it has a great UI that lets you switch between multiple upstream

18:10.720 --> 18:11.440
network options.

18:11.440 --> 18:16.480
So MiFi, Wi-Fi, Cat 5, whatever, you can just switch between them through their GUI.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.200
But if you don't like that, you can drop under the hood and it's got a nice Linux command

18:19.200 --> 18:20.720
line and it works pretty well.

18:20.720 --> 18:23.760
But it's very appliance based.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.280
It's not very flexible.

18:25.280 --> 18:30.640
And the number one issue I have with it is although it touts some level of WireGuard

18:30.640 --> 18:33.280
support, there doesn't seem to be quite what I want.

18:33.280 --> 18:38.720
So I'm thinking about building, I don't know anymore if I should go with OpenSense or

18:38.720 --> 18:44.400
PFSense, but I'm thinking about building a new edge device that also has WireGuard support

18:44.400 --> 18:48.640
that would allow me to select multiple networks from different options at different times.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.760
But let me keep all of the devices behind the LAN.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.480
You know, they stay the same, their IPs don't change.

18:56.480 --> 19:00.320
And that the edge device needs to provide DNS for the LAN so I can resolve all the LAN

19:00.320 --> 19:01.120
devices by name.

19:01.120 --> 19:06.800
Those basic kinds of things, so obviously DHCP, DNS, I'd even like to provide NTP for

19:06.800 --> 19:07.520
the home network.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.920
But some of the key things I'd want is low power if possible, low noise is a requirement

19:13.920 --> 19:15.920
and even fanless would be ideal.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.160
Is this a thing that exists?

19:18.640 --> 19:22.240
I would probably, it's not fanless, but it's a lot of horsepower.

19:22.240 --> 19:28.720
I'd probably go with like the Ryzen Embedded, which is probably like way, way, way extreme

19:28.720 --> 19:30.320
maximum overkill for your needs.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.520
But you can spin up microcontainers and microservices.

19:33.520 --> 19:38.080
Like you can start with PFSense, but then you can expand that into a full free BSD

19:38.080 --> 19:42.240
installation, but maintain the PFSense GUI, because that will give you containers.

19:42.240 --> 19:46.320
And then you can start running jails and then inside the jail you can start running Docker

19:46.320 --> 19:47.440
and stuff like that.

19:47.440 --> 19:51.760
Because I've been experimenting with modifying PFSense to be able to better support things

19:51.760 --> 19:53.920
like LAN cache for steam caching.

19:53.920 --> 19:54.420
Yes.

19:54.420 --> 20:03.780
So like I did this work with Dr. Ian Cutress at Anandtech and the Chinese servers.

20:03.780 --> 20:07.940
And so like these are, you know, sort of the forbidden technology.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.620
It's like, this is, you know, don't do business with these companies, blah, blah, blah.

20:11.620 --> 20:13.220
But it's like, I must explore the technology.

20:13.700 --> 20:16.020
And so that's on a secure network.

20:16.020 --> 20:21.700
And the way that works is there's a PFSense machine that has a VPN connection and all

20:21.700 --> 20:24.580
of the traffic is tunneled, but it's also logged.

20:24.580 --> 20:27.140
So like every packet in and out is logged.

20:27.140 --> 20:30.820
And it doesn't matter what protocol it is, because sometimes you can hide things in non-IP

20:30.820 --> 20:33.140
protocol stuff because people always forget about that.

20:33.620 --> 20:37.940
Or, you know, like weird, like, oh, this looks like one of those really weird, you know,

20:37.940 --> 20:40.500
like IGMP packets and it's completely benign.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.060
And it's like, oh, no, this is actually a way to exfiltrate data.

20:43.060 --> 20:45.140
Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's not good.

20:45.140 --> 20:50.420
So I've got a fairly elaborate setup on PFSense where it has, you know, the LAN interface

20:50.420 --> 20:55.220
and then it has like the red zone and then it has, you know, a bunch of other interfaces

20:55.220 --> 20:56.500
and a couple of VLANs.

20:56.500 --> 21:01.540
And there's more stuff running on PFSense than you normally would for things like packet

21:01.540 --> 21:04.980
capture and analysis and IDS.

21:04.980 --> 21:09.460
And those things chew up a fair bit of horsepower.

21:10.100 --> 21:14.260
A really super inexpensive option are those ultra small form factor DELs.

21:14.260 --> 21:16.740
Like you can get, you know, a Haswell or Ivy Bridge.

21:16.740 --> 21:20.420
I mean, Intel mitigations aside, but you can get Intel, you can get like the Ivy Bridge

21:20.420 --> 21:25.460
or Haswell micro form factor DELs now for like a hundred bucks and throw in eight or

21:25.460 --> 21:26.500
16 gigs of RAM in those.

21:26.500 --> 21:30.820
And they're not fanless, but they're whisper quiet, at least until one of the fans die.

21:30.820 --> 21:34.180
Throw in a quad port NIC and you can do a lot with that.

21:34.180 --> 21:35.380
That's a great suggestion.

21:35.380 --> 21:38.340
Yeah, as long as it's fairly quiet, really, that's probably fine.

21:38.340 --> 21:41.620
And you can also just, you know, roll straight Linux on it if you want.

21:41.620 --> 21:42.660
That's an option.

21:42.660 --> 21:44.580
And not bother with the whole PFSense stuff.

21:44.580 --> 21:50.580
Yeah, that has also crossed my mind is just do a Linux box and then just roll bind, do

21:50.580 --> 21:52.900
wire guard by hand, set up DHCP.

21:52.900 --> 21:58.180
It's in fact, roll Linux box and maybe put PyHole on there to just make a few things

21:58.180 --> 21:59.300
easy in a container.

21:59.300 --> 22:01.060
Yeah, like having the whole thing.

22:01.060 --> 22:04.580
That's that's where I'm going is like not even doing very much on the host at all.

22:04.580 --> 22:06.500
Literally everything is container.

22:06.500 --> 22:12.580
Everything is, you know, Docker compose or Ansible or whatever.

22:12.580 --> 22:15.220
And if those containers all live on one machine, great.

22:15.220 --> 22:19.220
And if those containers need to be split up across a couple of different machines, great.

22:19.220 --> 22:25.860
But all of it sort of works together because like the PyHole and the LAN cache for Steam

22:25.860 --> 22:30.580
game caching and other game caching and all of that, all of that magic depends on DNS.

22:30.580 --> 22:33.780
Plus, you also want the DNS experience to be like the most amazing thing ever, because

22:33.780 --> 22:37.620
if your local DNS resolver is garbage, your whole Internet experience is going to feel

22:37.620 --> 22:38.660
like garbage.

22:38.660 --> 22:43.060
So you want that to be as good and fast as possible, and maybe it's worth having a premium

22:43.060 --> 22:44.260
device for that.

22:44.260 --> 22:45.780
That is very good point.

22:45.780 --> 22:49.540
Can you talk a little more about the steam cache aspect and how it requires DNS?

22:49.540 --> 22:51.940
Because that's something I definitely want to get set up.

22:51.940 --> 22:56.340
It's been on my to do list for a long time, and so I'm curious what I'll need to accommodate

22:56.340 --> 22:57.940
DNS wise to enable it.

22:57.940 --> 23:03.940
There's a GitHub repository for LAN cache that sort of goes into detail with everything,

23:03.940 --> 23:11.300
but Steam will do a DNS lookup for a record that is expected to be rewritten by your ISP

23:11.300 --> 23:14.180
or local provider or whatever, and you can just do it yourself.

23:14.180 --> 23:19.300
And it does not depend on HTTPS, there's no encryption, nothing like that.

23:19.300 --> 23:24.900
And so if you rewrite that DNS request and you have a corresponding web server that can

23:24.900 --> 23:29.700
proxy requests, then Steam is designed to work with the caching system.

23:29.700 --> 23:34.900
It's just normally it's like your ISP that's going to be doing the caching, but in this

23:34.900 --> 23:36.820
case it's you that's going to be doing the caching.

23:36.820 --> 23:41.700
And generally that's true with Blizzard and Activision and a bunch of other games.

23:41.700 --> 23:46.260
Sometimes HTTPS becomes a problem because they'll forget and they'll enable required

23:46.260 --> 23:52.900
HTTPS, and so any HTTPS traffic that you have is proxied but not cached because it's encrypted,

23:52.900 --> 23:56.980
and that encryption is sort of temporal, so it might be able to cache it, but then if

23:56.980 --> 24:00.420
it goes to playback that cache later, it's sort of nonsensical at that point in time,

24:00.420 --> 24:05.540
so the fact that it was cached encrypted data doesn't really help you.

24:05.540 --> 24:09.020
But most game providers will let you do that, and Windows Update is the same way.

24:09.020 --> 24:13.620
It manages its own integrity checking, so it doesn't need HTTPS, and so you can get

24:13.620 --> 24:16.980
your Windows updates if you have Windows machines on your network or your family has Windows

24:16.980 --> 24:18.580
machines or whatever.

24:18.580 --> 24:25.220
Same thing with repositories, so our local, the same container that is doing Steam caching,

24:25.220 --> 24:29.220
also with DNS magic, we're caching Debian and Fedora.

24:29.220 --> 24:32.340
And so it's just completely transparent, and it's like it's going to download the package

24:32.340 --> 24:36.260
and it's going to do its own integrity checking on the package, even though the connection's

24:36.260 --> 24:40.940
not encrypted, but because the connection's not encrypted, I can have that local cache.

24:40.940 --> 24:43.540
And so it's like, oh, it's time to update Debian.

24:43.540 --> 24:46.000
Oh, that's happening at a gigabit per second.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
That's nice.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.340
Yeah, really.

24:48.340 --> 24:51.140
Have you tried it with Ubuntu, or is it just Debian proper?

24:51.140 --> 24:55.100
No, yeah, no, you can totally do it with Ubuntu, you can totally do it with any other distro

24:55.100 --> 25:02.060
where you can set up an HTTP non-S mirror, and then that URL will be cached if you do

25:02.060 --> 25:03.060
some DNS magic.

25:03.060 --> 25:04.060
Guys, that sounds nice.

25:04.060 --> 25:08.220
Yeah, I definitely want to do the Steam cache one, because there are times when I'm on a

25:08.220 --> 25:13.700
MiFi, it's just so brutal, it's so bad, and I just think to myself, why haven't I set

25:13.700 --> 25:15.180
that Steam cache up yet?

25:15.180 --> 25:18.900
And that would be a good reason to have an Edge device with a little more horsepower,

25:18.900 --> 25:20.380
is to do kind of that stuff.

25:20.380 --> 25:27.100
Asrock has a, it's like the Desk Mini A320, I think.

25:27.100 --> 25:34.900
It's an APU, but it's got two 3.5 inch bays, and I really, really want to add an M.2 SSD

25:34.900 --> 25:38.860
and two 4 terabyte mechanical hard drives to that, so that it's like a cheap system.

25:38.860 --> 25:42.340
And that could be my travel cache system, because I find myself in the same situation

25:42.340 --> 25:46.900
a lot of the time, where I'm somewhere, and maybe I'm going to go to Computex, and maybe

25:46.900 --> 25:51.540
I want to do hardware testing in my hotel room, but the hotel room connection is garbage,

25:51.540 --> 25:55.860
and I need terabytes and terabytes of Fire Strike and games and crap like that.

25:55.860 --> 25:59.900
What if I could plug the hardware or laptop or whatever it is I'm testing in with a local

25:59.900 --> 26:04.100
connection, and I've got my little six inch cube of information, basically, and it's just

26:04.100 --> 26:07.900
shoving all of the information that I could possibly ever need onto the machine to be

26:07.900 --> 26:10.900
tested at wire speed, and then I don't have to worry about it.

26:10.900 --> 26:11.900
That's glorious.

26:11.900 --> 26:12.900
I love that idea.

26:12.900 --> 26:15.900
I'm making a project list over here, Alex.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.900
I've got a list of stuff I'm writing down over here.

26:18.900 --> 26:19.900
All right, I'm going to do that.

26:19.900 --> 26:24.140
You can add that to the pile of shame.

26:24.140 --> 26:26.900
The things I'll do one day.

26:26.900 --> 26:30.340
I was watching a video, I think it was Jay's Two Cent, where we went behind the scenes

26:30.340 --> 26:35.100
at one of these massive LAN parties, where he was talking with the networking team about

26:35.100 --> 26:41.580
how they ran fiber to each row of people doing LAN, and they had the LAN cache there, and

26:41.580 --> 26:44.980
that was really interesting, because he was talking about, I think it was Origin that

26:44.980 --> 26:50.340
uses HTTPS, which meant that they couldn't cache that one particular vendor.

26:50.340 --> 26:52.900
There have been a lot of complaints for that.

26:52.900 --> 26:57.820
I think that was Kane and Max CFM, and those guys for Dreamhack, because Kane does a lot

26:57.820 --> 27:03.780
of work for Dreamhack, and they get the world record on the LAN cache speed.

27:03.780 --> 27:09.220
It was 45 or 55 gigabytes per second, I think, or was it gigabit?

27:09.220 --> 27:10.820
It might have been gigabit.

27:10.820 --> 27:11.820
It was fast.

27:11.820 --> 27:13.620
It was insanely fast.

27:13.620 --> 27:19.980
Even Linus's mega, crazy, super SSD server might struggle going much faster than that.

27:19.980 --> 27:24.460
Wendell, you said something in there earlier that I thought would be worth touching on.

27:24.460 --> 27:28.460
Sounds like you're doing sort of my approach of minimum viable Linux for the host OS.

27:28.460 --> 27:34.300
It's just a really base install for your system, and then everything's either VM or containers?

27:34.300 --> 27:38.060
Yeah, because repeatability, and ain't nobody got time for that.

27:38.060 --> 27:39.540
Yeah, no kidding, right?

27:39.540 --> 27:40.540
I know.

27:40.540 --> 27:47.060
Well, and also, it's less to update, it's less to break, it's less security attack surface.

27:47.060 --> 27:48.560
There's a lot of benefits to it.

27:48.560 --> 27:52.100
The one thing that drives me insane about Docker containers is they never have good

27:52.100 --> 27:55.940
internal log management, and you will need that for incident response.

27:55.940 --> 28:02.020
So I usually have things on the Docker side of it for Docker Compose.

28:02.020 --> 28:05.420
It's like, okay, I'm just going to go ahead and map those directories to the host, but

28:05.420 --> 28:09.700
I'm also actually going to bother with log shipping to a machine on the network that's

28:09.700 --> 28:13.180
super hardened, just so that there's a logging device.

28:13.180 --> 28:16.900
And then it's like, hey, I'm not getting a heartbeat from this machine, but I started

28:16.900 --> 28:19.940
getting emails, like something may, and it's, you know, a lot of the time it's just that

28:19.940 --> 28:24.300
machine locked up or the power went out and the battery on the other thing is lasting

28:24.300 --> 28:25.420
a little bit longer.

28:25.420 --> 28:30.100
But that's a great thing to do with the Raspberry Pi as well, because it's not x86.

28:30.100 --> 28:36.660
So like the ScriptKitty binary exploit is like, oh, it's Raspberry Pi.

28:36.660 --> 28:40.380
You can't just, you know, upload a binary and ELF binary to it and have it actually

28:40.380 --> 28:41.380
work correctly.

28:41.380 --> 28:42.380
Right.

28:42.380 --> 28:46.660
And the fact that you can, you know, store the logs or export the logs or send it to

28:46.660 --> 28:51.020
something else or just have it stored there on that device, then it's like, it's nice

28:51.020 --> 28:54.540
because it's just right there on a separate device and it's hard to sort of compromise

28:54.540 --> 28:56.420
that and everything else.

28:56.420 --> 28:58.220
So let's get to a little bit of feedback.

28:58.220 --> 29:00.060
I have an email here from Ian.

29:00.060 --> 29:04.180
Thanks for writing in, Ian at Ask SSH.

29:04.180 --> 29:08.920
It's to do with hardware and he would like to know with all the AMD hardware releases

29:08.920 --> 29:14.520
right now, it's kind of hard to keep track of what is good for a low power server.

29:14.520 --> 29:19.660
What would you recommend as the best bang for budget AMD based system right now for

29:19.660 --> 29:22.220
a 24 seven based system?

29:22.220 --> 29:26.260
Best bang for the buck is probably the Ryzen 1600 AF.

29:26.260 --> 29:33.820
If you can find it, it's like 89 bucks and it's technically a 2600 because the 1600 on

29:33.820 --> 29:39.420
the old process sold so well, they're like, eh, we'll call it 1600 AF and it's a little

29:39.420 --> 29:45.620
slower than a 2600 so it didn't quite make the cut for a 2600 but it is essentially 2600

29:45.620 --> 29:51.780
and that CPU is incredible, an incredible, you know, bang for the buck because it's basically

29:51.780 --> 29:53.540
a 2000 series Ryzen.

29:53.540 --> 29:55.340
Where does that fit broadly speaking?

29:55.340 --> 29:58.660
I'm fairly familiar with the Intel lineup.

29:58.660 --> 30:02.580
What's the Intel kind of comparative chip there?

30:02.580 --> 30:06.300
Probably one of the Xeon E3s but it's actually going to be faster than just about all of

30:06.300 --> 30:08.300
the Xeon E3s that are available.

30:08.300 --> 30:10.300
Is that in single or multi-thread?

30:10.300 --> 30:12.460
Single thread is going to be close.

30:12.460 --> 30:14.540
It might slightly favor Intel.

30:14.540 --> 30:19.940
If you want to beat Intel in single thread with that Xeon E3, you could go with the Ryzen

30:19.940 --> 30:28.140
5 3600 and that's going to be a six core and that will handily outperform any Xeon E3 available

30:28.140 --> 30:29.140
today.

30:29.140 --> 30:33.740
Back to Ian's question, he's talking about the 24 by 7 piece.

30:33.740 --> 30:36.540
What's the sort of idle energy draw on these things?

30:36.540 --> 30:39.600
It depends on the motherboard and it depends on the implementation.

30:39.600 --> 30:44.120
If you go like super, super, super low power, which actually is a little tricky to do on

30:44.120 --> 30:49.140
Ryzen because you have to have a power supply that properly supports C6 and some power supplies

30:49.140 --> 30:54.540
that advertise the C6 deep sleep don't actually support the C6 deep sleep and some power supplies

30:54.540 --> 31:00.160
implement the C6 deep sleep as turn on this big old bank of resistors just to keep things

31:00.160 --> 31:05.900
ready in case the system wakes up, which generates heat so it doesn't actually consume less power.

31:05.900 --> 31:09.780
You got to really look at the power graph because it's like, oh, it's 80 plus gold or

31:09.780 --> 31:11.700
it's 80 plus bronze or it's 80 plus platinum.

31:11.700 --> 31:18.640
When you start playing with the 1% power utilization, that power efficiency goes to like 50% or 30%.

31:18.640 --> 31:23.100
So like literally half the energy that you're burning just goes to idle.

31:23.100 --> 31:27.940
DC to DC converters in that case might actually be a better choice, like one of the micro

31:27.940 --> 31:32.380
power supplies if you really, really want to be super frugal on the power, but it also

31:32.380 --> 31:37.460
depends a lot on the motherboard in terms of like the actual CPU itself.

31:37.460 --> 31:42.300
It's on the order of like one or two Watts per core while on the 3000 series plus whatever

31:42.300 --> 31:44.220
the IO die is using.

31:44.220 --> 31:48.940
So like the CPU itself in its lowest power state can be around like four or five Watts,

31:48.940 --> 31:52.820
maybe less than that, but it really depends on the rest of the system.

31:52.820 --> 31:53.820
Wow.

31:53.820 --> 31:55.100
That's like Raspberry Pi level.

31:55.100 --> 31:56.100
Yeah.

31:56.100 --> 31:57.100
Well, it's not doing anything.

31:57.100 --> 31:58.100
So I mean,

31:58.100 --> 32:02.700
Yeah, no, but my Xeons downstairs are doing nothing and they're sucking down 150 Watts

32:02.700 --> 32:03.700
each.

32:03.700 --> 32:04.700
Thank you very much.

32:04.700 --> 32:08.140
Your power usage is not going to be five Watts at the wall, no matter what you do, it's just

32:08.140 --> 32:12.300
that the power usage is going to be dominated by everything else in the system other than

32:12.300 --> 32:13.300
the CPU.

32:13.300 --> 32:14.300
Sure.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.540
So just keeping the NVMe on standby is going to be five Watts.

32:17.540 --> 32:19.020
Oh, that's good to know.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.740
I didn't know that.

32:20.740 --> 32:23.660
And now a logical question to follow that, and this one's from me.

32:23.660 --> 32:26.340
What sort of motherboards would we be looking at?

32:26.340 --> 32:27.820
Is there anything with IPMI?

32:27.820 --> 32:28.820
Yes.

32:28.820 --> 32:29.820
ASRock.

32:29.820 --> 32:30.820
ASRock rack.

32:30.820 --> 32:31.820
Thank you.

32:31.820 --> 32:34.140
They have an X470 and X570 board.

32:34.140 --> 32:40.100
The X470 board has dual Intel 10 gig optional and you don't really pay that much more like

32:40.100 --> 32:45.580
the board plus a 10 gig card, you know, is like 350, 300, 350, something like that.

32:45.580 --> 32:48.420
And so three to $400 for that board.

32:48.420 --> 32:49.420
It's great.

32:49.420 --> 32:54.140
It's got the AST 2500, same exact thing that you'd have in a server.

32:54.140 --> 33:00.100
Full RAM, full VGA implementation and with the American mega trends flavored implementation

33:00.100 --> 33:01.100
of the IPMI.

33:01.100 --> 33:07.380
It's got all the features, the watchdog, SSH access, command line, the whole nine yards,

33:07.380 --> 33:11.580
but it's an AM4 platform and they just came out with the X570 version, but I haven't been

33:11.580 --> 33:12.740
able to source it.

33:12.740 --> 33:16.420
I think it's a little more, I think it's like on the order of $600 and I think that's just

33:16.420 --> 33:20.720
an availability issue, not like an actual expected end user cost.

33:20.720 --> 33:27.900
But the 470 version is totally fine unless you need PCIe 4 or even more PCIe bandwidth.

33:27.900 --> 33:30.980
I assume those boards require DDR4, do they?

33:30.980 --> 33:31.980
Yeah.

33:31.980 --> 33:32.980
Yep.

33:32.980 --> 33:33.980
Yep.

33:33.980 --> 33:34.980
Okay.

33:34.980 --> 33:35.980
Good to know.

33:35.980 --> 33:39.620
So what a total system is going to cost you 400 for the board, a hundred ish for the CPU

33:39.620 --> 33:42.780
and then what 150 for 32 gigs of RAM?

33:42.780 --> 33:44.660
You can get unbuffered UDIMs.

33:44.660 --> 33:49.740
So I'd probably budget closer to 200 for the RAM and get unbuffered ECC.

33:49.740 --> 33:50.740
Okay.

33:50.740 --> 33:51.740
That's not bad though.

33:51.740 --> 33:53.300
That's a lot of performance for that money.

33:53.300 --> 33:54.940
And that would be a solid box.

33:54.940 --> 33:55.940
Yeah.

33:55.940 --> 33:58.380
And I think your idle current consumption on that, if you've got a good power supply,

33:58.380 --> 34:00.500
would probably be around 65 Watts.

34:00.500 --> 34:01.500
That's not bad at all.

34:01.500 --> 34:02.500
Very good.

34:02.500 --> 34:03.500
Yeah.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.500
All right.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.500
I want to go build one of those.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.500
So that's good.

34:06.500 --> 34:07.500
Add that to the pile.

34:07.500 --> 34:08.500
Yeah.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.900
Add that to the list of shame.

34:10.900 --> 34:16.480
I can give you a poor man's IPMI and that is a serial port.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.420
So here's the project for you.

34:18.420 --> 34:20.740
Maybe we can do a video on this because I already got all the stuff to do this.

34:20.740 --> 34:22.220
I just got to document it.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.220
Okay.

34:23.220 --> 34:28.780
So Raspberry Pi zero or regular Raspberry Pi if you want.

34:28.780 --> 34:39.120
The GPIO pin is wired into reset RS232 is connected to the RS232 on the host machine.

34:39.120 --> 34:42.980
The Raspberry Pi is available on a separate network or the same network depending on whatever

34:42.980 --> 34:43.980
you want to do.

34:43.980 --> 34:50.380
So the Raspberry Pi has enough wherewithal to reset the machine and it will at least

34:50.380 --> 34:51.680
get you to grub.

34:51.680 --> 34:56.760
So you can get grub on the serial terminal and do whatever you need to do as far as manipulating

34:56.760 --> 34:58.540
or booting the machine.

34:58.540 --> 35:00.180
That's a really great idea.

35:00.180 --> 35:01.780
Can you mount ISOs that way?

35:01.780 --> 35:03.300
Is that a thing you can do?

35:03.300 --> 35:06.520
If you wanted to do ISOs, you can't do ISOs over the serial port.

35:06.520 --> 35:10.600
What you do there is you put a USB stick in your computer that already has everything

35:10.600 --> 35:16.420
that you need to recover or if your motherboard has like one of those onboard micro SD cards.

35:16.420 --> 35:20.540
Not bootable, but you put that or bootable if you want, but you put that in there that

35:20.540 --> 35:27.700
has that stuff that you need on it already and then you hardwire the BIOS to only boot

35:27.700 --> 35:30.760
from the built-in hard drive and not consider other options.

35:30.760 --> 35:35.800
And then from the grub prompt, you can specify the other partition on the USB stick and use

35:35.800 --> 35:37.060
that as a recovery.

35:37.060 --> 35:38.060
I can see it now.

35:38.060 --> 35:40.860
I'm ringing my wife when I'm at work.

35:40.860 --> 35:43.580
Hey, wife, I've forgotten to plug my USB stick in.

35:43.580 --> 35:46.020
Please go and plug it in.

35:46.020 --> 35:47.020
Thank you.

35:47.020 --> 35:51.860
Yeah, it's not as good as an ASPEED 2500, but for, you know, $15, it's not bad.

35:51.860 --> 35:54.820
And it retrofits to any board with a serial port.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.820
Yeah.

35:55.820 --> 35:56.820
Yeah, you should do a video on that.

35:56.820 --> 35:58.380
I think people would love that.

35:58.380 --> 35:59.380
That's a great idea.

35:59.380 --> 36:01.420
Alex, is there anything else on our list today?

36:01.420 --> 36:05.660
Well, when we went to see you, Wendell, I swear you talked a little bit about a Bluetooth

36:05.660 --> 36:08.660
low-energy presence detection beacon.

36:08.660 --> 36:09.660
I finished that.

36:09.660 --> 36:12.300
There's a write-up of that on the forum and I haven't released the video, but probably

36:12.300 --> 36:14.960
by the time this is out, I will have released it.

36:14.960 --> 36:19.260
Forgetfulness is the only reason that I haven't released it, but that's on the Linux channel

36:19.260 --> 36:21.340
and there's a write-up on the forum.

36:21.340 --> 36:25.100
It's Bluetooth low-energy presence detection for like your house or whatever.

36:25.100 --> 36:29.580
And this is really the only Internet of Things stuff that I get into that is like genuinely

36:29.580 --> 36:33.940
like super useful because it's like, okay, if I'm in the workshop, I want some certain

36:33.940 --> 36:39.060
things to happen automatically, and if I leave the workshop and go into the house, whatever,

36:39.060 --> 36:43.860
and the Wi-Fi is not good enough, and Wi-Fi also is like, oh, I'm outside, and it's like,

36:43.860 --> 36:44.860
you're inside.

36:44.860 --> 36:47.380
It's like, I'm really not, but okay, that's fine.

36:47.380 --> 36:52.120
So it would be nice if when I'm outside, the outside lights are on, and if I'm inside,

36:52.120 --> 36:54.660
it doesn't care about the state of the outside lights.

36:54.660 --> 36:56.620
So the logic there is very simple.

36:56.620 --> 37:02.100
It's like if outside and outside lights are not on, turn on outside lights, but if inside

37:02.100 --> 37:04.260
don't care about outside lights.

37:04.260 --> 37:05.260
If they're on, leave them on.

37:05.260 --> 37:10.560
If they're off, turn them off, or leave them off, but don't mess with the state of it.

37:10.560 --> 37:13.920
If I transition from inside to outside, turn them on.

37:13.920 --> 37:17.500
If I transition from not there to outside, turn them on.

37:17.500 --> 37:23.120
If I transition from not there to inside, it's probably fine to leave them alone.

37:23.120 --> 37:29.160
So Bluetooth low-energy works better for that in my experience than Wi-Fi and pretty much

37:29.160 --> 37:31.240
every other technology that I've tried.

37:31.240 --> 37:34.460
And so are you just carrying your phone in your pocket and it's picking that up, or do

37:34.460 --> 37:35.460
you carry a special...

37:35.460 --> 37:36.460
No, just...

37:36.460 --> 37:37.980
There's no special tiles or anything you need to carry?

37:37.980 --> 37:39.100
No, you can.

37:39.100 --> 37:42.980
The tiles do actually work a little better than the phone because sometimes the phone

37:42.980 --> 37:48.540
puts the Bluetooth thing to sleep to save power, but generally the phone works fine.

37:48.540 --> 37:52.300
They do track people going through shopping centers and shopping malls and stuff using

37:52.300 --> 37:54.220
these Bluetooth beacons.

37:54.220 --> 37:56.820
Cruise ships use a lot of them as well, airports.

37:56.820 --> 38:00.900
So this stuff is being used commercially, so we may as well make use of it at home,

38:00.900 --> 38:01.900
right?

38:01.900 --> 38:02.900
Yeah.

38:02.900 --> 38:03.900
And you can combine stuff like that.

38:03.900 --> 38:07.300
I love the idea of it being Bluetooth LE because you're right, that is going to work better

38:07.300 --> 38:09.800
than Wi-Fi and you can put it all around your house.

38:09.800 --> 38:14.140
The other thing that I've done around the studio, I've got one that I'll show it to

38:14.140 --> 38:15.140
you guys.

38:15.140 --> 38:16.500
It's right here.

38:16.500 --> 38:23.900
I have these little NFC tags around the studio and when I go into an area, I put my phone

38:23.900 --> 38:28.340
on that NFC tag and then it triggers a Home Assistant automation for me for that area.

38:28.340 --> 38:33.220
I like the idea of supplementing location awareness from Bluetooth with these tags too

38:33.220 --> 38:34.900
for manual overrides and whatnot.

38:34.900 --> 38:38.980
I just want to put one in my mailbox to know when the mailman comes.

38:38.980 --> 38:42.740
When you start to think in terms of Bluetooth low energy tags or even just QR codes, like

38:42.740 --> 38:47.460
printed QR codes, suppose that there was no effort at all involved.

38:47.460 --> 38:51.060
It's like I'm in the kitchen, it's like, oh, it's grocery shopping day, what all do I need?

38:51.060 --> 38:54.120
You just open the pantry and there's a sticker on the inside of the door.

38:54.120 --> 38:59.220
If you can effortlessly take out your phone, hey phone, it's grocery store day, but the

38:59.220 --> 39:03.720
abbreviated way to say, hey phone, it's grocery store day, not even tapping an icon or finding

39:03.720 --> 39:08.020
the app among the thousands and thousands of apps on the phone with the completely stupid

39:08.020 --> 39:11.460
user interface of scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.

39:11.460 --> 39:16.100
It's just like I've opened the pantry, phone, look at this, it's like, oh, it must be grocery

39:16.100 --> 39:17.100
day.

39:17.100 --> 39:20.340
Correct phone, let's go down the checklist of things that I usually buy.

39:20.340 --> 39:25.940
Yeah, the one that I just did recently is I exit out the studio, I tap that with the

39:25.940 --> 39:32.540
phone and it sends a text message to the wife with an estimated time of arrival and then

39:32.540 --> 39:36.420
it waits five minutes and then it brings up Waze and my podcast player.

39:36.420 --> 39:37.420
And that's just all.

39:37.420 --> 39:41.540
So that way I'm down the road and I'm clear of the Wi-Fi network so I don't have to wait

39:41.540 --> 39:45.820
for the phone to figure out the Wi-Fi network versus LTE network, I'm clear of that and

39:45.820 --> 39:49.820
then those other apps open up and they have a data connection and it kicks off just fine.

39:49.820 --> 39:53.380
Imagine a Bluetooth low energy beacon when you're sitting at your couch in front of your

39:53.380 --> 39:58.180
big screen TV and you just touch your phone to the thing and then you're in Plex and it's

39:58.180 --> 40:02.120
like not only are you in Plex, but you're in Plex controlling the giant TV.

40:02.120 --> 40:06.100
You didn't have to fiddle with finding the app and cast to this and the other thing,

40:06.100 --> 40:07.860
it literally is just, it knows.

40:07.860 --> 40:10.060
Damn you Wendell.

40:10.060 --> 40:14.620
I haven't done that, I've tried to set that up and it turns out that's actually kind of

40:14.620 --> 40:18.940
a hard problem, but that's because we're using rocks and sticks to try to bang out these

40:18.940 --> 40:25.500
human interfaces and we really need somebody to come along and just set all this garbage

40:25.500 --> 40:27.500
on fire and start over.

40:27.500 --> 40:32.580
Yeah, it does feel a lot like a stone age sometimes, like we humans are still the critical

40:32.580 --> 40:36.740
translation layer and sometimes not so perfect.

40:36.740 --> 40:40.900
I although think we have a theme here gentlemen and it's essentially automate whatever you

40:40.900 --> 40:43.220
can really, that's what the theme is here.

40:43.220 --> 40:45.700
Yeah, has been throughout the show I guess, hasn't it?

40:45.700 --> 40:50.860
The subtext of that for me is can you do this in such a way that it is unlikely to bother

40:50.860 --> 40:54.380
you at least for years and years into the future?

40:54.380 --> 40:59.780
Like can I set this thing up so that it works and is largely automated and I just don't

40:59.780 --> 41:02.420
have to worry about it anymore?

41:02.420 --> 41:08.360
And I could see at some point, because the Amazon grocery delivery thing in my area has

41:08.360 --> 41:14.580
gotten to the point where I really want to take some time off and build an interface

41:14.580 --> 41:20.140
for like a Kroger, Walmart, and Meyer, and Amazon and just have them all fighting with

41:20.140 --> 41:22.980
each other for my API grocery list.

41:22.980 --> 41:26.100
And I don't want to buy everything from the API because I really do like to walk around

41:26.100 --> 41:30.680
the produce section and the bakery and like hand pick a few things.

41:30.680 --> 41:36.480
But in terms of like grocery procurement, I would really like to have an application

41:36.480 --> 41:42.820
that is, hey, if you buy two extra cartons of Charmin this week, it's going to be 15%

41:42.820 --> 41:47.460
less overall and it's like, great, make it so AI that's handling that for me.

41:47.460 --> 41:48.460
Yes.

41:48.460 --> 41:49.460
I would love that.

41:49.460 --> 41:50.460
Yeah.

41:50.460 --> 41:51.740
I just have all of that be handled.

41:51.740 --> 41:56.260
But the fact that you have three different grocery APIs that you can interface with,

41:56.260 --> 41:57.500
you literally can leverage that.

41:57.500 --> 42:00.740
And if enough people do that, it's going to be a race to the bottom and it's going to

42:00.740 --> 42:02.820
be glorious in terms of pricing.

42:02.820 --> 42:07.700
Probably bad in terms of local businesses, but probably good in terms of consumer pricing.

42:07.700 --> 42:09.820
Should we approve Wendell's time off request for that?

42:09.820 --> 42:10.820
Yeah, I'll approve that.

42:10.820 --> 42:11.820
Yeah.

42:11.820 --> 42:14.420
As long as we get early access.

42:14.420 --> 42:18.300
Well, that's probably it for us today, isn't it, Alex?

42:18.300 --> 42:19.660
Yeah, I think so.

42:19.660 --> 42:20.760
So thanks very much for listening.

42:20.760 --> 42:23.380
You can find us on Twitter at self-hosted show.

42:23.380 --> 42:28.020
And of course, self-hosted.show is the website, self-hosted.show slash subscribe for all the

42:28.020 --> 42:30.120
ways to get new episodes.

42:30.120 --> 42:32.860
And Wendell, give the people a way to catch what you do.

42:32.860 --> 42:36.460
Youtube.com slash level one techs or level one techs.com.

42:36.460 --> 42:42.220
And definitely, I'm looking for volunteers to build the AI hotel from Altered Carbon.

42:42.220 --> 42:47.580
I've got two Tesla V100s we can load into that AI and so it's just start doing all this

42:47.580 --> 42:48.580
stuff for us.

42:48.580 --> 42:49.580
And it's like, great, sounds good.

42:49.580 --> 42:50.580
Let's do it.

42:50.580 --> 42:51.580
Of course you are.

42:51.580 --> 42:52.580
Why wouldn't you be looking to do that?

42:52.580 --> 42:55.580
I think it's a great idea.

42:55.580 --> 42:59.780
Yeah, do go and check those forums out over on the level one techs site.

42:59.780 --> 43:03.720
They are a font of wonderful, wonderful information.

43:03.720 --> 43:07.540
And if nothing else, you can 3D print feet that you can't use on anything except fractal

43:07.540 --> 43:08.540
cases.

43:08.540 --> 43:09.540
And so thanks for listening.

43:09.540 --> 43:36.140
That was self-hosted episode 14.
