1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Alex I'm checking my email every single day right now because my Starlink kit is on its way

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There's gonna be a game changer for me. I think so. Yeah, like you've unlocked a

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,560
Level like you've one upped life if you've got Starlink, you know, it's funny as I started thinking, you know

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,700
Like now I need to get serious about a home PC setup

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,960
I can always like my work laptop will do or or an iPad will do

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,120
But if I'm gonna have like real internet at home now, I got to have like a real PC to connect to that. So

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,800
How's it gonna work? Cuz my understanding of Starlink is reasonably limited. I watched a couple of Jeff Gehrling videos

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,800
I think that's about as far as it goes

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Don't you have to tie it to a specific?

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,680
Grid reference so that they have enough satellite bandwidth for you to talk to like it won't work if you drive 50 miles west or something

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,140
Right. Yeah, I think it mostly turns out to be like a 30 mile

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,060
Area around your service address that you've put on your account is where it's functional. I don't I don't know yet

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,860
This is something I'm gonna play with but it sounds like it's pretty straightforward in

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,020
most cases to just update your service address and then like it takes effect in like

15
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,740
15 minutes and then you can start setting up in your new location

16
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,600
I imagine that's actually not as smooth as it's going to go

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,860
Like I'll try to do it to be like too many users in this area

18
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:21,780
I recall I was watching a guy on YouTube who was an RVer and was proclaiming that he had

19
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,420
Hacked the Starlink algorithm to let him use it anywhere in actual fact. What he was doing was he was pre staging his

20
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,180
Location in the Starlink app before he got there

21
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,860
So the systems had time to catch up or if where he got to didn't have connection to update his service address

22
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,340
I mean I could see that cuz I generally know where I'm gonna end up parking at, you know before I go there

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,940
So I could plug that in before I arrive. The other tricky thing is is I think the little dishy takes like

24
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,220
150 watts pretty much consistently once it's up and running. That's a significant amount of power

25
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,060
In fact, it's like running a whole PC. It is pretty much isn't it and they're not cheap either

26
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:05,520
So there was the $99 deposit, which I felt was fair. Okay. All right fine, and then there's like a

27
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,660
Separate four hundred and eighty five dollar fee to get the kit and the kit is everything you need

28
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,940
It's like the router Ethernet the PoE injector the dish all of it

29
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,460
But every time I check it just says pending

30
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,300
So you're six hundred dollars in the hole for this thing then and then the monthly service, of course as well

31
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,920
Oh, what does what does that cost? I think it's gonna be in the hundred dollar range

32
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:34,500
When you don't have good solid bandwidth almost any price that you can conceivably afford to pay is worth it

33
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,980
Yeah, slow internet is worse than no internet

34
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,460
That's what they say. And then once you get that good internet head over to a cloud guru

35
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,380
They are the leader in learning for the cloud Linux and other modern tech skills

36
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,160
Thousands of hands-on labs hundreds of certifications and courses and free cloud sandboxes on their credit card

37
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,820
Not yours go to cloud guru comm get certified get hired get learning

38
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:02,340
I can only imagine how having decent low ping internet. Do you have any any sense of?

39
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:09,620
The Starlink kind of ping times yet. I have done a little bit of meta analysis of the reviews and also to their credit

40
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,540
The Starlink folks kind of give you that information in the signup process when they're like, hey, this is a beta

41
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
It's gonna go down sometime

42
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,020
You're probably gonna get ping somewhere in the 40 millisecond range is what they kind of warn you for and I that's kind of what?

43
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,740
I've seen from the meta analysis of the reviews. I have seen some reviewers get it as low as 20

44
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,940
Something in the 20 to 40 would be great because 40 is about the best case

45
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,340
I'm ever going to get ever on LTE is about 40 milliseconds

46
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:43,020
and I know from having done these shows with you now for a long time an LTE connection is

47
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,260
workable, but we end up stepping on each other quite often and

48
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,120
Makes life for our editor more difficult

49
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,740
So lower the ping time for us certainly the better and also I would imagine although we'll see I'll get a sense of this

50
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:02,300
Is it would hopefully I know it drifts, but hopefully it drifts either less or more consistently

51
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,180
Than LTE where LTE is kind of all over the board depending on all the other users that are in that area

52
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:16,180
Are there any constraints around the amount of bandwidth you can consume because with LTE that's a big concern, right?

53
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,780
And as far as I know, there's no limits either

54
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:24,540
I don't know if eventually when they go public if they'll have tiered plans, but that's a huge deal. No, no, no, no

55
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,540
No, I know I know

56
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,180
Even with my quote-unquote

57
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:35,220
Unlimited LTE plans. I'm really kind of in the doghouse after 300 gigs and around 400 gigs

58
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,340
They're looking at what I'm doing and you know

59
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,100
I get the prioritized and all that kind of stuff and that is like on the extremely high end

60
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,140
Like these are elite rare plans where I can even get that far along before they start getting mad at me

61
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:55,260
That's crazy. Where are staying last week at my mother-in-law's in rural Norfolk. The only decent internet that she can get is

62
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,860
Through 4g LTE from EE in the UK and she gets 200 gigabytes a month

63
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,620
Bandwidth for her home internet and for me that was a real adjustment, you know dealing with that ping time

64
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:15,300
Dealing with that lack of bandwidth availability. Welcome to my world. I honestly don't know how you cope with it full-time

65
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,220
I know I know that's why I'm really excited about Starlink even though

66
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,540
there's the downside of putting more junk up in space, which is a serious problem and

67
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,780
These may actually be visible from the ground and maybe you know, there's we're not gonna be happy about that long term

68
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,580
But it's so obvious that at least here in the States

69
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,900
we need a solution to this because my other options are duopoly cell providers or a

70
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,420
monopoly cable provider

71
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,900
That's my options here and it just isn't is it is not long-term

72
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,340
Sustainable or tenable for something as important as our connectivity

73
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:59,460
Which is how I organize manage and run my entire business and most of my personal life is all online now

74
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:06,620
And that's true for probably nearly everyone listening to this show and so access to the internet just is so critical that I think it's kind of

75
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:13,260
Necessary that we have something like Starlink as an option and if they can get these prices down to below what I'm paying for these

76
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,460
ridiculous LTE plans I

77
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:21,020
Mean that's gonna make it more available to more people and you know, eventually to folks like Alex's mom

78
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,340
It's gonna be a game-changer for a lot of people

79
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:31,860
There are remote mountain properties that you look at these days on Zillow or rightmove or whatever and you think I'd love to know

80
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,060
It's gonna have to make a DSL. I can't I just can't even consider it, you know

81
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,340
So yeah, and I think ultimately Alex it's gonna make something like my end dream building some off-grid

82
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:50,660
Property a lot more feasible because all of the areas I've looked at in the Pacific Northwest that I could even begin to remotely afford

83
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:59,140
That have water or something like that. They're all outside a cellular range. There's nothing around there's no services and the idea

84
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:06,340
That I could go out there with my solar-powered RV and set up a little dishy and get a connection to the Internet from space

85
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,380
It's just amazing. I mean, it's huge dishy. What an adorable little name

86
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,220
Did you see that home assistant had a release this week? It seems like a big one

87
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,220
you know you it's hard to tell from the outside like

88
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,740
Which ones are kind of just the minor updates and which ones are the big ones?

89
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:27,660
And the one that came out as we're recording is the October release that came out on October 6th

90
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,660
There's a big thing in here Alex. They got official tuya integration from the folks at tuya

91
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:42,140
The people that people that organize all the tuya devices and run the tuya infrastructure have now created an official integration for home assistant

92
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,940
So here's the thing about this. I mean, I think it's awesome that we're starting to get actual vendors

93
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,220
Yeah, looking at home assistant and going yes, I want to support that

94
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:59,060
but also, you know, we've got stuff like cloudfree.shop and mylocalbytes.com and that kind of thing and

95
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:06,700
There's other things coming along with with pre-tasmota flash devices said that this becomes less important to me

96
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,380
Well even more so because this is the cloud

97
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,180
Integration. Yeah, they worked with the cloud API team not with like this the firmware team

98
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:22,100
And so this doesn't work for local integration. This uses the cloud connectivity. It looks like it's doing a really good job

99
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,740
In fact, it's much better than before much quicker all of that

100
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:31,380
It's what you'd want and it's official, but it does require their cloud API, which means it requires an internet connection

101
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,580
Which means it's a disqualifier for me. Just like you said I'd rather get a device I could control locally

102
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,460
In fact, I'd rather get a device that's not on Wi-Fi. What's your preferred poison these days?

103
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,060
Are you a Z-Wave or a ZigBee type of chat? If you go by the number of devices

104
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,180
I have it'd be it'd be Z-Wave

105
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,780
But if you go by where I plan to go to it'd be ZigBee and matter because that's gonna be one of the same

106
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,380
I think eventually yeah matter

107
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,120
I think is really kind of exciting because if a vendor adopts the matter protocol

108
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,340
Then there is a local API if you use matter

109
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,100
Then you've got a local API and like that to me is like well, that's a no-brainer

110
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:13,380
But right now I invested pretty early in Z-Wave and I've been very happy with my Z-Wave devices

111
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,820
In fact, I'll talk about that in a little bit more but for me Wi-Fi

112
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,180
It's just I like to be able to reboot my access points and maintain control of my devices

113
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,700
I don't like putting that load on my Wi-Fi network

114
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:31,580
And if it works with Z-Wave or ZigBee, I almost am guaranteed I can make it work somehow with home assistant

115
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,820
That's very true the stuff I talked about in the last episode at my dad's house that the ZigBee buttons I put in here

116
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:43,060
He's been delighted with them the the little IKEA trad free buttons. I think it's what they called

117
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,220
They're working great. So you get a plus one on ZigBee from me

118
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,480
Anyway, I'm gonna hold out with my Z-Wave devices for now

119
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,260
And then when the matter stuff settles I may make a transition but Alex with the release

120
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,460
they had a live stream kind of like a release party with the developers and they brought on the

121
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:08,380
Some of the developers from Tuya and they talked about some stats the opt-in stats that people can can get into and then send their

122
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,860
Information off anonymously. They said that for the people that have opted in they now show

123
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,420
90,000 active home assistant users

124
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,720
That's just since April when they launched this statistics package and the people who have opted into it

125
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,220
Also, the data shows that a lot of people have not updated since that April release. Oh

126
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,220
Oh

127
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,600
Boy that's a lot that's a lot of updates since they're doing a monthly now

128
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,220
Also, their analytics show that 40% of home assistant users have a Chromecast

129
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,480
40% is a huge huge number for that kind of thing

130
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,700
Home kit also shows as quite popular and the most popular hardware

131
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,220
Was the Raspberry Pi?

132
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,580
Followed closely by running home assistant in a VM like you do now

133
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,740
Do they take statistics on how many of those Raspberry Pi users are you?

134
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,660
Very fair very fair those all those stats are public at analytics dot home dash assistant dot IO

135
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
Or we'll put a link in the show notes

136
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:15,860
This is also the release for us Z wave users where it's time to migrate to Z wave JS as

137
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:23,380
Of this release it now supports s2 which is the improved security model and it's short for security to surprise surprise

138
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,380
besides improved security

139
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:32,200
Devices are also more reliable. They provide greater battery life and less latency compared to the original security mode

140
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
That was supported by Z wave JS

141
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,340
Integration will now automatically pick the best and optimal security method available

142
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,660
They have a whole new wizard for adding new devices and it looks sharp

143
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,260
Oh and speaking of wizards

144
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,740
There is now a migration wizard to migrate you from your old Z wave setup to the new Z wave JS

145
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,260
Which is what I was waiting for

146
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,460
However, when I go in my home assistant, it actually still asking me to migrate to open ZW or whatever it was

147
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,780
I don't know why but I'm still getting a migration offer to open ZW and I I don't know if I'm supposed to install

148
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,940
Z wave JS first or or what like they don't give you any information on that

149
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,060
But if your system isn't wonky like mine, they're saying go ahead and make the migration now. It's been pretty refined

150
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,820
It'll walk you through what it's gonna do and what's gonna change and then Alex the developers in the stream kind of doubled down

151
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:25,380
Which made me feel good about using Z wave. They said this Z wave JS integration is well written

152
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,900
It's well built and it is well maintained and they think it's good code. And so it's solid. It's good

153
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,140
It's a good in fact, they're gonna go for their thinking they haven't said they're gonna do this

154
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,100
But they're thinking seriously about going for official Z wave

155
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,540
Certification from the Z wave group because they're so proud of how this has turned out. Oh, really that'd be a huge success

156
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:52,980
I bought a Z wave smart door lock on some kind of sale on Black Friday

157
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,140
And it's been sat in a box ever since because I couldn't ever get it to pair

158
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,900
So maybe now is the time I can with that new s2 security support that's in there

159
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,380
Maybe I should give that another go

160
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:03,860
Yeah

161
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:09,260
And it gives you a little more information and it's a little more clear about when you should go hit the pair button on

162
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,500
The device like all of that whole process is a little smoother now

163
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,220
It looks with Z wave JS. They did a little live demonstration of a migration on the stream

164
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,980
I just remember it being frustrating as anything, you know when I tried it

165
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,260
Yeah, it feels a bit like a black box, doesn't it? But no, I think I think they're doing they're doing good things

166
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,700
So if you are a Z wave device user, which you know, I just I have I probably have somewhere

167
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,860
I think I have like a dozen Z wave devices

168
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,700
It's not it's not like an unbelievable number that I can't eventually migrate off of but I'll be using them still for a while

169
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:48,220
All right. I've got a low-key genuinely awesome feature that's come to github. I think in the last two or three months

170
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,260
load up a github repository right now you can do this live and

171
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,420
Open a repository. You just need to be logged in. That's the important thing

172
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,300
When you have that page open press full stop the period key on your keyboard and watch what happens. Oh

173
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,140
That's pretty nice. Oh, look at them

174
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,980
Yeah, all right straight into VS code web suddenly electron doesn't look so bad now hard does it?

175
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,260
It's that repository opened up in VS code, isn't it? Right? It better be. Yep. Oh, that's slick

176
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,260
Okay

177
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:27,300
impressive and then you open a file you make an edit you press save and it then is because it's part of git the

178
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,140
Git plug-in in VS code. You just commit it directly in there and boom you're done

179
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:38,100
Oh my gosh, if you're opening a third-party repository though, and you make a change and you save it

180
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,660
It asks you then if you want to fork it and then automatically helps you with the pool

181
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,780
Merge request model at github has Wow, it is so cool in the browser

182
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,580
When did they sneak this in? I don't know

183
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,340
I mean I first found it someone on our discord told me a couple of months ago about it

184
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,600
I think of course, but I've been using it a lot for my notes in the last few weeks

185
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,600
actually, I've got a private repository on github I use for notes and

186
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:12,800
I've actually just ended up using VS code in the browser on github.com. It's not very self-hosted is it but it works very well

187
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,380
And I want to mention our friends at a cloud guru have a course on the Linux kernel

188
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,960
It's a standalone course, but it's also part of a learning path to prepare you for the LPG 201 exam

189
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,580
You learn how the Linux kernel provides an interface between hardware and software

190
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:35,180
you'll compile a kernel from start to finish and of course, you'll cover kernel runtime management troubleshooting adding removing modules and

191
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,480
Modifying the modules on boot. We'll have a link in our show notes or you can go to a cloud guru and search for the

192
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
Linux kernel

193
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,860
So we were just talking about Zigbee and Zed wave and all that kind of stuff

194
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,140
So I was really excited to see that the home assistant has a new hardware project out

195
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,260
Yeah, and it's been funded the home assistant amber, which is based around the compute module 4

196
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,780
With their own board. It's got an SSD connector. It has Zigbee built-in

197
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,300
In fact the devs on the stream said no SD cards. We hate SD cards

198
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:13,180
So you can either use an SSD or it'll come with a MMC built into it. They're gonna chip it with a transparent case. I

199
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
Think maybe in part for radio

200
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,300
It's plastic for radio transparency and then they they have a whole post on why they chose transparent

201
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,220
Some models will come with a POE hat as well

202
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:30,820
It's pretty nice-looking. Although I don't know if it's gonna be as fast as the home assistant blue. Well, no, I mean my only concern

203
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,220
about this box and let me just preface everything I'm about to say with

204
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,980
the fact I think that these kind of projects from home assistant themselves are

205
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,340
Wonderful, and I'm so happy to see that they're doing it

206
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:50,900
My only concern is that putting the compute module 4 into a product at this stage in the Raspberry Pi 4's life cycle

207
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,820
Feels like we're getting towards the end of the Pi 4 cycle

208
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:02,180
Maybe are we going to be able to upgrade this to a CM 5 one day? Probably not. Will there be a home assistant?

209
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,500
Burnt sienna instead or something. I don't know but that's my only reservation. Everything else looks great

210
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,140
Yeah, perhaps that could be an issue

211
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,940
I don't know if we know for sure if there will be a compute module 5 this may be a you know

212
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,580
Once every few years. That's a good point Christopher

213
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:23,300
the other thing that holds the Raspberry Pi 4 back right now is

214
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,180
Absolutely the IO situation and they solve that with emmc or an SSD

215
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,300
you know, I mean it's no x86 box, right like

216
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,420
I've got jobs where I need more powerful systems, but

217
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,900
I am doing more than ever with my Pi 4. I mean now it's doing MQTT and it's doing

218
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,780
energy metric collection and and graphing and

219
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,820
It's still just chugging right along like it's just oh and also for a short period of time

220
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,740
I even ran the wise bridge on it

221
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,740
It was still doing just fine

222
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,060
Oh that thing chomps the CPU only with two camera feeds. Let me be clear and I turned it off

223
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:06,820
I did turn it off, but it was but home assistant everything was still working like it still has a little bit of oomph to spare

224
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:14,260
It still has a little bit of oomph to spare and uh, I could see the compute 4 module being enough machine

225
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,460
For most people until you get into more advanced logging and graphing and stuff like that

226
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:26,340
So what does this mean for the blue then moving forward? Well, it seems like the blue is kind of gonna phase out over time

227
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,420
Uh, I think the words used were we're gonna take the lessons learned

228
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,100
And we're applying that to the amber one thing about the blue that

229
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:40,900
Was noted by the developers is that it's a board that they took that already existed

230
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,420
And then, you know, they flashed home assistant onto it

231
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,300
but if you want zigbee or z wave or matter support you got to add a dongle and

232
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:57,220
It's it's not really flexible in that regard where uh, this is a device that they kind of control the board that the compute module

233
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,340
Is going to sit in they can integrate things like zigbee. They can do things like poe

234
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,660
Poe and it seems like when you look at also their hardware stats

235
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,660
We talked about earlier and you see so many so many users are using the raspberry pi

236
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,380
It probably makes sense from like a software

237
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:22,820
End user reliability stability standpoint to base your core product on that same platform if you can

238
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:30,180
Because then improvements you make there are going to benefit everybody else also using the raspberry pi that isn't running on an amber

239
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:36,500
They're just on a pi. Yeah, I hadn't considered that angle. That's an interesting one and alex if you if you'll allow me there's one small

240
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,380
Update in this october home assistant release that I wanted to talk about

241
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,460
It wasn't initially going to cover so I feel kind of embarrassed but it's icons

242
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:51,300
They updated the material design icons to version six. They've added 400 new icons

243
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,060
and

244
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,100
um

245
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,060
if you haven't done this yet to your home assistant update, I know all this has been very homeless assistant specific, but

246
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:05,220
I tell you what. It made me love my dashboard a little bit more when I went in there and just tweaked the icons

247
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:12,340
For all the different entities. So they all have unique individual icons that represent what they are and rumor has it based on

248
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,660
What the devs accidentally said on the live stream. They're going to include in the

249
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,660
lovelace

250
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:24,900
Wizard a new icon picker soon that lets you easily pick from these icons. Oh good because the mdi

251
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,420
Mdi website that you pick the icons from

252
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,980
Slow is the slowest damn web page to load on the entire freaking internet. I swear so slow so bad. Yeah

253
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,860
I i'm glad they have it but it's so slow

254
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,660
Yeah, so they're gonna have an icon picker. It'll be built in

255
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,940
And these these material design icons are in home assistant

256
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:50,020
There's so many for your different devices that just kind of give you a nice visual indicator what it do. Mm-hmm

257
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,660
You gotta know what it do

258
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,660
Lino.com

259
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,220
Slash ssh talk about people who know what they are doing. They've been doing this since

260
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,620
2003 one of the very first companies in cloud computing that's

Slash-ssh man, that's the circle of life for us

268
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,880
Plus you can go in there and just see how great it is

269
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,720
It really is a fantastic service with great performance and they've really invested in the dashboard and the hardware and the networking and well

270
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,440
The whole stack really like if you want to switch over from zoom to jitzy

271
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,120
They got a one-click deployment for that and it's like a great opportunity to take advantage of our $100 credit

272
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,560
They really have the best in class experience because they've been focusing on making this great for the last 18 years

273
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Their mission has remained unchanged

274
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:10,640
Making cloud computing accessible affordable for all and once you get in you'll see that they have things like s3 compatible object storage

275
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
There's so much you can do with that

276
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,080
They have bare metal servers

277
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,000
If your application load requires that ddos protection vlan support a powerful dns manager

278
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,840
And if you like to do your infrastructure by code, they've got terraform and kubernetes support to help you

279
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,560
Well integrate with everything else you're doing and with pricing 30 to 50 cheaper

280
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,800
Maybe it's a great opportunity to go multi-cloud. Why get locked into a single vendor?

281
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,440
Leno can help you spread that out

282
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,040
So you're not just dependent on one hyperscaler and as we've seen just the week that we're recording sometimes

283
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,720
Sometimes they go down and if you ever get stuck linode has the best customer support in the industry

284
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,120
They really have amazing 24 7 customer support by phone ticket or social

285
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,760
And then they back all that up with hundreds of guides and thousands of tutorials

286
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,560

Now what were you doing earlier in the week you weren't you know messing about with bgp routes were you

291
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,800
No, no, i'm not pushing out changes to remove dns entries

292
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,920
Uh, just you know

293
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,600
Of course listeners are probably picking up on the fact that this is the week that facebook went down

294
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,960
And alex and I are watching this with popcorn going. Oh, could you imagine what it's like to be on site right now?

295
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,200
Where they can't even badge in let alone figure out why everything's down

296
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,520
What a nightmare or send each other an email. That's the thing like, you know, bob at facebook.com would no longer work

297
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,360
Would it man if uh, if uh, if I didn't know any better, I think somebody probably lost their job

298
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,920
Well, I mean the conspiracy theorist in me wonders. It's all a little fishy that it happened on the exact same

299
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,440
Week as the uh testimony the whistleblower thing

300
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,200
You know

301
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,080
Is it a deflection tactic or is it just genuine genuinely a screw up? I I don't know but

302
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,760
You gotta wonder sometimes. I don't think it was a deflection tactic. I mean it was if it was that was a very significant self-inflicted wound

303
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,400
Yeah, true. I actually saw one of my neighbors sharing on facebook today

304
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,280
10 facebook alternatives for 2021. I thought that was so funny

305
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:33,280
Yeah, and telegram saw a massive rush of new users, you know, i'd buy an insider

306
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,680
Job before i'd buy an intentional screw up, you know like rage quit kind of thing. Yeah, maybe

307
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,600
Maybe the zuck didn't give somebody the smoked meats they were after

308
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,880
I've been a little too distracted to really pay attention though. I got I got sucked into the rabbit hole of energy monitoring, right?

309
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,320
Yeah, because you're you're back home now

310
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,360
So you've actually got some free time instead of just driving all day

311
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,080
And home assistant while I was on the roads

312
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,360
I didn't have a chance to really look at it added energy monitoring support where you can actually like get some

313
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,720
Good stats and whatnot in home assistant. Mm-hmm

314
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,720
And identify batteries and utility sources and and even like, you know fuel consumption costs

315
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
If you want to monitor that

316
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
So I thought okay, I got to try this

317
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,120
And I have a couple of z wave smart plugs that do energy monitoring. I've never really used that

318
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,800
So that is sort of the route that I looked at this like well, why don't why don't I try to see if I can?

319
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,560
get my existing

320
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,240
smart plugs to work

321
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,320
And for listeners that don't remember I have I have two setups. I have a home automation setup in my rv

322
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,880
Which is pretty extensive and then I have like a mini version at the studio

323
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
it's like a smaller instance of

324
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,000
of uh home home assistant it runs on the home assistant blue

325
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,880
And in a way it's it's often kind of like a good testing ground because it's so much simpler

326
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,480
there's just there's less entities to go through and all that kind of stuff and

327
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
I noticed after the update

328
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,160
To the home assistant blues version of home assistant, which is comes out at the same time. Everybody else does

329
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,240
that

330
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,680
I just had energy monitoring like my belkin wemo plugs that I happen to have that I only use here in the studio

331
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,400
We're just reporting their energy usage and home assistant had like a little

332
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,540
Diagram of where power was going and how much power had been used that day and I thought

333
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,380
Wow

334
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,500
That looks great. I'd love to have that at home where I actually care about my power and all that kind of stuff

335
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,940
I thought to myself

336
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,180
So I go home and I don't have any of that

337
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:40,180
My plugs are monitoring their draw. They're seeing how many how many watts are being used

338
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,100
But home assistant couldn't care less. It's like if I bring up the sensor. Yeah, it knows how many watts are being used

339
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,900
But when I go to configure an energy device, it's just

340
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,500
Whatever bro. There's no devices giving you any stats for some reason. I've just got this picture of home assistant being like

341
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,020
this

342
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,420
Uh beavis and butthead style character sat on a couch in the corner with a backwards baseball cap and a cigarette in the other hand going

343
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,020
Whatever bro. I don't care. Yeah, you can't have that. I don't care and it's so to me

344
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:15,540
It's like okay. There's something wrong. Obviously these devices are like not giving home assistant the information you need

345
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,260
But when you go into the developer tools and you look at the state attributes and the states it's sending back

346
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,580
It's clearly saying this is the amount of power being consumed

347
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:31,940
It's in the watts format and it is this many watts like it's easily readable by the human eye and i'm thinking to myself

348
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,140
What's going on here? Why can't I see this power draw?

349
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,340
And I want to I want to not only get an overview of my power draw

350
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,500
But I want to start building automations that say

351
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,620
Hey, hey when two appliances when these two smart plugs because I can just say these two together

352
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,300
They're on one circuit. I know that so when these two smart plugs both have a draw over 500 watts

353
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,180
Turn off the heater smart plug always turn it off

354
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,940
So that way the wife can turn on the toaster and when it starts drawing a thousand watts

355
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,260
It turns off the heater that's drawing 800 watts

356
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,460
And that's that's essentially what I want. And if anybody has a blueprint or a good advice on how to set that up

357
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,900
Please let me know

358
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,580
Ultimately, that's what i'm trying to get to I haven't gotten there yet. But what I did do

359
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:17,800
Is I managed to get my damn energy monitor and it took quite a journey. I have to say because of ultimately

360
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,420
You have to get the data in the format that home assistant wants

361
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,980
So first you got to have home assistant 2021.8 or newer

362
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:33,460
And you need a smart plug or an energy monitoring device like one of those clamp devices or a shelly

363
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,500
That reports in kilowatt hours

364
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,740
all my plugs

365
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,740
report in watts

366
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,040
As in watts currently being consumed

367
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,380
Home assistant wants kilowatt hours and then it'll do all the math for you from there

368
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,160
So what you have to do is you have to get an integration

369
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,120
called

370
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,180
integration

371
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,100
It's a math integration

372
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:04,820
Which will take the watts and convert them into kilowatt hours for you and then produce a new sensor

373
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,100
That shows that energy information in kilowatt hours

374
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,020
I have a configuration.yaml entry example in the show notes

375
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,900
Then once you have that

376
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,180
The new energy utilities that are built into home assistant will see this device as something it can pull stats from

377
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,980
And we'll start giving you your usage. So I have to go through for each one of my smart plugs

378
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,700
And I have to do this. I have to create this

379
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,860
like this template sensor that takes

380
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,060
information from the state of my smart plug

381
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,540
And formats it in a way that home assistant wants and I have the examples in the show notes

382
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,820
But I had to go deep because I had to learn a little bit of how templating works

383
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,740
I had to I had to learn about

384
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,740
creating new kinds of sensors

385
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,060
It was it was really quite the journey

386
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:55,700
I I naively expected to just do the update get energy monitoring and see my smart plugs report in there

387
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:02,740
Boy, was I wrong. Sometimes we get a bit spoiled with home system. Don't we it picks up so much. It does so much and then

388
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,820
Occasionally, we actually have to break out some uh davinci code to find out what we actually wanted

389
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,980
I think this is one of those examples and I felt like there was so much out there that

390
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,100
Didn't apply since the new energy monitoring was introduced. So like a lot of the help

391
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,220
was old and no longer relevant and

392
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,180
Because my smart plugs I guess aren't as common. Um, there's not as many people that have solved this problem

393
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,540
So just yeah, it was I felt like I was searching

394
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,340
Niche resources and it took me a while to even just try to figure out the language

395
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,780
I need and figure out what the requirements were of home assistant and all of that

396
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,460
That is a real problem with with projects like home assistant that moves so fast to see it a lot with kubernetes at work as well

397
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,260
is

398
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,260
that kind of uh

399
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,940
google entropy of of stuff like

400
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:59,060
A post, you know google will think a year old post isn't too old to surface as the top result

401
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,660
When in actual fact in home assistant land that may as well be 10 years ago

402
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,780
Yeah, that's exactly right. Um, and then you know alex when I got it all kind of done

403
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,820
I realized it's okay

404
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:16,260
It's pretty basic at this point because I don't have all of my battery and solar information in there

405
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:22,100
It really wasn't worth the journey. I actually like the dashboards I created myself

406
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:29,220
Better and i'll have a few links in the show notes it it involved uh setting up a history stats integration

407
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:35,540
So I could collect historical information about my power usage and then I used a utility meter integration

408
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,180
and that let my

409
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,900
Virtual energy monitors i'd set up that produce kilowatt hours show up as a utility source now

410
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,460
That lets me do all kinds of things like now I have a dashboard

411
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,940
That shows me

412
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,700
if today

413
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,740
My heaters are using more power than they were say three days ago. I have a three-day window

414
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,380
On my power usage of my heaters

415
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,780
And I can kind of tell

416
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
When i'm kind of using more power and maybe

417
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,580
I can make adjustments based on that if I want I actually haven't decided to take any action on that right now

418
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,080
I'm, just collecting the information and collecting historical information

419
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,700
And so when summer comes around i'll have a totally, you know different set of data

420
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,320
And then when the whole year is completed, I think the information is going to be pretty fascinating

421
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:25,140
And i'll probably be able to overlay it with temperature information and all kinds of stuff. So I brought together

422
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,140
the history stats integration with the utility meter

423
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:35,960
Integration and I have again an example of what that looks like in your configuration.yaml linked in the show notes

424
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,080
So now what that's done is it's created these virtual sensors that i've built dashboards around in home assistant

425
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,280
They give me all this information that I think that's where they're going with the built-in energy support

426
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,680
But I like my version better that I built myself

427
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,640
It's not too bad actually 17 lines of code to do all that history stat stuff. It's not

428
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:58,440
Unreasonable and it's very readable like it all makes sense when you read it. You can see what i'm doing

429
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,040
It's there's nothing tricky about it. Yeah, that's very true. Now something else we've talked about on the show previously is

430
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,360
de-googlifying

431
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,680
I'll be honest on whilst i've been in england. I haven't been paying much attention to that

432
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,080
I've just been getting on with the business of traveling

433
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,440
however

434
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:21,400
You mentioned in lup this week, uh linux unplugged dot com slash 426 a tool called tube sync

435
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,000
Yeah, think of tube sync as a pvr for youtube you give it

436
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,880
channels and playlists or if you're familiar with sonar it's like sonar for youtube

437
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,360
And then it goes out and pulls down the videos and it gives you a dashboard to tell you

438
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,760
How many video sources you're pulling from?

439
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,000
What's coming up next exactly like you might expect from something like sonar?

440
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,600
It's a pretty advanced ui and there's a docker compose that gets most of it set up for you, too

441
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,840
Alex including the elastic search stuff. You might need now the reason I brought this up on this show

442
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,920
uh is is this isn't linux unplugged extras, but uh,

443
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,920
Uh, I actually found something called media cms dot io and this is essentially

444
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,440
a youtube front end clone. So what I was thinking about doing was

445
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,840
Originally anyway, I was going to use tube sync to download the videos from youtube just as an archiving

446
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:13,960
type

447
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,560
uh utility

448
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:22,920
Bring them into plex maybe because there are some people on the plex forums that have youtube metadata agents and that kind of thing

449
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:29,800
But I think what I might end up doing is using this media cms. Ios to self host my own kind of

450
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,560
Pseudo youtube instance thing. Have you seen this? Oh, this is neat

451
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:42,120
Yes, and it it is obviously inspired by the youtube ui but good on them. They've taken the best elements in this

452
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,320
And I think it looks really solid. They got dark mode. They got light mode

453
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:53,000
And it could really end up making a perfect curated youtube and wow

454
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,400
I could I could see it being a lot of work for what you want to do

455
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,600
Man, this could be a slam dunk for parents

456
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,080
This could be a great way

457
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,800
You could take tube sync and pull in the approved channels that you're comfortable with your kids watching

458
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,280
Have tube sync pull it down to the file system

459
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,120
And then point media cms right at that and it's a curated youtube

460
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,440
I wonder how they handle video transcoding because obviously youtube has

461
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,240
A whole bunch of stuff when you upload video to it

462
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:25,400
It transcodes to all the different formats and then you just switch on the fly the the quality that you're streaming does

463
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,880
Does this have any function for that? I don't see any quality options in the playback. Oh, yeah. No, it's under the settings

464
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,200
It's right there and it says it has multiple transcoding profiles same defaults

465
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,840
It says for multiple dimensions from 20 from 240p up to 1080p

466
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,120
Experimental support for remote workers. So I guess there's a stuff a bunch of stuff. We could figure out there

467
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,320
That's this could be a fun project. That's something to put on our list after I get done solving energy

468
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,800
Yeah, and then world hunger and world peace and uh

469
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,440
Covid as well. You got to solve that one, too

470
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,400
And then and then we'll get on redoing jb.com

471
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,360
But we do have one thing we can solve for people if they are an icloud

472
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,960
Slash iphone user and you got your pictures up there. You came across a really handy tool

473
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,880
To help pull all of your icloud photos down locally to your machine. Yeah, we were talking about this

474
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,640
Where was it in the jupiter broadcasting telegram chat actually?

475
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,400
Someone was asking, you know, how do you back up your iphone?

476
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:32,600
Pictures and stuff like that because of the way that ios has very restrictive background api kind of it

477
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,080
kills anything in the background that's

478
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,160
Going to drain battery unlike android. That's a lot more permissive

479
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
It means you can't run stuff like

480
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:47,800
Resilio sync or sync thing very effectively or there's another one on android called folder sync

481
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,120
and so

482
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:55,560
This neat app is actually called gimme-i photos, which is kind of a funny name

483
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,000
And this sidesteps all of ios's problems

484
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,680
With backgrounding api's and on device, you know

485
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,320
Image management and stuff like that

486
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,440
Because it hooks directly into icloud

487
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,200
The only caveat being is you got to be okay with putting your photos up in icloud

488
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,720
But I think what alex is driving at there

489
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,040
It's like that's the only one that's really going to work reliably with the way the iphone backgrounding works

490
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,840
If you want them off the phone reliably automatically, it's going to have to be icloud photo on an iphone

491
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,800
So that's why this is so great and because it's python

492
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,200
You don't have to be on a mac. You could run it on a linux box or a windows box, too

493
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:35,480
Yeah, I ran this just on a normal linux server. I think I ran it out of a container because i'm

494
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,800
That's just who I am

495
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,440
The really nice thing about it and I didn't expect this at all

496
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,240
I didn't even think about this until I tried it

497
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,820
It uses a python library underneath which actually supports the icloud two-factor authentication

498
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,560
mechanisms

499
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,520
So when I brought this up for the first time a little pop-up appeared on my mac to say hey

500
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:02,120
Someone's trying to log in as you back in rally. Is this you and here's your two-factor code and I was like, huh?

501
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,640
Did not expect that

502
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,680
Yeah, that made me feel a little bit better that it was kind of legit about how it's authorizing against the icloud servers

503
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,400
It seems to be using like an official apple api for that

504
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,200
And I think it's great for running on your nas. If you've got a nas box that you can shell into

505
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,640
You could go into your directory of choice on your nas and execute this thing and it's just going to sit there and download

506
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,920
Photos all day long and I think for me the absolute killer

507
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,160
Use case are like my parents phones, you know a couple of parents use android a couple use

508
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,840
ios

509
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:37,320
And the ios ones i've really struggled to get the photos out of icloud into anything

510
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,700
Meaningful off their phones into anything meaningful like next cloud even is a bit of a crap shoot on ios

511
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,260
And this just solves that problem

512
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:52,860
Altogether i'm not the only thing i'm not totally certain on is how long that two-factor authentication token lasts for

513
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:58,860
And I guess time will tell but uh, i'm going to set this up for my parents this week whilst i'm here and then

514
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,420
report back when it uh

515
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,340
You know in six months and let you know how it's how it's gone. And are you thinking just cronit?

516
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,260
So it just runs automatically every night or something. Yeah, exactly

517
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,660
Put it put it on a timer and then let it download every day every week. Whatever. Yeah

518
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,380
Yeah, that will be interesting to see how long that two-factor authentication

519
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,580
If it is it I bet you it must have some time expiration

520
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:25,040
So you'll have to check back in and see if either a it generates a new prompt or b just breaks quietly

521
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,460
Backblaze.com

522
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:36,220

All the data and backblaze now has over an exabyte of customer data backed up and counting with 50 billion files restored for their customers

526
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,300
You can do web restores

527
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,580
If that's how you like to roll you can restore files by the app

528
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,980
If that's how you want to get to files on the go

529
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:10,380
I don't know how you do and they also offer restore by mail check this out a flash key or a hard drive that you

530
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:14,860
Can grab from them ship to your door overnight with your data restored to it

531
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:20,380
But here's the best part if you send the hard drive back within 30 days you get a full refund

532
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,180
Now that's some peace of mind if you lose your data and you've got a lot of things you're going to need to recover

533
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,900
It's nice having a physical hard drive mailed to you overnight by fedex

534
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,980
And if you're worried about accidentally deleting files for an extra two dollars a month

535
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,700
You can increase your retention history to one year

536
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,940
Their mobile apps mean you can get access to those same files when you're out and about on the go

537
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:47,980
And of course backblaze has been recommended by new york times by macworld by tom's guide nine to five mac and many more

538
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,800
But why not go see it for yourself? You get a free 15 day trial at backblaze.com

ssh 15 days means plenty of time to upload and download some files and get a real feel for the service

541
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,360
And you know backblaze has been around for a while

542
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,700
They started 14 years ago to create a business that's equally fair and good for its customers partners employees

543
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,960
investors and the greater community and since

544
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,560
2013 they've been publishing their hard drive reports

545
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,520
That's a report

546
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,880
We make sure to never miss and it's a real value to the entire industry too because of the amount of disks

547
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,080
The real scale that backblaze is working with they can get some genuine insights and now after 14 years

ssh

553
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,220
Now I mentioned tail scale in the last episode which was a brand new project to me

554
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,060
But it turns out a lot of you guys had already figured this one out well ahead of me

555
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:05,460
And zahid writes in hello. I was just listening to your latest episode and heard about your love for tail scale

556
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:12,580
Not sure if you're aware, but there are synology packages available for it as well. Keep up the great work. Cheers zahid

557
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,900
Hey, that's handy. Yeah, it really is

558
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,140
I mean that was actually the only reason I ended up looking at uh tail scale in the first place was

559
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:24,820
I was futzing about with that synology naz ready to put it at my mom's house and uh, I was like

560
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,860
What's this tail scale thing? I'm pretty sure i've heard of it

561
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,300
and then I did a bit of research figured out it was wire guard and was like

562
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,940
I'll just give this a go

563
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:39,460
And then within 10 minutes i'd built out everything I was trying to achieve with wire guard for several days prior

564
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,340
So no kidding huge fan of tail scale and it you know real success story

565
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:50,260
My mom took it back from my mother-in-law's house where she you know came to meet my daughter and stuff like that

566
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:57,140
Took it back to her house plugged in one ethernet cable the power cable pressed the on button on the synology

567
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:03,620
And within a couple of minutes it had booted and tail scale had registered it. I didn't have to do any dynamic dns

568
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:09,140
No, firewall changes. It was just magic. I swear. It was awesome

569
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,900
That's why we've been seeing so much love this week erno writes and i'm beyond ecstatic

570
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:20,500
I listened to episode 54 self-hosted on my way to my morning mountain biking and as soon as I came home

571
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,580
I had to try tail scale

572
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:27,220
It was pretty cool based on alex's explanation. But now that I tried it, it's even cooler

573
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,780
They make it super easy to set up. I think i've been setting up wire guard for weeks

574
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,580
But this well this just takes care of all of it for me

575
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,500
I have it installed on my phone kabuntu desktop and my linode server

576
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,940
I plan on installing it on my o droid running in armbian and i'm planning on setting up some kind of sync thing

577
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,460
We'll see but so far. I am super ecstatic. Thank you so much for your mention of tail scale

578
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:56,180
And chris glad you made it back to washington alex. I hope you're enjoying the motherland sincerely erno from virginia

579
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:01,540
I think I weigh at least 90 of fish and chips now good for you having been back here for a month

580
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,980
That's what I do, too. I'd have to fish and chips and curry

581
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,940
So taylor writes in thanks so much for the amazing show that is self-hosted every two weeks

582
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,260
I'm refreshing my podcatcher like a madman

583
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,460
I was just catching up on episode 54 and could relate to alex's remote access woes

584
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,080
Tail scale is a solution that seems to be popular on reddit and irc

585
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:26,840
But I wanted to mention something that has been working really well for me and that is zero tier

586
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,920
Now zero tier is a distributed wan solution that essentially creates a global overlay network

587
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Kind of like nebula does

588
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,640
It's open source and self-hostable

589
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,640
With nas packages third party web management guis and so on

590
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,360
They just released a dns solution as well

591
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,440
Which sounds very similar to the tail scale magic dns offering?

592
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,440
And I just wanted to give you guys another self-hosted option. Thanks for the show

593
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,840
I definitely want to give head scale a try

594
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:00,040
that's why i'm kind of waiting to replace nebula with tail scale is I want to see how

595
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,560
Viable it is to use head scale and uh self-host the server component of tail scale

596
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,440
But that also looks really great. It does there's so many options. I just had to give a plug for nebula, too

597
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,480
now the only thing about zero tier that

598
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,880
Kind of gives me it's just a one or two percent pause

599
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:24,840
Is that the protocol is custom whereas the tail scale protocol is based around wire guard. So

600
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,120
I mean who's to say one is better than the other but uh, I love me some wire guard

601
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,320
If I were a betting man, alex, I know which one I would bet on

602
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:40,520
It's not it's not one that's been made up. Uh, I really I respect the wire guard project immensely

603
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,960
So that's just clearly like the one I would put my trust in if my data was was truly critical

604
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,560
I want to mention uh, thank you

605
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,920
Everybody who went to self-hosted dot show slash contact and sent in their question

606
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,240
We also have the discord community self-host dot show slash discord, which is always popping off

607
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:01,000
And our matrix community is also growing. There's a good conversation of self-hosters going on

608
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,000
You can find our matrix server. We have a jupiter broadcasting dot com matrix server and

609
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,200
Probably the easiest way to just get like a quick guide

610
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,120
Is to actually go to linux unplugged dot com slash matrix. I haven't put that up anywhere else yet

611
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,720
But there is a community growing out there in matrix land of self-hosters. Oh chris. What have you done?

612
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:25,000
You've invited another set of notifications into my life. Thank you so much. Oh, oh, I know alex. I know so well

613
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:33,080
But you know i'm i'm trying to assemble the troops because i'm so close to getting this automation bliss where

614
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:38,200
You know, my my goal is to make it so my wife no longer has to worry about blowing

615
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,520
A 15 amp circuit if we have a heater going and she wants to run the toaster

616
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,880
I want home assistant to figure it out and I know uh, like our guest matt and others out there have done this

617
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,560
But I could use some wisdom

618
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,120
So the matrix server is a great spot to let me know

619
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,720
Because i'm i'm trying to drop in on the matrix from time to time the discord's also really great or telegram

620
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,920
How have you solved this particular problem? What should I do?

621
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,520
And will my z-wave devices update fast enough because it seems like there's sometimes like a 20 second lag

622
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,440
All these things show your wisdom

623
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,280
Let's get this energy monitoring figured out because I think this is going to be big in the self-hosting community

624
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,560
And as always I want to give a big thank you to our sre subscribers. You make this show possible

625
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:23,960
You can go to self-hosted. Show slash sre to support the show and you can find us on twitter

626
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,920
Alex is over there at ironic badger. I'm at chris las and the show at self-hosted show

627
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:35,020
