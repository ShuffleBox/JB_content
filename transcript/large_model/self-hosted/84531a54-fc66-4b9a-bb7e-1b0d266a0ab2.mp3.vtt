WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.480
Coming up on the show, we react to home assistant password shaming both of us and then attempt to solve an age-old cloud problem.

00:07.160 --> 00:10.480
Backups. I'm Chris. And I'm Alex and this is Self Hosted.

00:11.680 --> 00:14.200
The podcast is the middle-aged man now. We're 40.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.520
Yeah, the podcast is feeling like he's still got some pet left in him

00:18.520 --> 00:24.560
but also has a few miles on him or her. Midlife crisis coming up. Is it a, is the podcast,

00:24.560 --> 00:29.400
does it have a gender? It's a thing, right? The podcast prefers to be referred to as they.

00:33.960 --> 00:40.480
Podcast pronouns. Yeah, there's a title right there. I'll tell you what. Anyway, you were gonna tell me about your off-grid solar stuff.

00:40.480 --> 00:45.120
We've not heard about that for a while. We were chatting about this just before we hit record because I'm off-grid and

00:46.400 --> 00:47.740
podcasting on solar right now.

00:47.740 --> 00:52.000
I was just talking to you actually because you're thinking about getting solar and I think that the thing

00:52.000 --> 00:54.440
that people have to wrap their head around is

00:55.040 --> 01:01.080
what are you planning for? Are you planning for like a grid blackout or brownout? Are you planning for going out into the woods?

01:01.480 --> 01:03.480
What's your scenario? And

01:03.800 --> 01:09.040
then how much battery do you really need versus could you supplement with a generator? Like for me right now,

01:09.040 --> 01:11.480
I think I've hit a sweet spot of

01:12.160 --> 01:14.040
enough battery

01:14.040 --> 01:18.480
capacity that I can run on it for a day or so and if it's a sunny day out,

01:18.480 --> 01:22.040
I can get charged. I can get a 30-40% charge right now in the winter,

01:22.280 --> 01:25.240
but I can't get a hundred percent charge off of solar right now.

01:25.240 --> 01:31.640
And so I need to run the generator for about an hour once a day right now when I'm off-grid and

01:32.640 --> 01:38.160
that's fine. I feel like that's actually a really good spot because the more battery you have, the more generator or solar you're gonna need.

01:38.760 --> 01:42.880
You can't, you know, you can't charge all you have to have the ability to charge all that stuff up.

01:42.880 --> 01:47.760
So I feel like I've kind of hit the sweet spot that because it's winter, you know, we're not getting prime sunshine.

01:47.760 --> 01:52.800
And I'm only running the generator about once a day and otherwise we're getting, we're getting along.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.240
I think I'm kind of in that sweet spot.

01:54.240 --> 01:58.720
And I think that's something you should think about when you're speccing out your solar system for your house is

01:58.800 --> 02:02.240
what are you covering for? Are you covering for a couple of days of no power?

02:02.240 --> 02:04.600
Or do you really just need to cover for a couple of hours?

02:04.600 --> 02:08.000
And if it goes longer, maybe you could run a generator for an hour or two.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.360
I think I want to cover just the the average daily low-level load of the house.

02:13.360 --> 02:18.800
I want to make the house more sustainable. So, you know, like just all the lighting, all the computers that are on in here,

02:19.440 --> 02:21.440
whatever that works out to be.

02:21.440 --> 02:27.520
My electric bill is normally in a sort of hundred to hundred and twenty-ish dollar range. So it's not too crazy.

02:28.840 --> 02:35.400
And for me, it's about sustainability and I was watching a David Attenborough program, Our Perfect Planet, the other night.

02:35.760 --> 02:41.560
Beautiful 4k HDR on the LG OLED. Oh, it was magical to watch that thing.

02:41.560 --> 02:42.960
Streaming from the Plex server.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.280
Correct. Yeah, through the Nvidia Shield.

02:45.840 --> 02:53.200
You can't help but watch these Perfect Planet things and be left with a sense of guilt about what humanity is doing to the planet

02:53.200 --> 02:56.400
and how we're consuming too many resources and stuff like that.

02:56.400 --> 03:03.280
So, you know, I think about how I might be in a position to do something about that as just an individual

03:03.680 --> 03:09.040
when in reality we need to as a species collectively actually effect change.

03:09.040 --> 03:17.040
But as an individual, there isn't much I can do, but reducing my use of fossil fuels even by a little bit feels like a good place to start.

03:17.280 --> 03:22.400
Yeah, I love the idea of even just offsetting the computers that run all the time.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.240
So during the day, I've reached the point where all day long I'm running off the solar power.

03:26.240 --> 03:32.320
I'm bringing in more solar power than I am using, which is a great spot to be because that means my home server,

03:32.560 --> 03:35.680
all my stuff is being sustained by the sun.

03:35.680 --> 03:40.480
And I'd love to do a similar setup at the studio, a couple of panels on the roof.

03:40.480 --> 03:47.520
If I could just bring in, you know, 400 watts or so, I could probably cover most of my computer gear that's running 24-7.

03:47.520 --> 03:52.880
And, you know, I think about long term Alex, say even just 10 years, 15 years down the road,

03:52.880 --> 03:56.320
maybe the majority of cars or all cars sold will be electric.

03:56.800 --> 04:04.400
How does the grid in the United States, at least, handle that if we don't have some people offsetting their load with solar?

04:04.400 --> 04:10.320
It seems like long term, the direction things are going between crypto mining and electric cars,

04:10.320 --> 04:12.320
there's going to be more demand on the grid than ever.

04:12.320 --> 04:17.200
So being able to supplement a little bit might not only just be a nice thing to do for the environment,

04:17.200 --> 04:19.520
but also ensure that you have enough power to go around.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.040
Free Bitcoin, baby.

04:21.360 --> 04:25.520
Yep. Get that crypto going and maybe, maybe spend your time learning.

04:25.520 --> 04:28.000
This episode is brought to you by the all new A Cloud Guru.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.400
They are the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux and other modern tech skills.

04:32.400 --> 04:32.960
Go check them out.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.680
They have hundreds of courses and thousands of hands on labs.

04:35.680 --> 04:40.080
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru dot com.

04:40.080 --> 04:46.960
You could spend that time mining crypto or you could spend that time learning job skills and getting hired.

04:46.960 --> 04:57.040
But, you know, I think maybe you and I are thinking about off grid and backup power today because a lot of our listener services are down and offline as we record this right now.

04:57.040 --> 04:57.760
That's right. Yeah.

04:57.760 --> 05:06.560
OVH, one of the largest VPS providers in Europe, have suffered a major fire this week and it's, it's taken,

05:06.560 --> 05:16.160
literally taken out one of their data centers and had dramatic effects on some of their other regions, data centers, whatever they called for OVH as well.

05:16.160 --> 05:21.520
It's just got me thinking, great, there's another disaster that I hadn't really thought about.

05:21.520 --> 05:25.040
What if AWS or DigitalOcean or Linode, what if they catch fire?

05:25.040 --> 05:27.040
Oh, that's another one to plan for.

05:27.040 --> 05:35.040
Yeah, the thing that's tricky about OVH is data centers one through four, we're all kind of like in the same area.

05:35.040 --> 05:41.280
So after midnight on the Wednesday of the week, we're recording this OVH cloud had an alarm go off.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.400
The cause as of this recording right now is still unknown.

05:44.400 --> 05:49.600
However, the founder and CEO speculated it may have been a UPS fire.

05:49.600 --> 05:58.240
And he noted in a video update that he released a couple of days ago that UPS number seven had been serviced earlier that day.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.120
But obviously more investigation is required.

06:01.120 --> 06:10.240
In total, OVH had four data centers in this area and one data center, SPG two was just totally destroyed by fire.

06:10.240 --> 06:17.680
And then part of SPG one was also damaged and then SPG three and four, they're fine.

06:17.680 --> 06:22.800
But as we record, there's still some outages because there's some areas the staff can't get to.

06:22.800 --> 06:32.080
There's network issue, there's still some power issues, and there's even the fact that they still have to validate that the cooling system is still fully functional.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.000
It's like bad, Alex.

06:34.000 --> 06:42.000
This is a weird one to me because every data center that I've worked near or in in some occasions,

06:42.000 --> 06:54.800
they've all had argon fire suppressant systems and just fire was something that you kind of assumed would never get out of control in a data center because it's a controlled environment.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.280
There isn't a huge amount of flammable stuff like on a data center floor.

06:59.280 --> 07:02.960
It's just metal boxes with some cables and stuff like that, essentially.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.400
So it's kind of surprising to me that it was able to get to this level.

07:06.400 --> 07:10.480
I mean, if you look at some of the pictures and we've got a Reuters article linked in the show notes.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.480
That building was toast.

07:12.480 --> 07:22.320
Yeah, the CEO says something about it using the older style construction techniques and that the newer buildings that weren't damaged were using the newer style.

07:22.320 --> 07:30.000
I wonder if that style is fire suppression, you know, or materials or something.

07:30.000 --> 07:38.720
But it kind of got us thinking like, you know, we got kind of a sad note in from listener Kerry said my server was in data center one and I have lost it, I'm afraid.

07:38.720 --> 07:47.520
I didn't have any complete backups because I didn't really have anywhere to back up to that server already blew my personal self-hosting budget.

07:47.520 --> 07:50.480
I feel like I've lost a loved one.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.760
I guess I'll get a box at home and I'll have to back up to that from now on.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.640
But that's going to get very expensive.

07:56.640 --> 07:57.600
That is tricky.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.960
Well, it is.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.960
It is going to get expensive.

08:00.960 --> 08:06.640
But I would argue that the emotions you're feeling right now are also expensive.

08:06.640 --> 08:11.680
And just in a, you know, not dollars and cents necessarily, but they're expensive in a different way emotionally.

08:11.680 --> 08:16.400
And only you can quantify how much your data is worth.

08:16.400 --> 08:24.800
I mean, I don't know what was on this particular server for you, Kerry, but I certainly know in the past when I've lost data, it hurts.

08:24.800 --> 08:40.480
Like genuinely, you spend the next few weeks, months, sometimes longer wishing you'd done things differently, thinking, oh, if only I'd spent a couple of hundred on a Pi and an external hard drive and I wouldn't even be in this situation.

08:40.480 --> 08:50.240
I mean, if you think about what most typical VPSs are, they are probably less than 100 gig disk, probably only a few gigabytes of RAM or something like that.

08:50.240 --> 08:54.320
So we aren't talking about a huge amount of data to back up here.

08:54.320 --> 09:02.720
And what I would say is if you've got no backup, I mean, literally zero, don't try and aim for perfect.

09:02.720 --> 09:14.080
Just get a 128 gig USB stick off Amazon and then just get in the habit of downloading your data once a month, once a year even.

09:14.080 --> 09:20.320
Because I'm sure right now you wish you'd had something, even if it was 11 months old, you'd have something.

09:20.320 --> 09:36.800
Something I've seen really common is a lot of people these days when they have cheap cloud hosting, they're going for like a NUC with a disk hanging off it or something that they're syncing to locally and getting that peace of mind by having the data on their local network.

09:36.800 --> 09:50.400
And I got to admit, that's kind of what I did for the Jupiter broadcasting stuff is we have next cloud up at Linode and then we have next cloud installed on the server at the Jupiter Broadcasting Studio on the LAN.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.520
And we sync the stuff that I really care about.

09:53.520 --> 10:00.480
We don't sync everything because it's hundreds of gigs, but locally we've we actually that's what it will also archive.

10:00.480 --> 10:10.320
But so I should probably back up the studio server now that I think about it, but we back up the cloud locally to anything that's that's not ephemeral and anything's not ephemeral.

10:10.320 --> 10:15.920
We try to keep locally. And then my intention is to back that server up somewhere.

10:15.920 --> 10:21.440
Alex's house back plays. I don't know what, but I've got the cloud part covered.

10:21.440 --> 10:31.040
I don't necessarily have the local part fully covered right now because I ended up and it's sort of where I connected with what Kerry was saying is I just ended up with terabytes of data, terabytes.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.560
And I don't know. I don't really know how to even get that offside over the wire.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.960
It's so much data. Never underestimate.

10:36.960 --> 10:46.720
I think the saying goes the bandwidth of a truck driving down a highway full of hard drives, get it on a hard drive and mail it to me.

10:46.720 --> 10:47.760
That's the best way.

10:47.760 --> 10:52.640
What you're saying is I should pack up the RV and drive a hard drive down to your place.

10:52.640 --> 10:53.840
That makes the most sense, right?

10:53.840 --> 10:54.880
You can if you want.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.880
Three thousand dollar backup trip.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.640
But, you know, so that's something we all struggle with.

11:00.640 --> 11:09.920
But you remember when we went and saw Wendell, how he was implementing at his data center on his land, he was backing up his place was nuts.

11:09.920 --> 11:15.920
Yeah, he was backing up his client's cloud data for them to his to his service, just in case their cloud providers had issues.

11:15.920 --> 11:21.360
It's something you do kind of have to think about is when I'm building something, what is the risk to losing this?

11:21.360 --> 11:29.760
Like, there's some things I have on the cloud that if they were if they were if they were lost, it'd be inconvenient, but we could regenerate from source material.

11:29.760 --> 11:30.640
Not everything.

11:30.640 --> 11:38.240
Yeah, it is. It is about evaluating the I don't want to say like opportunity cost or whatever, but everything has a cost.

11:38.240 --> 11:42.720
And, you know, photos, for example, are irreplaceable.

11:42.720 --> 11:46.080
You can't recreate those moments, videos, whatever.

11:46.080 --> 11:53.840
But, you know, a PDF with an invoice of some work you did 10 years ago, maybe that.

11:53.840 --> 11:58.160
OK, it might be nice to have it, but that's all just nice.

11:58.160 --> 12:12.320
But, you know, the cost of a one time backup off site to a pendrive or something like that is so small compared to the amount, just the amount of time you're going to spend noodling after you've lost some data.

12:12.320 --> 12:18.880
Whilst you reconstruct what was actually on that file system and remember, oh, yeah, that was on that box as well.

12:18.880 --> 12:23.680
I lost that, too. And some of that stuff won't occur to you until years later.

12:23.680 --> 12:29.440
That's very true. And it feels so you just feel like you've like somebody cut a hole out of you sometimes.

12:29.440 --> 12:40.080
And I think that especially when it comes to the pictures, I have opted to leave on for the iPhone members of my family, our iCloud photo backup for everybody.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.720
I even end up paying for like some sort of family storage plan.

12:42.720 --> 12:52.560
So that way I knew because my mom is on there and, you know, my wife and I just wanted to know that everybody's photos were backed up, even though I also back them up.

12:52.560 --> 12:58.240
My my phone, every picture I take goes off to next cloud in 100 percent quality.

12:58.240 --> 13:02.480
But Google Photos also duplicates everything.

13:02.480 --> 13:10.960
I'm off the Google Photos sauce because I'm using the iCloud photo, but it's like, you know, trading one one service for the other.

13:10.960 --> 13:18.240
I mean, there are arguments to be made for Google's privacy policies versus Apple's, but I'm not sure I fully trust either, to be honest with you.

13:18.240 --> 13:22.960
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm kind of gambling that Apple's are a little better and that they're not mining it for data.

13:22.960 --> 13:26.560
But make no mistake, bro, Apple are mining you for your cash.

13:26.560 --> 13:30.960
Right. No kidding. No kidding. And we have talked about Google Photos alternatives.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.320
And it's not that I'm not going to implement one of those.

13:34.320 --> 13:42.160
That's actually been my intention. But I still feel like I get some value out of just paying Apple to back that thing up because they are so valuable.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.280
And that's really photos are it like pretty much everything else.

13:45.280 --> 13:50.600
I'm comfortable how I back it up, although I know there's a couple of areas that I could probably do better.

13:50.600 --> 13:55.680
I mean, do you feel like there's an area where if you were to audit your backups right now, you'd look at and go, oh, no, Alex, you got to fix it.

13:55.680 --> 14:00.360
Yeah, I do. So the last couple of months have been a bit crazy for me.

14:00.360 --> 14:08.080
My wife and I had our first daughter and she spent she came a little bit early and she spent a couple of months in the hospital.

14:08.080 --> 14:11.640
So things have kind of been decaying whilst I've been there.

14:11.640 --> 14:17.080
Congratulations. An official on show. Congratulations. Yay. Yay.

14:17.080 --> 14:25.160
I've known this the first time you said anything on the show. So, yeah, I didn't want to go public until she was home just in case because anyway, she's home.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.960
She's healthy. Everything's good with the world.

14:28.960 --> 14:36.400
So, yeah, I purchased the Helios as to be my on site replication backup device.

14:36.400 --> 14:43.720
And then when everything went down in January and Ella was born, I was in the middle of rebuilding my server at that point,

14:43.720 --> 14:48.560
because that's when the whole GVTG thing started playing up and not working quite as I'd hoped.

14:48.560 --> 14:56.120
So, you know, I was at the hospital most of the day, but I'd come back here for two or three hours just to unwind and just mess around with hardware and stuff.

14:56.120 --> 14:59.120
And I never quite got to putting my backups back in place.

14:59.120 --> 15:02.240
And it's one of those things you think, oh, I'll get to it. I'll get to it.

15:02.240 --> 15:08.560
And then before you know it, a year later, you have a problem, you think, crap, I never got to it.

15:08.560 --> 15:15.080
Yeah, I do have plans which we'll share with you soon as to what's going to replace the Helios in that situation.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.840
But I'm tight lipped for now.

15:17.840 --> 15:25.600
But we do have a we do have an upcoming segment on backups that will hopefully give you some ideas and inspiration.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.680
Linode dot com slash SSH.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.320
Go there to get one hundred dollars in Linode credit.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.760
This could be the opportunity to try out Linode.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.480
Linode dot com slash SSH.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.440
You also support the show.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.600
Linode is how we host in the cloud.

15:39.600 --> 15:45.080
We've built all kinds of back end services for the show and for Jupiter broadcasting on Linode.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.480
And I have a peace of mind knowing that Linode has great support.

15:48.480 --> 15:52.480
So if I ever get stuck, well, I know they're going to take care of me.

15:52.480 --> 16:02.200
In fact, they just received Linode, just received the People's Choice Stevie Award for favorite customer service in the computer services category.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.320
That's huge.

16:03.320 --> 16:09.520
You guys having great support has been one of the key things that people write into our show when they switch and tell us about Linode.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.720
They have eleven data centers worldwide.

16:11.720 --> 16:20.920
In 2016, they became their own ISP and have full control over their own network and have built out super fast connections to their worldwide data centers.

16:20.920 --> 16:24.080
They have a brilliant cloud manager that makes it simple to use Linode.

16:24.080 --> 16:28.480
If you're a brand new user or if you're a pro, you're going to love what they have.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.800
Then there's the pricing Linode has dialed this in.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.560
The value is nuts.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.760
They have systems, of course, are like five dollars a month.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.880
Right. But you can do different combinations depending on what you need.

16:39.880 --> 16:42.080
Maybe you need a lot of memory or a lot of CPU.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.600
Maybe you need GPU. Maybe you need several GPUs.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.160
Maybe you need it all.

16:46.160 --> 16:51.920
I got to be honest, we recently just decided to go all in on our matrix server because it's getting busier and busier.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.840
And it's awesome what Linode lets you do.

16:53.840 --> 17:00.240
And even when you need to upgrade an existing machine or clone a machine or snapshot, it's all just brilliant in their cloud manager.

17:00.240 --> 17:05.240
I'm really impressed with the complexity that they can make seem so simple.

17:05.240 --> 17:10.920
You know, like I'm I'm managing servers in data centers around the world and they just make it all seem so intuitive.

17:10.920 --> 17:14.960
So I like that. And you can really get a sense of that when you try out our one hundred dollar credit.

17:14.960 --> 17:20.880
One hundred dollars when you go to Linode dot com slash SSH, see what I've been talking about.

17:20.880 --> 17:25.680
And of course, you support the show when you go there and you visit that URL and you use that and you sign up.

17:25.680 --> 17:30.360
It tells Linode that our audience is supporting the show and that Linode should keep supporting us.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.320
It helps us put these shows out for free.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.080
It makes content like this possible.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.120
It's the circle of podcasting.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.560
Go to Linode dot com slash SSH.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.480
Don't be using that stinking Linux unplugged Linode code.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.320
Got to be using that self-hosted Linode code.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.960
That's right. Live long.

17:45.960 --> 17:53.360
Hashtag SSH, live long and and go to Linode dot com slash SSH.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.720
My home assistant box password shamed me this week.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.600
Did you get this? Yes.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.360
Did you get it for the SSH add-in?

18:00.360 --> 18:02.360
That's what I think I got it for.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.560
Mine was node red, I think.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.040
Oh, node red.

18:06.040 --> 18:10.080
Alex, you're using a bad password with node red.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.120
Well, maybe even home assistant itself.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.360
Yeah, I don't know. I've been a bit busy.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.560
I didn't actually read it.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.240
I just saw the notification and dismissed it.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.840
I was like, oh, whatever. I'll get to you later.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.440
I dismissed it and then mine came back.

18:20.440 --> 18:23.520
Mine is for the add-on core underscore SSH,

18:23.520 --> 18:27.160
which uses secrets which have been detected as not secure.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.960
Probably a lot of people in the audience are getting

18:28.960 --> 18:30.120
this if they're on home assistant.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.200
It's a new feature, quote unquote,

18:32.200 --> 18:36.200
that has been integrated and frankly, probably a good one.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.800
Yeah, but the Internet being the Internet, people are pissed.

18:39.800 --> 18:44.800
I don't really get, oh, maybe I'm just becoming

18:44.800 --> 18:49.800
a grumpy old man now I'm a dad and outrage culture is just,

18:49.800 --> 18:52.080
I don't know, I'm just tired of it.

18:52.080 --> 18:56.120
So there's a link in the show notes to a post by Troy Hunt,

18:56.120 --> 18:59.120
who is an incredibly well-respected security researcher.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.560
And he's the guy that is behind the website,

19:01.560 --> 19:03.480
have I been pwned?

19:03.480 --> 19:05.400
And this website is incredible.

19:05.400 --> 19:09.680
You can tap in any password into their database

19:09.680 --> 19:12.000
and it'll tell you that yes, this password

19:12.000 --> 19:13.720
is out in the wild.

19:13.720 --> 19:17.120
And as Troy puts it, if your password is in this list,

19:17.120 --> 19:20.840
I've seen it clear text, which means that the bad guys

19:20.840 --> 19:22.720
have seen it clear text.

19:22.720 --> 19:27.480
So no matter your opinion on how secure you think it is,

19:27.480 --> 19:30.440
I guarantee it's out there in the wild somewhere

19:30.440 --> 19:31.800
and somebody knows what it is.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.840
So don't use that password.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.560
It's actually pretty clever for the home assistant

19:35.560 --> 19:36.760
developers to build this in.

19:36.760 --> 19:40.360
So the way it works is your passwords are hashed,

19:40.360 --> 19:42.880
the first five characters of that hash,

19:42.880 --> 19:44.880
so just the first five characters of a hash

19:44.880 --> 19:47.280
of your password are then used to query

19:47.280 --> 19:49.200
the have I been pwned website.

19:49.200 --> 19:52.160
It then returns a result of possible password hashes

19:52.160 --> 19:56.120
that match and then home assistant checks that list

19:56.120 --> 19:58.320
against your hash locally.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.800
All of that validation is happening on your box.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.960
And what I find really interesting,

20:02.960 --> 20:05.240
and Troy goes into full details in the article,

20:05.240 --> 20:09.960
he basically goes through the home assistant forums thread

20:09.960 --> 20:12.320
where people are bitching and moaning and whining

20:12.320 --> 20:15.680
about this feature being turned on without their permission

20:15.680 --> 20:18.960
to give you an idea of how, I don't wanna say stupid,

20:18.960 --> 20:22.680
but honestly, when I was reading this Troy Hunt article,

20:22.680 --> 20:25.760
I was like, yeah, this thread is stupid.

20:25.760 --> 20:27.960
Someone was complaining it was sending out data

20:27.960 --> 20:29.640
over their metered connection.

20:29.640 --> 20:33.360
He then proceeded to say, it's a few bytes.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.520
Like 36 kilobytes, yeah.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.720
Yeah, we're talking five times smaller

20:37.720 --> 20:39.480
than the average webpage load.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.280
If you notice that on a metered connection,

20:41.280 --> 20:42.600
then you've got problems.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.800
Right, we're not really talking very much data.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.400
And it's probably, although we don't know for sure,

20:47.400 --> 20:49.960
only happening when you start up home assistant

20:49.960 --> 20:51.480
or reload the config.

20:51.480 --> 20:54.480
How do you feel about doing this on your local LAN?

20:54.480 --> 20:57.480
I mean, I'm definitely guilty of reusing passwords

20:57.480 --> 20:58.600
on the internet.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.360
I'm certainly guilty of doing it on my LAN.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.600
That seems to be the crux of everyone's argument

21:03.600 --> 21:08.600
is my LAN, my rules, I have a safe, trusted environment,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.480
and I don't wanna have to use good password hygiene.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.320
I don't want long passwords that are unique.

21:15.320 --> 21:18.040
And I can definitely relate.

21:18.040 --> 21:21.600
They're sort of, when you do this for a living,

21:21.600 --> 21:25.120
every now and then it's nice to be a little lazy.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.480
Like, what's the saying about the guy who makes shoes,

21:28.480 --> 21:30.280
his kids always have the worst shoes.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.800
You know, like, cause you just get home,

21:32.800 --> 21:34.840
it's the last thing you wanna do, right?

21:34.840 --> 21:36.440
It's just the last thing.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.120
So I do understand that.

21:38.120 --> 21:41.720
However, this is where I fall down on it.

21:41.720 --> 21:46.160
The home assistant community is kind of a special case

21:46.160 --> 21:49.960
because they're playing around with IoT smart devices

21:49.960 --> 21:52.080
that are network connected.

21:52.080 --> 21:55.920
There's a higher threat level,

21:55.920 --> 21:59.440
a broader threat attack surface, if you will.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.360
And so I feel like you have to be a little more secure

22:02.360 --> 22:05.560
when you are willing to ride the IoT train, you know?

22:05.560 --> 22:08.920
Because the problem is any one of those individual devices

22:08.920 --> 22:10.480
one day could become compromised,

22:10.480 --> 22:12.240
and then that becomes a launching off point

22:12.240 --> 22:14.000
where they can go after other devices on your LAN.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.720
And we see it happen.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.000
And to that point, Troy actually makes this point

22:18.000 --> 22:20.280
in his article that LinkedIn,

22:20.280 --> 22:23.080
I mean, we're talking a proper website here,

22:23.080 --> 22:25.760
had a data breach because one of their developers,

22:25.760 --> 22:28.800
Home Networks, had a weak SSH password,

22:28.800 --> 22:31.000
which allowed people to pivot through

22:31.000 --> 22:34.520
that developer's Home Network into LinkedIn servers

22:34.520 --> 22:36.360
and compromise LinkedIn that way.

22:36.360 --> 22:37.960
Yeah, they brute-forced his iMac.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.440
And so, you know, I put myself in that developer's shoes

22:40.440 --> 22:41.480
and I think, well, holy crap,

22:41.480 --> 22:43.640
someone could pivot into Red Hat from here

22:43.640 --> 22:45.040
and I wouldn't want that.

22:45.040 --> 22:48.000
So I think to myself, okay, actually, Troy,

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
you've probably got a point here.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
I do need to step up my game.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.840
And he uses 1Password.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.080
I think he's on the advisory board for 1Password.

22:55.080 --> 22:58.160
But we talked last episode about Bitwarden.

22:58.160 --> 23:02.360
And I really cannot emphasize enough,

23:02.360 --> 23:04.080
you know, there are command line clients

23:04.080 --> 23:05.400
and stuff like that that you can use

23:05.400 --> 23:06.480
so you can put it in scripts

23:06.480 --> 23:09.040
and do all sorts of fun stuff if you want to.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.840
And I think that's gonna have to become

23:10.840 --> 23:15.400
a 2021 rather late New Year's resolution for me

23:15.400 --> 23:20.000
is to try and use that CLI stuff more on my LAN at least.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.880
Yeah, good passwords, I think, matter

23:21.880 --> 23:24.320
when we're kind of riding the cutting edge of technology.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.920
Even if you're not intentionally exposing your LAN

23:27.920 --> 23:30.040
to the internet, you never know

23:30.040 --> 23:32.560
when some crazy thing could happen.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.920
It's unlikely, but it could happen.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.760
But really, you also never know

23:35.760 --> 23:37.760
if one day somebody is gonna rock up

23:37.760 --> 23:39.200
onto your Wi-Fi or something,

23:39.200 --> 23:42.080
or somebody joins your LAN that you put on intentionally,

23:42.080 --> 23:45.280
but they have some misconfiguration or infection.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.200
So it's kind of like multiple layers

23:47.200 --> 23:50.840
of protecting yourself is the best kind of protection.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.480
And I think when you look at logins,

23:52.480 --> 23:54.640
you could look at maybe not only unique passwords,

23:54.640 --> 23:58.840
but when possible, also using keys to do SSH sign-ins.

23:58.840 --> 24:01.440
So that way you have to have maybe a key and a password.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.120
And that just takes it a little bit step further.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.760
Like that LinkedIn developer,

24:04.760 --> 24:07.920
if he had had a decent password or password and a key,

24:07.920 --> 24:10.480
then the attackers would have never gotten onto his iMac

24:10.480 --> 24:12.000
and then never gotten into LinkedIn.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.560
And when the whole COVID lockdown thing started

24:15.560 --> 24:17.560
and we had a lot more people all of a sudden

24:17.560 --> 24:20.520
working from home, that was one of my first concerns is,

24:20.520 --> 24:24.320
well, now all of these corporations are as insecure

24:24.320 --> 24:26.320
as people's home networks are.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.600
And you never know when that could be an issue as well.

24:28.600 --> 24:32.320
I just think as much of a pain in the arse as it is,

24:32.320 --> 24:35.040
there's enough tools and we know enough information now

24:35.040 --> 24:36.440
that it's worth doing.

24:36.440 --> 24:38.360
The only thing I would have changed

24:38.360 --> 24:40.880
with how Home Assistant has implemented this

24:40.880 --> 24:43.360
is give me an option to turn it off for a bit.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.720
I'm not fixing it while I'm out here in the woods.

24:46.720 --> 24:50.640
Simon sat checkbox for seven days or something.

24:50.640 --> 24:53.680
Or until next update even, that could work too.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.160
I do believe they're actually working on

24:56.160 --> 24:58.280
making it opt in or opt out now.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.240
So for what it's worth,

25:00.240 --> 25:04.280
the outrage has had some effect on the feature.

25:04.280 --> 25:05.520
But I mean, I think it's great.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.960
I think anything that we can do,

25:06.960 --> 25:09.400
and here's another point about the Home Assistant community

25:09.400 --> 25:11.520
being a special case as well,

25:11.520 --> 25:16.520
is a lot of people are coming to servers for the first time

25:16.840 --> 25:18.440
because of Home Assistant.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.720
They're running a box in their house for the first time

25:20.720 --> 25:23.720
that's got SSH listening on something,

25:23.720 --> 25:25.800
maybe for the first time ever.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.320
And anything that Home Assistant can do

25:28.320 --> 25:32.200
for those kind of newer users

25:32.200 --> 25:37.200
that aren't enterprise grade buffoons like me

25:37.320 --> 25:41.120
that just reminds them that, hold on,

25:41.120 --> 25:43.480
if you're exposing your house to the internet

25:43.480 --> 25:46.160
through Nebuchadnezzar, through WireGuard,

25:46.160 --> 25:49.320
through whatever it might be, there is some risk.

25:49.320 --> 25:50.960
And then when you couple that up

25:50.960 --> 25:53.240
with some leaky washing machine

25:53.240 --> 25:56.200
that's running an old firmware from eight years ago,

25:56.200 --> 25:57.680
there are risks to these things.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.960
And I for one applaud the Home Assistant project

25:59.960 --> 26:02.240
for having the stones to put this in.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.280
Yeah, and it definitely, I think,

26:04.280 --> 26:06.720
will improve the community security overall,

26:06.720 --> 26:08.640
which is a good thing for them.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.200
And as they make this a commercial product one day,

26:11.200 --> 26:12.040
because you know this has got to be

26:12.040 --> 26:13.040
the direction this thing's going

26:13.040 --> 26:14.880
when they try to make it a consumer product

26:14.880 --> 26:18.360
and not just a more advanced prosumer

26:18.360 --> 26:19.680
or enthusiast product.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.800
Nerd product.

26:20.800 --> 26:21.640
Go on, you should say it.

26:21.640 --> 26:22.520
Nerd product.

26:22.520 --> 26:23.640
It's a nerd product right now.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.240
But one day, maybe one day,

26:25.240 --> 26:28.000
they're gonna try to sell it to average Joes

26:28.000 --> 26:29.400
who have bought all these smart devices

26:29.400 --> 26:30.280
and now they just need something

26:30.280 --> 26:31.680
to make it all work together.

26:31.680 --> 26:34.840
And buy the $100 Home Assistant appliance.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.920
And you need these kind of things built in.

26:36.920 --> 26:39.400
And they just recently had a run-in with add-ons

26:39.400 --> 26:40.880
that were leaking information.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.720
So I could see why this is an area they're investing into.

26:43.720 --> 26:44.600
And I say good on them.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.080
And I think it'll be a smooth transition.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.160
There is also something worth looking into

26:49.160 --> 26:51.480
is they're working with K-Aninemy,

26:51.480 --> 26:54.160
which is a Cloudflare hosted service.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.880
So Cloudflare's kind of proxying

26:55.880 --> 26:58.160
some of these requests to anonymize them.

26:58.160 --> 27:01.280
That's also made some people uncomfortable in all of this.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.640
But I did a read through of the setup

27:02.640 --> 27:04.320
and it actually, it seems like they've done

27:04.320 --> 27:06.160
a really, really solid job here.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.280
So we'll have a link in the show notes

27:08.280 --> 27:10.520
at selfhosted.show slash 40

27:10.520 --> 27:12.120
for the Cloudflare information on that.

27:12.120 --> 27:15.020
If that has also perhaps gotten the hairs

27:15.020 --> 27:16.720
on the back of your neck up a little bit,

27:16.720 --> 27:18.800
it's worth reading about, we'll have information.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.120
I'm super curious to hear what you all do

27:21.120 --> 27:23.680
for your local LAN password situations.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.520
Do you use a password manager?

27:25.520 --> 27:29.760
Are you like me and reuse the same password on every box?

27:29.760 --> 27:32.100
Let us know, selfhosted.show slash contact.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.440
Datadog.com slash self-hosted.

27:36.440 --> 27:39.500
One word, datadog.com slash self-hosted.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.480
Go there, try it out and get a free t-shirt.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.000
Datadog is gonna solve problems

27:44.000 --> 27:45.480
and help you communicate them.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.080
Analyze code level performance

27:47.080 --> 27:48.800
across your entire environment

27:48.800 --> 27:52.580
and troubleshoot issues faster with Datadog.

27:52.580 --> 27:54.520
You see Datadog's continuous profiler

27:54.520 --> 27:56.260
automatically collects information

27:56.260 --> 27:58.840
from your production servers all the time.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.380
So then when you're ready, when you need to,

28:00.380 --> 28:02.880
you can quickly look and analyze all of the data

28:02.880 --> 28:06.640
with minimal overhead and get finally

28:06.640 --> 28:10.000
a unified picture of your entire environment.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.760
Correlate code performance with server metrics

28:12.760 --> 28:17.400
and other monitoring data in real time, beautiful dashboards.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.640
Datadog.com slash self-hosted,

28:19.640 --> 28:21.880
just to look at these dashboards.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.920
And then they have a lot of tightly integrated additions,

28:24.920 --> 28:27.880
add-ons, tracing, log management,

28:27.880 --> 28:29.280
and that continuous profiler

28:29.280 --> 28:33.480
that brings it all into one platform, that's Datadog.

28:33.480 --> 28:36.000
And imagine getting yourself a visual dashboard

28:36.000 --> 28:39.120
that you can use to communicate issues with your team.

28:39.120 --> 28:42.620
Developers to sysadmins, sysadmins to executives.

28:42.620 --> 28:47.180
Make plans, predict future performance, try it all out,

28:47.180 --> 28:49.820
and take advantage of their machine learning and learning.

28:49.820 --> 28:51.400
Datadog enables you to pinpoint

28:51.400 --> 28:54.280
the root cause of an issue faster than ever.

28:54.280 --> 28:57.220
So try their products out for free for 14 days

28:57.220 --> 29:00.900
by visiting datadog.com slash self-hosted.

29:00.900 --> 29:03.040
For a limited time, if you start a trial

29:03.040 --> 29:05.720
and create one dashboard, you'll get some free swag,

29:05.720 --> 29:07.400
a Datadog t-shirt.

29:07.400 --> 29:11.840
And I miss swag, I miss event swag, I miss t-shirts.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.240
So go get one, datadog.com slash self-hosted,

29:14.240 --> 29:16.920
create an account, get that trial going and get a t-shirt,

29:16.920 --> 29:21.040
and then begin visualizing your entire infrastructure.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.340
Datadog.com slash self-hosted.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.720
Listener Chris writes in,

29:26.720 --> 29:29.000
I run a number of services from my home server

29:29.000 --> 29:30.880
that are internet facing.

29:30.880 --> 29:33.040
I understand that the smart best practice

29:33.040 --> 29:34.800
is to minimize that as much as possible,

29:34.800 --> 29:36.380
but some of these things I wanna access

29:36.380 --> 29:38.500
whilst I'm away from the house.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.440
Some of them are also used by family members,

29:40.440 --> 29:43.320
and so it's unavoidable on some levels.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.960
My question is this, how do I know if a service

29:45.960 --> 29:50.320
is hardened enough to raw dog it out on the open internet?

29:50.320 --> 29:51.160
Wow.

29:52.120 --> 29:55.440
We're just gonna, let's let that sit for a second.

29:55.440 --> 29:58.200
How do you know, how do you know if you can raw dog it?

29:58.200 --> 30:00.840
Yeah, I mean, I feel this one, you know, Plex is one,

30:00.840 --> 30:02.260
you know, Plex you kind of feel safe about,

30:02.260 --> 30:04.960
but how do you know about some of the lesser used ones,

30:04.960 --> 30:06.600
like Subsonic or something, right?

30:06.600 --> 30:10.480
I think it's safe to assume that everything is porous.

30:11.360 --> 30:12.200
Everything.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.000
Yeah, I hate though that the answer

30:14.000 --> 30:15.760
always is put it behind a VPN.

30:15.760 --> 30:16.600
Why?

30:16.600 --> 30:18.180
I mean, with WireGuard these days,

30:18.180 --> 30:20.520
it's really the, the barrier to entry,

30:20.520 --> 30:23.500
as long as you don't screw up your subnets like I did,

30:23.500 --> 30:24.840
the barrier is pretty low.

30:24.840 --> 30:26.300
But you have friends and family

30:26.300 --> 30:27.740
that are using your Plex server

30:27.740 --> 30:29.220
without connecting to WireGuard.

30:29.220 --> 30:31.280
You know, like Plex is such a great example,

30:31.280 --> 30:34.560
or JellyFan, because you do often wanna share with others.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.400
That's true.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.800
And I could see that being true with others as well.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.520
Nextcloud he mentions in here,

30:40.520 --> 30:43.720
but BabyBuddy, I'm not so sure about that.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.600
You know, that starts to get a little more niche.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.460
And I hate to be the guy that just says,

30:48.460 --> 30:50.340
well, if it's big, you can use it publicly,

30:50.340 --> 30:51.800
and if it's small, you should hide it.

30:51.800 --> 30:55.920
But that's kind of a general rule of thumb that I follow.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.160
You know, you try to figure how many eyes have been on it.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.360
You know, another angle to consider

30:59.360 --> 31:01.780
is security by obscurity.

31:01.780 --> 31:03.800
Now, if you think that, you know,

31:03.800 --> 31:05.880
you just have a random URL that you're using

31:05.880 --> 31:07.540
to access this service,

31:07.540 --> 31:09.880
and you've put it behind a reverse proxy,

31:09.880 --> 31:11.920
and probably these days you're using Let's Encrypt

31:11.920 --> 31:13.660
to generate a certificate for it,

31:13.660 --> 31:16.160
so that you know that things are secure.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.580
Well, I've got bad news for you, I'm afraid.

31:17.580 --> 31:22.580
If you go to crt.sh and type in your domain name,

31:22.700 --> 31:26.120
you'll see every single certificate

31:26.120 --> 31:27.900
that's ever been issued by Let's Encrypt

31:27.900 --> 31:30.400
for your domain name.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.440
And so you think to yourself,

31:31.440 --> 31:34.240
okay, well now my super secret string

31:34.240 --> 31:37.680
that I came up with to hide this service

31:37.680 --> 31:39.400
is now out in the public domain.

31:39.400 --> 31:42.140
So really, it's not secret at all.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.860
One thing you could do to kind of work around that

31:44.860 --> 31:47.240
is use a wildcard certificate.

31:47.240 --> 31:49.620
That would kind of sort of help,

31:49.620 --> 31:53.520
because it wouldn't, you know, publish the actual string.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.020
But it just goes to show to me that, you know,

31:56.020 --> 32:00.440
security through obscurity is really not, it's an illusion.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.860
Yeah, and I was gonna suggest throwing it out

32:02.860 --> 32:04.940
on like a VPS, like Linode,

32:04.940 --> 32:07.720
and run your software there for a bit

32:07.720 --> 32:10.100
on the public internet and monitor the logs.

32:10.100 --> 32:12.180
But you could run something for six months

32:12.180 --> 32:13.260
and nobody nibbles at it,

32:13.260 --> 32:17.380
and then on, you know, day one of seven months,

32:17.380 --> 32:18.820
somebody nibbles on it.

32:18.820 --> 32:19.900
It's tricky that way.

32:19.900 --> 32:22.940
And so it really, the only way to have full peace of mind,

32:22.940 --> 32:25.960
and that's what I've opted to do here in LadyJupes,

32:25.960 --> 32:30.300
is just to have absolutely zero outside inbound.

32:30.300 --> 32:32.300
That's the only way I've found

32:32.300 --> 32:34.140
to be completely comfortable with it.

32:34.140 --> 32:36.160
I don't necessarily always follow that rule myself,

32:36.160 --> 32:38.480
because some services like mail servers,

32:38.480 --> 32:41.240
web servers, media streaming servers,

32:41.240 --> 32:43.940
they have to be public by their very nature.

32:43.940 --> 32:46.340
So you have to hope that those just have more eyes

32:46.340 --> 32:48.220
and that they get a little more attention

32:48.220 --> 32:49.860
and that they've been a little more audited.

32:49.860 --> 32:52.380
But remember, logging is your friend.

32:52.380 --> 32:55.300
So if you ever suspect something's weird is happening,

32:55.300 --> 32:57.220
go check your logs, see if you have weird logins,

32:57.220 --> 32:59.740
see if you have somebody hitting your website all the time.

32:59.740 --> 33:00.740
Use DataDog.

33:00.740 --> 33:02.540
Yeah, yeah, use something that will,

33:02.540 --> 33:03.700
you go through there and alert you.

33:03.700 --> 33:05.780
That absolutely could be a good way to go.

33:05.780 --> 33:08.140
It's a good question, though, listener Chris,

33:08.140 --> 33:09.860
because I'm sure it's one that people struggle with.

33:09.860 --> 33:11.960
So let us know what you out there would do,

33:11.960 --> 33:14.280
selfhosted.show slash contact.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.460
Now, we have Joseph who writes in.

33:16.460 --> 33:18.680
He says, I have a bunch of those Tekken smart switches

33:18.680 --> 33:22.040
flashed with Tasmoto, and they work great.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.380
I have a need for smart switches

33:23.380 --> 33:25.480
to replace my wall switches, though.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.740
You know, for example, like my kids' closet lights,

33:27.740 --> 33:31.100
which are always left on.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.100
I would also love to replace the controllers

33:33.100 --> 33:35.380
on our ceiling fans with smart devices,

33:35.380 --> 33:37.660
something that would toggle the light on and off,

33:37.660 --> 33:40.260
and also set the fan to high, medium, or low,

33:40.260 --> 33:41.820
or even off completely.

33:41.820 --> 33:44.280
My preference would be for something I can self-host,

33:44.280 --> 33:47.260
non-cloud connected, open source software.

33:47.260 --> 33:49.700
Are there any devices which would actually fill this need

33:49.700 --> 33:52.380
or similar to the way the Tekken smart plugs do?

33:52.380 --> 33:53.460
What are your thoughts?

33:53.460 --> 33:54.980
Well, this is an easy question.

33:54.980 --> 33:58.740
The Shelly devices are exactly what you're looking for,

33:58.740 --> 34:01.020
and I think we've talked about them on a previous episode,

34:01.020 --> 34:02.100
but just to recap,

34:02.100 --> 34:04.220
they're about the size of an Oreo cookie,

34:04.220 --> 34:07.560
and they go inside the light box behind the switch.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.860
So you don't change the switch itself,

34:09.860 --> 34:14.860
but this little cookie-sized box has a relay inside it.

34:15.220 --> 34:16.500
You need to do a little bit of wiring.

34:16.500 --> 34:19.180
So, you know, mains voltage, be careful,

34:19.180 --> 34:21.680
or get an electrician if you're not comfortable.

34:21.680 --> 34:22.760
They make a few products.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.380
So they make a 2.5, which will let you do

34:25.380 --> 34:28.500
up to two switches in the same box.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.540
They make a single unit as well,

34:30.540 --> 34:31.660
and they make a bunch of other stuff

34:31.660 --> 34:34.220
that does like rolling shutters for garage doors

34:34.220 --> 34:35.580
and all sorts of stuff.

34:35.580 --> 34:37.940
So go to Shelly.cloud and check out their stuff

34:37.940 --> 34:38.780
if you're interested,

34:38.780 --> 34:40.820
but it's exactly what you're looking for,

34:40.820 --> 34:43.460
and you can put TAS motor on them.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.340
So Mahendra writes in,

34:45.340 --> 34:46.620
in the latest episode,

34:46.620 --> 34:49.820
you suggest file run for a simple file browser.

34:49.820 --> 34:53.540
I wanted to suggest another minimalist alternative.

34:53.540 --> 34:56.380
It's very light with no database required

34:56.380 --> 35:00.700
at github.com slash file browser slash file browser.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.380
God, that rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

35:02.380 --> 35:04.180
It's very simple, easy to remember.

35:04.180 --> 35:06.860
Yeah, it is just a web-based file browser

35:06.860 --> 35:08.940
that sits on top of a directory.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.060
Each user gets their own directory,

35:11.060 --> 35:13.280
and it's just a standalone app.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.460
Pretty simple.

35:14.460 --> 35:15.300
I like it.

35:15.300 --> 35:17.660
Even easier than the one we had talked about before.

35:17.660 --> 35:19.600
So I'm gonna think I'm gonna grab this and try it out.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.440
It is nice.

35:20.440 --> 35:21.780
Yeah, I tried it out before the show,

35:21.780 --> 35:25.420
and I kinda wish I hadn't bothered with file run now.

35:25.420 --> 35:29.080
This is, I think, my new standard kind of

35:29.080 --> 35:32.660
throw it up and forget about it remote access software.

35:32.660 --> 35:33.800
So yeah, great job.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.620
Thanks for writing in, Mahendra.

35:35.620 --> 35:37.340
Now I've mentioned Chowdown a couple of times

35:37.340 --> 35:39.860
on the show before as a self-hosted recipe app.

35:39.860 --> 35:40.700
I still use it.

35:40.700 --> 35:41.520
I still love it.

35:41.520 --> 35:45.980
It stores all of my recipes in clear text files on disk,

35:45.980 --> 35:47.420
but there are some alternatives,

35:47.420 --> 35:50.180
and we've had a couple of listeners write in,

35:50.180 --> 35:52.340
and one of them is called Tandoor Recipes.

35:52.340 --> 35:53.420
What do you think of this one, Chris?

35:53.420 --> 35:55.100
It looks really good.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.820
This, if anything, would probably get me

35:57.820 --> 35:59.780
to start doing something like this,

35:59.780 --> 36:02.600
because it has a planning aspect,

36:02.600 --> 36:04.580
which is useful for a guy like me.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.620
I can do a little meal planning,

36:06.620 --> 36:08.880
but also has a sharing feature,

36:08.880 --> 36:10.460
and it's all on a progressive web app,

36:10.460 --> 36:13.580
which means my wife and I could share it on our phones,

36:13.580 --> 36:14.580
which I think would be really nice.

36:14.580 --> 36:17.140
And then the other thing I would need is,

36:17.140 --> 36:19.620
and it does support importing from Chowdown, is import,

36:19.620 --> 36:21.280
and it has Chowdown import

36:21.280 --> 36:24.020
as well as Nextcloud, Cookbook import,

36:24.020 --> 36:25.900
Mealy, Paprika, Saffron,

36:25.900 --> 36:28.540
and a couple of others it can import from.

36:28.540 --> 36:30.940
I think it's easy to try out.

36:30.940 --> 36:33.140
Now we have mentioned this one previously,

36:33.140 --> 36:37.300
because it goes by the name vabeen1111 slash recipes

36:37.300 --> 36:38.140
on GitHub.

36:38.140 --> 36:39.880
That's the repo it's in.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.220
I think the Tandoor name must be new.

36:42.220 --> 36:44.480
I don't know how old exactly it is.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.760
Yeah, it is a new release too,

36:46.760 --> 36:48.660
so that might be maybe they did a name change.

36:48.660 --> 36:51.140
But they are using MKDocs for their documentation,

36:51.140 --> 36:53.220
so I've got to give them a plus point for that.

36:53.220 --> 36:54.660
Yeah, it says here that they're happy to announce

36:54.660 --> 36:55.780
they've released a new version

36:55.780 --> 36:57.900
which gives the application its well-deserved name

36:57.900 --> 36:59.620
and logo, Tandoor recipes.

36:59.620 --> 37:00.660
So there you go.

37:00.660 --> 37:02.900
It runs out of a Docker container.

37:02.900 --> 37:05.780
It will also run on Unraid, Synology, Kubernetes.

37:05.780 --> 37:08.700
You can do it manually as well if you want to.

37:08.700 --> 37:10.260
There's a bunch of interesting stuff

37:10.260 --> 37:12.740
about syncing and storage in their documentation.

37:12.740 --> 37:15.860
So it's going to take a lot for me to throw away Chowdown,

37:15.860 --> 37:17.940
because I do genuinely really like it,

37:17.940 --> 37:21.740
and I've modified the CSS so I've got some fuzzy search.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.260
You know how I love my fuzzy search.

37:23.260 --> 37:24.300
Oh, that's cool.

37:24.300 --> 37:26.540
You know, I've customized Chowdown for my own needs,

37:26.540 --> 37:28.940
but then maybe the grass is greener.

37:28.940 --> 37:30.460
Maybe I should try this one out.

37:30.460 --> 37:32.840
I mean, it does have the import functionality.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.260
Downside though is it needs a Postgres database,

37:35.260 --> 37:37.860
and I've already got like,

37:37.860 --> 37:40.940
it feels like a dozen different database containers running.

37:40.940 --> 37:42.560
Do I need another one?

37:42.560 --> 37:45.560
That is a constant internal battle,

37:45.560 --> 37:47.820
and sometimes I'm just down to, ah, who cares?

37:47.820 --> 37:48.700
Just run a whole bunch.

37:48.700 --> 37:49.700
You've got the resources.

37:49.700 --> 37:52.620
And other times, like the sysadmin in me

37:52.620 --> 37:53.780
is just not having it.

37:54.820 --> 37:57.300
You can't run three copies of Postgres.

37:57.300 --> 37:58.260
That doesn't make any sense.

37:58.260 --> 37:59.100
They're different versions.

37:59.100 --> 38:01.660
They have different security issues, different features.

38:01.660 --> 38:02.900
What are you doing?

38:02.900 --> 38:05.380
And it's a recipes app at the end of the day.

38:05.380 --> 38:06.220
Do you know what I mean?

38:06.220 --> 38:10.220
Just having the files in clear text on disk

38:10.220 --> 38:11.980
feels more future-proof to me.

38:11.980 --> 38:13.780
So if this person loses interest

38:13.780 --> 38:18.220
in maintaining this particular app for whatever reason,

38:18.220 --> 38:20.820
I'm not up the creek without a paddle, so to speak.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.860
That I think is a great feature of Chowdown.

38:22.860 --> 38:26.460
That kind of clear text backend gives me peace of mind.

38:26.460 --> 38:28.860
That's just a peace of mind for that kind of stuff.

38:28.860 --> 38:31.260
And if Chowdown stops working for some reason,

38:31.260 --> 38:33.460
I can just pull it up in any text editor

38:33.460 --> 38:34.560
and it's still readable.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.460
Yeah, it's almost as good as writing them down

38:36.460 --> 38:37.480
on an index card.

38:37.480 --> 38:40.160
You know, you laugh at that,

38:40.160 --> 38:42.160
but I'm pretty sure if I asked my mom

38:42.160 --> 38:45.420
to go and find me a recipe for something,

38:45.420 --> 38:48.580
she would find it in less time than it takes me to fix.

38:48.580 --> 38:50.060
Oh, Chowdown's not working?

38:50.060 --> 38:53.780
Okay, well, let me just SSH in and do this, do that,

38:53.780 --> 38:54.740
do the other.

38:54.740 --> 38:56.140
And before you know it, 10 minutes later,

38:56.140 --> 38:58.620
you've forgotten that you're actually looking for a recipe

38:58.620 --> 39:00.580
and then you go and order pizza instead, so.

39:00.580 --> 39:04.180
Yeah, and meanwhile, she's got the index card ready to go.

39:04.180 --> 39:05.020
It's very true.

39:05.020 --> 39:06.980
There's something to that.

39:06.980 --> 39:08.500
A reminder, you can find our sponsor,

39:08.500 --> 39:10.140
our Cloud Guru on social media.

39:10.140 --> 39:11.860
They're just slash the Cloud Guru.

39:11.860 --> 39:14.020
It's really easy, like on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube,

39:14.020 --> 39:15.900
pretty much all the social media platforms,

39:15.900 --> 39:17.740
just slash a Cloud Guru.

39:17.740 --> 39:20.060
Also, our members, thank you to our members,

39:20.060 --> 39:23.300

39:34.100 --> 39:35.740
My wife's CAM3 came in this week,

39:35.740 --> 39:37.380
so we're gonna have a little chat about that today.

39:37.380 --> 39:38.740
Yes, that's gonna be the post show.

39:38.740 --> 39:40.660
I ordered a few of them, so I got thoughts.

39:40.660 --> 39:42.020
Of course you did.

39:42.020 --> 39:45.700

39:58.720 --> 40:00.260
So thanks very much for listening, everybody.

40:00.260 --> 40:16.260
That was selfhosted.show slash 40.
