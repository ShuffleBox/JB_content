1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
I'm not sure what it is about you today, Alex.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,040
You just kind of have a glow about you.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,440
This episode of self-hosted is brought to you by the sun.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,160
Solar powered podcasting.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,280
That is awesome.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:11,780
Yeah, man.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,540
Wow.

8
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,040
Yeah.

9
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,300
And you got quite the solar stuff.

10
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,420
I mean, compared to the one that I have on my RV roof, which is, um, a lot smaller,

11
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,360
you got a lot more roof to work with.

12
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,280
I don't have a need to drive it down the road.

13
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,640
Do I?

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,560
So yeah, I've gone for an eight kilowatt solar system on my roof.

15
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,480
That's great.

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,880
And so it actually means like legitimately it's running everything.

17
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,360
On a day like today, in the middle of June, when the sun is beating down real

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,700
hard all day, I can actually run both my AC units, all my servers, fridges,

19
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,680
the TVs, everything, 100% on solar for about two hours.

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,100
And I know something that's on your mind is like eventually putting some

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,960
sort of battery solution in there.

22
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,120
There's of course, reasonable solutions, but if you could just Star Trek Q style,

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,280
snap your fingers and have a battery solution materialized out of thin air,

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,520
what would be your ideal setup?

25
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,720
Uh, you know how I like to make stuff.

26
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,680
I've, I've been watching videos of this guy called, I think, uh, is it Jerry Garcia

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,620
or something like that on YouTube for years and he builds his own batteries,

28
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,920
power walls out of old electric car batteries.

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:18,720
Yeah.

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,520
That's what I want to do.

31
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,840
I just think that'd be the coolest thing in the world because cars need a very high

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,000
peak voltage to accelerate the mass of the vehicle, whereas a house is a much

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,640
more constant, much less peaky load than that.

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,080
So you can get away with old air quotes, dead car batteries that are

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,600
actually suitable for, for houses.

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,800
I, you know what I didn't even appreciate earlier is that you had your air

37
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,520
conditioning going.

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,520
Two units as well, because, uh, I live in one of these crazy big American houses

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,560
that has a unit per, per story.

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,120
That's so cool though.

41
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,080
I mean, you're like not even hitting like the power grid

42
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,240
to run air conditioning.

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,520
That's that's awesome.

44
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:58,880
Yeah.

45
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,960
At one point today, the solar was reporting 6.4 kilowatts of power.

46
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,360
So 6,400 Watts, I suppose.

47
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,280
I dream one day of, of building a big, big array, just something, even something

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,000
around that size, I think it'd be perfect for what I have envisioned for the future.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,880
24 panels.

50
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,080
I think, um, solar edge is the company that I went with.

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,920
Um, yeah, and they've got an online monitoring platform, which home assistant

52
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,200
of course talks to, and my there's a local Zigbee gateway that talks to the

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,360
inverter, uh, as well to provide that information.

54
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
In fact, when they were installing it, it was kind of funny.

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,280
The, uh, the installer knocked on my door and said, Hey, where's your,

56
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,440
where's your router?

57
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,560
And I'm like, hmm.

58
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,680
Is that your yank router?

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,920
Why do you want access to my, to my router?

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,200
And, uh, he was like, Oh, I've got this Zigbee box.

61
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,240
I want to plug in and I'm like, why?

62
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,920
And he told me about everything it does and I thought, Oh, that's so cool.

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,360
And I was like, what do you need?

64
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,720
He goes, I just need an ethernet port.

65
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,600
I'm like, Oh, Oh, okay.

66
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,520
I got you covered.

67
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,520
That's pretty great.

68
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,960
So, uh, now it's connected up and, uh, it all talks back to the equipment over Zigbee.

69
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,160
Wow.

70
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,920
That's wild.

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,000
That is, you know, we also learned recently that Zigbee is used on the Mars helicopter

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,120
opportunity, or no, I'm sorry, Ingenuity.

73
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,920
And that's how it talks back to the Mars rover is over Zigbee.

74
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,120
Really?

75
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,720
That's cool.

76
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,520
Yeah.

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,640
So Zigbee is getting, it's getting used on Mars to communicate with the

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,800
little drone helicopter.

79
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, that's pretty cool.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,520
I'll be interested to follow your journey to see how that setup evolves.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,720
And then eventually I can't wait to hear stories of you up there on the roof, trying

82
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,000
to clean those panels after some storm or something.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,200
Yeah.

84
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,000
You know, it's coming.

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah.

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,960
Well, I have a confession to make before we get too far into the show.

87
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,560
So first I want to tell you about our friends at a cloud guru.

88
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,280
This episode is brought to you by them.

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,360
They are the leader in learning for the cloud for Linux and other modern tech

90
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,200
skills, hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs, get certified, get hired,

91
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,160
get learning at a cloud guru.com.

92
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:07,680
So while I was in Montana, I decided to be just, I guess, like extra challenging

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,640
and give myself more stress during my trip.

94
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,160
I decided to just to kind of throw a wrench at everything and do a episode of Coder

95
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,560
radio live on the road.

96
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,240
Not that this is impossible, but when you know, I've pre-recorded everything and

97
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,200
I'm only doing one live show on the road.

98
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,440
Like I'm not really in the right head space.

99
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,080
I haven't really checked everything out.

100
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,760
I didn't really think through it methodically.

101
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,560
Like I would, if it was a whole series of shows I'm going to produce.

102
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,040
And one of the things I didn't really have dialed in before I left for Montana.

103
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,320
Was remote desktop control and it has to be remote desktop.

104
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,480
It can't be SSH.

105
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,400
I actually have to see the console because of the audio tools we use in our mixer.

106
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,520
I have to see the console and I, I thought, well, you know what I'll do.

107
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,960
I know I shouldn't do this, but I don't have time.

108
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,360
I'm I'm going to throw team viewer on these machines.

109
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,040
And when I'm in Montana, I'll pull up team viewer and I'll get everything working.

110
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,320
I'll get the stream up over team viewer.

111
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,840
It'll be fine.

112
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,360
And for about five minutes, it was, um, I got re I got remoted in.

113
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,120
I realized, oh, this machine, you know, it's not running quite right.

114
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,400
It needs to be rebooted.

115
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
So I restarted the machine I was remoted into, which is fine.

116
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,340
Right.

117
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,060
That's fine.

118
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:26,680
It comes back up and team viewer, it has like some detective code in there that

119
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,880
detected that I was doing admin like functions, remoting into machine rebooting

120
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,080
and then trying to reconnect to it after a few minutes.

121
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,520
And it detected that I was doing these admin like functions and then disabled

122
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,760
my ability to connect for like 15 minutes.

123
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,760
Now that sucks because I'm an hour out from going live and I want to get the

124
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,600
stream up, I like to get the stream up about an hour before we start.

125
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,000
So people can start, you know, assembly 15 minute time.

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,500
Okay.

127
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,760
So I go about and I do my other things.

128
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,080
I set up stuff, other stuff up.

129
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,160
15 minutes goes by and I may be getting the time window wrong.

130
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,760
This was a few weeks ago, but that 15 minutes goes by I reconnect.

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,500
Nope.

132
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,000
Sorry.

133
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
Admin activity detected.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,280
You have to wait 15 minutes.

135
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Oh man.

136
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,640
So I keep going, setting up now I'm like a half hour, actually I let extra time

137
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,520
go by just in case.

138
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,800
And now I'm like, I'm at the 40 minute mark show starts at the top of the next hour.

139
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,280
So I'm like trying to get connected.

140
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,600
I gave it extra time.

141
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,480
I gave an extra like five, 10 minutes.

142
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,560
I connect again.

143
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,700
Nope.

144
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,720
Admin detected.

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,760
Can't connect.

146
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,280
Now I'm starting to get panic.

147
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,800
Now I can't get on.

148
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,000
Now I can't get on the internet.

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,360
I can't get on this live stream.

150
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,200
I can't get that going.

151
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,560
You know, Mike doesn't know he's going to be connecting, expecting me to be there.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,960
The audience is starting to show up in the chat room, asking where the stream's at.

153
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,920
It's starting to get stressful.

154
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,520
So, you know, I go into business mode and I think to myself, look, you jackass.

155
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,720
It's like $670 to just buy the commercial license and then you can get access to

156
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
your machines and you can do your show.

157
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
You're going to be traveling more this year.

158
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,760
Just, just pay the price.

159
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,200
Just pay the damn price.

160
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
So I, I think about it.

161
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,560
I know I could self host this.

162
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,680
I know I shouldn't do this, but I want to get on the air.

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,280
The show starts in just a few minutes.

164
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,280
So I head over to TeamViewer's site.

165
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,920
I get all logged in, make sure it's all my account stuff is correct.

166
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,240
And I subscribe to the annual like $670 plan.

167
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,680
That's a lot of greenbacks.

168
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,760
Oh, it hurts so bad.

169
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,680
I mean, I've, I've, I've paid more for other subscriptions, but this one in

170
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,040
particular, because of how they got me into it and because I needed, I needed

171
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,040
to just do this once, you know, like the way they got me into this, but I knew,

172
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,640
okay, if I might need to do it more, all right, I'll pay, I'll pay their license.

173
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,600
Fine.

174
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,040
It says instant activation right at the top of the website.

175
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,240
So I think I'm going to be golden.

176
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,040
Well, it was labor day and the TeamViewer staff was off that day, Alex, and nobody

177
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,160
was there to issue me my license.

178
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,720
Wait, that's not automated.

179
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,640
That's not instant either.

180
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,880
And so the time comes, we're like five minutes.

181
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,160
I still haven't gotten activated.

182
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,360
In fact, it took till the next day until I got activated.

183
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,680
I was so angry, but I figured out that if I did a new install on a new Linux

184
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,360
box and connected from the first time from that machine to the other machine

185
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,400
that I was getting blocked on, I could do it from that machine with the free

186
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,720
account and I got the stream up and running with like two minutes to spare.

187
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,840
And I had to then like, just let all of that fade and just focus on the show and,

188
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,560
and sit with the fact that I spent that nearly $700 and still didn't have the

189
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,640
license and I just had to sit with that while I did the show.

190
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:48,160
And so I, in that moment, to resign myself to find a free self-hostable

191
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,800
replacement for TeamViewer, I would not let this happen to me again.

192
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,760
And I did some shopping, I found a couple of different options.

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,280
I don't know.

194
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,240
Have you looked in this area yourself before a TeamViewer replacement?

195
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,680
No, they've never actually got me with that, uh, admin stuff detected.

196
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,320
I used to use it quite a bit to help family members back in the day.

197
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,200
But, uh, lately, I don't know, technology's matured to the point where I don't often

198
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
need to remote into their systems anymore.

199
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,360
So, well, and in a lot of cases, something like WireGuard with VNC

200
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,720
would do mostly what you need in, in a lot of cases, but in my case, I sometimes

201
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,920
am behind a double NAT, I need to be able to traverse that.

202
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,520
I need to do it from a mobile device.

203
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,960
I need to be able to do it from a Linux box, a Mac box, you know, anything like that.

204
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,640
Yeah, that's where TeamViewer is really nice.

205
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,560
It just, it just punches through everything.

206
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,760
So if you've never used it before, it's pretty slick actually.

207
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,640
You type in a, like a nine digit code, which identifies the other person's server.

208
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,160
And then they give you a five or six character password that you type in.

209
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,800
And, uh, yeah, that's how you do it.

210
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,400
You just connect like that and punches through every firewall inbound, outbound,

211
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,520
whatever bounces off their servers and just works.

212
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,400
And it makes those remote support situations so much more streamlined with

213
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,720
that code and, uh, it's simple.

214
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,520
I tried a few things and RustDesk came across my, I don't know, maybe it was an

215
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,040
email, but it came across my path.

216
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,200
And, uh, if you did send it to the show, thank you.

217
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:30,280
Cause I eventually did get a chance to try it out and I really, really like RustDesk.

218
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,280
As the name implies, it is built, it is built in Rust.

219
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,720
The client, the front end is open source.

220
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,920
They have one for basically every major OS, including your Linux is out there.

221
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,280
The front end client is really clean and simple.

222
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,040
It's a lot like a simplified front end for team viewer.

223
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,720
It runs as a backend service on Linux.

224
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,200
So you don't even necessarily have to have, have it up and running on your screen.

225
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,680
It'll install itself as a service.

226
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,560
There is a server component.

227
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,480
Now, by default, you can use their server.

228
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,040
You can use their, their server.

229
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,680
I think there's really no restrictions on it.

230
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,560
I was able to connect to three machines simultaneously using their free server.

231
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,320
They do say though, right on their front page, our server resources are limited.

232
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,480
So please set up your own server.

233
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,480
And that's where this gets a little tricky.

234
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:26,040
You can pay $200 a year, which is a lot less than 700 for their server, which is

235
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,920
all set up and nice and lets you do all kinds of connections and you can run it

236
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,720
on your own box for a year, but you know, $200 is a lot for some people.

237
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,720
So they've also made a demo server available is what they call it.

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,720
Now this demo server is significantly limited.

239
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,520
Only one relay connection allowed, no NAT traversal.

240
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,880
You really kind of have to be prepared for like a very limited experience, but

241
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,960
it's a demo server that's quote unquote free.

242
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,760
It's open source.

243
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,920
You could run it on your machine right now.

244
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,120
They make a Docker container available for it, but because it's open source, the

245
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,120
community could in theory, take their spec implementation and build a more

246
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,080
feature complete self-hostable Rust desk server.

247
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,440
And I think if Rust desk continues to take off and really makes itself an

248
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,120
appealing alternative to team viewer, I could really see the community stepping

249
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,360
up and taking the spec implementation that they make available for free and

250
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,440
building it into something else.

251
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,720
So I'm kind of going all in.

252
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,880
I loaded it on all the machines that I would need to build a

253
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
remote support in the studio.

254
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,120
How's the performance?

255
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,880
A lot of these things you mentioned VNC a few minutes ago.

256
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,960
I just have memories of that thing leave just not working very well or not updating

257
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,720
the cursor unless something's moving elsewhere on the screen.

258
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,520
How's this work?

259
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,120
Oh yeah.

260
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,960
Oh yeah, so many old cursor problems with VNC and are watching like the, the, the

261
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,000
screen paint as it, as you wait.

262
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,240
Yeah.

263
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,960
No, it's good.

264
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,480
It's great.

265
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,760
In fact, I'd say it is absolutely comparable with team viewers performance.

266
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,440
I didn't get a chance to dig in under the hood to see what they're using.

267
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,040
If they're using VNC, it is absolutely by far the fastest, bestest, most

268
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,320
incredible implementation of VNC I've ever seen.

269
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,440
I'd suspect it must be something else though, because the performance is great.

270
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,920
There's no mouse ghosting and I was absolutely happy even while having three

271
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,440
connections going simultaneously.

272
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,720
Well, that's the beauty of it being open source, right?

273
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,560
We can go and have a look if we want.

274
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,480
You can, we could go dig around it.

275
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,840
In fact, if the community has another one that they like, I know there's a few out

276
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,800
there that kind of are trying to solve this problem.

277
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,320
Let us know.

278
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,200
Self-hosted.show slash contact.

279
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,960
Now just looking through the source code.

280
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,360
I mean, there there's a file in the source called windows.cc and it mentions

281
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,360
ultra VNC has RDP support.

282
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,360
Do you need to use a normal VNC client for this?

283
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,880
Or do they provide everything that you need?

284
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,240
Yep.

285
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,280
They bring, you install the client on your OS and you can set up a session

286
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,880
ID, you plug it in there and it connects.

287
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,040
Once you connect once it saves it in a recent sessions area.

288
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,640
So you can just double click to reconnect to the machine again.

289
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,520
Then once you're in there, you get a viewer that lets you scale the screen

290
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,280
image or set it to the actual resolution.

291
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,240
And it has a little bar along the top that lets you switch between multiple

292
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,720
monitors.

293
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,360
If you're remoting into a system that has multiple screens, and it also gives

294
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,960
you a few other quick options that you might want, like send a few keystrokes

295
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,280
and, and stuff like that.

296
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,680
And the UI, when you launch it, the remote either to connect to someone, or if you

297
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,160
want to allow an inbound connection, it's just that one UI and it gives you your

298
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
ID and you set a password right there.

299
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,920
Very cool.

300
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,160
Yeah.

301
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,360
That looks like a great project.

302
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,880
One caveat though.

303
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,080
Unfortunately, at this time does not support Wayland on Linux.

304
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,400
So why is that always a gotcha like this?

305
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,320
Well, it's the nature of the Linux desktop right now.

306
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,160
Uh, but thankfully all of our studio systems, TeamViewer works on Wayland.

307
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,920
Yes, it does.

308
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,600
It does.

309
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,680
And I'm actually, that is one thing I have to give TeamViewer credit for.

310
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,520
And why I went with it is even though it gets a lot of hate, uh, in the technical

311
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,880
community, legitimately, they have been supporting a Linux release now for

312
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,680
a very long time and they are, they support Wayland, they support Gnome Shell,

313
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,320
Plasma, their integration is top-notch and I got to give them credit for it.

314
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,360
Like they've built a good product.

315
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,720
That's why I was willing to pay for it.

316
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,880
It's just the way that went about the delay and then the fact that I have to

317
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,240
pay that every single year, it's just not my bag and I always prefer to self host

318
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,440
if I can, and now I just have to decide, do I want the spec server or do I want

319
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,840
to pay for the Rust desk server?

320
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,640
I got to make that decision, but I'll play with it some more.

321
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,880
And decide in the future.

322
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,880
All right, very good.

323
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,720
Now, moving on, have you seen this website, shucks.top?

324
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,440
No, I've never heard of this.

325
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
Uh, what is this?

326
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,640
Somebody put it in the Discord, of course, and this website lists you all the

327
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,960
different drives that are suitable to be shucked.

328
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,400
You know how I like shucking drives.

329
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,960
I do.

330
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,040
And, uh, normally it's a dashboard of which retailer has which shuckable drive

331
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,400
on sale, but right now, thanks to crypto and this annoying, annoying, annoying

332
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:02,480
new Chia coin thing that, uh, you can mine coins on hard drives, apparently, uh,

333
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,000
hard drives, just like everything else now are in short supply.

334
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,520
You got to be kidding me.

335
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:07,960
Really?

336
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,360
Yeah, no, I want storage prices to be going down right now because I have a, I

337
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,040
have a big plan to buy a lot of disc around November.

338
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,440
Dang it.

339
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,400
So, uh, you know, yeah, you're a big shucker.

340
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,960
For those of you who don't know the term, you get a USB enclosure, hard drive,

341
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,640
and you shuck that enclosure and you get the disc out of it.

342
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,680
You know, it's like a coconut.

343
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,280
You get, you get the husk off and you pull out the coconut and, um, sometimes

344
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,880
it's delicious and sometimes it's, uh, not so good.

345
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,840
Well, sometimes it isn't so good.

346
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,160
Actually this week, I, uh, I've had two hard drives sale on me this week,

347
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,040
both shucked Seagates.

348
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
Oh no, man.

349
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,600
I've got a bunch of, uh, older Western digital drives, uh,

350
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,120
approaching three years old.

351
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,720
And so what I wanted to start doing was buying a disc every quarter, give or take

352
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,880
to start kind of staggering their dates so that the bathtub curve, um, that I

353
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,760
don't fall victim to that, which is, you know, if every, if everything's the same

354
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,920
age with the same environmental life conditions, the chances that they're going

355
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,000
to fail all at the same time is reasonably high.

356
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,360
So I wanted to try and protect myself from that a little bit.

357
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,640
Um, and so I bought a couple of these Seagate drives earlier in the year.

358
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,280
I think I talked about it on the show and both of these Seagate, 10 terabyte, uh,

359
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,000
what are they Barracuda pros have both just decided this week at exactly the

360
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,760
same time, despite my burn in tests and everything else that, uh, this week was

361
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,080
the week they were going to give up the ghost.

362
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,240
Oh man.

363
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,360
I'm so sorry to hear that.

364
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,720
Uh, nobody ever wants to deal with that.

365
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,880
Any data loss happen?

366
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,080
No, no data loss.

367
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,360
One of the drives was being used in ZFS and the other one was on merger FS.

368
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,480
So snap rate did its thing perfectly and so did ZFS.

369
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,760
So we're all good, baby.

370
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,960
Linode.com slash SSH.

371
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,720
Go there to get $100 in credit and support the show.

372
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,280
No matter what skill level you're at or what technology stack you use Linode can

373
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,200
help your ideas come to life on the web.

374
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,600
You're going to be impressed.

375
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,800
And when you get that $100, you can really try it out.

376
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,680
Alex, I don't think I told you yet, but I set up file run.

377
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,000
You know, you recommended it to us on Linux unplugged.

378
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,880
Oh, good.

379
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,480
Yeah.

380
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,880
Yeah, I set up a Linode, a couple of, well, it's been about a week now for the

381
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,560
elementary development summit and they're using file run to upload all of their

382
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,480
videos and stuff for the summit.

383
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,080
We were going to do a next cloud instance, but just file run seemed to make so much

384
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,640
more sense, a lot more straightforward for the, for the presenters to way simpler.

385
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,600
And it was really easy.

386
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,880
I I've told the story before, but it actually got, I got it all set up using

387
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,440
Linode's one click Docker deployment, which is in my case, I chose Debian, but

388
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,400
you've got a couple options there.

389
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,480
Debian Docker basic set up with Docker compose pre-installed and all of the

390
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,440
right repos set up.

391
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,120
And so I deploy that and then I just grab the Docker compose from the project for

392
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,080
file run and had it up and running before the DNS had switched over for the website.

393
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,640
And it was just like a no brainer.

394
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,840
And then later on, you know, of course, West West is always like, you know, we

395
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,920
could do, we could mount the S3 object storage and then use that for the storage

396
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,440
for file run, so we don't have to worry about them filling up the disk.

397
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,560
And I'm like, of course I'm on board with that.

398
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,280
I love stacking those Linode services together.

399
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,920
Their dashboard makes us really simple and straightforward.

400
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,160
You can use their cloud firewall to protect your system.

401
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,640
Then you can deploy a Linode to run your application, and then you can use object

402
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,040
storage on the backend to essentially have addressable storage that expands as

403
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,840
you need it.

404
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,120
Yeah, there's a lot of ways to crack that.

405
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,040
And if any of that sounds complicated, don't worry.

406
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,080
It's also really simple to just get started with a standard box.

407
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,280
Really easy with just a couple of clicks.

408
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,680
It's a great opportunity to learn with that one hundred dollar credit as well.

409
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,080
They have this powerful system with this simple interface.

410
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,480
So many people make that claim, but it's actually extremely hard to get that

411
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,200
balance right.

412
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,840
And the reason why Linode gets it right is because they've been attempting this

413
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,920
since 2003 and through just working at this and listening to their customers and

414
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,920
building it just focused on delivering the best virtualized cloud computing and

415
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,240
having that focus since 2003, they've gotten to this point where they have this

416
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,560
marvelous system now.

417
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,120
So go use our one hundred dollar credit at linode.com slash SSH to try it out.

418
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,440
And yeah, the performance is fantastic, too.

419
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,880
We love getting your stories.

420
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,680
So let us know how your switch to Linode is going.

421
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,160
Linode.com slash SSH.

422
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,080
Now, I'm reluctant to even bring this up, to be honest with you, because the open

423
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,840
source community is well known for over egging the pudding when it comes to

424
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,040
drama, but the more I dug into this story, the more I felt like it was worth

425
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,280
the discussion on the show.

426
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,080
So this week, Home Assistant developer Frank, you've probably seen his name

427
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
everywhere over Home Assistant.

428
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,720
He is a prolific contributor to the project, spelled F-R-E-N-C-K.

429
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,760
He jumped into a NixOS GitHub pull request and made what seems on the face

430
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,000
of it, like a really simple request. He says, as the author of the package, I'm

431
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,760
asking it to not be repackaged here.

432
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,000
Sounds straightforward enough, right?

433
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,160
I suppose.

434
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,680
I mean, it's MIT licensed, so he doesn't really have the authority to make that

435
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,200
request.

436
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,320
Well, that's just it, isn't it?

437
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:22,800
Yeah.

438
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,280
I mean, there's the spirit of the developer's intention.

439
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,280
And then there's the letter of the law, which says that NixOS, which is a Linux

440
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,320
distribution that's very technical, very niche, and very awesome if you're into

441
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,880
declared systems that are kind of just super, super niche, NixOS is great, but it

442
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,200
is a Linux distribution just like Ubuntu or Debian, they package these things up

443
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,000
into their own repos.

444
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,600
Well, here's the thing as well, right?

445
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:55,360
Is that NixOS is all about reproducible builds, but for some reason Fedora felt

446
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,600
the need to package this Amby Python library as well. And as the thread

447
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,520
transpired on GitHub, Frank started to get a little more petulant, dare I say, as

448
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,000
time went by, you know, he started off by saying, I have no emotional investment,

449
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:18,120
no emotional attachment to this issue. And then a few posts later, this by the

450
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,360
way has moved out of GitHub onto the Home Assistant forum by this point. He goes

451
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,440
from saying, I've got no emotional attachment to saying, sorry to hear you

452
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,880
don't respect requests from authors who wrote the source you rely on, the author

453
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,840
that has put in the effort to create it in the first place. Always good to know a

454
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,280
project doesn't care. I mean, come on.

455
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,760
In my opinion, I would characterize a lot of his responses as short and somewhat

456
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,240
hostile and snippy. People ask him like, they come back with very reasonable

457
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,960
counter suggestions and proposals that have been that are well thought out. And

458
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,720
he responds with trite one sentence responses that are sort of demeaning.

459
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:05,920
Yeah, one example of that is that Nick's OS offered, we will set a config flag in

460
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,720
the OS that reads, except that this package is not supported by upstream

461
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,920
developers, and I will go to Nick's packages to report any issues equals

462
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,240
true. And Frank was still unhappy with that. So

463
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,160
here's what I think here, Alex, because the core argument that Frank had was, he

464
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,040
was concerned this would lead to user support requests on him. He was concerned

465
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,920
that people would install Home Assistant and all of these packages and

466
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,320
dependencies on Nick's OS, run into some problem with their setup at some point

467
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,160
that led them to the Ambly library. And then from there, they would dissect the

468
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,240
source code and the original author, suss out his contact information or his

469
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,400
GitHub, and then file a issue support request or email with Frank. After that

470
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,600
process. Now, I've been in this for quite a while. And I could tell you, I bet you

471
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,600
a good steak dinner that the totality of people that would do that over say, like

472
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,840
a five to 10 year period would probably be a handful, you know, under a dozen

473
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,640
because let's be honest, Nick Nick's OS is an extremely niche Linux distribution.

474
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,560
Then the ability to entertain who the developer is. Well, actually, the ability

475
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,240
to entertain what particular library is even causing you a problem is a niche

476
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,280
skill set. The ability to entertain which developer created that one library

477
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,280
that's creating you a problem is also a niche skill set. So you get my point like

478
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,680
it's his main concern was that he'd be getting support requests when in reality

479
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,440
that just doesn't seem likely. That's not going to that's not going to result

480
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,840
from this inclusion in Nick's OS,

481
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,880
which raises the question, you know, if you don't want your stuff to be used and

482
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,960
packaged by other people, like this, I mean, the whole point of open source

483
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,880
licensing is that you're giving your code away, you still retain intellectual

484
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,160
property over it, you still, air quotes, own it, but you don't own what people can

485
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,440
do with it. And for me, that raises the question why he's even publishing it as

486
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,640
open source code in the first place, if he doesn't want people to do this?

487
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,360
Yeah, that's, that's a good question.

488
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,200
It's a tricky one, because if you think about the way in which Home Assistant

489
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,720
itself is licensed, that uses the permissive Apache two license. And that

490
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,680
doesn't really impose very many strict restrictions at all on derivative works.

491
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,440
If Home Assistant then includes any GPL licensed stuff, at that point, you're

492
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:36,160
going to, at that point, you then have a whole other can of worms about what

493
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,160
would, what would happen next. And I think, for me, I get a little concerned

494
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,080
when I see how Paulus, who was on the show a couple of episodes ago, jumped

495
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,680
into that Home Assistant thread, all of these links will be in the show notes, by

496
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,960
the way, and basically just locked the thread, closed it, and then delisted it,

497
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,640
like sweeping the whole thing under the rug.

498
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,480
All of this is that behavior of shutting down the forms and not really wanting to

499
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,280
engage in a conversation about it, trying to reduce the amount of heat that Frank

500
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:12,640
is taking, and Frank's response and being so concerned about additional support

501
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,640
requests that he would go to those, you know, he would essentially get in that

502
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,920
argument in that thread. I think all of these are symptomatic of what you and I

503
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,000
have worried about the project for a long time. And that is that the core

504
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,240
developers who are some of, as you mentioned, the most important developers

505
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,360
to the project are beyond what we would consider burned out and that they are on

506
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,280
their very last nerve. And every time we see a public interaction, we witness what

507
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,320
appears to be an individual who is so far at his end of his rope, he has no time to

508
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,320
deal with people talking back to him. He has no time for the possibility that he

509
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,560
might get additional emails. The idea that he might get more emails is upsetting to

510
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,960
him. And then you see Paulus going around and cleaning up the conversation in the

511
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,640
form. So that way it doesn't inundate Frank with all of this, you know, peanut

512
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,440
gallery chatter about it and just to try to get away from the issue as quickly as

513
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,960
possible because he doesn't have time to deal with it and he wants to stay

514
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,360
focused. And I don't really know what the solution here is because that just seems

515
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,280
to be, even if it's not the case, even if this is just Chris's wild opinion, it's

516
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,080
what the public sees every time. And the issue here is this made it out beyond

517
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,360
just the Home Assistant community this time. It made it onto Hacker News and it

518
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,720
had a very robust conversation over there. It was fired up on the forums like

519
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,400
Alex did. It made it to Reddit. It was in our team Slack where we were discussing

520
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,600
this back and forth. Like it made its rounds around the internet and it's not

521
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,920
a good look. It looks like everybody's hot take is, well, they don't know what

522
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,000
open source is. They don't understand how Linux distributions work. Don't they

523
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,640
know it's MIT licensed? And it's clear they're smart guys. They know all of

524
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,880
those things. There's something else going on here and we're just getting

525
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,640
little glimpses of it. See, I think you have a different take. You worry that

526
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,680
maybe one day these guys, because they don't appreciate and understand open

527
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,560
source, are going to take their cake and their ball and they're going to go home

528
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,400
and eat it. Does that make sense? And they're going to convert it to a

529
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,840
commercial product and we're going to be sitting here going, well, wait, now what

530
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,200
do we do? My concern is more the development team just totally burns out

531
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,680
and leaves the project and abandons it and says, well, it's open source. You take

532
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,080
care of it.

533
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,440
I think both scenarios are probably equally likely at this point, although

534
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,760
perhaps going closed source, I mean, we've got precedent for that with MB. We've

535
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,760
seen other projects do that before. I do think Home Assistant is slightly less

536
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,800
likely to do that because just because of the sheer volume of open source

537
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,360
contributions over the years. I think if there was any talk of Home Assistant

538
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,360
itself going closed source, that would get forked in a heartbeat and, you know,

539
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,560
home lover would come out of it instead or whatever you want to call it. And then

540
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,480
Home Assistant just wouldn't be able to keep up with changes without that open

541
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,880
source support. So I don't think it's hugely likely, but I feel like, you know,

542
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,160
all the moves and it's a difficult one because we talked to Paulus recently and

543
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,680
he paints a very rosy picture about the feature of the product and it's a

544
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,640
sustainable one as well. You know, Frank and Paulus and these guys are getting

545
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,640
paid through Nebuchadnezzar, which oftentimes is a reason that these

546
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,880
developers burn out is because it's a side hustle or a side project. For these

547
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,200
guys, it is their job, you know. So I do think we've come to expect a certain

548
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,200
level of access to open source developers like this because of the way

549
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,600
we conduct all of our business in public. I'm sure if we went and looked in some

550
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,280
internal, you know, company email thread named Big Corp here, we'd see similar

551
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,480
levels of emotional attachment and petulance at times. But the difference

552
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,240
here is that it's out for the world to see.

553
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,320
And there is a bit of a spirit of cooperation in the open source

554
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,680
community. A lot of Home Assistant is built on top of a lot of other great

555
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,080
code. And so when somebody comes along and says, yeah, but don't use our open

556
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,440
source code in your project, it doesn't really sit well and it gets noticed. And

557
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,480
I think to your point that, you know, there are full time employees of

558
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,680
Nebuchadnezzar, money is only part of the solution. It is likely that Frank is

559
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,200
such a talented developer and what he works on is so crucial to Home

560
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,400
Assistant. I bet you there is just an unrelenting, never ending amount of work

561
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,200
for him to take on. And, you know, he did some work with the new ESP Home

562
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,480
release that we'll talk about. And he did. Yeah. Yeah, he's done. He's

563
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,280
involved in more things than ever now. And I think there is only so much that

564
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,120
maybe one developer can take on. And when you're talented like he is, you're

565
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,240
going to get you're going to get worked. And I don't know if you've ever read

566
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,120
The Phoenix Project, which is a book about DevOps. It talks about this

567
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,840
concept of a halo engineer who people are afraid of upsetting or touching

568
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,640
systems because this this one guy knows all of the different incantations you

569
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,440
have to say to make something work. I feel like Frank's maneuvering into that

570
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,080
position. And the Home Assistant project is very dependent on him because of his

571
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,080
skills. It's a difficult problem to solve. And it is not unique to Home

572
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,480
Assistant that you end up with this reliance on one talented guy. But I

573
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,720
don't know what the solution is either. Do we all stop collectively emailing

574
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,680
Frank all at once? Maybe?

575
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,440
That might help. Well, why don't we just really quickly talk about ESP Home?

576
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,240
It's now part of Home Assistant. So they're kind of related. And for those

577
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,120
of you who don't recall those those little ESP, what is it 8266? And the ESP

578
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,480
32? Yeah, there's a couple of them. They're made out of China. There's a

579
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:50,240
company they're called Espressif. And they make ESP 8266 and ESP 32 devices,

580
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,160
little Arduino compatible single board systems that have a Wi Fi chip in them.

581
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,640
You can use them for for all kinds of things like sensors or controllers,

582
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:05,000
little MQTT devices. And now it's sort of a perfect fit, as you can imagine,

583
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,280
with Home Assistant, because that's a lot of that's a lot of things you'd

584
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,160
want to do with a Home Assistant installation. And so they've rolled out

585
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,680
version 1.19.0. And I think the biggest thing in here is they've added a

586
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,400
feature that's very similar to commercial smart plugs, where you can give

587
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,960
it your Wi Fi information over Bluetooth le and give it the Wi Fi credentials.

588
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,440
That's a huge feature. That's slick. Yeah, I remember Paula's telling us

589
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,800
about that a couple of weeks ago. It's nice to see it actually land in a

590
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,600
release. Now another improvement they've made is that they've been working hard

591
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,320
on some new tooling to make it easier for everyone to install ESP home and

592
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,280
other firmwares on their devices. And to do that, they've created something

593
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:49,240
called ESP web tools linked in the show notes. Yeah, that's nice to see. And

594
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,640
gonna make it even simpler for people to approach. But don't worry. They're

595
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,960
also improving the command line experience. So both got some love, which

596
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,600
is great to see. And then the other thing that I think puts this into now

597
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,280
I'm very much going to consider devices based on this is, and this is

598
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,240
something I've been waiting for desperately. They're going to add

599
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,240
attributes from Home Assistant now that you're going to be able to save them

600
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,680
into the local sensor on ESP home. So for example, the brightness of a light

601
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,520
so when the light turns on, it resumes the original brightness, or the

602
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,640
current temperature for a climate device. So that way doesn't have to keep

603
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,000
checking in with Home Assistant all the time. To be able to read attributes from

604
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,880
Home Assistant entities, right into the local sensor, I feel like is a

605
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,920
game changing feature. For them. It's just a bullet point in the new release.

606
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,120
And I'm like, Yes, I'm so happy. I've got this like Jonah Hill kind of I'm so

607
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,760
happy GIF playing right now. Yes. Right. Exactly. I think that's pretty great.

608
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:49,160
So a new ESP home makes me happy. Now in the spirit of embedded devices,

609
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:54,360
Tasmota has a new release this week, they've just released 9.5.0. Now there

610
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,840
is a breaking change in this release, and lights using the MQTT discovery

611
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,480
protocol will not work correctly in recent versions of Home Assistant. So

612
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,760
upgrade to 9.5 and use the Tasmota integration to work around that problem.

613
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,480
We want to thank our friends over at a cloud guru for sponsoring this your

614
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,480
program and let you know about their hands on with podman containers on

615
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,000
Linux course, which is free for the month of June. And of course, it'll

616
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,040
still be available for members when you go over there. This course, you're

617
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,840
going to learn what containers are. So you're going to get some basics there,

618
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,440
but also then how to manage them and specifically how to manage them using

619
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,560
podman, how podman interoperates with Kubernetes and system D. And, of course,

620
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,200
because it's the new way now, how to manage podman using cockpit, which is

621
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,040
the web graphical interface that I actually think is pretty great. But

622
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,600
don't mention it to Alex, it upsets him. But you can go over there, we'll have

623
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,320
a link in the show notes. And you can check out hands on with podman

624
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,200
containers on Linux for a cloud guru, which is free in June. But then, of

625
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,000
course, will be available on the platform link in the show notes.

626
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,560
Probably time we need some feedback, eh? Yeah, I think so. I feel like it.

627
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,720
Corey wrote in he wants to get social, but he wants to do without social

628
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,040
media. He says, Hey, longtime listener and even long timer self-hosted. I

629
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,960
love the show. And he says with more and more things going online only in

630
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,680
person interactions are getting to be more sparse. I found lately I need to

631
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,600
put conscious effort into keeping up with friends and family checking in

632
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,440
from time to time and or even taking notes about something they've mentioned

633
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,800
to follow up on. Wow. You know what, Corey? I'm just realizing I should be

634
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,080
doing that. He says Corey goes on to say I was curious if anyone had a tech

635
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,760
solution for this. Some sort of like contact management thing where you

636
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,360
could make notes about a project or vacation they mentioned. So you could

637
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,680
ask them about it later on or or even set reminders like. Hey, self, you

638
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,320
haven't talked to X in four weeks, maybe check in on them or maybe some

639
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,480
sort of reminder about their vacation and asking them how it went. Perhaps

640
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,280
it sounds a bit dumb, but I think I could put it to use, especially after

641
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,520
college or school when friends kind of go their own way. So is there

642
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,560
something out there? What would you guys do? Thanks. Well, at first I

643
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,920
thought the question was about social media, and I kind of had a sinking

644
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,600
feeling that self hosting your own social media kind of defeats the point

645
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,840
of social media. And then as the question carried on, I sort of was

646
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,360
listening and realized that actually what he's looking for is a basically

647
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,840
a customer relationship management system. And there is a really good one

648
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:35,240
in this space in the self hosted space called Monica at Monica HQ.com. And

649
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,240
this essentially lets you set reminders for all sorts of things like the

650
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,480
names of the children of all of your friends, wedding anniversaries, the

651
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,480
last time you called them and talked to talk to them about the weather or

652
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,800
whatever it might be. Monica lets you quickly and easily log all that

653
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,000
information so you can be a better friend, family member or spouse. I kind

654
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,600
of think this is a great idea, actually. Or I could see it, you know, for

655
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,040
like keeping track of what you guys have going on, you know, for the

656
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,320
JB team members. So that way I'm not like rude and just forgetting the

657
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,000
important things that you guys have going on, you know, like this could

658
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,600
make me a better team member. Well, good news. They have an official

659
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,720
Docker image over at Docker Hub. I might give it a look. If I remember

660
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,320
after the show, I might give it a try. Yeah, essentially it's a digital

661
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,720
Rolodex. Yeah, I think that actually be pretty useful. OK, so the Hom writes

662
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,160
in and this is about cooling Raspberry Pi's in your famous RV server seat

663
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,920
without cutting big holes in it. He's got a couple of suggestions about

664
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,320
using water cooling, actually, to cool the air inside the box rather than

665
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,440
the pies themselves. I had not even considered water cooling a Raspberry

666
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,400
Pi before. That actually be a pretty cool project, wouldn't it? So how

667
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,520
would that work? If you think about it, you'd put a radiator inside the

668
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,000
seat that would act as a heat sink, I suppose, because the thing about

669
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,880
water cooling rigs that I always I've never done water cooling in my

670
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,080
life. I've always wanted to, but it's always just been that notch more

671
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,880
expensive than I'm willing to go. Yeah, whenever I see that Linus Tech Tips

672
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,320
or whoever mucking about with water cooling, they've got these big shiny

673
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,720
copper heat sinks directly attached to the motherboard or whatever to the

674
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,880
CPU. I just how would you transfer the heat from the seat to the radiator?

675
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,000
I guess is the question. That is a good question. I think the way you'd have

676
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,720
to do it is you'd have to get something that sits on the pie. So I'd have to

677
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,920
get rid of my flirt cases that I like and get something that affixes to

678
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,320
the hot components on the pie. Affix it to the flirt cases because

679
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,880
they are a heat sink themselves, right? Maybe, maybe, maybe. I'd also

680
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,840
want like a plate that I could attach to a router. You'd want a couple

681
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,520
of different or maybe something for the switch and you'd run water

682
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,680
cooling through those plates into a radiator that I guess you could maybe

683
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,480
put it in the booth, but I think for better cooling you'd need the radiator

684
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,040
outside the booth. Clearly this needs better planning, but I like where

685
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,720
the home's going with this. It's an idea I actually had not considered and

686
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,840
anything would be better than cutting a hole in the side of my RV. However,

687
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,920
the pies are only part of the problem because the other situation I have

688
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,760
is the electrical system with the Victron equipment and the batteries.

689
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,000
When I'm running solar and so I'm taking in a whole bunch of solar which

690
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,560
generates heat surprisingly and then also running air conditioning so I'm

691
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,920
inverting solar power into air conditioning when it's really hot out.

692
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,040
So like say above 95 degrees or 90 ish even that just generates a lot of

693
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,640
heat in itself. Then you combine that with when I've been driving the

694
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,000
drivetrain is very hot which is behind the power bay. So it's a lot of

695
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,440
ambient heat and what I have to do to keep it running is I have to get

696
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,640
airflow going through there. So I don't think I could water cool the

697
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,800
Victron equipment. So it would only solve the Raspberry Pi problem but definitely

698
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,280
worth considering. I'm going to actually go do a little googling tonight and

699
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,240
see what I can find.

700
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,280
Yeah I mean like maybe with hard drives you don't need a huge amount of

701
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,480
airflow over them you just need some and maybe you could make that fan pull

702
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,720
double duty of doing the water cooling and also blowing air over the

703
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
drivetrain and battery bay.

704
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,920
Well Alex I think you better come out here and set a few weeks aside so we

705
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,440
can start getting to work on this project.

706
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,000
Maybe yeah it's episode 50 before we know it.

707
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,160
Yeah maybe that would be fun wouldn't it? I don't know though I'm pretty

708
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,560
nervous about it. Pretty nervous about cutting holes. I'll come to some

709
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,240
solution and when I do I'll share it but in the meantime let's talk about

710
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,520
something that'd be simple. Something maybe I won't have to mess too much

711
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:36,840
with.

712
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,280
Yeah we've got an app pick for you all this week called Tiny Home. This is a

713
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,400
simple static homepage generator. There's a link to it in the show notes and if

714
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,000
you head on over there you'll see there's a link to an example demo site.

715
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,960
And the demo site is just it's so simple it's just headings with a couple of

716
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,240
buttons on it you know so if you want to put all of your different self-hosted

717
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,480
web apps it's basically a collection of links you know like Heimdall, like

718
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,880
Homer, like Organizer all those kind of things except this is a statically

719
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,720
generated super simple little website.

720
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,360
Yeah and I think it just generates it from bash scripts or some kind of

721
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,120
script so it's really easy for you to manage it and just spit out a static

722
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,080
website. That's pretty nice. That's pretty nice.

723
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,920
Yeah just generate a little CSV file and the static generator will do the

724
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,400
rest.

725
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,840
Gosh that is easy. If you're still mulling over Google photo alternatives

726
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,080
check out Alex on Linux Unplugged 409. He joined us to talk about some of his

727
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,440
favorites and some of the ones we've covered on this show before but with a
