1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Coming up on Self-Hosted Episode 10,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,680
we'll find out why it was a really good idea

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,800
for Alex to run Cat 6A in his new home.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,800
And a handy-dandy speed test app.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,320
And I'll give you a very expensive

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,800
project off-grid update.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,640
I'm Alex.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,520
And I'm Chris.

9
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,600
And this is Self-Hosted.

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,760
So it's 2020 now, Chris, huh?

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,080
2020 and episode 10, two big moments.

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,080
I think this is officially the future now, 2020.

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,360
That's like a big number.

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,560
30 felt like a big age, but now I'm

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,440
in the process of coming to grips with reaching nearly 40.

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,080
And 40 feels like that's how old my dad was.

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,120
40 is old.

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,120
We have people.

19
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,080
You can't say that, Alex.

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,000
You can't say that.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,760
OK, so look, let me just preface this with, when I was a kid,

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,800
I remember my dad's 40th birthday being like a big deal.

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,920
I know.

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,440
That's what I'm saying.

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,760
And now it's me.

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,480
And 2020 feels the same way.

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,920
And episode 10, not quite.

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,240
That's more like episode 100.

29
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,680
But episode 10 is important.

30
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,120
One of my best friends just had his second kid today.

31
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,640
So congratulations, Chris.

32
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,360
Not you, my Chris Hudson, my other friend.

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,400
A lot of name conflicts with this one.

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,840
I got a name that just every office has a few Chris's in it.

35
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,280
You can just shake a stick.

36
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,200
So my parents picked Alex because they

37
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,120
thought it was original, Alexander.

38
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,920
When I got to preschool, there were five in my class of 22.

39
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,800
I suspect I was named after Superman, Christopher Reeves,

40
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,840
because I think my mom had a thing for Superman.

41
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,680
That's my theory.

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,240
Oh, that explains the heaven.

43
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,040
So really, though, what's relevant for this show

44
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,360
is to celebrate episode 10, we're

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,640
introducing a few corners to the podcast.

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,440
We are.

47
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,480
And we need to start with camera corner this week

48
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,840
because while we were on holiday break,

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,000
WISE went and had themselves a bit of a data compromise.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,440
And just about the entire internet

51
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,720
wanted us to know about it, because we've

52
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,840
talked about those WISEcams here on the podcast.

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,960
I'm so sad.

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,280
Those WISEcams were like the panacea.

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,800
I don't know.

56
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,440
I mean, $25 each, when it's that good of a deal,

57
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,400
there's a higher risk profile, most likely.

58
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,240
There's got to be something wrong with it.

59
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,720
And there have been other cameras, like from Sonoff.

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,360
They're just releasing a pan tilt zoom camera as well,

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,880
which will run, I believe, Tasmota firmware.

62
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,120
So there are other games coming into this town as well.

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,560
So luckily, even though WISE appear

64
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,480
to have had a few missteps, which we'll cover now, I guess.

65
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,080
Yeah, so I guess let's talk about what happened.

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,680
It looks like it was essentially an operational error.

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,440
Their production database was duplicated and for a bit

68
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,240
put out into the public.

69
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,520
Now, this group that likes to call themselves security

70
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,840
researchers, but they're really just sort of stunt actors,

71
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,040
had a lot of fun with this.

72
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,060
They came across this, and they contacted WISE

73
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,320
and gave them very little notice.

74
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,360
Stunt actors.

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Yeah, they were.

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,800
That's just funny.

77
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,680
Well, they're just completely irresponsible.

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
So you can't really call them security researchers.

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,440
It's really a shame what happened to WISE.

80
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,440
But at the end of the day, it was their mistake.

81
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,120
So device information, like tokens

82
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,040
associated with your Echo integration, user email

83
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,400
address, your camera nicknames, your Wi-Fi network information,

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,160
and WISE device information were in this public database.

85
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,160
There was nothing to do with credentials.

86
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,280
However, I think Amazon has reset everybody's tokens.

87
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,920
And there was also a small number

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,800
of users who were beta testing, I think, a scale, a WISE scale.

89
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,880
And so some body metric information was public.

90
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,720
Doesn't seem clear if it was accessed by anyone

91
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,840
other than this research group.

92
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,600
But I think it's something we touched on with our chat

93
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,280
with Quindor last episode.

94
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,080
And that is these companies have to become infrastructure

95
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,440
experts when they roll out a cloud service that

96
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,000
goes along with their product.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,080
Well, everybody's a software company these days.

98
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,840
Look at John Deere tractors.

99
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,800
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,000
And so that's why when this news came out,

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,420
I was frustrated that any information that

102
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,080
was in the app at the time I set up these cameras

103
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,320
may have been leaked.

104
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,120
But my cameras are fully offline.

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,440
They're blocked from WISE services.

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,500
They're reflashed with the RTSP firmware.

107
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,780
And I use them via Shinobi.

108
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,760
And I don't use the cloud service at all.

109
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,560
So I'm not as concerned about a compromise.

110
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,560
But it's still really disappointing to see it.

111
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,880
I kind of knew something like this could potentially happen.

112
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,640
They're new.

113
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,760
The products are cheap.

114
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,960
It seems possible.

115
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,760
I think one thing is clear to me working in the industry

116
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,840
that there's a lot of people who like

117
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,620
to spam their resumes and CVs with technology names.

118
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,040
And they don't necessarily have enough experience

119
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,600
to back it up.

120
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,920
People want 10 years of DevOps experience.

121
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,760
Well, what does that even mean?

122
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,160
DevOps hasn't really even been around for 10 years as a concept.

123
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,120
So people want a good example in my line of work,

124
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,320
10 years of OpenShift, 10 years of Kubernetes experience.

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
Well, good luck.

126
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,120
Yeah, it's like one part a joke.

127
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,580
But it is also a real problem.

128
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,480
And everybody thinks they're an expert.

129
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,880
And it's not just the small guys.

130
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm picking on WISE here.

131
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,880
But YaoMei, the ginormous Chinese corporation,

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,680
had some sort of issue on their back end proxy service.

133
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,800
So Google had to completely disable the ability

134
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,500
to pull up YaoMei cameras because it

135
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,360
was showing other folks' cameras inside other homes.

136
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,920
You'd ask the Google Smart Home to show your camera.

137
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,760
And it would show you somebody, a complete stranger's camera.

138
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,920
That was freaky.

139
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,680
I remember looking at that one on Reddit

140
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,360
and seeing just the video and the kind of panic

141
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,320
almost that Reddit went into frenzy over that one.

142
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,680
And for once, it was justified.

143
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,720
And Google pulled the plug pretty quick that day.

144
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,160
I'm kind of glad they can.

145
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,620
They just revoked Xiaomi's token.

146
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,600
And they're good to go.

147
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,680
That's why I was pretty impressed

148
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,760
when you were setting up your own self-hosted cameras

149
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,560
at the new place.

150
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,680
So you're in the new house now.

151
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,540
I am.

152
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,920
And you have been on a project streak.

153
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,540
I've been so impressed with how much you've actually just

154
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,160
gotten done.

155
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,460
Like, you're not waiting around.

156
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,080
You've got thermostats, cameras, lighting.

157
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,560
I mean, gradual.

158
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,200
There's so much to talk about, Alex.

159
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
But why don't we talk about the cameras

160
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,360
that you installed, because it's perfectly

161
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,780
in line with the camera corner.

162
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,840
Well, so in the last house, I was renting.

163
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,280
And this one, we bought a house.

164
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,000
And I can run ethernet, so I can do what I want.

165
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,680
Oh, yeah.

166
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,560
So I've run Cat 6A from the basement to the attic.

167
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,320
That was literally the first big job that we did.

168
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,000
So my server's down in the basement.

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,080
And I've got a humidity sensor down there.

170
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,160
And so far, it's not been above 63%, 64%.

171
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,160
So we're looking tasty on the basement front.

172
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Isn't that nice to know in a new place?

173
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,800
And all that information gets fed into Home Assistant,

174
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,760
and therefore Grafana.

175
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,720
So I could already look back at the last two,

176
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,560
three weeks' worth of data and say, we've had a bit of rain,

177
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,440
not too much.

178
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,280
And say, look, my basement is fine.

179
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,360
I don't need the dehumidifier or whatever.

180
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,600
That's so cool.

181
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,760
So running Cat 6A because, and here's the reason,

182
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,000
I wanted to future-proof it so I could run 10 gig over copper.

183
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,760
Yeah, that doesn't surprise me at all.

184
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm curious if you're also doing POE for these cameras.

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,520
I am.

186
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,480
Yeah, so I looked at a bunch of options.

187
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,280
Unifi makes some really great gear.

188
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,060
But ultimately, I didn't want to be

189
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,440
locked into their kind of proprietary ecosystem

190
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,220
with the cameras.

191
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,200
I had a couple of Nest cams from the last house

192
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,680
and a thermostat, actually.

193
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,600
But after they retired the Works with Nest API program,

194
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,160
I have sworn off that Nest train.

195
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,400
Yeah, that's your warning shot.

196
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,120
If you don't learn your lesson from that.

197
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah.

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,920
So I wanted something that was completely not going

199
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,720
to rely on the vendor ever.

200
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,440
So I bought two different brands of cameras to try out.

201
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,640
And I like them both.

202
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:03,120
So I bought an Amcrest 4K IP8M T2499EW.

203
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,800
That rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

204
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,560
And then that's plugged into Shinobi with an RTSP feed.

205
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,640
So those were my requirements, really.

206
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,400
POE, RTSP.

207
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,240
Absolutely.

208
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,160
And then the rest, generally speaking,

209
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,600
comes that they do night vision.

210
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,440
They do all the rest of it.

211
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,960
And they're working pretty well and pretty reliably?

212
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,040
Yes, perfect, dude.

213
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,000
Every time I log into Shinobi, it's right there.

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,240
Now, I haven't actually had the time

215
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,240
to go in and configure motion and that kind of thing,

216
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,880
like recordings and stuff.

217
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,220
But I tried a couple of different ways to run Shinobi.

218
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,280
The first one was out of a Docker container

219
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,880
that my friend Alex wrote.

220
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,720
He's one of the Linux server guys.

221
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,240
And it was fine.

222
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,880
But I was getting about a 5 to 10 second lag.

223
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,560
And I couldn't really figure it out.

224
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,680
And so I hopped onto the Discord with Moeis Cool, who I think

225
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,560
is part of the Shinobi project.

226
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,520
And he helped me out with a few different things.

227
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,640
Oh, that's awesome.

228
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,080
Yeah, I know it is, right?

229
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,440
I love open source.

230
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,920
And I built an Ubuntu VM on my ESXi box.

231
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,280
And I'm running Shinobi in there.

232
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,280
And my lag is down to maybe one, one and a half seconds.

233
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,920
There you go.

234
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,440
I can hear a car door close outside.

235
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,520
And it's sort of.

236
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,480
That's pretty good.

237
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,520
Yeah, I like it a lot.

238
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,280
So if I hear a van pull up, there's no window behind me.

239
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,160
So I can't see the front driveway from where I'm sat.

240
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,440
I just have Shinobi on a screen next to me all the time.

241
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,680
And I can see perfectly what's going on in 4K.

242
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,760
It's great.

243
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,560
So Amcrest was one of them.

244
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,480
Amcrest, OK.

245
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,200
And then the other one, I bought a pair of Reolink cameras.

246
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
Now, the reason I bought three cameras

247
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,160
was because the Amcrest 4K was about $100.

248
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,160
The Reolinks were about $50 each.

249
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
They don't have 4K, I don't think.

250
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,120
But they're like 2.5K five megapixel sensors.

251
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,520
So my rationale for that was I want the camera I'm going to use

252
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,200
the most is the driveway.

253
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,920
And then the other cameras I'll use,

254
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,040
I'll put one in the back garden and watch the deer run past.

255
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,080
Yeah, sure.

256
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,280
And then have another one looking up the street.

257
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,360
4K is nice not just for future proofing,

258
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,680
but also for getting enough resolution

259
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,120
to read license plates in the driveway and stuff.

260
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,640
That's where 4K can be nice.

261
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,680
I can see individual raindrops in the puddles outside my house.

262
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,200
It's phenomenal.

263
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,720
It's so great.

264
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,680
So out of the couple there, though, the two brands,

265
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,360
sounds like you like the slightly more expensive Amcrest

266
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,080
ones.

267
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,960
I do.

268
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,160
But is it worth twice the price?

269
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,280
I don't know.

270
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,080
If you were to do a blind test and put them on a 1080p screen,

271
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,920
which in reality, they're only ever

272
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,000
going to be one quarter of a 1080p panel

273
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,440
for 99% of their life, I couldn't tell the difference.

274
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,040
So is it worth it?

275
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,840
Probably not.

276
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,120
But I've already bought it, so.

277
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,720
And they'll probably last quite a while.

278
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,320
I do hope so, yeah.

279
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,880
I'm really curious to know if anyone has suggestions for me.

280
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,480
Because I'm pretty satisfied with interior cameras,

281
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
but now I want exterior cameras.

282
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,560
That would be really nice.

283
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,760
Somebody was in the yard just the other day.

284
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,800
A rando was in our yard the other day.

285
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,000
And the only one I have is the dash camera.

286
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,840
Something like this, I really like the idea,

287
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,000
although I've been not a big fan of running ethernet in an RV.

288
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,240
Yeah, I can imagine.

289
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,800
Something I can mount on the outside.

290
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,400
And I'll tell you what, PoE switches

291
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,800
are a whole minefield of different standards,

292
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,600
and specs, and voltages, and all sorts of nonsense.

293
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,920
Oh, yeah, was that a rabbit hole?

294
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,240
Did you spend forever doing research and stuff?

295
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,720
It was.

296
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,160
It was about an evening.

297
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,960
I wasted about maybe four or five hours just researching

298
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,800
PoE switches.

299
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,320
And I settled on $100 Netgear eight port PoE switch,

300
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,240
which is compatible with my two UniFi access points,

301
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,680
as well as the three cameras.

302
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,320
And it will do, I think, 80, 90 watts or something total.

303
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,960
So it's going to be totally fine for what I need.

304
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,040
So before we completely get out of camera corner,

305
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,600
I did want to ask you about that.

306
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,280
Sounds like these are all ethernet,

307
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,160
but you did install new APs.

308
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,520
I bought a pair of UniFi AP AC Pros

309
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,640
when I lived in London, because my flat in London

310
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,640
was long and thin with brick walls.

311
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,560
Even though it was a 700 square foot apartment,

312
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,020
I still needed two of the darn things

313
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,480
to get signal at the front and the back of the house.

314
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,120
I have two for my RV.

315
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,080
I assume it's the metal wall or something.

316
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,960
It kills signal.

317
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,240
So I have one in the bedroom and one in the living room.

318
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,720
Yeah, so I'm still running the UniFi controller in the cloud

319
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,440
on a droplet with DigitalOcean.

320
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,880
And yeah, I'm now actually using the UniFi component

321
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,160
of Home Assistant to do presence detection.

322
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,840
And one of the other projects, which we'll

323
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,160
get to in the next episode, is my automated garage door

324
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,040
opener.

325
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,720
And so I'm actually using the presence detection of UniFi

326
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,060
and Live 360 combined to automatically open

327
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,640
my garage door and all sorts of stuff.

328
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,840
But we'll get to that.

329
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,360
Oh, boy.

330
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,180
OK.

331
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,540
So I am currently watching the Wi-Fi market

332
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,920
to see what direction I want to go.

333
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,440
I'm not huge on the requirement of the UniFi controller.

334
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,680
I'm not huge on that.

335
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,980
And I would love to see somebody come along and really

336
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,040
challenge UniFi.

337
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,440
Well, it's not a requirement.

338
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,840
OK, it's just when you want to set it up,

339
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,960
you can do it through the app these days.

340
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,280
And if the controller goes away, these APs

341
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,920
will continue working forevermore

342
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,360
until you reconfigure them.

343
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,240
I mean, the Home Assistant integrations really

344
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,000
might put it over the top.

345
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
I just love Home Assistant so much

346
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,960
that if it works with Home Assistant, I'm like,

347
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,800
I'll use a controller then.

348
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,300
Cool, Alex.

349
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,200
Well, congratulations on the move

350
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,080
and congratulations on the new setups.

351
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,840
Sometimes you can let that stuff get away and never get to it

352
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,240
and all these projects build up, but you have been cracking.

353
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,720
Oh, I've been so excited about this house, you know?

354
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,640
So how the heck did you find time for our little app

355
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,720
this week?

356
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,600
So when you're running ethernet, turns out

357
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,480
you want to figure out whether what you've run

358
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,640
is actually capable of what you hope it is.

359
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,440
Of course.

360
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,520
I found an app called LibreSpeed,

361
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,520
which you can run in a Docker container.

362
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,560
And I do on my server.

363
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,360
And this thing, it's a little web app

364
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,380
that you can run in a browser.

365
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,680
There's an Android app as well.

366
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,600
And the HTML5 version should work

367
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,200
in the browser of an iOS or any other flavor of device.

368
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,720
So I love this for myself.

369
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,780
I threw this on a Docker container in the RV.

370
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,600
And when I move about, it's a very simple, reliable,

371
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,800
and reproducible way for me to measure

372
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,040
the speed of my connection.

373
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,660
And one of the things that it highlights,

374
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,160
which is extremely important to me,

375
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,440
is the actual jitter level of your connection, which

376
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,360
can have a huge impact on VoIP calls.

377
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,560
It's nice if you think about the possibilities here.

378
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,760
Normally, we rely on speedtest.net

379
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,600
to figure out how fast our Wi-Fi is, how fast our 4G is,

380
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,480
all that kind of stuff.

381
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,640
And a lot of providers actually seriously prioritize

382
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,960
that traffic because they know that people will call into the

383
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,440
call center and say, hey, my internet's

384
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,600
only getting 300.

385
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,240
You promised me 400, blah, blah, blah.

386
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,720
So a lot of providers actually really prioritize

387
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,140
those packets heavily.

388
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,880
So a really good way to test you're

389
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,760
getting what your ISP says you should be getting

390
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,600
is to just run some normal traffic

391
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,840
to a self-hosted droplet.

392
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,480
Yeah, or run it on a droplet or a VPS of whatever provider

393
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,240
and ensure that you're getting the speeds

394
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,800
that you're paying for because it's so simple to start.

395
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,960
It took me seven seconds to get it up and running

396
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,920
in a container.

397
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,480
We'll put a snippet of the Docker compose

398
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,320
YAML in the show notes.

399
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,020
But it is super-duper simple to run.

400
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,040
And it shows you your ping and your jitter, like Chris said.

401
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,600
But for me, the most important thing

402
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,240
was I could run it on my desktop,

403
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,380
plug it into the ethernet that I'd just run,

404
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,880
and see that I was getting that gigabit speed that I wanted.

405
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,600
So not only could I plug in my ethernet cable tester

406
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,480
and check the pairs are all OK, I

407
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,880
could check that the 200, 300-foot run that I'd just

408
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,960
done was actually giving me the speeds

409
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,160
between my desktop and my server that I wanted.

410
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,040
I could also make a half bonus suggestion for stat ping

411
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,680
in this category, too.

412
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,880
I'll put a link to stat ping in the show notes.

413
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,480
And that just gives you an overall health

414
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,200
check of the quality of your connection,

415
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,680
the average response time, the 24-hour uptime,

416
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,960
and your overall uptime for the last seven days.

417
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,480
And it gives you a graph of that.

418
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,280
So you can see how reliable your connection's been,

419
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,720
which is super handy for me.

420
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,000
Status.ktz.cloud is my stat ping instance.

421
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,920
There you go.

422
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,560
I'll tell you what's interesting was when I moved house.

423
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,600
So I went from AT&T Fiber to Spectrum,

424
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,160
which is a DOCSIS 3.1 cable connection, same as Virgin

425
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,000
Media in the UK, I think, use.

426
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,380
And I noticed my average response time

427
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,960
went from about 8 milliseconds to about 35 milliseconds.

428
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,280
Ooh, womp womp.

429
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,860
Yeah, you were a little worried about it, maybe justifiably so

430
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,080
then.

431
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,920
Yeah, a little bit.

432
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,320
I mean, I've sacrificed my gigabit upload

433
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,120
for 35 meg upload, which hurts.

434
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,120
But it's a nice house.

435
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,340
It's an opportunity to just engineer things

436
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:51,960
slightly different.

437
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,000
That's how I look at it.

438
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,120
I mean, that's where my whole project off-grid thing really

439
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
came from.

440
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,720
So what's going on with off-grid then?

441
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,240
So project off-grid is my personal project

442
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,480
to essentially get a bit of an internet presence

443
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,680
while offline.

444
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,880
I've moved all of my IoT devices to be

445
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,320
controlled by Home Assistant, been setting up

446
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,360
things like offline readers and caches of movies and games.

447
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,920
And part of this project off-grid

448
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,760
has always eventually been solar.

449
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,840
So that way, I could be off-grid in terms of power generation

450
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,120
as well.

451
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,920
So I'm starting to look at that right now

452
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,760
because there's a lot of other motivating factors.

453
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,100
Our setup right now is it's a 50 amp connection to shore.

454
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,640
So when I'm plugged into shore power,

455
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,260
I've got 50 amps of power to work with.

456
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,120
That's plenty.

457
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,720
When I am mobile, it's much less.

458
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,800
It's an 1,800-watt inverter.

459
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,280
So I have about eight.

460
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,980
It can go up to 2,000, but it's an 1,800-watt inverter.

461
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,320
And I've got two lithium-ion batteries.

462
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,220
It's not very much room to work with.

463
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,240
So I've been planning to upgrade the whole system,

464
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,200
and I'm ready to make a plunge.

465
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,920
And I kind of want to run past you

466
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,160
with what I think I'm going to do for project off-grid.

467
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,240
How long can you go on battery power then?

468
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,920
Right now, about anywhere between six to 12 hours

469
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,320
in a really kind of conservative run, just the bare minimum,

470
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,600
keep the fridge on, a few lights, and maybe the TV.

471
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,300
Oh, that's right.

472
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,240
You've got to run a flipping fridge.

473
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
Yeah, I've got a residential fridge.

474
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,480
And it's a 40-foot RV, so it's a big RV.

475
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,640
And there's a lot of stuff in there.

476
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,160
And only a few of the plugs are on the inverter.

477
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,880
And the inverter is a modified sine wave,

478
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,320
so it really messes with my audio equipment.

479
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,680
It creates a lot of buzz in the audio.

480
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,720
It's bad.

481
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,280
And the UPSs, I take it.

482
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,160
And it's aggressive, and it does not work with UPSs.

483
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,160
So I'm looking at going with three solar panels.

484
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,120
I have room for more, but I want to start small at first,

485
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,840
because I am in the Pacific Northwest, which would bring

486
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,760
in 510 watts of solar, but would, in theory,

487
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,280
be expandable to 1,000 watts.

488
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,280
I have the room, and the system can handle it.

489
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,560
So what are you realistically expecting from that 500-watt

490
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,400
panel in Seattle?

491
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,360
Well, or when I travel outside of Seattle,

492
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,900
down in Arizona or Texas.

493
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,600
Yeah, that's a good point.

494
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,400
I'll tell you what.

495
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,640
That's probably your more usual use case for the solar, right?

496
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,840
Not at home.

497
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,360
Good point.

498
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,120
Yeah, and while you're going down the road,

499
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,640
it'll be charging, too.

500
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,400
But even, say, at Linux Fest Northwest, there's sun

501
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,600
sometimes.

502
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,320
I mean, it was quite sunny last year.

503
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,200
So the idea would be that it sort of supplements your power.

504
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,680
And you go from maybe being able to stay parked for 12 hours,

505
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,760
which would be really kind of tight right now,

506
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,680
to maybe 24 hours, to kind of bring

507
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,240
in a little supplemental power.

508
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,680
I have a generator on board, too, which I can run and charge

509
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,440
up the batteries.

510
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,760
I can't currently do that.

511
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,120
Burning those dead dinosaurs is effective.

512
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,160
It's very effective.

513
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,120
So that's why I kind of thought I'd go balanced.

514
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,680
I'd go with just 510 watts of solar,

515
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,000
plus I have a generator.

516
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,500
So between the two of them, I could charge up a battery bank.

517
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,560
And then as part of this, add three more 100-amp-hour

518
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,960
Battleborn lithium batteries, a Victron MultiPlus 3000 VA

519
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,240
inverter, and upgrade the alternator charging system

520
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,880
in the RV engine so it can charge this battery bank.

521
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,200
Because when it's all said and done,

522
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,280
there'll be like five or six lithium ion batteries

523
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,680
this thing's got to charge.

524
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,920
And so what's your expected run time at the end of this?

525
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,800
I don't have a final number yet.

526
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,760
What do you want?

527
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,600
I'm shooting for 24 or 48 hours.

528
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,480
Well, 24 or 48, there's only 100% difference there.

529
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:34,980
I know.

530
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,800
Well, it depends on if my current lithium ion batteries

531
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,920
are usable or not.

532
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,520
OK.

533
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,760
I'm working with a company called AM Solar, really, really

534
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,320
well-known, well-respected, good craftsmanship kind of company

535
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,760
based out of Oregon.

536
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,200
Do you have a guess on what this rough price for a system

537
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,440
like this would cost?

538
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,120
Oh, lord.

539
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,320
So I was looking at solar for the roof of my house,

540
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,320
just with the Tesla Powerwall stuff.

541
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,560
I'm not in a position to buy it.

542
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,440
But it was like 15 or 16 grand.

543
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,400
So this is a much smaller scale system.

544
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,040
But then again, it's in an RV, so it's

545
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,000
got to be earthquake proof.

546
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,880
So I'd say similar.

547
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,320
Let's go 10, 15 grand, something like that.

548
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,440
Yeah, it's 15 grand.

549
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,880
Oh, wow.

550
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,960
15 grand, yeah.

551
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,320
Now, that takes the whole system and replaces

552
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,160
my entire electrical system.

553
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,400
It's a pure sine wave inverter.

554
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,200
All of my outlets would be powered,

555
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,480
which is actually pretty important since I have a CPAP

556
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,000
and other things.

557
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,040
And it would mean we'd have the capability

558
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,800
when we were visiting somewhere that wasn't wired for an RV.

559
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,120
This is such a cool feature.

560
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,040
And you could plug my entire RV into a standard wall outlet

561
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,760
with an extension cord, like you would a vacuum cleaner.

562
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,800
And the Victron system, you set it.

563
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
You say, hey, I'm on a, you set it,

564
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,400
say don't use more than 15 amps from shore power.

565
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,960
The Victron system, once you have that set,

566
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,720
when it senses load more than the 15 amps,

567
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,440
it will pull the additional power it requires

568
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,200
from the battery bank.

569
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,680
So that way, you can just keep on using stuff in the RV.

570
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,040
You can peak above 15 amps and it'll just make up

571
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,160
the difference from the batteries.

572
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,120
And that, for the style of travel we do,

573
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,720
would be so killer because I show up in the RV

574
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,480
to do a podcast about a place.

575
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,760
We did this at Dell, we did this at Linux Academy.

576
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,560
We just, we've done this so often.

577
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,240
And they're not wired for an RV.

578
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,040
Like they can give me some power,

579
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,880
but they're not, this is not an RV park.

580
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,000
And this would let me hang there for days at a time,

581
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,280
get the work done and have just the right amount of power.

582
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,320
I don't even know how that would work.

583
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,320
It's amazing, that is magic to me.

584
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,560
It really is pretty cool.

585
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,840
And with that, I would be completely off-grid

586
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,520
because we'd have, we'd be generating our own power.

587
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,280
We store our own water.

588
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,000
We'd have our own network with Home Assistant

589
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,200
that does all of this automation off-grid, offline.

590
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
It's really cool, it's really close.

591
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,560
And so I was talking to the shop

592
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,680
because they're a really in-demand place.

593
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,320
And they were telling me if I do it in January, February,

594
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,560
I can probably get it done in the next six months.

595
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,000
If I go much beyond January, February,

596
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,880
it's, they're booked months out.

597
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,560
Well, six months is still booked months out in my opinion.

598
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
They must be in demand.

599
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,480
So here's another suggestion.

600
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,160
There's a program on YouTube called Fully Charged,

601
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,880
which is by, what's the name of the guy in Red Dwarf

602
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,080
with like the blocky face?

603
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,240
Robert Llewellyn, I think is his name.

604
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,280
He runs a YouTube show called Fully Charged.

605
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,800
And they talk all about electric cars

606
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,840
and electric vehicles and stuff.

607
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,760
And he was showing off some cool stuff

608
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,760
with using his Tesla as like a power wall for his house.

609
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,840
So not only did he have the power wall on the wall,

610
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,760
but he was using his car as a residual battery pack as well.

611
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,640
So I'm wondering if you ever bought an electric car,

612
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,520
you could plug it into this inverter system

613
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,320
and then go and charge your car at a fast charger

614
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,120
and then bring that electric home.

615
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,000
Or charge the car while the RV is going down the road.

616
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,680
The RV is generating power, more power than I can use

617
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,360
because the alternator is running,

618
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,320
the solar would be collecting power.

619
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,280
If I could charge an electric vehicle

620
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,720
that I was towing behind the RV while I'm driving

621
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,120
and then I would get to my destination

622
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,600
and my car is fully charged.

623
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,680
But additionally,

624
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,520
this is something I've actually been looking into.

625
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,040
A lot of electric vehicles have regenerative braking.

626
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,080
You know, about regenerative braking.

627
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,640
If you're towing an electric vehicle behind an RV

628
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,160
and using its braking,

629
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,680
doing what's called four down towing

630
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,520
where all four wheels are down on the road

631
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,000
when you're towing the electric vehicle

632
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,040
and you use the brakes of the electric vehicle,

633
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,120
it does in fact charge the batteries

634
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,360
of the electric vehicle.

635
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,520
As an F1 guy, I love all of that stuff,

636
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,920
like trickling down into road cars and things.

637
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,080
Yeah, yeah.

638
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,560
So a few years ago, they brought in something

639
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,760
called Kerr's Kinetic Energy Recovery System,

640
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,120
which they were like,

641
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,880
oh, this is gonna be the future of the road car.

642
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,240
And everyone at the time was like, no, what a load of BS.

643
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,760
But no, it's actually real

644
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,720
and people are actually using it and it's the future.

645
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,560
I just don't know.

646
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,000
I mean, you know, $15,000 is such a massive commitment.

647
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,640
So how much of it can you take with you

648
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,040
if you were to ever replace dupes with something else?

649
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,080
Like how much can you take with you?

650
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,880
And you could take probably the panels and parts of it,

651
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,560
but I would probably be more inclined to leave it in

652
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,320
because it adds a considerable amount of value to the RV.

653
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,240
This is a top of the line system and installed by AM Solar,

654
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,800
so it's top of the line installers too.

655
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,640
That's always the thing,

656
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,280
when you wanna put an extension on your house,

657
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,440
like when we were looking at houses in North Carolina,

658
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
they had swimming pools and we were like,

659
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,960
oh, does a swimming pool add value?

660
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,440
And the realtor was like, nope.

661
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,360
So you could spend 50 grand on putting a swimming pool in

662
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,960
and get none of it back, so.

663
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,240
Yeah, but a solar system on the other hand,

664
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,520
that is pretty, especially in the RV space,

665
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,280
everybody wants solar eventually.

666
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,960
It's something that's been on my list.

667
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,760
Let me know what you think about that.

668
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,840
If you've got experience with the Victron system,

669
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,080
especially, this is an esoteric ask,

670
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,440
but if anybody's gonna be out there

671
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,560
that would have any information on this, it's our audience.

672
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,160
If you know how to use say Bluetooth or something like that

673
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,120
to get the stats out of a Victron unit into Home Assistant

674
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,840
and then into Grafana, please contact me

675
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,120
because this is a big part of what I want to do

676
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,200
is have real-time information on how much power

677
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,800
my entire system is using

678
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,560
and then I wanna graph it over time

679
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,880
and then I wanna teach people how to do this.

680
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,960
So I'd really love to hear from somebody,

681
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,800
selfhosted.show slash contact or at Chris Elias on Twitter

682
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,480
and let me know because man, oh man,

683
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,280
I think the potential there,

684
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,080
the kind of data I could pull off these units

685
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,440
that are running and monitoring everything

686
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,240
could be phenomenal.

687
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Eric got in touch with us via selfhosted.show slash contact

688
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,560
to say, I just wanted to send a quick thanks for the show

689
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,080
and sharing Alex's favorite smart plug.

690
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,360
I just ordered the four pack of the Tekin SP20 plugs,

691
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,320
figured out what TAS motor is

692
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,840
and did the over the air flash

693
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,720
with the amazing two-year convert script.

694
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,560
Yes, awesome, well done.

695
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,680
That is good to hear.

696
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,720
Yeah, and now they're yours forever.

697
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,840
Absolutely are.

698
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,040
That is so cool.

699
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,360
The other one that I really recommend,

700
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,760
so the SP20s are great.

701
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,400
They seem to work pretty well with two-year convert.

702
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,840
And the other one is the SS31 that Tekin make

703
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,560
and this is a pretty cool one.

704
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,080
It's got four AC outlets and four USB plugs

705
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,680
and there are five relays in there.

706
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,280
So you can turn on and off all the USB ports at once

707
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,360
and then each of the AC ports has its own relay

708
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
in it as well.

709
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,920
And they work flawlessly with two-year convert.

710
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,760
I'm using my Raspberry Pi 4

711
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,200
and I get it out of the box and within maybe two minutes,

712
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,080
this thing has TAS motor on it.

713
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,960
When you say it, you say it like two-year convert

714
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,960
but it's two-ya convert.

715
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,720
T-U-Y-A convert.

716
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah. Yeah.

717
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,720
Two-ya.

718
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,760
Yeah, exactly.

719
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,600
Well, great.

720
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,500
That's really awesome.

721
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,600
It is awesome.

722
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,920
I'll tell you what else is awesome, smart doorbells.

723
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,280
So David Carollo, I'm sorry if I butchered that name,

724
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,600
I'm talking about Ring doorbells, camera devices, et cetera.

725
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,780
Any advice on installing your own?

726
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,500
Oh, great question.

727
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,900
Ring did just issue an update by the way,

728
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,560
allowing you to opt in or not

729
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,960
if your footage is shared with law enforcement.

730
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
Nice to see.

731
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,920
But I think everyone's been scared off the product

732
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,200
but they've sort of proven out

733
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,520
that there's some usefulness to it.

734
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,360
I disagree.

735
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,600
So one of my new neighbors invited to me

736
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,160
to his poker night on Friday.

737
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,120
And it was really interesting.

738
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,440
It was very eye-opening for me

739
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,920
to hear what normal people think.

740
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,480
Oh, this is absolutely good on the ground research.

741
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,560
I attend these kinds of things myself as well.

742
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,400
Yeah.

743
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,240
And they were talking about

744
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,600
all the different streaming services

745
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,200
they're subscribed to and about,

746
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
oh, have you seen this show?

747
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,040
It's on Hulu.

748
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,860
Have you seen that one?

749
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,700
It's on Amazon.

750
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,480
It was really fun to listen to

751
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,020
sort of normal non-technical people talk about this stuff.

752
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,760
But the other thing they were talking a lot about

753
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
were Ring doorbells.

754
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,400
And they're like, oh, they're amazing.

755
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,240
They're so great.

756
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,640
Like I've got one on my garage door

757
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,680
and one on my front door

758
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,520
and one on my back door.

759
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,720
And I'm like, so you've got three of these things?

760
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,380
Oh yeah, we just pay the subscription

761
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,520
and I can look back 30 days in my history and all that.

762
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,280
I'm like, oh, okay.

763
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,600
Like trying to play the dumb ignorant guy

764
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,120
to get them to tell me more stuff.

765
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,660
Did you just turn up the accent a little bit?

766
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,800
Oh, interesting.

767
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,640
Yeah.

768
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,280
Oh yes, that's very interesting.

769
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,400
This is such good data though

770
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
because you get an idea

771
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,760
with what compels and appeals the average consumer.

772
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,440
Right, yeah, normal people.

773
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,280
Yeah.

774
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,440
As much as I love you, Chris,

775
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,280
you and I are not normal people.

776
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,680
No, I know.

777
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,440
The things that we think are important in a device,

778
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,600
not what the regular consumer thinks is important

779
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,840
in the real world.

780
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,960
To give you an example,

781
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,920
the first project I tackled in my new house

782
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,160
was running ethernet.

783
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,120
Most people would replace the toilet flappers

784
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,560
that were running for days on end as the first job.

785
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,760
No, I ran ethernet.

786
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,200
So what that led me to

787
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,920
was looking at different doorbell options

788
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
and seeing what was out there.

789
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,520
And I came across a YouTube video

790
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,400
by a company called Nelly's Security.

791
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,520
And they make $140.

792
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,680
Yes, that is expensive for a doorbell.

793
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,320
They make $140, three megapixel,

794
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,920
30 frame per second, 1080p doorbell.

795
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,800
And this thing supports ONVIF.

796
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,760
So it will plug straight into Shinobi

797
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,880
and any other NVR that speaks that language.

798
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,080
And it also has a micro SD card built into it inside.

799
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,960
They seem like a really good company.

800
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,000
So I'll put a link to the YouTube video in the show notes.

801
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,080
And it seems like a normal guy

802
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,040
just making a video about his company.

803
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,600
So if you're listening and wanna send me one for review,

804
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,960
I'll do that.

805
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,080
I'm gonna buy one right now.

806
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,400
You haven't bought one?

807
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,320
No, not yet.

808
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,040
Oh, well, I will buy one

809
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,960
because I need something that is offline for the RV.

810
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,400
And the ring doorbell used to integrate with Home Assistant,

811
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
even if you didn't wanna pay for the service.

812
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,520
And over the holidays, they killed it.

813
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,840
They killed the integration.

814
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,560
Merry Christmas to me.

815
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,880
And they killed the API.

816
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,320
They ring turned it off.

817
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,080
And now I can't just go grab stills from the camera

818
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,440
and show it in Home Assistant.

819
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,040
Oh, it's disgusting, isn't it?

820
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,920
It's so frustrating.

821
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,960
So I'm gonna buy this.

822
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,880
And I'll tell you if it works or not.

823
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,320
You don't own the hardware.

824
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,160
And I know I sound like I'm on a soapbox.

825
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,000
I kind of am.

826
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,200
If you require a cloud service or an API

827
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,040
to retrieve an image, to access the feed or whatever,

828
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,000
via the company's cloud service,

829
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,400
you do not own that hardware.

830
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,240
And that's one of the reasons

831
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,240
that Tasmota on those smart plugs is so great.

832
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,080
And that's one of the things

833
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,800
I think that makes this doorbell so good

834
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,000
is that if you want it to remain 100% local on your LAN

835
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,720
forevermore until the hardware physically stops working,

836
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,760
it will.

837
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,960
When I'm making these purchase decisions at this new house,

838
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,080
those are my minimum viable requirements now.

839
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,040
I can't stress that enough.

840
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
It really is a mind shift.

841
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,120
When you re-flash something or you get it controlled locally,

842
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,640
you look at it and you go, I can use this forever now.

843
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,680
And over the holidays, I was gifted some smart lights.

844
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,640
And it really, like the apps, they just suck.

845
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,320
The whole thing is just, it's really just awful.

846
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,200
And just being able to just be done with all of that

847
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,040
is so nice.

848
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,280
So I am the same way now.

849
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,160
If I'm gonna spend my money,

850
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,640
I'll find out this is the rare case

851
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,840
where I don't actually look ahead of time.

852
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,000
But since you and I both wanna know

853
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,560
and it'd be interesting to talk about in the show,

854
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,880
I'll go ahead and I'll grab this.

855
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,720
I really like this to work.

856
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,480
So I'll pick up this smart doorbell and I'll let you know.

857
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,320
Fantastic.

858
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,200
Can you call it smart?

859
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,840
I mean, it's a camera doorbell.

860
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,760
What makes it smart?

861
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,720
I guess it would be the stuff built into Shinobi

862
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,000
for like motion detection and all the rest of it.

863
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,120
Yeah, I like that it has built in support

864
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,280
for that security camera standard.

865
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,480
That's really nice.

866
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,440
On VIF, yeah.

867
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,280
Yeah, on VIF.

868
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,200
That really put it over the top for me.

869
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,480
When you mentioned that the other week,

870
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,360
I didn't know what it was,

871
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,040
but now I've done a bit of camera research.

872
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,560
I understand that that's quite an important standard

873
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,280
for NVRs and stuff, so.

874
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,120
Right.

875
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,000
And the Wyze cams do not support that.

876
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,200
I'd love to see Wyze add support for that.

877
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,160
To be honest with you,

878
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,320
I still like the Wyze cams for internal capture,

879
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,080
