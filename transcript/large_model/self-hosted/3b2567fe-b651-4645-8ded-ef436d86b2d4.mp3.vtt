WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Well, welcome into episode 68 of self-hosted everybody. This is a big episode today. We've got

00:06.480 --> 00:11.680
Chris with me in person sitting right here. I get, I get the desk too. I know I can look into the

00:11.680 --> 00:16.080
whites of your eyes today. That's very strange. You've got a, if anybody has seen, is it Lewis

00:16.080 --> 00:20.160
Rossman, right? You look, you just need the cat. You look exactly like Lewis Rossman right now in

00:20.160 --> 00:24.320
that a huge lounge chair with the microphone. I don't have the muscles and I'm a little bit,

00:24.320 --> 00:27.600
the anger's down a little bit. Yeah. You're not quite as am.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.880
I'd also like to welcome in today, Wes Payne.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.520
Hello, hello. It's good to be back.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.120
Hey Wes, how was the trip in? You got here just a little bit ago.

00:37.120 --> 00:42.240
It was a little longer, a few extra flights that I didn't expect, but it was well, well worth it.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.320
50% more flights if I, if I understand it right.

00:46.320 --> 00:47.680
Unfortunately so.

00:47.680 --> 00:52.640
Yeah. So these two fine gentlemen are joining me today at my house for the

00:52.640 --> 00:59.440
big Jupiter broadcasting East coast meetup, which is on Saturday and looking like it's going to be

00:59.440 --> 01:03.600
a hell of a party because not only do we have probably over a hundred people showing up,

01:04.160 --> 01:07.200
but there's some town event going on too. So it's going to be, I mean,

01:07.200 --> 01:09.520
we're going to, this is going to be one of those where we have stories for a while.

01:10.240 --> 01:16.240
As this episode as the meetup will be the day after. So, you know, as on Friday,

01:16.240 --> 01:21.200
so the meetups on the Saturday, those, I think this, this town event is like an Easter,

01:21.200 --> 01:27.200
like spring fling thing. It's going to be food trucks and all sorts of crazy stuff. So

01:27.200 --> 01:31.280
if you're in the rally area or even if you're not stopped by, say hi, it'd been amazing to see you.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.760
It was nice for us though. So we got in a couple of days early so we could, you know, hang out and

01:36.480 --> 01:41.120
pre-show a little bit as we do and do some barbecue and do some talking and catching up.

01:41.760 --> 01:47.040
So Brent is actually in route right now too, as we record just, you know, and it's great to see

01:47.040 --> 01:50.320
your new place. Well, it's probably not as new to you anymore, but it's new to all of us.

01:50.320 --> 01:57.200
Oh yes. And it's like the size of a bed and breakfast, like, like it's an estate. So,

01:57.200 --> 02:01.600
so it can fit all of us easily. I don't want people thinking I live in some McMansion,

02:01.600 --> 02:05.920
like it's a pretty nice house, but it's just below McMansion. It's not ridiculous. It's not

02:05.920 --> 02:09.120
ludicrous. We're comfortable. And you know what? It actually seems pretty reasonable when all of

02:09.120 --> 02:13.920
us are in town. Right. Exactly. I mean, hosting people, because, you know, one of the reasons

02:13.920 --> 02:19.200
we bought this place was we host family from England for three, four, five weeks at a time.

02:19.200 --> 02:23.600
And when you've got four or five people in a house, like you don't want to be all on top of

02:23.600 --> 02:29.200
each other for that long. So, and a baby and a baby now, of course. Yeah. I've got to have room

02:29.200 --> 02:34.160
for the drums. Right. Of course the drums, the printer, the workshop, right. You know what I

02:34.160 --> 02:37.760
wanted? Like, of course, you know, when somebody arrives, like, you know, they want the tour,

02:37.760 --> 02:42.560
right. But I wanted, I wanted the tech tour when I arrived. I feel like we're in a real

02:42.560 --> 02:47.760
life episode of MTV cribs today. Right. It's self-hosted cribs. Um, and so we thought we

02:47.760 --> 02:52.160
should start with the very basics, like how Alex is getting power into his house, because

02:52.160 --> 02:57.120
you got a pretty impressive solar setup. Oh yeah. There you go.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.760
Oh, interesting. Did they put like a netting along the bottoms for, to keep out critter guard? Yeah.

03:05.760 --> 03:13.680
Okay. So there you go. That's a kilowatt hours, eight kilowatt array.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.000
So they're probably getting their main sun starting right about now.

03:17.040 --> 03:26.160
In the summer, we get perfect sun from about 10 a.m. to about 3 p.m. Oh, nice. And then these guys

03:26.160 --> 03:31.760
get in the way slowly. Yeah. You can look on the monitoring app for solar edge. Yeah. And it,

03:32.480 --> 03:36.480
you can see the shadow moving across the roof. Like it does per panel breakdown.

03:36.480 --> 03:44.160
Yeah. So that's the panels. Yeah. And then they brought, they brought the cables in through the

03:44.160 --> 03:47.200
attic and down, down through the back. So that, that was the room we were sat in. That was the

03:47.200 --> 03:51.840
bonus room. So they brought the power sort of through this metal conduit out the back and

03:51.840 --> 04:00.880
through the attic of the, of the house. So you can see the metal conduit coming down the side of the

04:00.880 --> 04:06.640
drain pipe there and then into this solar edge inverter thingy that's here. That's it. Really?

04:06.640 --> 04:11.120
There's a, it's really not that complicated until I suppose if you were to put a battery wall in

04:11.120 --> 04:14.640
there, it would get more complicated. It would not probably go around here. This, this thing is a

04:14.640 --> 04:19.920
wifi bridge. I used to have a Zigbee bridge, but it kept dropping out for some reason. And the

04:19.920 --> 04:24.800
repeater was in the bonus room just up there. But this one now is in into the basement, into the

04:24.800 --> 04:33.680
server area. And it's just based on just 2.4 gig wifi. It has its own SSID, just for some reason

04:33.680 --> 04:38.640
talks, talks that way. And then I plug in an ethernet cable into their little solar edge,

04:38.640 --> 04:43.200
little white box receiver thing. And then it connects out through to the internet that way.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.800
And then they have a web portal for all the deets. And that's how they can monitor.

04:46.800 --> 04:51.120
Yeah. Wow. And they have an app of course. Do they have an API? That's the question.

04:51.120 --> 04:55.680
Yes. That's how Home Assistant gets it. Oh yeah, that's, that's great. Yeah.

04:55.680 --> 05:01.360
I mean, I was actually looking at a Kickstarter the other day where they do smart, uh, breaker

05:01.360 --> 05:07.520
panels and each breaker has the smarts built into it to read. Why are we not having this already?

05:07.520 --> 05:12.800
There's also a group that'll analyze just your house power using machine learning and try to

05:12.800 --> 05:16.880
give a best guess of what appliances are running and then assign the individual usage to those.

05:16.880 --> 05:21.680
And just by looking at the load, the average load. Yeah. How do you tell between, well,

05:21.680 --> 05:25.040
I was going to say a fridge and a server. Or how do you tell between a hairdryer and a toaster?

05:25.040 --> 05:30.160
I don't know, but maybe they have ways. Subtle signs in the data they think they've had. Yeah.

05:30.960 --> 05:35.440
Well, great. Thank you for showing this to us. I'm just waiting for that episode where we get

05:35.440 --> 05:39.360
connected and you're like, okay, I'm ready to build the battery wall. I do want to do that.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.240
And as you've seen, I think we could cuss. I know you're going to do some fancy and nice,

05:42.240 --> 05:45.760
but I'm telling you, we could DIY that thing. We could. Yeah. I mean, as you've seen, just

05:45.760 --> 05:50.080
before we were going to record, we get some lightning and some pretty big storms blow through

05:50.080 --> 05:54.560
here. And sometimes they knock down trees and the power goes out for four or five hours,

05:54.560 --> 05:59.120
just on a random Tuesday. And that can be quite annoying. So there's two options for me for a

05:59.120 --> 06:05.280
power wall. Number one is to build a dedicated like UPS for my house, which sounds awesome.

06:05.280 --> 06:09.520
Cause I mean, it just in this room, I think I have four UPS is just to make sure everything

06:09.520 --> 06:14.000
stays on during those little Brown. I mean, what have I probably counted? Yeah. At least have I

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
counted six UPS? Well, there's one for my desktop right there. There's another one over there for

06:18.000 --> 06:21.680
like my 3d printer. And then there's another one over there for all my guitar amp equipment and

06:21.680 --> 06:25.040
stuff. And there's stuff where the servers are, taco stuff. And some of the other stuff in that

06:25.040 --> 06:29.040
closet, the backup closet. Yeah. We didn't get to in a minute. Uh, there's another one in,

06:29.040 --> 06:34.080
it's ridiculous. Screw the whole house. Vacuum. Yeah. Whole house. UPS. That sounds great.

06:34.080 --> 06:37.760
I just got fed up of Brown outs. Yeah. I guess the goal should be is like,

06:37.760 --> 06:41.360
as these UPSs get to the point where the batteries are aging out, that's when it's time to do the

06:41.360 --> 06:46.880
power wall, right? That's what you do the power wall. Yeah, true. True enough. Yeah. So we also

06:46.880 --> 06:50.240
got to see the server basement. I've been wanting to see this set up for a while.

06:54.640 --> 07:01.040
Nice. I'm loving it. So let's walk us through what we got here. We've got a nice wood built rack.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.120
I mean, maybe not as nice as the one brand build. Maybe, maybe it is. That's custom order. Maybe,

07:07.120 --> 07:13.520
maybe it isn't. Can't say. Well, tell me what you think we've got. Well, I'm seeing a, I'm seeing,

07:14.400 --> 07:21.200
seeing a couple of APC UPSs. I'm seeing, uh, your carrier's modem or whatever it is over there.

07:21.200 --> 07:26.880
Just in modem mode. Of course. We've got this big rack here. That's a system with how many disks?

07:26.880 --> 07:31.760
I forget. I know you've told me, but I forget. Uh, and then what is this guy down here? This

07:31.760 --> 07:37.440
little bitty machine that's open sense. Oh, okay. That's the firewall. I've seen a couple of switches

07:37.440 --> 07:43.040
there. Yeah. You've got a POE switch. So with eight ports for POE running two cameras at least

07:43.040 --> 07:47.840
and two acts, maybe three access points off that guy. Okay. So there's room for future expansion

07:47.840 --> 07:52.400
on that. I think I've only used five out of the eight ports. So I do plan on running another couple

07:52.400 --> 08:00.160
of cameras. Oh, temperature sensor here. Yeah. So this isn't ESP 8266 hooked up to a DHT

08:00.160 --> 08:06.000
22 temperature sensor. So it does temperature and humidity down here. I put it sort of behind the

08:06.000 --> 08:10.320
server. Now I think about it. Maybe I should put it away from the server. So it doesn't, you know,

08:10.320 --> 08:15.760
so the heat from the fans at the back doesn't affect the readings too much, but seeing a new

08:15.760 --> 08:19.520
AO tag Z stick and I see it's plugged into the back of the machine there. Is that what I'm seeing?

08:19.520 --> 08:25.040
Maybe actually that one's in a drawer upstairs. I ditched the Z wave stuff experiences with it.

08:25.040 --> 08:30.640
Yeah. And I went the Zigbee route and got the Conbee Zigbee USB. Nice. Is that what I'm seeing

08:30.640 --> 08:35.280
plugged in there? Yeah. There's a Conbee two in there as well as connections to the UPS. So this

08:35.280 --> 08:38.800
must be the Proxmox box then. Yeah, that's it. That's the one that does everything. And so then

08:38.800 --> 08:43.200
home assistance around on this. Home assistance on there. That's got the i5 8500 in there. It's

08:43.920 --> 08:49.360
the ASRock mini ITX, no, a micro ATX board that I put in there last autumn.

08:49.360 --> 08:57.920
What's this? 10 or 12 disks. Why does it say disk failed? I'm just kidding. He had me.

08:59.440 --> 09:04.560
He had me. And then I've got this cool like little KVM switch. I don't know if it's...

09:04.560 --> 09:09.840
Oh yeah. Great. Actually connected up because this is... Oh, there you go. H-top up on the screen.

09:09.840 --> 09:15.680
So I've been running H-top for the last eight years maybe. And it does the keyboard too,

09:15.680 --> 09:22.320
which is nice. That's super handy. So there you go. Yeah. Love this. And it just runs.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.760
And it's not loud at all, really. Well, not really, but I do have the fans turned up because

09:27.760 --> 09:31.440
it's in the basement. Yeah, why not? I don't care about it. You know, just keep the airflow going

09:31.440 --> 09:35.200
through. And I figure actually in the basement environment, having a little bit of air movement

09:35.200 --> 09:39.200
is probably a good thing. Yeah, probably a little bit of a dehumidifier. It's probably doing me a

09:39.200 --> 09:46.720
solid. Nice. There it is. The famous setup. I do have some future projects for myself and Brent

09:46.720 --> 09:50.880
because Brent's staying with me for the next week or two after you guys leave. So we're going to

09:50.880 --> 09:56.320
rewire quite a lot of what's down there. And you redo all the ethernet into a patch panel,

09:57.040 --> 10:01.920
wall mount a lot of the switches that are down there, probably run a couple more cameras,

10:01.920 --> 10:04.320
pull some more ethernet. That's always easier with two people.

10:04.320 --> 10:10.800
Yeah. And then the other thing we got a little peek at because Alex's place is so big, he can

10:10.800 --> 10:18.080
have a closet that's basically like an offsite backup. I did think about this. So the server is

10:18.080 --> 10:23.360
at one end of the house, the right hand end. And then the room we're in to record is my bonus room

10:23.360 --> 10:26.800
above the garage, which is the left hand end of the house. As I think about it, maybe we should

10:26.800 --> 10:31.280
call these wings. Yeah. So if there's going to be like a pipe bust or something like that. Well,

10:31.280 --> 10:35.040
that's it. That's the insurance, isn't it? You know, if a tornado was to blow through or a

10:35.040 --> 10:40.400
hurricane was to blow through and knock the house down, I am out of luck with both of these boxes

10:40.400 --> 10:43.680
in the building. Maybe. I mean, you could still see one part of the structure could remain standing

10:43.680 --> 10:48.640
maybe. And you're having them on opposite sides. So yeah, maybe. Or when the worst event happens,

10:48.640 --> 10:52.400
you know, whichever side you're closer to, you can try to grab the box on your way out of the house.

10:52.400 --> 10:57.200
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Grab the baby in one hand, the server in the other. Come on wife,

10:57.200 --> 11:02.400
you can carry yourself. Someone grab the dog. I'm pretty sure he can carry himself too.

11:03.040 --> 11:09.040
So this is a bit of a like storage for like boxes and gear. And then I see some backup power

11:09.040 --> 11:15.920
supplies. I see some switch gear. I see a patch panel. Yeah. Printer two switches. What is this

11:15.920 --> 11:19.840
guy over here? Is this an HD tuner? HD hard run. Yeah. Are you getting, are you pulling it over

11:19.840 --> 11:25.040
the air? Yeah. And it works in here like that? Yeah. I mean, it's just pointed towards the

11:25.040 --> 11:30.400
antenna. Painting a picture for the listener. I just have an over the air kind of flat wall antenna

11:30.400 --> 11:37.120
just resting dangling on a shelf pointed at the ceiling. And it just works well enough. And to be

11:37.120 --> 11:41.760
honest with you, the only time I use over the air tuner is when we've got some weather coming through

11:41.760 --> 11:47.120
and I want to watch the weather reports. Yeah. Yep. Me too. So you call this the backup closet?

11:47.120 --> 11:52.880
Because down in the bottom right hand corner over there, there's a little Lian Li Q25B case with

11:52.880 --> 11:58.640
three hard drives in it. And just above it is the... Oh, this is just a silent little machine

11:58.640 --> 12:03.360
running here. That's the HP290 slim I keep talking about that runs my Blue Iris. I wouldn't even know

12:03.360 --> 12:09.120
it was on. Nope. I can feel just a tiny bit of airflow, but that's it. The backup server's off.

12:09.120 --> 12:14.400
I turn that on once a week, does its thing and then it turns off. I have a sense too that we

12:14.400 --> 12:17.040
haven't even seen everything. Like I think as we'll be here for the next few days, you'll be

12:17.040 --> 12:22.240
like, oh right, I wanted to show you this too. I do hope so. Yeah. Yeah. That's always how it goes.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.920
Well, I think we're only just beginning to get a sense of all the automations at play, right? We've

12:25.920 --> 12:29.280
sort of scrapped the surface, the big ticket items that we've, you know, we've heard about on the

12:29.280 --> 12:33.200
show that we've been looking forward to, but you know, you see Alex over there, comfying his chair

12:33.200 --> 12:37.360
and you can tell he's controlling pretty much everything. Yeah. Just before we were going to

12:37.360 --> 12:41.520
record, Chris was like, can you turn off the AC? It's a bit noisy. And he went to walk over to do,

12:41.520 --> 12:46.080
I was like, dude, sit down. Like an animal. I know. I know. And it was funny because

12:46.800 --> 12:49.920
I've also noticed like, you know, there's little temperature sensors throughout.

12:49.920 --> 12:53.520
There's some buttons here and there. What do you think of them? These are the little, uh,

12:53.520 --> 12:57.440
Xiaomi Bluetooth low energy ones. Yeah. I like that they have the actual temperature display

12:57.440 --> 13:02.160
on there and just on the wall behind you, uh, underneath the little red hat Bluetooth speaker,

13:02.160 --> 13:07.440
there's a little ESP 32 3d printed with the yellow cable going into it. And that is what

13:07.440 --> 13:11.920
he's talking on Bluetooth low energy to all these different temperature centers throughout this, uh,

13:11.920 --> 13:16.160
half of the building. And then down the other end, I've got another one, which talks to the ones

13:16.160 --> 13:20.720
down that end. And then they all feed through ESP home into home assistant. Nice.

13:21.600 --> 13:26.560
Yes. Uh, also everything has sort of been augmented with, uh, you could see where Alex

13:26.560 --> 13:30.800
has seen a problem and like, Oh, I can 3d print that solution. So definitely desk parts have been

13:30.800 --> 13:35.040
augmented. Uh, things mounted to the wall have been augmented with a 3d print. Uh, there's just

13:35.040 --> 13:39.920
little bits of 3d printing solutions here and there. You obviously are like, you see a problem

13:39.920 --> 13:42.720
and you're like, Oh, I'm going to, I'm going to print the fix to that. Well, I didn't spend money

13:42.720 --> 13:49.840
on a 3d printer to buy stuff. It's a replicator. Dang it. So I want you to turn around. I've given

13:49.840 --> 13:56.000
you a hard time about raspberry pies in the past. There was a drawer marked to do. Yeah. And in that

13:56.000 --> 14:03.920
drawer, I want you to kind of pie shame. These are all the projects I have in progress or to do.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.640
Oh, they're each in a case too. Yeah. I don't know how you managed to come up with an idea

14:08.640 --> 14:13.760
more haunting than a to do list, but a to do chore of physical objects. This is, this is going to be

14:13.760 --> 14:17.840
about where I'm at. Do you like this? You've got four pies within arm's reach. Cause there's one

14:17.840 --> 14:22.720
over here to a Cody box and there's one attached to the 3d printer as well. So there's five pies

14:22.720 --> 14:30.160
within arm's reach of me, just within arm's reach of me and I'm using one of them. I like this case.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.520
These got some good cases here. Of course you've got the flirt one, which I love too.

14:33.520 --> 14:39.440
Got the flirt case. We've got the geek worm aluminum case. The geek worm one is particularly

14:39.440 --> 14:44.880
good for the 3d printer because you take one half off and 3d print a specific bracket and

14:44.880 --> 14:50.000
then screw the two together. And you've got some heat dissipation for the PI four and one half.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.760
And then the custom bracket attaches to the 3d printer and it's good to go.

14:55.760 --> 14:58.720
You got, you can't give me a hard time anymore. You've been outed now. I know.

14:58.720 --> 15:03.520
I know. The thing is though, I buy stuff like, um, home automation gear. And then I think,

15:03.520 --> 15:09.840
Oh, I'll, I'll install that later. And then don't open the second drawer on the right there

15:09.840 --> 15:14.160
and look at all the Shelly gear. I've got shamefully, I've bought, I'm just haven't

15:14.160 --> 15:18.560
got around to install. I have a, I have a basket full of that stuff right now, but I'll get to it.

15:18.560 --> 15:23.040
One of these days, you know what? And I'm not even kidding in that basket are some wise cameras

15:23.040 --> 15:28.560
who I've got to deploy. And that got sent into the show a couple of times this week. Wise took

15:28.560 --> 15:34.480
it over the backend about security and people wrote in wanting to know what we thought about it,

15:34.480 --> 15:38.560
including Eric Johnston. He wrote in and said, Hey guys, you know, you've talked about the ways

15:38.560 --> 15:42.880
cameras quite a bit. They're actually wise, but you're talking about the wise cameras quite a bit.

15:42.880 --> 15:47.760
And I thought you'd be interested to know this. Gizmodo wrote an article and the headline is

15:47.760 --> 15:53.360
you should probably stop using your wise camera right now. The verge, the verge wrote a headline

15:53.360 --> 15:58.800
that said, I'm done with wise. And I think the gist of what happened, I was traveling, but I

15:58.800 --> 16:03.600
think the gist of what happened is it turns out, it turns out there's a pretty nasty vulnerability

16:03.600 --> 16:08.240
in the V1 camera. They no longer sell. They had to be on your land first, but if they got on your

16:08.240 --> 16:11.760
land and got some information off of your wise camera, which supposedly they could do if they

16:11.760 --> 16:16.640
just had land access, then later on they could access your camera and including information

16:16.640 --> 16:22.400
about your camera even remotely. So like Wes comes, comes to my house, gets onto my wise cameras,

16:22.400 --> 16:27.440
then he's peeping on me from remote from then on out. I did make you guys a dedicated guest

16:27.440 --> 16:33.600
network. That explains it. Just to be safe. So I mean, some of this is hyperbole, right? Some of

16:33.600 --> 16:38.320
this is just journalism, clickbait stuff. You know, you should stop using your wise cameras

16:38.320 --> 16:44.560
immediately. Okay, fine. Yes. I understand why they write that headline, but since the original

16:44.560 --> 16:50.960
publication of the article, uh, wise themselves have released a response, you know, stating like

16:50.960 --> 16:56.560
Chris said, um, we'd like to let our users know that these vulnerabilities required some form of

16:56.560 --> 17:02.320
local network access. And that does really rule out most attack vectors. I mean, unless you have

17:02.320 --> 17:07.440
a really crappy wifi password or you just leave an ethernet cable hanging out your mailbox by the

17:07.440 --> 17:13.680
street. I mean, most people aren't going to get to your, uh, to your local network. And so for me,

17:13.680 --> 17:20.400
yeah, fine. The V1s were vulnerable for a while, but what really actually bothers me is how wise

17:20.400 --> 17:26.400
is a company handled this vulnerability. Yeah. That's the problem, right? Is they just essentially

17:26.400 --> 17:30.560
swooped under the rug and discontinued the model. And I guess maybe the logic was is we're not

17:30.560 --> 17:35.280
making any more of them. Yeah, I suppose so. We're not obligated to do anything better than just say,

17:35.280 --> 17:38.880
well, we're not telling you to keep using them. Yeah. And if you updated the version two or

17:38.880 --> 17:43.280
version three, you didn't have this problem. So they figured, well, I really got away from that

17:43.280 --> 17:47.680
problem. But the reality is people have these deployed, right? Doctors offices, maybe even,

17:47.680 --> 17:52.480
who knows, it is a little worse than that. So the V1, two and three were all vulnerable,

17:53.200 --> 17:58.640
but they silently released an update a few months ago for the V2 and three only. So they've left the

17:58.640 --> 18:04.160
V1s hung out to dry. Yeah. Yeah. Just leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Yeah. And then you combine

18:04.160 --> 18:09.520
that with bad communication. This could be really bad for wise because wise has aspirations to become

18:10.240 --> 18:16.960
the IOT of everything vendor from internet scales to door locks to everything. In fact,

18:16.960 --> 18:21.200
if you open up the wise app now, they have a shop section in there. They're selling lights. They're

18:21.200 --> 18:27.200
selling every single kind of IOT Wi-Fi connected device you can think of. They're selling it now.

18:27.760 --> 18:33.120
And you have to have a brand that's trusted in order to do that. And if you don't have a trusted

18:33.120 --> 18:39.360
brand, you're dead in the water. I agree completely. I'm a bit surprised by Bitdefender,

18:39.360 --> 18:44.640
who are the security research company who uncovered this floor. They sat on it for nearly

18:44.640 --> 18:50.720
three years before telling us about it. So, uh, not only is there the original vulnerability

18:50.720 --> 18:55.680
that, you know, we're talking about here, there were other previously undisclosed vulnerabilities

18:55.680 --> 19:02.400
that have been, uh, bypassing the authentication as well as allowing remote code execution,

19:02.400 --> 19:10.080
uh, reported in both 2019 and 2020. That's when they were patched. Sorry. But, uh, I mean,

19:10.080 --> 19:14.080
I just feel like wise has to step their game up. This isn't good enough.

19:15.040 --> 19:18.880
You know, when they discontinued the V1, they issued a vague, like, uh,

19:19.440 --> 19:23.360
Hey, this has some enhanced security risks. So you probably don't want to use it anymore.

19:24.160 --> 19:28.800
So knowing what we know about this, that you have to be on the land initially to exploit it.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.880
And then when they discontinued the product, they said, Hey, by the way,

19:32.880 --> 19:36.640
you should probably stop using it. I think their exact wording, I found it at one point,

19:36.640 --> 19:40.720
the company issued a warning during the V1 retirement saying, quote, it has an increased

19:40.720 --> 19:47.840
risk of attack increased risk because you do have to be on the land because it has to be this

19:47.840 --> 19:51.200
particular one that they're not patching. And because it is a retired product,

19:52.000 --> 19:56.560
where is the line here? I agree with the V2 and V3. They, there should have been patch notes.

19:57.280 --> 20:02.160
The only reason that they're end of life thing, the product is because it says here in their blog

20:02.160 --> 20:09.520
post, they can't support the necessary fixes in that product. And so for me, if it was only being

20:09.520 --> 20:16.960
end of life as a consequence of that gesture, goodwill, give us 25% off a V2 or V3 camera

20:16.960 --> 20:22.160
or something, you know, something. Yeah. Cause you know, they rolled the dice to make a $25

20:22.160 --> 20:27.280
camera. They had to put really cheap parts in there. And that's why some of their AI stuff

20:27.280 --> 20:32.560
until the V3, honestly, guys, the wise cams are not good until the V3. The V3 is a really

20:32.560 --> 20:38.880
good camera for the price for 35 bucks or whatever, but V1 and two, they were rough.

20:38.880 --> 20:43.440
We've been using the V3 as our baby monitor. Yeah. It's the night vision on that thing is,

20:43.440 --> 20:49.600
is incredible. It is. I I'm, I'm gone right now. And half of, half of the way I'm monitoring the

20:49.600 --> 20:53.840
RV is with wise V3s. Now for me, five minutes, he pulls out his fire and he's like, Oh, look,

20:53.840 --> 20:58.800
there's Levi. I got to check on the dog. It's your own form of doom scrolling. It is. But for me,

20:59.360 --> 21:03.760
and I think maybe for a lot of the people in our audience, when I deploy something like this,

21:03.760 --> 21:10.480
a $25 or a $35 camera, I go in assuming it's going to be monetized in some other way that I

21:10.480 --> 21:16.000
don't agree with. And so I, I blocked DNS requests from the camera. So the cameras can't properly

21:16.000 --> 21:20.960
talk to the internet. I have to be on my land in order to use the cameras. And that's just

21:20.960 --> 21:24.160
always the way I've, so they don't talk to, and that means they don't get firmware updates either.

21:24.160 --> 21:28.560
I have actually restored the DNS access and done the firmware thing once, but then that's also

21:28.560 --> 21:33.840
caused problems. So it's not ideal. And that's why I've kind of backed off. If people have noticed

21:33.840 --> 21:38.240
on the show, I don't really talk about them as much anymore because it is a bit of a compromise

21:38.240 --> 21:43.200
product, but for the price and for the functionality and for the ability to integrate it with home

21:43.200 --> 21:47.360
assistant, using things like wise bridge, it's a compromise I'm willing to make still. And I'm not

21:47.360 --> 21:52.880
going to stop using my wise cams because of this, but I'd already built kind of for this scenario.

21:52.880 --> 21:57.600
Does it change any of your thoughts on adopting additional wise cams? You know, is this still a

21:57.600 --> 22:00.800
reasonable trade off? Cause that seemed kind of how they got on the scene, right? Like, look,

22:00.800 --> 22:05.040
it's not perfect, but it's cheap, it's workable, and it gets you started instead of maybe a,

22:05.040 --> 22:10.960
you know, hundreds of dollar fancy IP camera. Yeah. I'm always on the fence. It's like the

22:10.960 --> 22:15.360
wise, the great thing about the wise cams, USB powered Wi-Fi, they don't even have to be

22:15.360 --> 22:20.240
wired. They can go outdoors. You can get them to work with home assistant with pretty much

22:20.240 --> 22:24.880
minimal effort and you don't have to run wires or anything like that, right? It's just, those things

22:24.880 --> 22:30.160
are so great, but they're also just not quite the right tool for the job. They're not quite the

22:30.160 --> 22:36.240
right ones to run 24 seven, do 4k video. You really want it wired. You want POE and that kind

22:36.240 --> 22:39.680
of stuff in my opinion. So that's always the, that's always the balance I'm trying to make.

22:40.160 --> 22:44.320
Particularly as they're moving into the wider smart home ecosystem, like you were saying,

22:44.320 --> 22:49.760
they have ambitions to, I think they make a doorbell now they make, probably making a 3d

22:49.760 --> 22:56.960
printer before we know it. So I think that the long-term outlook for me and wise is, they're

22:56.960 --> 23:04.480
just a cheap, convenient solution to non-essential problems. You know, if the webcam we're using for

23:04.480 --> 23:09.760
as a baby monitor broke, I'd probably just buy another one because they're so cheap compared to

23:09.760 --> 23:15.040
a dedicated baby monitor. Um, and we have the flexibility of pulling up the app anywhere on any

23:15.040 --> 23:21.600
device and you know, they're very flexible, very cheap, but you do pay a price for that.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.840
And sometimes they have a great sale. They have great sales sometimes too. I think it does say a

23:25.840 --> 23:29.760
lot, you know, we just talking about all the things you have automated in your home, but that

23:29.760 --> 23:33.040
flexibility really is, you know, you know, you could set all that up if you wanted to, but just,

23:33.040 --> 23:41.760
just the point is that sometimes it's really nice not to have to Linode.com slash SSH. Go there to

23:41.760 --> 23:46.480
get $100 in 60 day credit. And you go there to support the show. Go say hello to Linode and

23:46.480 --> 23:51.520
support the show. Linode.com slash SSH is where we're running everything. And just before we left,

23:51.920 --> 23:57.920
I wanted the matrix server to really hum like a top. We upgraded that thing to 96 gigs of RAM

23:57.920 --> 24:05.600
and 48 epic CPU cores on Linode and two terabytes of SSD storage. We're cooking with gas now.

24:05.600 --> 24:10.240
Is that enough to run matrix? Barely, barely, barely. But you know, what was great is

24:10.240 --> 24:16.320
we've just slowly increased the size of that Linode. We started at, I mean, we might've started

24:16.320 --> 24:20.640
at a $5 Linode cause it was just an experiment. And then we just kind of turned it up as time has

24:20.640 --> 24:24.640
gone on. And this time we really cranked it up to 11, but you know what else I was thinking?

24:24.640 --> 24:29.520
I wonder if there'd be a way to use Wisebridge on Linode to have like a remote Wisebridge,

24:29.520 --> 24:34.240
like a connect, maybe like some, like a VPN back to my land. There's so many things you can

24:34.240 --> 24:39.440
experiment because they have great price plans for big enterprise operations. If you're out there,

24:39.440 --> 24:43.440
or for just, you know, individuals, they'll want to do something and experiment their

24:43.440 --> 24:48.240
pricing's 30 to 50% less than the big hyperscalers out there. They have these crazy UIs. They've got

24:48.240 --> 24:52.240
a great API. If that's the route you like to go, they've got a really nice command line tool. So

24:52.240 --> 24:56.080
one of the things I've done is I just have a tab in my dropdown terminal. I'm almost,

24:56.080 --> 25:00.480
I have like almost all of the Linode command line client commands that I use in my history on that

25:00.480 --> 25:06.000
tab. I can throw stuff up on object storage in no time. And the great thing is if you ever run into

25:06.000 --> 25:10.560
any trouble, have any problems getting something set up, Linode comes with amazing 24 seven

25:10.560 --> 25:14.880
customer support by phone or by ticket. And they don't do that thing where they like escalate and

25:14.880 --> 25:19.760
escalate and escalate. They stick with you. Each person is trained and ready to go.

25:19.760 --> 25:23.280
They've got the best support. And I hear that over and over again from the self-hosted community.

25:24.320 --> 25:29.760
That stuff matters. And what I love about Linode is they've built this in a way that really is fast.

25:29.760 --> 25:36.400
40 gigabit connections, SSDs, MVME PCIe storage, AMD epic processors. They are their own ISP.

25:37.040 --> 25:43.200
It just goes on and on. So go try it. Go build something. Go learn something. See why it meets

25:43.200 --> 25:49.920
our bar of requirements. And no other provider has. Check them out. Get $100 and support the show.

25:49.920 --> 25:56.000
Linode.com slash SSH. That's $100 for 60 days on a new account. And you support the show by going

25:56.000 --> 26:05.600
to Linode.com slash SSH. Now, I'm really not sure how I feel about Plex's news this week. They've

26:05.600 --> 26:13.280
added a universal watch list, which allows for search and discovery across all the streaming

26:13.280 --> 26:18.720
services. We're talking Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

26:19.600 --> 26:23.920
And they've done all this client side. And we all took a look earlier before the show. And

26:23.920 --> 26:29.200
I'm curious to get your thoughts. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. You know, I remember when we talked to the

26:29.200 --> 26:35.040
CEO, I I remember then thinking this is the way they're going because this is probably the most

26:35.040 --> 26:40.560
legitimate play they can make for this space. And they are also in a very unique position where they

26:40.560 --> 26:47.760
have a huge established user base that has a large local library that has the shared function

26:47.760 --> 26:50.960
where you can have friends. So like Alex and I, we share our Plex libraries with each other.

26:52.400 --> 26:56.320
And so that last piece was kind of the online streaming. So now you can look for a movie

26:56.320 --> 27:00.160
and you can see it across all of your friends, servers, your own server or the online streaming

27:00.160 --> 27:05.520
services that it's on. Now, to facilitate this, Plex raised 50 million dollars in funding last

27:05.520 --> 27:09.520
year. So we knew this was going somewhere. And then 20 million just landed even more recently.

27:10.480 --> 27:17.040
Previously, and probably likely still, their primary revenue came from Plex Pass. Now they're

27:17.040 --> 27:22.400
transitioning to this new model where in this mix, when you search for a movie, sometimes it's free.

27:22.400 --> 27:26.480
And that's going to be ad supported and they're going to run a pre roll. And they believe that

27:26.480 --> 27:34.800
in 2022 ad supported revenue is going to easily surpass the Plex Pass. And OK, so these I think

27:34.800 --> 27:40.000
this is the general like, OK, I can see where they're going. I acknowledge it. Yet in the pit

27:40.000 --> 27:46.000
of my stomach, I'm very concerned. They do make some concessions on the blog post to say,

27:46.000 --> 27:52.880
categorically, we do not and do not have any plans to upload your data to our servers. You know,

27:52.880 --> 27:56.560
we don't really care what's in your libraries, et cetera, et cetera. Maybe that's a good thing,

27:56.560 --> 28:00.240
since it does seem to be all happening client side, like your Plex server didn't get updated

28:00.240 --> 28:06.480
to support this. No, I didn't change my my PMS version. I didn't change even the Android TV app

28:06.480 --> 28:11.440
didn't get update. We went to check the history before just to see if if it was. But no, it's it's

28:11.440 --> 28:18.240
all the client itself. The app obviously had some frameworks built into it to check Plex's service

28:18.240 --> 28:23.280
to change what it's displaying to me at any given moment. And then just at the bottom left hand

28:23.280 --> 28:31.200
corner, it now says discover brackets and beta. Yeah, these kinds of things, you know, being able

28:31.200 --> 28:37.040
to search across all of the services. They live and die on these business relationships, and Roku

28:37.040 --> 28:43.440
has tried this. Apple has tried this. And Plex, you know, this this was brought up to the team

28:43.440 --> 28:49.440
over at Plex, and they said, quote, We are a little bit of a Switzerland in this regard. They

28:49.440 --> 28:55.120
believe that they can be the Switzerland of streaming. And they're going to create deals

28:55.120 --> 29:00.480
directly with Samsung and LG to build in Plex that's that scans across all of these services.

29:00.480 --> 29:03.920
On the back end, they're building deals out with all these different streaming platforms.

29:03.920 --> 29:07.440
On the back end, they're building deals out with all these different streaming providers

29:07.440 --> 29:11.600
and trying to leverage their public APIs where they can. But this has never worked.

29:12.640 --> 29:16.400
Yeah, what's the business model? Like, I mean, we tried it, like I said before the show and

29:17.200 --> 29:23.360
the experience was it's all miss, right? We often clicked into an app that I didn't have installed,

29:23.360 --> 29:28.240
or the service linked me to I think was to YouTube in particular for a particular movie.

29:28.240 --> 29:32.800
I clicked on the movie and nothing happened. All I really did was just pass a search parameter to

29:32.800 --> 29:36.560
the YouTube app. But it was like a limited version of the YouTube app. Like even even when it did

29:36.560 --> 29:41.280
work, it seemed like on net, it was kind of a worse experience than watching from your local

29:41.280 --> 29:45.680
times. Yeah, I can imagine after you got every single streaming service app installed, and you

29:45.680 --> 29:50.880
got every single streaming service app logged in, then you go back to Plex, I could see that being

29:50.880 --> 29:54.720
a little smoother. But what would be even credible, and I understand they can't do this is if you

29:54.720 --> 29:59.280
could just stream it all in Plex, because that's what you use Plex for, right? It's basically just

29:59.280 --> 30:04.640
a shell forwarding you to where the content is. Yeah, and they're just trying to deep link to

30:04.640 --> 30:12.000
the specific content in that app. I don't see Disney, or Netflix, or Amazon Prime, or HBO,

30:12.000 --> 30:18.160
letting Plex do that, you know, bypass DRM, it would probably make the particular streaming

30:18.160 --> 30:24.000
service app less sticky. So you know, that's just a lot of the friction of just changing apps for

30:24.000 --> 30:29.440
a lot of people is enough to keep people in the Netflix app or in the app. Yeah, you you kind of

30:29.440 --> 30:34.960
lose your moat effect, right? Disney wants you to have to go into the Disney app, they want you to

30:34.960 --> 30:40.640
experience the Disney plus experience. Right. So even if Plex isn't competing in terms of being

30:40.640 --> 30:44.720
the actual media dealer on that on being the dashboard and the interface, right, they are

30:44.720 --> 30:48.560
all right, if you you know, if you launch the Disney plus app, they can feature their new movies,

30:48.560 --> 30:52.240
they can put banners up for the for the content they're trying to drive traffic to and they don't

30:52.240 --> 30:56.880
have that control over the Plex UI. Hey, didn't you know we sell toys for these two? Yeah,

30:56.880 --> 31:04.080
so this is somewhat like some kind of a bastard child of tracked.tv. And just watch.com because

31:04.080 --> 31:10.160
you can set up lists to add certain things to watch lists. And when a particular movies coming

31:10.160 --> 31:14.640
out in the future, I can say, Oh, remind me when this movie comes out and where I'll be able to

31:14.640 --> 31:23.280
watch it. What's really interesting, though, is, is that at the moment, it feels promising, yet

31:23.280 --> 31:30.560
simultaneously not finished. Yeah. I like being able to search for a movie. And in the results,

31:32.320 --> 31:36.400
I see what server it's available on immediately. That's really nice. It was more of a manual

31:36.400 --> 31:40.480
process to find out if you had a movie or not with the quality there. So if I search for a movie,

31:40.480 --> 31:45.280
it says HD 1080p on my server and yours, it might say 4K, for example. I'll be like, Oh,

31:45.280 --> 31:50.640
I'll go watch it on Chris's right. And funny enough, that worked really well. That fires

31:50.640 --> 31:55.440
right up. It's all inside the Plex app. That's the experience you want. It's just when you go off to

31:55.440 --> 32:00.720
the other streaming apps that it's it's nice to know what services a piece of content is on and

32:00.720 --> 32:04.240
if you can buy or rent it, because I have been in a situation where the family wanted to watch a

32:04.240 --> 32:09.120
movie. We didn't own that movie. We didn't have that one online. And so I ended up doing that

32:09.120 --> 32:12.960
thing where I went, I found some website that lets you search across multiple streaming services.

32:12.960 --> 32:17.120
And then I fired that app up. And then, you know, so it fixes that process, right? There's always

32:17.120 --> 32:20.240
three different versions of those sites. You're never quite sure. Are they actually up today?

32:21.280 --> 32:26.480
That's true. So they fix that. And, you know, I mean, we've talked about this before on the show.

32:26.480 --> 32:30.880
It's like, what else are they going to do, guys? They can't be like, hey, if you've got a really

32:30.880 --> 32:34.640
big pirated collection, like we're the best app to play your pirated collection, like they can't go

32:34.640 --> 32:37.840
that route, right? So they've got to find some legitimate way to do this. This isn't going to

32:37.840 --> 32:43.440
get them crushed by the copyright lobbyists. It's been obvious for a while, just as a user

32:43.440 --> 32:49.600
of Plex, that the core app, certainly as I see it, certainly what it started out as,

32:50.160 --> 32:56.560
as a home media streaming solution that is probably synonymous with pirated content,

32:56.560 --> 33:03.040
if we're being honest, that is not their core business now. And the app itself and the performance

33:03.040 --> 33:09.280
and the bugs and, you know, just the feature set that we're getting is proof of that. And this

33:09.280 --> 33:15.120
finally is, in my opinion, Plex tipping their hand and saying, this is the future of Plex.

33:15.680 --> 33:21.200
And so for me, I think Jellyfin is becoming more important than ever right now.

33:21.200 --> 33:26.480
Yeah, I agree. In fact, that's why I've been kind of watching the new Jellyfin releases and a new

33:26.480 --> 33:33.440
beta, 10.8.0, just shipped a few days ago. There's some nice stuff in here. A lot of transcode fixes,

33:33.440 --> 33:39.360
some DLNA fixes are in here. It feels like they're entering that real sweet spot where they're

33:39.360 --> 33:46.000
focused on this kind of stuff. You know, that's a lot of how these things work in tech. They,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.800
you know, when they get big enough, they have to become some legitimate business.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.800
Harvey Dent, right? If you live long enough, you see yourself become the villain.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.160
Yeah, possibly.

33:54.160 --> 33:58.320
But I mean, with Jellyfin, right, we have a viable alternative. The only real

33:59.120 --> 34:03.360
major criticism I have is that it's in a language that I don't personally know how to contribute

34:03.360 --> 34:09.040
to. It's based off of the MB history. So there's a lot of, you know, Windows.net style, I think it's

34:09.040 --> 34:11.520
or it's maybe C sharp. I can't remember.

34:11.520 --> 34:11.920
Yes.

34:11.920 --> 34:15.520
Yeah, C sharp mono. I feel the same way. It's sort of, it's a foreign thing. I'd love to be

34:15.520 --> 34:17.600
able to help, but it's not my bill house.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.560
I would be in there.

34:18.560 --> 34:25.280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dangus wrote in with some Plex free music self hosting tips is Hey guys,

34:25.280 --> 34:29.280
love the show. I wanted to mention a few apps for those outside the Plex ecosystem or maybe

34:29.280 --> 34:33.440
planning to migrate. I've been an avid Jellyfin user for a few years now and I've been getting

34:33.440 --> 34:41.040
into my music and hosting it as well. Namely Sonic XD for the desktop and Symfomium, I think.

34:41.040 --> 34:45.440
Symfomium for Android. Both of these are fantastic audio players that connect to both Jellyfin and

34:45.440 --> 34:50.880
subsonic and Plex sample. It looks fantastic. It's a bit of an investment. If you're not already in

34:50.880 --> 34:56.960
the Plex ecosystem, they wanted to pass these along. So it looks like Symfomium, Symfomium,

34:56.960 --> 35:02.880
S Y M F O N I U M and Sonic's D S O N I X D for the desktop.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.760
I can give you some real time feedback on my Plex amp experiment.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.040
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it.

35:07.040 --> 35:13.040
Both the wife and I quit Spotify a couple of months ago and up until about a week ago,

35:13.040 --> 35:16.800
it's been going really, really well until we actually, until I actually had a conversation

35:16.800 --> 35:22.480
with my wife and said, how are you finding Plex amp? And she goes, well, it's missing this. And

35:22.480 --> 35:26.240
now you mentioned it. It's missing that. And I don't, can you, can we download this and can we,

35:26.240 --> 35:32.240
I'm like, I've just, I looked at my server and I've got like five or six terabytes of music now.

35:32.880 --> 35:36.720
And I'm still missing a bunch of stuff. And Lidar, you know, we talked about the,

35:37.360 --> 35:42.080
the Deezer script a while ago, just can't cope with that kind of volume. It's just spinning

35:42.080 --> 35:49.680
its wheels and just gets lost in it. So, uh, I am really enjoying Plex amp on my side. I've got

35:49.680 --> 35:55.120
pretty much all the music I regularly listen to. Um, but we have, we have resubscribed to Spotify.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.480
I was tempted recently. I was tempted because it's really nice to have Spotify on the studio

36:00.480 --> 36:04.240
equipment and on Linux. It's nice to have Spotify sometimes, but I haven't yet folded.

36:04.240 --> 36:08.080
I have, I have, I have remained canceled Spotify free.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.880
I'm using YouTube music over here. I'm a weirdo.

36:10.880 --> 36:15.200
How is that? How's that going? It's okay. I used to use, uh, the Google play music

36:15.200 --> 36:18.560
back when that still existed, partially because I could upload a bunch of my own

36:18.560 --> 36:23.200
black files to it. And so I still have those. And yeah, I don't know. I like having a subscription.

36:23.200 --> 36:26.560
It's very convenient for discovery for just random stuff. I don't care about,

36:26.560 --> 36:30.400
but because I can no longer upload to it, I do find I'm more interested in some of these,

36:30.400 --> 36:35.280
you know, Plex amp. Doesn't Apple music let you do that? Let you upload your own?

36:35.280 --> 36:39.760
Yeah. We should get wears on our iPhone. I've been trying that for three years.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.640
When he got me, I'm on one.

36:42.640 --> 36:46.080
Yeah. Well, it's six. I got you to have a kid first. See, I took the long play on that one.

36:46.080 --> 36:49.440
First I convinced you guys to have a kid. So then you would be felt, felt motivated

36:49.440 --> 36:55.280
to get good camera optics. Hey, I'll tell you what, there was an example of streaming service

36:55.280 --> 37:00.320
entropy this week. Um, Snoop Dogg has decided to take hit one of his,

37:00.320 --> 37:04.880
my, or a couple of his most famous albums, one of which is called doggy style. Uh,

37:04.880 --> 37:08.960
and I listened to that album surprising amount actually. And I went on Spotify the other day

37:08.960 --> 37:13.280
and it's, it's gone. Do you know why he's trying to sell it as an NFT?

37:16.080 --> 37:22.240
So I fired up Plex amp boom straight away. You know, so I have a, I have doggy style in Plex amp

37:22.960 --> 37:25.600
and all that money you saved on your Spotify subscription. You know,

37:25.600 --> 37:32.240
now you can buy the NFT about, I don't know, man, I'm sitting here. It's a little bittersweet.

37:32.240 --> 37:35.520
I don't really want to talk about this next story, but for some people out there,

37:35.520 --> 37:39.760
maybe they care. New version of home assistant came out, but it doesn't matter. I'm not upgrading

37:39.760 --> 37:44.240
because I can't, but come on. It's packed with amazing features. I knew they would do this to

37:44.240 --> 37:48.400
me. I knew the version that, cause this is where they dropped my Z wave and I knew they would do

37:48.400 --> 37:52.640
this tons of new stuff that I want, but it is really good. Yeah, it is. It is a few things

37:52.640 --> 37:56.960
that stand out to me. The one, uh, there's a, there's a couple, let's start off with the,

37:56.960 --> 38:02.720
uh, group stuff. So now you can create groups in the user interface directly. Previously,

38:02.720 --> 38:07.360
you would have to drop to the YAML, uh, configuration to do that. It's a nice little

38:07.360 --> 38:14.560
change, um, along with a new hide entities function, which lets you hide the constituent

38:14.560 --> 38:20.080
lights say of a particular group. That's really nice. That is, I want that already.

38:20.800 --> 38:27.040
Now, another one that got me pretty excited was switch as X. So in my home assistant YAML right

38:27.040 --> 38:32.640
now, I have a bunch of, uh, I don't know what you call them, but they basically convert a switch

38:32.640 --> 38:37.680
into a light or a cover, right? Or as from, in my case, a smart plug into a heater or something

38:37.680 --> 38:44.960
like that. Right. Yep. And switch as X now lets me set directly in the configuration of that,

38:44.960 --> 38:52.880
uh, smart plug. I can now show that as a light zones, the entire zone can now have a state.

38:52.880 --> 38:57.840
That's really nice to see. So like my, my kitchen is a zone. My living room is a zone. My bedroom

38:57.840 --> 39:05.280
is his own. Um, and they've done optimizing on both the front end and the backend side of home

39:05.280 --> 39:09.760
assistant as well. So, and I love that. Of course, of course, I'm not going to get that version.

39:09.760 --> 39:13.360
And now it's no longer called a Lovelace either. It's just called the dashboard. Now too,

39:13.360 --> 39:17.920
that is a shame because obviously it was a tip of the hat to Ada Lovelace. One of the fathers of

39:17.920 --> 39:23.200
or can you call her a father of computing, a mother of computing, one of the perennials.

39:23.200 --> 39:28.640
We have a word for that. There was another feature in there that caught my fancy. And

39:28.640 --> 39:33.680
this is particularly useful when writing automations. There's a little test button

39:33.680 --> 39:38.320
up in the top of the automations thing, which lets you test the conditions to make sure they're

39:38.320 --> 39:46.240
right. And yeah, it's a nice little one. Damn it. This really sucks. I want this version so bad.

39:46.240 --> 39:51.440
So if this isn't enough, what is enough to make your upgrade time? It's a matter of having to

39:51.440 --> 39:56.720
redo my entire Z wave. And you know, all of my, I mean my, my heaters, all my heating stuff,

39:56.720 --> 40:02.720
all my, all my temperature sensors, my outdoor sensors, my motion sensors, they're all a UV

40:02.720 --> 40:06.720
sensors, my humidity sensors. They're all Z wave. You're just putting off the inevitable though.

40:06.720 --> 40:11.120
I know you're going to have to do it. Have you considered learning Python and starting to

40:11.120 --> 40:15.600
maintain the old version yourself? Well, I'm doing just about as much work cause I'm first,

40:15.600 --> 40:18.960
I got to learn, I got to learn Nick's OS upside and down. And then I got to figure out how to

40:18.960 --> 40:23.520
deploy everything. I was deploying in a container in Nick's OS and I got to learn how to move

40:23.520 --> 40:27.760
everything over to MQTT and do Z wave to MQTT. And then I'm going to have to figure out node

40:27.760 --> 40:32.000
red if I go that route. So I might as well just learn Python and probably save myself some time.

40:32.640 --> 40:35.760
They've really done this at their worst time too. Cause here we are traveling and all this stuff

40:35.760 --> 40:39.680
and I'm just learning an entire new way. I want to build my system. So like now I don't want to

40:39.680 --> 40:44.400
do it the old way and then be like, this is old and busted. It's just the worst. I should have,

40:44.400 --> 40:46.320
I can't believe they didn't call me first and ask me.

40:47.600 --> 40:51.440
Just to reiterate, the reason Chris is all butthurt is because they're deprecating

40:51.440 --> 40:57.280
a Python two based integration, which has been coming for how many years? Two years,

40:57.280 --> 41:03.280
maybe. I don't know. I just don't sympathize with you on this one. I don't. I know it's a pain in

41:03.280 --> 41:07.120
the butt. Okay. Can I, can I plead my case set differently? Can I, I'll take a new approach.

41:07.120 --> 41:10.560
You can try. If they'd only gotten that damn damn migration wizard to work properly,

41:10.560 --> 41:13.920
I could have migrated to the supported stuff, but the migration wizard didn't work. So now

41:13.920 --> 41:21.360
I'm still a victim, right? No, it's fine. I'll, I'll hang tight for a bit. And then you're probably

41:21.360 --> 41:25.840
by summertime. I'll get, I'll get caught up. I'll still keep the home assistant, uh, install at the

41:25.840 --> 41:33.040
studio. I'll keep that up to date. You're like a Will Smith level victim. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yep.

41:33.040 --> 41:33.520
That's true.

41:35.760 --> 41:40.640
tailscale.com slash self-hosted to go there to get a free account for up to 20 devices.

41:40.640 --> 41:46.320
And of course you support the show. TailScale is a zero config VPN. It installs on any device

41:46.320 --> 41:51.200
in minutes. You can manage firewall rules for you or for, I don't know, maybe Wes over there.

41:51.200 --> 41:54.640
And it's just a great way to work from just about anywhere. So of course, as you know,

41:54.640 --> 42:00.800
right now we're on the road. And as you can imagine, tail scale is saving the day.

42:00.800 --> 42:06.000
I have different devices, even my VMs connected to my flat tail scale network,

42:06.000 --> 42:12.480
and all of it is using WireGuard's noise encryption. It's beautiful, secure, and simple.

42:12.480 --> 42:16.640
You'd be shocked how fast you can get this thing set up. You install the client, it generates a

42:16.640 --> 42:21.120
URL. You associate that with your account and you're good to go. I've even got it on my iPad

42:21.120 --> 42:25.040
so I can pull up the feedback and I can read through all the emails on my iPad to get it

42:25.040 --> 42:30.480
ready for the show. And even in situations where I've got carrier grade NAT, I'm behind a firewall,

42:30.480 --> 42:37.440
I'm on like some limited guest Wi-Fi that Alex has set up, it still works. Tail scale just works.

42:37.440 --> 42:41.200
It's how I'm also keeping connected to my kids' computers so when they have problems,

42:41.200 --> 42:45.280
they're just on my flat tail scale network. And yeah, you can even divide things up if you need

42:45.280 --> 42:48.960
to worry about that kind of stuff. And if you want to throw a DNS server on the network,

42:48.960 --> 42:53.920
tail scale works with that like magic. So I've got it run on everything from Arch x86 boxes

42:53.920 --> 43:00.400
to Tumbleweed Raspberry Pis to iPads and Android devices. And it's just great. The best thing is

43:00.400 --> 43:05.920
it's like every device gets a network IP that is assigned to it and remains consistent no matter

43:05.920 --> 43:11.120
where I'm at, no matter where I'm at in the country, all of my bookmarks still work. And

43:11.120 --> 43:15.840
tail scale works with whatever your single sign on provider is. So if you want to use a single sign

43:15.840 --> 43:20.880
on provider you already have with two factor authentication, that's going to work too. You're

43:20.880 --> 43:25.360
going to be really impressed. You'll probably get it going in a matter of minutes regardless of your

43:25.360 --> 43:31.120
device or operating system. So go try it for yourself. Protect your data with wire guard

43:31.120 --> 43:38.240
scale encryption and build a flat mesh network in seconds for free up to 20 devices. And you support

43:38.240 --> 43:45.120
the show when you go to tailscale.com slash self hosted. Go see why I love it so much. It's going

43:45.120 --> 43:49.120
to change how you think about networking. It's going to change how you can get access to your

43:49.120 --> 43:56.800
data and it's going to help keep you private and secure. Tailscale.com slash self hosted.

43:56.800 --> 44:00.400
I'm still finding it weird that I'm in the same room as you two gentlemen. This is uh,

44:00.400 --> 44:03.760
this is nice. I could get used to this. We should, we need to get like, uh,

44:03.760 --> 44:07.840
six more sponsors on every episode and we just do every episode like this. Yeah.

44:07.840 --> 44:12.000
Just pay for the flights. Turn it into an LTT video. Probably need a time machine too

44:12.000 --> 44:15.840
to make that five hour flight each way work. Well think about the automations we could do in the

44:15.840 --> 44:21.920
JP private jet. Right? Oh, that's where we go. We need a jet. We need one. We keep flying west.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.600
If we always fly west, then it will be fine. We can make that work, right? Oh yeah. I think

44:25.600 --> 44:30.080
cause it's a glove. That's how it works. Yeah. Or is it east? I don't know. I mean you just

44:30.080 --> 44:36.080
go one direction long enough. It doesn't matter. True. So we have some feedback from Josh today.

44:36.080 --> 44:40.080
Hi Chris and Alex. Thank you for the podcast. I've recently been starting out in the world

44:40.080 --> 44:44.960
of self hosting and I've listened to every episode. I am fortunate enough to be able to

44:44.960 --> 44:49.200
keep something small at my dad's house. Now, given the chat on a previous episode,

44:49.200 --> 44:54.960
I've been looking towards an SBC single board computer based NAS. Hopefully this will consume

44:54.960 --> 44:59.360
very little power and should be able to cope with semi-regular incremental backups. I'm thinking

44:59.360 --> 45:04.640
about something, uh, maybe in the weekly backup range. There seems to be mixed advice about this

45:04.640 --> 45:09.600
online, including a lot of feedback suggesting that using an SBC is flawed as these disks will

45:09.600 --> 45:15.120
be hanging off the USB bus. Uh, do you feel this is something to be concerned about or is this an

45:15.120 --> 45:19.360
acceptable compromise to reach the low power and small form factor solution I'm looking for?

45:20.400 --> 45:24.400
I'm hearing low power a couple of times in here. So it sounds like that is a,

45:24.400 --> 45:29.520
that is a primary concern for Josh here. And so you probably are going down the right path Josh,

45:29.520 --> 45:35.280
but I wonder, have you considered the magnificent world of the compute module four? Because there

45:35.280 --> 45:43.040
are carrier boards where you can get PCI slots, you can get a SATA, you can have an EMMC, which

45:43.040 --> 45:48.720
is much superior to an SD card for a boot drive. And so, uh, you know, if I were going to build a

45:48.720 --> 45:55.360
NAS today based around some sort of SBC, it would take a really, really, really strong argument for

45:55.360 --> 46:01.920
me to consider anything else but the CM4 simply because nothing else has the network effect,

46:01.920 --> 46:05.520
the community effect, the software support. And when you're building something that you want to

46:05.520 --> 46:11.280
run solid and run for a while, that matters. You know, there may be faster SBCs out there with

46:11.280 --> 46:17.120
ones that already have PCI slots, for example, but the CM4, the compute module four combined with a

46:17.120 --> 46:21.600
carrier board that can accommodate you in my experience is such a solid setup. It's really

46:21.600 --> 46:27.440
hard to argue against that. What do you think Alex? It's just a backup, right? Yeah, true.

46:27.440 --> 46:33.760
If you have something hanging off the USB bus and it fails, it shouldn't matter. It is your backup.

46:33.760 --> 46:39.040
As long as you have monitoring in place to let you know that something's gone south,

46:40.560 --> 46:44.480
you know, the backup is the perfect place to experiment and do something that's slightly more

46:44.480 --> 46:53.280
risky. Uh, so long as maybe, I don't know, like maybe have two, uh, you know, three, two, one.

46:53.280 --> 46:57.520
Yeah, the prices, you probably could too, right? I mean, the most expensive thing here is going to

46:57.520 --> 47:01.600
be the storage. That's going to be the most expensive thing. So let us know what you do,

47:01.600 --> 47:04.800
Josh. Cause you know, sometimes we get these questions, but we don't always get the followups.

47:04.800 --> 47:10.640
So we'd love to know. Kevin writes in, I have five or so VPS servers on Linode.

47:11.360 --> 47:15.760
I have one domain name at my DNS provider with subdomains pointing to each server.

47:15.760 --> 47:21.520
It's great for SSH access. I want to run a web server from each one of them. I've obtained a

47:21.520 --> 47:27.840
wildcard TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt on the first server using Lego. I've confirmed the

47:27.840 --> 47:33.520
wildcard cert works on the first server where Lego is installed. It serves a new page with HTTPS on

47:33.520 --> 47:39.760
the subdomain with that cert. I then set a cron job to run Lego and renew that cert monthly.

47:40.400 --> 47:45.840
What is the safest way though, to propagate that wildcard cert from one server to all four other

47:45.840 --> 47:51.760
servers automatically each month? I've got wire guard, I've got SSH, just not keys. I've got

47:51.760 --> 47:57.600
Ansible vault I could potentially use. I've thought about doing these with cron jobs that

47:57.600 --> 48:01.840
copy these over SSH, but how do I automate communicating between the servers? How do I

48:01.840 --> 48:06.320
protect the SSH keys, the SSH certificate and other connection credentials and move all of

48:06.320 --> 48:11.440
this around? This feels like one of those where there's like a thousand ways you could solve this

48:11.440 --> 48:19.360
problem. You could do it the proper way, the established way and move the certificates around

48:19.360 --> 48:24.800
between the servers, but we were talking about this as a group before we recorded and Wes,

48:24.800 --> 48:29.120
you came up with an interesting idea. Yeah, it's kind of sounding like maybe the, you know,

48:29.120 --> 48:33.840
handling of the secrets, distributing that to multiple machines. That workflow hasn't really

48:33.840 --> 48:39.360
been worked out yet in this case. That's a fine thing to experiment with, but if that's not an

48:39.360 --> 48:42.560
essential, you know, if that's just going to be an implementation detail to the actual point of

48:42.560 --> 48:48.960
getting this done, you don't need to be the one handling that part of it. What about just something

48:48.960 --> 48:54.560
like S3? You know, I mean, you can, you can secure that. You can also set a time expiring links. That

48:54.560 --> 48:59.440
was the kind of thing you were worried about and you don't have to host it. Exactly right. Yeah. I

48:59.440 --> 49:07.120
mean, you can do, like you say, authentication on an S3 request. It's easily accessible over the

49:07.120 --> 49:12.560
internet safely, securely. People do it all the time. I'm sure you've all seen the, uh, web URL

49:12.560 --> 49:20.640
of an S3 item in your URL bar at some point. Uh, you know, it's a chicken and egg problem with SSH

49:20.640 --> 49:25.120
that you come across all the time, right? I want to automate this thing, but I need my SSH key over

49:25.120 --> 49:31.520
there already before I do the thing. Yep. Yep. That's three solves that particular problem or

49:31.520 --> 49:36.880
any kind of object storage really. Uh, but the reason I think that we talked about S3 in particular

49:36.880 --> 49:40.800
is that it's authenticated. And if you're putting a secret up there, like a certificate,

49:41.760 --> 49:46.640
it's, uh, you need to have some kind of authentication in front of it. And you could

49:46.640 --> 49:51.680
just use object storage at Linode already because that's S3 compatible. Good to go. So nobody's

49:51.680 --> 49:56.000
going to suggest sync thing. Okay. So don't use sync thing. We did mention it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

49:56.000 --> 50:01.280
I don't know. Like it's, uh, uh, how secure is it with third party bounce service and stuff like

50:01.280 --> 50:05.680
that? I mean, it's probably fine. Yeah. It just doesn't seem like the right tool. Does it? I mean,

50:05.680 --> 50:08.560
it seems like you could do it, but it doesn't seem like the right way to do it.

50:08.560 --> 50:12.480
Go old school and use BitTorrent. Yeah. There you go. Or BitTorrent sync. You could do that.

50:12.480 --> 50:18.800
I think you mean Resilio. Resilio sync. I mean, the thing is with the S3 solution,

50:18.800 --> 50:22.800
it would work in much a similar way as sync thing, right? I guess with sync thing you could,

50:23.440 --> 50:28.080
and this is just solutionizing off the top of my head, which I hate doing, but anyway,

50:28.880 --> 50:33.280
you could, uh, encrypt the secret on whatever box is running Lego

50:33.280 --> 50:38.880
and then sync the encrypted thing with sync thing and then have the logic to decrypt it

50:38.880 --> 50:43.280
at the remote site that way. And that would be kind of secure as it's going over the wire,

50:43.280 --> 50:46.720
but I bet you that's how I would do it. If I, if I were to solve this problem,

50:46.720 --> 50:50.080
that's probably what I would do. Here's the downside on each of those other four remote

50:50.080 --> 50:54.640
systems. You still need the decryption password. Yeah. Probably stored in plain text,

50:54.640 --> 51:00.960
probably on disc. So are you in any better solution than just doing it with a sync thing

51:00.960 --> 51:06.560
naked? I don't know. Probably not. But if anybody has an idea, let us know. Self hosted.show

51:06.560 --> 51:11.600
slash contact or send us a boost like Optimus Gray did. Optimus boosted in and he said,

51:11.600 --> 51:16.880
I hope to see you next week. If gas prices aren't too high, that is, but don't work Brent too much.

51:16.880 --> 51:22.240
I want to see Brent. He sent us 500 sats to say that if you want to give us a boost,

51:22.240 --> 51:27.280
it's like the bat line into the show. You go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com,

51:27.280 --> 51:31.200
load that wallet up and send us a boost and we'll get it here on the show.

51:31.840 --> 51:36.480
I want to say a big thank you to our SRE site reliability engineer subscribers.

51:36.480 --> 51:42.080
You make this show possible over at self-hosted.show slash SRE and they could join the party,

51:42.080 --> 51:46.720
Jupiter.party if they want to support the entire network and get access to all the

51:46.720 --> 51:51.840
special features of the shows. Yeah. I wonder, you know, I wonder if we'll have some extras.

51:51.840 --> 51:55.680
We should probably plug the extras just in case we get any extra content that we record here with

51:55.680 --> 52:00.160
the group of us extras.show. Wes, thanks for hanging out with us. Thanks for having me.

52:00.160 --> 52:04.320
We, I, we really didn't give him a chance to stretch his wings. You know, we could get into

52:04.320 --> 52:09.040
some topic on the road that Wes could probably really dig into. You should think about that.

52:09.040 --> 52:12.000
So Wes, you're just going to have to come back so that way we can do it again.

52:12.000 --> 52:16.800
Oh, I think we can come up with something. I think we can indeed. Go find our contact page,

52:16.800 --> 52:19.440
send us in your thoughts. Let us know what you think. Maybe you got a solution for one of the

52:19.440 --> 52:23.920
things we've talked about today. Self-hosted.show slash contact is the place to get in touch.

52:23.920 --> 52:27.840
You can find me on Twitter. I'm at Chris LAS. I thought we weren't doing the Twitter thing anymore.

52:27.840 --> 52:33.760
I decided to do it this week. Okay. Okay. It's cause Elon's on board now. Okay. I'm on Twitter

52:33.760 --> 52:37.920
also at ironic badger. I'm also, and this is something that the listener wrote in and let

52:37.920 --> 52:42.720
me know about, we need to plug the discord more heavily. So apparently we don't say enough about

52:42.720 --> 52:47.200
it. So we got a discord. Here we go. We have a discord self-hosted.show slash discord. I'm over

52:47.200 --> 52:52.000
there at Alex KTZ. Are you on the Twitter? Is there anything you want to plug Wes?

52:52.000 --> 52:56.960
I am at Wes Payne and Hey, maybe check out that podcast. You and I do Linux action news.

52:56.960 --> 53:02.640
Hey, Hey, Hey. Also there's a self-hosted matrix. Our matrix service colony.jupiterbroadcasting.com.

53:02.640 --> 53:06.800
If you want to get into some trouble over there, we'd love to have you and get in there. There is,

53:06.800 --> 53:13.600
I think a growing to self-hosted room community over there. Isn't it ironic that the self-hosted

53:13.600 --> 53:19.280
podcast has a discord server and luck and JB as a whole have the matrix server. And I'm just not,

53:19.280 --> 53:22.800
well, we kind of have came first. The discord server, I think came first.

53:22.800 --> 53:26.560
All these problems that you talked about in last week's love about hosting a chat server

53:26.560 --> 53:30.160
are exactly why I didn't want to do it. We should mention, if you want to hear some

53:30.160 --> 53:33.680
horror stories about self-hosting matrix, we just did that in Linux unplugged the

53:33.680 --> 53:37.440
most recent episode, which I should probably have the number for since we're talking about it. But

53:38.160 --> 53:41.120
you know, let's just say when, you know, if you're, I just want to, I'll just say this part,

53:41.120 --> 53:45.520
if you're doing it for five or 10 people, maybe even a hundred people, it's fine. Don't worry

53:45.520 --> 53:49.600
about it. If you want to do for more than a hundred people or maybe 2000 people, there's

53:49.600 --> 53:53.680
some things that go, they go a little wrong. They go a little sideways with the default config.

53:53.680 --> 53:57.040
And we covered that at Linux unplugged.com slash four five two.

53:58.640 --> 54:03.920
And if you have any other questions about which episode did Chris talk about this particular

54:03.920 --> 54:09.360
thing in Coda radio, we have a show notes website over at notes.jupitabroadcasting.com.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.440
All the episodes are in there and that's actually a fully self-hosted website.

54:13.440 --> 54:18.720
Now, as always, thanks for listening, everybody. That was self-hosted.show slash 68.
