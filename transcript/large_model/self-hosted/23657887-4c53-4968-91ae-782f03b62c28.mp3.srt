1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Well, I'm pretty excited because I get to geek out this week.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,940
Matt, from Adventurous Way, a YouTube channel that Alex and I watch, is joining us.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,980
And Matt, you've got a ton of videos about RV travel, automation, self-hosting.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,320
And just recently, you and the wife bought 40 acres of raw land in central Vermont

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,480
and are starting the long work of building a smart home from the ground up.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,780
Matt, welcome to the show.

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,280
Thank you so much for having me.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,520
Are you crazy?

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,920
I watch your videos and it looks like years of work ahead of you.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,920
It really is.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,600
Yeah, this is the start of a pretty long journey, I think.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,980
We are just at the very beginning of it.

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,920
And yeah, I think we are probably a little bit crazy.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,120
I'm sure you've noticed, Chris, that I managed to coerce another Brit onto the show.

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,360
I wanted to bring the average, you know, raise the standard a bit.

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, it wasn't lost on me.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,520
It wasn't lost on me at all.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,200
But, you know, Alex, there's like a ton of stuff we could talk to Matt about.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,300
But I thought maybe we'd start with what he and I have in common.

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,840
When I first started watching your channel, you were doing a smart RV system similar to

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,720
mine, Home Assistant, Victron, the whole work.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,320
So can you walk us through a little bit of what you built?

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, so we've been living full time in our RV now for about three years.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,680
We moved out of a perfectly good four bedroom home in the Bay Area, California, and into

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,320
a 180 square foot box on wheels.

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,760
So imagine about half the size of the average like master bedroom in the US.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,160
And that's been our entire home for the last three years.

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,720
And so pretty quickly, we realized that we're both technologists, my partner and I are both

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,200
sort of former software engineers and tech people, we kind of realized there's an opportunity

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,120
here to use technology to make ourselves more comfortable.

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,840
And that was really where this whole journey began.

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,300
And so what started off as just like a hobby, it's pretty hard to have hobbies when you

33
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,360
live in such a small space, if they're physical, we also don't have a backyard go and do gardening

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,040
and I've given up my woodworking shop and things.

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,520
So we really focused on digital hobbies.

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,220
And so although I've been into some elements of self hosting and tech for many, many years,

37
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:21,200
this for me really was an opportunity to go deep into into tech and the home automation

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
side of things.

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,140
So starting almost three years ago, I had a Raspberry Pi, and I loaded Home Assistant

40
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,140
onto it.

41
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,700
And that was kind of where I started.

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:38,320
And within a matter of weeks, I was already overwhelming the Raspberry Pi, it must have

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,400
been a model three, I guess back then, completely overwhelming what it was able to do.

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,960
And I was like, I think it's I think it's time for an upgrade.

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,720
Again, space, big concern for us here, as you know, living in an RV.

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
And power draw as well.

47
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
Right.

48
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
And that's the nice thing about the Pi.

49
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
Yeah.

50
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,500
And the Pi was great because it could run off the DC voltage.

51
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,380
And that was something that I wanted to stick with.

52
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,860
So we upgraded to an eighth gen Intel NUC.

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,360
It runs an i3 processor.

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,700
And because it runs, I think it's like 19 volts that it actually runs on, I was able

55
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:20,080
to avoid using the normal AC power brick, and instead run it straight off DC, using

56
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,520
a DC boost converter.

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,720
That has been running flawlessly now for almost three years, 24 seven.

58
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Nice.

59
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,520
It's interesting you say that Matt, I think a few years ago, maybe five plus Plex was

60
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,600
the gateway drug for a lot of people that got them into self hosting.

61
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,000
I know you're a proponent of that as well.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,600
Home Assistant is the new gateway drug, don't you think?

63
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,120
I think it is.

64
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,380
And it's, it's literally the hub of the entire experience in our RV.

65
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,280
It is even when we're consuming media, I've got Plex plugged into Home Assistant.

66
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,400
And so it really is that that kind of entrance point for me.

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,680
But I think it's becoming so accessible, and so easy to get up and running with the it's

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,600
just attracting more and more people to this this kind of lifestyle and this this hobby.

69
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,240
Well, I have a ton of questions for you, Matt.

70
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,680
And in fact, I want to get into some of the details about your system.

71
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,360
But I want to mention this episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

72
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,960
They are the leader in learning for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills, hundreds

73
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,440
of courses and 1000s of hands on labs, get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud

74
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
guru.com.

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,000
Matt, something you said there was that it was what struck you as well, we could use

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,680
some of this technology to make life more comfortable in our tiny home.

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,040
That's kind of how I got into it, too.

78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,800
And I'm curious, what was some of your very first automations?

79
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,040
Was it was it around enabling boondocking?

80
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Was it around heating?

81
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Where did you start?

82
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,320
Yeah, so for us, the scarcity of resources was one of our biggest challenges.

83
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,640
Much like you, we have battle born lithium batteries, we have solar, but they're still

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
finite.

85
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,680
In three years on the road, we do not and have never owned a generator.

86
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,520
So one of my big first priorities was how do I get power?

87
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,420
We prefer to boondock rather than stay in RV parks.

88
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,000
I think started last year, we did 100 days in a row of boondocking, just totally off

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
grid.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Wow.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
100 days.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's impressive.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Very nice.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Wow.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,820
So when the pandemic first hit, we were just every 10 to 14 days, we would run into town

96
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,600
to go and dump our tanks and fill up again and then back out into the middle of nowhere

97
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
and carry on.

98
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,620
Oh, look at you, you big show off.

99
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,640
So one of the priorities with the home automation was how do I make this more achievable?

100
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,920
And for me, I've never got into the script so much, just the trigger thing and then things

101
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,180
happen all at once.

102
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,200
I was always into the how can I make the RV smarter in the first place so I don't have

103
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,760
to interact with it at all.

104
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,200
So one of my favorites, I call it the auto dump feature and has nothing to do with dumping

105
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,440
tanks.

106
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:05,360
This is all about electricity and the idea is to say, let's say it's a sunny day outside.

107
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,080
It's spring, I'm in the desert, I've got plenty of solar coming in.

108
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,400
At some point, my battery is going to fill up.

109
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
So what do I do with that excess?

110
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,560
How can I use it?

111
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,640
So I set up an automation that as the batteries reached higher and higher voltage levels and

112
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,720
higher and higher percent charge, it would begin to turn on or enable certain devices.

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,760
So as you've probably noticed, the Victron inverter has a fairly high background power

114
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,120
draw and so we keep it turned off most of the time.

115
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,800
Once the batteries reach 80%, I would turn the inverter on automatically.

116
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,360
Once the batteries reached 90%, it would switch the fridge over from propane to AC electric.

117
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,080
And once the batteries reached 95%, it would switch the electric water heater on.

118
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,840
So on a good sunny day without us doing anything at all, we would end the day with full batteries,

119
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,600
a full tank of hot water and having saved some propane from the fridge.

120
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,800
I love that.

121
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
That's so great.

122
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
That's really cool.

123
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,560
You must be then going through and replacing those basic DC switches that came with the

124
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,200
RV with something smarter.

125
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,840
One of the challenges in the RV is nothing is designed for RVs in the smart world.

126
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,400
So we don't use a lot of 110 volts.

127
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,120
DC is king.

128
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,560
And so the Sonoff SV has been my choice for a lot of this and a couple of the other Sonoff

129
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
devices.

130
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
The 4Chan Pro has been another one I've used.

131
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,760
And then a couple of things are running on Sonoff, I think it's the POW R2, the energy

132
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,320
monitoring hardwired one or the Sonoff S31.

133
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,280
And those have really been the heart of it.

134
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,200
I started off with TAS motor running on those and then switched over to ESP home a little

135
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
while later.

136
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,520
I actually use one of those Sonoff SVs and I'm holding up to the camera for you both

137
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,960
for my garage doors.

138
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,920
And yeah, it's worked absolutely flawlessly.

139
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,560
It's got a little relay on it.

140
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,040
It runs on low voltage, like you said, Matt.

141
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
I really like it.

142
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,480
I put TAS motor on mine, of course.

143
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,680
Fantastic little board.

144
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,220
And then another, it sounds like another key piece of insight that's coming into Home Assistant

145
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,800
is you are making Home Assistant aware of your electrical system.

146
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,000
Sounds like battery state, power generation from solar.

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,640
Home Assistant must be getting a lot of information off of your Victron setup.

148
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,840
How are you supplying that to Home Assistant?

149
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Yeah, you're right.

150
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,440
So we are using the Victron CCGX, the Color Control GX, which is one of their family of

151
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,260
products that has a built in MQTT broker.

152
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,900
So this is actually one of the original reasons, I guess, that we chose Victron versus some

153
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,720
of the other vendors out there that do solar for RVs.

154
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,140
We basically schlep up all of that MQTT data, throw it into Home Assistant, and also then

155
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,400
collect it all in InfluxDB as well.

156
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,360
And for me, it was actually the data collection side of things that was really why I started

157
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
this in the first place.

158
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,440
We wanted to see the long term trends of our batteries, of our solar, all these sorts of

159
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
things.

160
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,680
We've now got, I think, almost three years worth of data at about a one to ten second

161
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,000
resolution across dozens and dozens and dozens of data points on the electrical system.

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,560
So you're getting real insights to how the health of your batteries are, if they're still

163
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,040
delivering the same way, and probably even like you could start to see maybe something's

164
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,800
wrong with one of our solar panels because of this data.

165
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Exactly.

166
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,080
So we've used it ourselves to answer questions like, if we added 200 more watts of solar,

167
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,400
what would that do to our system?

168
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,280
Or how many watts of solar do we need to get through winter at a given latitude?

169
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,200
Because we can graph the location of the RV versus the amount of power that we bring in

170
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
during the day.

171
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
I love this.

172
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,000
You've got to come on board as a road trip consultant for me, you know, running operations.

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,240
So a lot of the stuff that we've done in that sense has been quite selfish.

174
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,760
It's informed decisions that we've made ourselves.

175
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,360
But I think one of the things that's really excited me the most is being able to share

176
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,140
this data with others.

177
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:19,240
So we've actually shared all of our electrical data with Battleborn, who make our batteries,

178
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,340
with Dennis, the CEO, and he's then able to look at that data and from that get real world

179
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,240
insight into how their batteries actually perform in the wild.

180
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:36,280
Because no lab can recreate an RV in temperature fluctuations and casually turning on the AC

181
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,000
and then boondocking for-

182
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
A hundred days.

183
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Exactly.

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,680
So we've been able to share all that data with them and that really helps them to then

185
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,680
understand how their batteries perform in different conditions and hopefully then improve

186
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
their products.

187
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,760
Yeah, I could show them how their batteries perform while they're cooking because it's

188
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,880
so dang hot here.

189
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,180
But something else that strikes me is that you could do is you could watch for the total

190
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,600
draw of the RV and prevent tripping a breaker when you're set up to shore power and you're

191
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,000
actually maybe not boondocking, but you're at an RV park or something like that.

192
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,960
So there's utilities for when you're not off grid as well, I would imagine.

193
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,160
We actually added that exact automation about 10 months ago.

194
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,400
We arrived here in Vermont, we had full hookups and we knew we were going to be here during

195
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,680
the winter and we're only in a 30 amp RV, which means that our main breaker in the RV

196
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,900
can only handle 30 amps, which means it's really, really easy for us to trip that breaker.

197
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:34,220
If we ran an electric water heater, an electric space heater, if we then happened to turn

198
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:39,560
on the microwave or electric kettle or something else, that would trip the breaker.

199
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:46,200
So I was able to use a home assistant automation to look at what I'd set the Victron system

200
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,840
to allow as the input current, so 30 amps usually, and then deduct from that whatever

201
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,880
the current total power draw was.

202
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,380
And then if I was exceeding the 30 amps, it would then automatically pause either the

203
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:05,240
electric water heater or the electric space heater so that I can run the microwave or

204
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,000
run the electric kettle because I need my cup of tea and pause those things until the

205
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,920
microwave or the kettle has shut off and then return them back to their original state.

206
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,280
And thanks to that, we didn't trip a breaker all winter long.

207
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:26,560
So Matt, are you telling me that my color control GX is collecting all the information

208
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,880
I need and I just need to go into the settings and tell it an MQTT endpoint or something?

209
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Do I already have it?

210
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
It's even simpler than that.

211
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,360
It actually has a built-in MQTT broker.

212
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
No.

213
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,160
So you can just connect to it on port 1883 and pull the data straight off.

214
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,440
You're doing it right now, aren't you, Chris?

215
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Be honest.

216
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,520
I just don't understand why nobody's built a Victron integration for a home assistant.

217
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Get on it, somebody.

218
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,720
So I actually looked at doing it.

219
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,040
I posted on the Victron forums late last year and said I'd be really interested in making

220
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,920
a Victron integration.

221
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,600
That was probably your forum post I read.

222
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,280
I don't know Python.

223
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:11,900
And so for me, there's a decent barrier to entry to go straight from not knowing a language

224
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,720
to writing an integration with this massive kind of project.

225
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,040
But yeah, all the data's there on MQTT.

226
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,420
It feels like this is a great example of if you had somebody who was a Python developer

227
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:28,280
and had a Victron system, it wouldn't take long until we had an integration.

228
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,680
But those two paths have not yet crossed.

229
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:40,280
But these Victron systems are crazy popular in van builds, bus builds, modern RVs.

230
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,560
These things are going everywhere.

231
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,260
And Victron makes some great stuff.

232
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,260
They really do.

233
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,400
And one of the things that I like the most about Victron is they are open sourcing nearly

234
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,920
all of their software.

235
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,800
So all the APIs they use are all completely publicly documented, but all the source code

236
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
is also there as well.

237
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Hell yeah.

238
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,480
And you'll like this one.

239
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,720
They've even got a literal how-to guide on GitHub along with all the software you need

240
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,040
to run the CCGX software on a Raspberry Pi.

241
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,200
Yeah, I really like that.

242
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,440
I know some of their boxes internally are running Linux too, which I think is just great.

243
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,880
I'm a huge fan of that as well.

244
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,720
We should reach out to Victron and have them on the show.

245
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
We should.

246
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
You're right.

247
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,280
I should give them enough publicity on there, for heck's sake.

248
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
But yeah.

249
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
All right.

250
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Well, yeah.

251
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:35,480
So I am setting up MQTT and pointing it at my ColorGX right now, so I'm going to get

252
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
that going.

253
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,720
Top tip, if you want to, my favorite MQTT kind of tool is something called MQTT Explorer.

254
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Ah, OK.

255
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,120
This thing lets you log into a broker and see all the messages that it's getting in

256
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
real time.

257
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
Oh.

258
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,360
And I see it's a Mac app, is that a Mac app?

259
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,620
Brew install MQTT-Explorer, I think.

260
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,620
No kidding.

261
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,620
Really?

262
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,620
OK.

263
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,480
Actually, so you can use Brew to install practically everything these days.

264
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:08,880
When I set this, I got an M1 Mac about a month ago, and I've religiously used Brew for absolutely

265
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,640
everything, including Chrome, VS Code, Audacity, everything.

266
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,640
Yeah.

267
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
I legitimately had no idea.

268
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
No, I know.

269
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,800
It's been a really, really long way in the last five years or so.

270
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Yeah.

271
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,160
I have to say, my Mac experiment here on the road trip, it's been good.

272
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,320
Once I got, and Matt, I don't know if you've ever run into this, but I had this problem

273
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,760
where NSURLSessionD just would consume all of my bandwidth, because I was in a pretty

274
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,840
crappy signal area, and I had hardly any signal.

275
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,840
And I'd fire up the Mac, and it would just sit there and run and run and run, in part

276
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,640
because the download speeds were slow, so it took longer.

277
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,200
And I'm sitting there trying to do a live show.

278
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
It's just horrible.

279
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,920
So once everybody yelled at me to try Little Snitch out again, which I had tried out 100

280
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
years ago.

281
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,140
I gave Little Snitch a go and set up an outbound firewall and blocked basically everything

282
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,480
except for the apps I'm using to do the shows.

283
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,280
It's been pretty solid since then.

284
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,360
Seemed a little hacky, but sure works.

285
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,800
Yeah, there's a load of little tricks like that you can use when you're in a really constrained

286
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,520
bandwidth situation, just to make sure that your devices are only doing the things you

287
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,320
really, really want them to do, and not just those background tasks that can wait.

288
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,840
Are you doing any of that at the firewall level now?

289
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,360
The big one for us is actually just the ad blocker.

290
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,040
Just having AdGuard Home on there just cuts out so much stuff.

291
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,340
I will say we are completely spoiled.

292
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:44,500
Having been running on bonded cellular connections for the past couple of years, we actually

293
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,000
have cable internet plugged into the side of our RV.

294
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,680
So we're sitting on 400 meg cable internet right now.

295
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
Nice.

296
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,680
Yeah, that's a treat.

297
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
Yeah.

298
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,640
Yeah, the one nice thing about this spot we are in Tucson right now is we have pretty

299
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
dang good signal.

300
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,840
It's not like that good, but it's not wired good, but it's been pretty good.

301
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,280
So that's been nice because some points on this trip I have just had horrendously bad

302
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
signal.

303
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,980
It's amazing what you can actually still get done.

304
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,320
We actually found that in all our time boondocking around the Southwest, I think there was only

305
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,680
one spot we ended up in where we didn't have usable cellular internet.

306
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,400
And we sort of knew that going into it.

307
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,840
So we just made sure that all the work we had to do, we didn't need anything online.

308
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:34,480
But a big part of living in the RV is you find all of these challenges, I think, a lot

309
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,720
quicker than when you live in a house.

310
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
No kidding.

311
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Yeah.

312
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,200
And one of those is when I want to update our website, let's have a new Docker container

313
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,960
I want to push.

314
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,200
If you're sitting in an office, you think nothing of going Docker push and uploading

315
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,340
that image.

316
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,340
Of course.

317
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,340
Right.

318
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,720
I spent a long time optimizing ours so that it was pushing just the tiniest little delta

319
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,900
of that layer at the top that had to change.

320
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,960
And it was otherwise as static as possible.

321
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,560
And all these little things you find.

322
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
That's a great point.

323
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,040
Well, like, boy, sometimes updating Docker images takes frickin forever over cellular.

324
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,560
Like it's clearly not many people doing that.

325
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,760
Hey, Alex, hot, hot update here.

326
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,280
It looks like MQTT Explorer is available for Linux as an app image and a snap.

327
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,640
So you can get it on Linux and a Mac and the App Store and a DMG.

328
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
And of course, on Windows.

329
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,080
So I think I've spent more time nodding and smiling and looking impressed in the last

330
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,280
20 minutes than I have in the last 20 months.

331
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,080
Some seriously, seriously cool stuff.

332
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,720
I wonder how much we could apply to people's houses and make people more cognizant of the

333
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,500
energy they're using and maybe make that into some kind of sustainable movement.

334
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Really interesting.

335
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,820
So what's your favorite automation that you've done?

336
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,260
The untrippable breaker has probably been the most impactful day to day.

337
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,400
One of the ones that was so simple yet made a huge difference to our quality of life was

338
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,200
we have a GPS dongle that we have plugged into the Victron CCGX, which means the Victron

339
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,880
system is aware of the trailer's location at any point in time.

340
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,080
It can use that for some geofencing and things through the Victron software, through their

341
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
dashboard.

342
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,200
But once you then plug that GPS dongle in, it's then also exposing its data on the MQTT

343
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,800
broker, which means I can then collect that data with Node-RED.

344
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:36,320
And Home Assistant, about maybe 18 months or so ago, I guess, added a new service allowing

345
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,960
you to set the home location through the Home Assistant API.

346
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,440
So then as we're driving down the road, every 60 seconds, Node-RED will ping Home Assistant

347
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,440
and say, oh, by the way, we're now here.

348
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,240
And that way, as we cross time zones or state borders or whatever, Home Assistant always

349
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,080
has our latest information, schedules based on time or continue to work.

350
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,200
Yeah, that was a real simple one, but really worked well.

351
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,560
I know that's a problem you've been trying to solve, Chris, for some time now.

352
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,680
Yeah, it's so silly.

353
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,640
Here I am in Tucson right now, and my evening automation for lighting is based on the sunset

354
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,360
in the Pacific Northwest.

355
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,240
And I used to go in there and update it, but I just kind of stopped.

356
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,480
I just kind of said, screw it.

357
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,680
I'm done updating it.

358
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
It's close enough.

359
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,120
It's about an hour off.

360
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,040
I should totally look into that.

361
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,920
linode.com slash SSH.

362
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,640
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on your account and go there to support this show.

363
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,400
You know, Linode started in 2003 as one of the very first companies in cloud computing

364
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,200
before we called it cloud computing.

365
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,840
And now 18 years later, they haven't like launched a trillion different services.

366
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,080
They've remained focused in building out their core service.

367
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,560
Not only do they have the best servers in the business with incredible performance,

368
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,640
that's networking 11 data centers around the world, but they've added services that matter.

369
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,600
Things that impact the quality of your life, like DDoS protection, VLAN support, a powerful

370
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,000
DNS manager, and of course, block storage and S3 compatible object storage, which I

371
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,600
absolutely love.

372
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,000
But I know there's people, you know, like Alex, who like things like the Terraform support

373
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
and the Kubernetes support.

374
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

375
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,480
I'm sure that's great for some of you out there.

376
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
So shoot me.

377
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,560
But what I like about Linode is they have really just remained focused on building something

378
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,840
really great for those of us who want something fast and reliable, and then they back that

379
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,040
with the best customer support in the business, phone, ticket, email, even social.

380
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,520
They're going to take care of you.

381
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,080
And there's tons of one click deployments.

382
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,720
If you just want to get started with something, that can be a great way to learn.

383
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,440
You can also just DIY, which is often the way I prefer to go.

384
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,560
Or sometimes I'll do something in the middle where I'll deploy a base system that has just

385
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,640
the runtime for the container information, all installed, all that all that junk that

386
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
you'd normally have to set up.

387
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,160
And it has the right repos.

388
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,760
You're getting the right versions of the packages and the GPG keys, and it'll just build on

389
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
top of that.

390
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,260
And that takes like, I don't know, eight seconds to deploy.

391
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
It's pretty fast.

392
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
It's pretty amazing.

393
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,200
So go over to linode.com slash SSH, get that one hundred dollars, support the show and

394
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,840
see what we've been talking about.

395
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,000
Every time we're working on a project, we'll try something out on Linode real quick.

396
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,380
It's a great way to R&D stuff and, you know, that hundred dollars can help you do that

397
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,380
as well.

398
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,660
So you got to go check it out for yourself.

399
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,880
Take advantage of that one hundred dollars and see why Linode is better than the rest.

400
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:29,040
There's a lot of choices out there, but nobody does it like Linode, linode.com slash SSH.

401
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Right then.

402
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,080
So the ultimate conclusion of self-hosting, at least in my opinion, is probably to self

403
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,160
build, you know, a house or somewhere you're going to live, right?

404
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,840
Tell us a little bit about your plans, Matt, for the 40 acres in Vermont that you've just

405
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
bought.

406
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Yes.

407
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,440
So I am, like you, sort of a Brit here in the US.

408
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,600
And as we've been traveling around the US, we've been looking for where we might want

409
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,400
to live one day.

410
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,000
We don't have family in the US, so we're really free to kind of choose wherever it is we want

411
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,560
to live.

412
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,920
And we have spent a lot of time in a lot of different places.

413
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,320
We've eventually settled on Vermont as a place.

414
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:14,840
So about two or three months ago, we closed our sale or our purchase on 40 acres of completely

415
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,000
raw land in central Vermont.

416
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And when I say raw land, this is literally like trees and dirt.

417
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,480
There really is nothing there.

418
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,720
It's a hill with some trees on it.

419
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,000
You know, you can say, you can be honest, it's a hill with some trees on it.

420
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,340
It really is.

421
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,760
And there is not a lot there.

422
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,960
But when we went into this, we had some very specific requirements of what we wanted.

423
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,980
We didn't want to be in a city or a town, we wanted to be somewhere more rural.

424
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,440
And one of the things that made that requirement a little bit more challenging is we said a

425
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,240
must have is fiber internet.

426
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,640
So even though we're in the middle of nowhere in central Vermont, we will have 800 meg symmetric

427
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,000
fiber to the property.

428
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You bastard.

429
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Good for you, man.

430
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,480
Nice one, Dan.

431
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,880
In the woods with fiber, yes, please.

432
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,880
Yeah.

433
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,320
So we are now at the start of this journey.

434
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,380
Last week, we had a driveway put in we're building the house site about 1000 feet back

435
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,760
from the road.

436
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,320
And building that driveway was just beyond what what Diana and I could possibly take

437
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
on.

438
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
I don't know.

439
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,320
I've been watching your videos, dude.

440
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,280
You have been felling trees like a proper lumberjack.

441
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
Really impressive.

442
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,520
There's a lot of new skills that we're picking up.

443
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,640
It's it's kind of surreal to like today, I was out there with a chainsaw, working on

444
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,480
the property and then came home writing a blog post, compiling some stuff and working

445
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,000
on some some programming and some automations and things.

446
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,880
It's a very surreal kind of contrast, I guess, between the two two things.

447
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,320
What a cool existence there.

448
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,060
Yeah, we have a lot of fun doing it.

449
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:48,360
And how great that you have the RV there with you with all this stuff kind of done and now

450
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,160
taking care of itself so you can focus on other stuff.

451
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
Yeah, exactly.

452
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,680
And in many ways, this house that we want to build, it should probably go without saying

453
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,380
that we want to have a load of smart technology in there and things and obviously self host

454
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,480
a lot of things inside there.

455
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,680
The RV in many ways has been our test lab and still continues to be our test lab for

456
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,940
a lot of those things.

457
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,040
So even though we're running with just like one little Intel NUC and could serve that

458
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,720
all with like a little travel router and would probably be fine in here, we sort of push

459
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,020
the boundaries to learn some of the things we might need for the house.

460
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,480
The RV is staging.

461
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
It basically is.

462
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,080
Yeah, I'm sure you're already daydreaming of ideas for the new house, but this is something

463
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,360
you get to build from scratch.

464
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,460
So I imagine you're thinking Ethernet throughout your picture in a spot where you'll probably

465
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,460
run a server.

466
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,540
Walk us through a little bit of what you are now considering now that you've got a crack

467
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,480
to build something from scratch, even if it is a bit off.

468
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,600
I'm learning so much and I think the community around the self-hosted Discord and things

469
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,080
has been a fantastic resource already.

470
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,500
As I as I learn more, I keep evolving my plans.

471
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,520
But some of the things that I've picked up so far are things like if you want to run

472
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:03,240
your own hardware, there's usually a trade off of like heat and noise and cost and power

473
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,440
efficiency in these things.

474
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,320
We've learned so much about resource management in the RV.

475
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,760
We want to have a completely net zero house.

476
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,000
We're trying to build a passive house and hit the living building challenge, which are

477
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,560
a set of requirements that basically mean a very, very high quality, sustainable, comfortable

478
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
home.

479
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,000
So how do I now then host servers and things within that is kind of the challenge.

480
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,740
So one of the things that we're going to do because we're self-building, the priority

481
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,900
is to get utilities onto the property.

482
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,680
So electricity and fiber, bring those up the driveway.

483
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,620
Make sure we've got our solar and our batteries installed.

484
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,120
Bring the the well truck up and dig a well, all those sorts of things.

485
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,480
I love that water came after Internet.

486
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
I noticed that too.

487
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,840
Someone asked us a few days ago if we had a phone line at the property and I'm like,

488
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,040
I have no idea.

489
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
I have never checked.

490
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,040
No.

491
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,560
No, I would just say it's gone now.

492
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:04,280
But but no, so because we need to bring those things on and get them done quickly, most

493
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,400
people would put those in a basement.

494
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,840
But to have a basement implies you already got a house and we don't.

495
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,840
So we're actually going to build a separate standalone mechanical building.

496
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,680
Bring all of the utilities into there, which gives us this big advantage that we've then

497
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:24,880
got a separate building where noise and environmental controls can be tailored to whatever we want

498
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
inside.

499
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,760
And that's where we're going to run all of our servers and switches and all that kind

500
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
of stuff.

501
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,240
And it can be as loud as it wants to be.

502
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
Doesn't matter.

503
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,200
We can then have a separate building for that.

504
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Right.

505
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,640
With an Ethernet cable going to the house.

506
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,880
So that's where you're going to put all your solar batteries and inverters and electric

507
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,280
grid tie off points and...

508
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,400
Exactly.

509
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,000
So it'll have as much power as it needs.

510
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,160
We're thinking because the property is quite large, the distances between some of the buildings

511
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,960
could also therefore be quite large.

512
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,920
For example, we want to run cameras along the driveway.

513
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,960
We're sort of pushing the limits of what Ethernet can do.

514
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,260
So we're then probably going to run fiber as a backbone between the buildings and run

515
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,920
fiber from the road to the house site and then our own fibers back down to the road

516
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,440
and then tap in there.

517
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
Might as well.

518
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,600
Because at this stage, and if you're building this property in 2021, actually fiber does

519
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,880
seem like a pretty smart way to go.

520
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,640
It sort of future proofs it a bit.

521
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
Yeah, exactly.

522
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,920
And it's one of those things where we have a YouTube channel.

523
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,600
We're moving around big media files all the time.

524
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,280
And so having an ability to do that at greater than one gig speed is something that we would

525
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,240
actually really find valuable.

526
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,080
Can I rent some space in your mech room?

527
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,480
Yeah.

528
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,000
Forest data center colo hosting.

529
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,800
I can see it now.

530
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Vermont rural.

531
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Yeah.

532
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Yeah.

533
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
What are we calling it on Discord?

534
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
VT Rural?

535
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,680
That's pretty great.

536
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,400
That sounds like almost exactly, although at a larger scale and distance than what I

537
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,640
had envisioned.

538
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:05,060
My ultimate goal for our RV Lady Jubes would be to park her on a piece of property that

539
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:11,800
we've bought with a shed that has solar, it has the inverter, it has the batteries, maybe

540
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:17,960
it has a washer and dryer in it, and it has some on-premises servers that have been theoretically

541
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,920
sinking over Starlink or something with media ready to go or whatever.

542
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,200
And I love the idea of separating out the noisy stuff into its own building.

543
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,720
I mean, why not?

544
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,920
That's such a great way to go.

545
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,280
And so I imagine you're considering a whole new generation of home assistant build.

546
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,000
You're not going to take the one out of the RV.

547
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You're going to leave that.

548
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,120
And I would imagine a whole new build.

549
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
Yeah.

550
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,560
So this is an area now that I'm learning so much about.

551
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,480
The hardware side of running servers is pretty new to me.

552
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,880
And although I'm comfortable with the concepts, the specifics of exactly what to run is all

553
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,880
new.

554
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,040
But you actually touch on something there that's a real challenge that I'm battling

555
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
with.

556
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,880
The concept of self-hosting is that you have your own little private island of stuff.

557
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,560
It doesn't matter what goes on elsewhere, out in the cloud or whatever.

558
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,080
You are insulated from that because you have your own little private island.

559
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,560
Well, when we have a house, we sort of then have two islands.

560
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,200
You have things like, take Plex as an example.

561
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,680
Do I run Plex in the house, in the RV, both?

562
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,600
How do I sort of manage those things?

563
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Right.

564
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
In there.

565
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Yes.

566
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Yeah.

567
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
So that's an area for me that's, I think, really exciting.

568
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,080
There's some places where it's a huge asset, like backups, great.

569
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,400
I've now got a really easy way to do that.

570
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,080
But for things like media sharing, do I have two copies?

571
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,600
It becomes tricky.

572
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,360
And then there's the angle as well of, for you in particular, I think this will be a

573
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:54,760
unique challenge, is when you are driving around in your RV for potentially six months

574
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:01,360
and you're leaving the rural pad empty for six months, you want to make sure that that

575
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,360
stuff is reliable and has decent redundancy and all that kind of stuff.

576
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,420
And I think one of the things that I've heard you struggling with, you sort of brought up

577
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,040
on the Discord, is how good is good enough?

578
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,320
And do I need to have dual power supplies?

579
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,420
And how many SSDs do I need to put in RAID to make sure that that doesn't kick things

580
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,520
over and that kind of thing?

581
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,040
So there's a lot to consider.

582
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,720
And I'll add to that, Alex, lesson learned here.

583
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,120
I thought I had a fairly good setup.

584
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:38,240
And as I'm on the road at this point, my main server at the studio is offline, which does

585
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,920
a ton of lifting for me and then syncs the results to the RV.

586
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,320
And I feel like I'm operating with one hand tied behind my back while that server is down.

587
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,000
And now I'm running through my head of like, what am I going to do to rebuild that?

588
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,760
Because it really is a tricky problem.

589
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,880
And this is on a pretty nice actual server box.

590
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
It's a nice little box.

591
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:07,000
So the thing is, I don't think we really fully admit to ourselves just how much light tinkering

592
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,640
we do on the average week to these servers to keep them tended, to keep the leaves in

593
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,920
the correct space, to coin a gardening kind of analogy.

594
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,200
I probably SSH into my server just out of habit, at least once or twice a day.

595
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,640
I don't really know why sometimes.

596
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
I just do.

597
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
Yeah.

598
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:31,440
I mean, you touched on it there with the dual PSUs and I would just say, imagine the situation

599
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,400
where you don't have physical access to your server, nor would anybody else have physical

600
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,060
access to your server for three months.

601
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:43,740
How do you give yourself the best chance of being okay and everything working?

602
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,600
I've gone through exactly this this week, because as you both know, I'm going back to

603
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,760
England at the weekend.

604
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,160
It will be probably the day after this airs actually.

605
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:58,400
And the server that lives in England for me has been running on an old super micro board

606
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,320
with a Java based IPMI KVM built in.

607
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,680
Works okay, but I prefer it was a little more modern, that kind of stuff.

608
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,600
And I thought to myself, could I just make do by taking a Raspberry Pi 4 over there and

609
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,040
put Pi KVM on it?

610
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:20,520
And I'm like, no, actually, I need this to be 100% as close as is possible, reliable.

611
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,440
Because the last thing I want to do is have to call my dad up and say, Hey, can you go

612
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,480
and push this widget into this particular orifice?

613
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,940
And you know, wave your hands at three o'clock on Sunday, you know, and make it work.

614
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,600
So I've bought, I've bought a new ASRock board, which is I've written a blog post about which

615
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,160
I'll put a link to in the show notes.

616
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,000
I think that might be the perfect media server motherboard for me moving forward.

617
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
We'll see.

618
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,640
But it's that there's just so much to consider.

619
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:53,100
And I think you have to get to a point where you're like, okay, I'm willing to risk a single

620
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,280
power supply in this system.

621
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,040
If that goes boom, okay.

622
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
What's my plan B?

623
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:05,800
You know, my plan B might be Linode, something like that with some ZFS data sets replicated

624
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,200
or something like that.

625
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,960
It's too bad about the Pi KVM though, because that was one of my thoughts was if I had Pi

626
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,160
KVM at the studio, I could at least see what's going on on the console right now.

627
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,760
But I really an IPMI system would be better.

628
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,880
I was actually thinking, although I don't really know how to pull it off is like a redundant

629
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,540
Pi KVM system or a redundant Pi system for WireGuard.

630
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:32,520
When I'm back, when I do get back to Washington, addressing that redundancy is one of my to

631
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,200
do items because I know exactly what you mean, Matt.

632
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,400
It's like I'm sort of helpless down here in Tucson when the server is up in Seattle.

633
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,440
Yeah, I mean, one of the technologies I've been researching and playing with some more

634
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,560
recently is Karp.

635
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,920
So this gives you essentially the ability to have two devices that can fight between

636
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,200
themselves, let's say, for an IP address on the network.

637
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,260
So OpenSense supports this out of the box.

638
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,880
You can run two separate machines with OpenSense on.

639
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,080
And if one of them dies, the other will automatically kind of pick up and run with that.

640
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,580
And maybe there's a similar thing you can do with Raspberry Pis with other services.

641
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,240
You can have essentially a redundant Raspberry Pi sitting there idle.

642
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,680
And if the first one drops off the network for any reason or just doesn't respond, the

643
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,920
second one would pick up.

644
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,000
Don't you got this vision of two fish flopping around on the deck fighting each other?

645
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Right.

646
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,040
Might be fun.

647
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,040
That could be good to watch.

648
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,240
Well, Matt, there's so many things we could talk about, but we should probably leave some

649
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,760
of it for your YouTube channel.

650
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,240
But thank you for coming on the show today and chatting with us about some of this.

651
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,040
And best of luck to you and the wife building your new home.

652
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,760
I think it's going to be quite the project to watch.

653
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
Thank you so much.

654
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Yeah.

655
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,160
I'm looking forward to learning a lot more.

656
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,360
And I've been binging all of the podcasts recently.
