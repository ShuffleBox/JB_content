1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You're now listening to Chris and the Badger, a presentation of the self-hosted podcast

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
with Chris.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,600
A lot of options out there, but you can use this stack.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,600
I've tested this.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,760
I've refined it over the years.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,760
And Alex.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,840
I don't think there's a better solution really if you're willing to put the effort in.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:26,440
And featuring special guests, Morgan the Doorbell Guy, Wes Payne, an RV, JDM, what?

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,280
Jonathan, hang on a sec, this goes on for a while.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:40,440
Geerling and your hosts who are celebrating episode, oh, come on, alright.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
And Jeff Geerling.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,440
Okay.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
Now your host.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,760
Snap Raid and Merger FS and I endorse this media server build here.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,640
Celebrating episode number 50, a long-term relationship with something.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,000
What else could I do with it?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,200
And that single spark is a huge rabbit hole.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,440
Chris and Alex.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,160
Well welcome to episode 50 everybody.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,640
I hope you liked our special intro to celebrate the 50th episode.

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,720
Yeah, that's great.

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,160
Congratulations Alex to episode 50 and thank you to, oh yeah, in our Discord for making

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,680
that awesome intro.

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,820
Now he's got to make a special edition show themes all the time.

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,640
That was amazing.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,880
And it's here Alex, 50 episodes and it takes a while when you're doing them only twice

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
a month.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,360
It's been a long haul.

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
Yeah, 50, huh?

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,040
It means, what, nearly two years of doing this with you and to celebrate we've actually

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,380
got some merch available for the first time.

32
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,080
This really was all really driven by Alex.

33
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,360
He wanted to see this done.

34
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,520
Of course I wanted to see it too, but Alex really took the lead and made sure we got

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,340
something special for you guys for episode 50.

36
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,080
We have it up at JupiterGarage.com.

37
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,380
We've got a couple of special shirts, a Chris and the Badger shirt and a self-hosted logo

38
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,520
shirt if you'd like that.

39
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,720
And we also have a couple of exclusive stickers, a self-hosted square sticker and of course

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,680
a Chris and the Badger sticker, which would look great on your machine, I got to say.

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,840
Yeah, I think it would too.

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,160
I mean, I think it was when Drew, who's our editor sent me a little electronics project

43
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,580
full of parts and it said to the Badger on the corner, I was like, ah, we need to lean

44
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,840
into this a bit more, don't we?

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,240
Yeah, we are leaning into it.

46
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,600
I think with episode 50, we're just like, we're doing it.

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
We're doing it.

48
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,740
And it's because, you know, people kind of came together and helped us make it special.

49
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,960
So that's up there right now.

50
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,720
And if you are a self-hosted SRE, one of our members, then check out the post show and

51
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,800
check out your member feed.

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,280
We will have a special promo code for you to take a little bit off the gear, but it's

53
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,040
all actually at a really great price right now.

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,360
We're basically running it pretty close to cost as it is because we just wanted to have

55
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,520
something special out there for episode 50.

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,960
So all of it is up at JupiterGarage.com.

57
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,640
If I could just take a moment to interject and just say a huge thank you personally to

58
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,760
all of you for listening to all these episodes.

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,040
It's a real privilege to do this show with you, Chris, but also be able to present to

60
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,960
the audience that we have who engage on Discord so well and on Twitter and all that kind of

61
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
stuff as well.

62
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,000
So it's been a huge privilege for me and a big, big thank you.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,880
And we want to say thank you to A Cloud Guru, the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux

64
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,320
and other modern tech skills.

65
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,920
They have hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,360
So go get certified, get hired and get learning at ACloudGuru.com.

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,720
I'd imagine that you're still rebuilding from the great flood of a few weeks ago.

68
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,820
How's that going?

69
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,320
It is indeed an ongoing process, Alex.

70
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,520
We'll just say that, I guess.

71
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,120
I actually did pick up a couple of quick tips that I'll share in a bit in the show from

72
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
this entire experience.

73
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,480
So I guess there's a bit of a silver lining there to it, but I haven't replaced everything.

74
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,680
I have successfully saved a couple of items.

75
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,380
So that's awesome.

76
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,680
But for the most part, I'd say like 90% of everything was a loss.

77
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Damn.

78
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,400
I mean, I hope you had insurance.

79
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,040
Well some of it's just old gear, you know, some of it's just old stuff like chargers

80
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
and whatnot.

81
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,760
I suppose I could probably try to do the insurance thing.

82
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,620
I have a box in the attic full of old English for some reason.

83
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,120
They made it across the channel, ocean.

84
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,320
I have a box full of English power adapters.

85
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,840
And so they're the sort of things that just hang around forever.

86
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,420
So maybe it's a good thing that you doused them all with, you know, 17 gallons worth

87
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,420
of water.

88
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,520
And I do need to kind of like change up my charging situation because see what I got

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,980
going in this area is a charging station, you could say, for all of the kids iPads and

90
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,320
switches and controllers.

91
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,880
And so this whole situation's actually inspired the wife and I to cap the water pipes at that

92
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,120
area, remove the faucet completely.

93
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,260
And then after we get back on the impending Denver road trip, we're going to build a shelving

94
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,620
system in there where the kids can slide their devices in the shelves and they'll have power

95
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,620
cords pre-run.

96
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,020
So the whole, the whole incident's actually inspired us to really kind of up our game

97
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,820
instead of just having like this loose area where we stash stuff near a sink.

98
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,240
But it just took the disaster to kick our butts into gear, I guess.

99
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,780
You know, one of these days I might convince you to get a 3D printer and custom print the

100
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,540
right size inserts for the devices.

101
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,100
There's been a couple of fixes and a couple of projects for this road trip a couple of

102
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,400
times now because this is one of the bigger trips because we're going to be on the road

103
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,820
for probably about 40 days straight.

104
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,740
If you think about that in terms of just wear and tear on a vehicle and the house box that

105
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,800
is running on top of that vehicle, that's a lot.

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,380
And so there's been a lot of things we're doing to prepare for it.

107
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,580
And I've thought a couple of times, a few things I'm replacing, like trying to get a

108
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,620
magnet on my door so that lines up with the sensor and trying to just position that magnet

109
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,620
just right.

110
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,420
If I could have built a little 3D housing for that, to just position it where I needed

111
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,940
it, it would have been job done.

112
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,740
It's on my mind.

113
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,740
It may happen.

114
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,580
You have a few options of cheap 3D printers.

115
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,860
I mean, there's a Prusa one that's the Prusa mini, it's about 400 bucks delivered.

116
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,020
I could make some, Creality makes some as well, but I had bad experiences with the Chineseium

117
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,020
printers.

118
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,300
And personally, I'm a huge fan boy of Prusa because they open source everything and nine

119
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,140
times out of 10, the print just works, which is what I'm in 3D printing for.

120
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,420
I'm not really in it to tinker and 3D print new parts for my printer.

121
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,820
I want to print cool stuff.

122
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,940
I just figured I'd wait for you to upgrade your current rig and then I'd buy this one

123
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
off you used.

124
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,100
That does tend to happen.

125
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Yeah.

126
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,100
We'll see.

127
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,100
We'll see.

128
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
But we will be in Denver soon.

129
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
We're going to have a meetup.

130
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,260
Alex is going to be there running trivia night.

131
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,540
So go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

132
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,100
I think it's August 20th, a Friday that we're going to be in Denver doing the meetup.

133
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,060
There's also a meetup coming up in Salt Lake City.

134
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,060
Just only I will be there.

135
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,180
Alex won't be making it to that one, but details for that are at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

136
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,340
It's going to be weird getting on a plane, I'll tell you that.

137
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,500
How long of a flight is it to Denver for you guys?

138
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,820
About three or four hours, I think.

139
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,060
It really is just the perfect midpoint between you and me, isn't it?

140
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,740
It's like right there smack dab in the middle.

141
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
Yeah.

142
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,880
It's either that or the middle of Arkansas.

143
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,780
Most of the crew is flying out with the exception of myself, of course my wife and Brent.

144
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:23,060
Brent, you know, from Brunch with Brent is flying into Seattle and then he is going to

145
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,820
caravan out with the family and I in Lady Jubes.

146
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,140
Oh, I'm so jealous.

147
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,100
Brent is a precious resource that we have to share out carefully.

148
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,100
We do.

149
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,100
Yeah.

150
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
Yeah.

151
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,380
Well, he'll have his fill of us, I think, by the time we're in.

152
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,740
I mean, you know, it's actually going to be pretty great.

153
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,740
The kids are excited.

154
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,660
This is going to totally, this is going to enshrine him as Uncle Brent at the end of

155
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,740
this road trip, you know, so that'll be pretty great and I'm really looking forward to it.

156
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,260
Well, I'm extremely jealous of that and I hope you have a great time on the road.

157
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,180
I've always wanted to do Salt Lake City.

158
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,620
I never quite made it that far north in Utah.

159
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,180
We did Arches and Dead Horse State Park and that kind of stuff near Moab a couple of years

160
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,180
ago.

161
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,180
That was amazing.

162
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,260
If you're ever in that area, amazing, amazing stuff.

163
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,260
Absolutely love it.

164
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,260
Totally.

165
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,260
You're absolutely right.

166
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,260
It's like another world.

167
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,460
It feels like you're on a set of Star Trek when you're in Moab.

168
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,460
Mars.

169
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,460
You know, Salt Lake City was a promise I made to the audience because it's not like exactly

170
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,900
on our way to Denver, but I made a promise to the audience that when we could, we'd return

171
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,720
to Salt Lake City because we had to skip it.

172
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,300
We had a whole thing planned and we had to skip it.

173
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,420
So this is making good on a promise to the audience in Salt Lake City.

174
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:36,140
Perhaps this is an entirely gross misrepresentation of Salt Lake City, but it's kind of colored

175
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:42,260
to me by the Book of Mormon, if you've seen that.

176
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,780
I mean, you know, it actually just sort of tangentially related to that.

177
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,260
When we were trying to book a venue, we had to listen to a whole bunch of rules about

178
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,340
alcohol that we have never had to sit through from any other state.

179
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,340
It's a thing.

180
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,340
It's a thing.

181
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,180
Well, when you've had one too many beers after a meetup, the last thing you want is to be

182
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,380
fumbling around for a phone in your pocket or trying to remember what voice command you

183
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,180
programmed into the lady cylinder this week.

184
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,500
Have you got a solution to that?

185
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,200
I had a fire tablet that worked pretty well before it got water destroyed because it fell

186
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
out.

187
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
It was off the wall.

188
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
It fell into the water bath.

189
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,380
But also, you know, Brent's going to be on board and he doesn't know all those special

190
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,860
commands, and he's going to want to control things.

191
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,300
So I wanted to get that tablet on the wall replaced, which runs my home assistant dashboard

192
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,660
24-7 because it makes it easier for the family and it makes it easier for guests.

193
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,820
And yeah, it makes it easier when you just can't remember what, you know, what did I

194
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,140
call that group of lights again?

195
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,100
I can't remember.

196
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:46,260
So out of a bit of, I'd say maybe laziness, and out of a bit of budget concerns, I've

197
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,380
been picking up the Amazon Fire tablets.

198
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,580
And I don't really want to invest in a system where I need to reflash these things.

199
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,780
It's not that I'm against it.

200
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,660
I used to love doing that.

201
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,740
It's just kind of, it crosses an effort line for me that I'm willing to put into this kind

202
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
of device.

203
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,100
Beyond that, I'd rather just get like a used iPad.

204
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,580
Well, we talked a little bit about flashing lineage on to my old Kindle Fire a little

205
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,580
while ago.

206
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,580
Right.

207
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,500
And for me, it's just not quite worth the effort.

208
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,700
The tablets kind of suck already.

209
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,540
And so if I have to do all this extra work, it kind of like loses the value for me a little

210
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,540
bit.

211
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,900
I wanted to see if I could find a nice sweet spot where I could still pick up a Fire tablet

212
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,620
for a great price off of Amazon and then just easily and quickly modify it for my needs,

213
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,060
which is mount it to a wall and run home assistant dashboard all day.

214
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,860
And so a couple of projects that I found made it exactly what I was shooting for that kind

215
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,140
of like that sweet spot in the middle.

216
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,220
And I picked up a 10 inch Amazon Fire tablet.

217
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,580
I opted to go for the ad free one because again, I'm not going to reflash this thing.

218
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,160
But if you were going to reflash the thing, you could, you could save a few bucks and

219
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,580
you could get the version that comes with ads on the lock screen, which is so obnoxious.

220
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,320
In fact, I've bought the no ads version in the past and still received the version that

221
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,220
comes with the ad so I could totally understand if you wanted to reflash it.

222
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,300
But I that wasn't what I wanted to do.

223
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,180
I wanted to use this app that I found called wall panel.

224
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,220
It's an Android application for web based dashboards, like home assistant, like that's

225
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,280
what's in a lot of their screenshots.

226
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,320
And you could sideload it if you want.

227
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,060
But they've also submitted wall panel to the Google Play Store and to the Amazon App Store,

228
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,180
which means it makes it stupid easy to get it up and going on a Fire tablet.

229
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,660
It has really great fast camera motion detection to so now what I can do is sleep my screen.

230
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,860
And then when the front facing camera detects motion, it wakes the screen up.

231
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,660
And that's actually surprisingly handy.

232
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,320
You approach the tablet and as you're approaching it, the screen just becomes available.

233
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,900
And then I have it set to like a three minute sleep window.

234
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,960
You can have a pin code option in there to kind of lock the screen out if you don't want

235
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,300
to just give anyone access to your dashboard.

236
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,000
And with the ease of access and installing this thing and the power options for keeping

237
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,280
the screen awake and all that kind of stuff, it gets me 90% of the way there with a stock

238
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,860
Amazon Fire tablet.

239
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,860
So it's wall panel.

240
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,800
I'll have a link in the show notes for that.

241
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,560
So what if I did want to reflash it or tinker with it?

242
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,720
What can I do there?

243
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,580
There are a couple of options there.

244
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,740
The one that I think I'd recommend like the next step up from wall panel.

245
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,900
You may have seen this over at the XDA forums, it's called the Amazon Fire Toolbox.

246
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:31,160
And this uses the Android debug bridge to apply tweaks to the Fire tablet from completely

247
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,860
reflashing them to just doing things like maybe installing Google Play, or removing

248
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,420
some of Amazon's annoying software that's on there to just completely replacing the

249
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,020
version of Android if you like.

250
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:49,080
The downside is you got to use Windows and I just don't really have access to a Windows

251
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
machine.

252
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,400
It's a basic app.

253
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,840
They say they're going to work on Linux support, but Datastream33 who kind of hangs out over

254
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,700
the XDA forums, he's a senior member over there.

255
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,300
It's his project or their project and they're a Windows user right now.

256
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,580
So they're making it for Windows.

257
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,200
So it's not really something that I have quick access to.

258
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,460
But the idea is you plug your Fire tablet into your Windows box, you load this toolbox

259
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,760
up and then it gives you a GUI with a bunch of options in there that just kind of can

260
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,700
go in there and lobotomize the Amazon stuff out of the tablet if you want and give it

261
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,180
actual genuine Google Play Store APIs.

262
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,380
Who doesn't want to lobotomize a tablet, huh?

263
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,340
Well, I mean, have you seen the neg where they put on these things?

264
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,280
They want you to buy everything that Amazon makes and they want to turn it into an Alexa

265
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,820
and they also want you to turn it into an Audible station and they also want you to

266
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,720
turn it into a Prime streaming machine and they put all this stuff all over it.

267
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,860
And I just want it to run one single app.

268
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,660
You know, I was worried about this kind of thing because in days past you had to root

269
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,300
things and reflash bootloaders and that kind of stuff.

270
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,740
And I read a long time ago that warranty claims were refused if people had done modifications

271
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,740
like this to these ad supported devices.

272
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,080
Is that still the case now?

273
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,620
So the nice thing about the toolbox that we were just talking about from XDA, that's not

274
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,580
messing with like the system restore partition on your fire tablet.

275
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,080
So you could go in there and like lobotomize the Amazon stuff out of the image.

276
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,860
And then if you needed to reset it to factory defaults and it just restores it to a stock

277
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
fire tablet.

278
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,620
So your warranty is good if you just did that before you sent it in.

279
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,620
Yeah, that makes sense.

280
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,980
I mean, it's just software, isn't it?

281
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:38,180
I mean, unless there's like an intrusion detection in the firmware, I don't see how they'd ever

282
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,180
know.

283
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,620
Well, yeah, they could do that, I suppose, but thankfully they're not.

284
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,860
But that's where wall panel is kind of this nice starting point.

285
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,400
And you could just start with that for these on wall dashboard.

286
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,180
This is, I think, such a great way to make home automation more accessible to your family

287
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,740
is a visual way for them to control things.

288
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,540
And with the home assistant dashboard setup, you could make something really appealing

289
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,300
to people and it renders really great on a 10 inch tablet.

290
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,840
And wall panel has an option to turn on by default when the tablet boots.

291
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:14,060
So it kind of just launches immediately and kind of papers over all that Amazon stuff.

292
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,660
And it really gets you like 90 percent of the way there.

293
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
Super quick.

294
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
What's the last 10 percent?

295
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,300
I think the last 10 percent would be replacing the OS, you know, because then you could put

296
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:29,900
something a little more modern on there because Amazon's fire Android OS space is often behind

297
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
mainline Android.

298
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,820
Well, yeah, I mean, I saw today just in the J.B. Telegram chat that people were talking

299
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:40,220
about the I think it's like a 12 year old Kindle is getting Internet access revoked

300
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,420
or something by Amazon, turning it into a waste essentially.

301
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,680
You know, that's a tricky one.

302
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,500
The cellular networks eventually get shut down.

303
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,700
I think things like on the 3G network or something, right, because it's it's pretty old.

304
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,180
I mean, yeah, eventually they got to shut down the network.

305
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,660
But that's it really kind of does make you think like if you want something to last a

306
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:04,540
really, really long time, you've got to look at ways of self-hosting it.

307
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,260
And maybe some some devices just aren't aren't the right fit, although you could argue 12

308
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,900
years is a pretty good value proposition when you consider new Kindles are like 100 bucks.

309
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,380
Like back then, those Kindles were not that cheap, but new Kindles are a lot cheaper.

310
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,780
Well, very good.

311
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,980
I think next time there's a Black Friday sale or some kind of Amazon invented Prime Day

312
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,180
thing, I might pick up a Fire tablet and just give that a go.

313
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,940
The one that I flash with Lineage a little while ago has been doing perfect duty, actually,

314
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:38,500
because we've been using one of the Wyze Cam V3s with that Lineage OS 7 inch Fire tablet

315
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:44,220
from half a decade plus ago as our baby monitor, and it's been working brilliantly well.

316
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,180
So you can breathe new life into old dogs with this stuff.

317
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,660
As part of the episode 50 festivities, I wanted to complete a project that I've been kind

318
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,620
of working on in the evenings off and on over the last six months or so, which was a searchable

319
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,380
archive of our show notes.

320
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:09,780
And a huge thanks goes out to the orange one from Discord who rewrote, I think, something

321
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:17,780
like all but three lines of my code to scrape the Flyerside website and ingest the HTML

322
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:25,100
and the XML feeds and spit out what eventually turns out to be an MKDocs based searchable

323
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,260
archive of the entire Jupiter broadcasting suite of shows.

324
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,260
That's so great.

325
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,980
I feel like he kept those three lines of code in there just to be nice to you.

326
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,740
But it's so quick and snappy, and it makes it really quick to find stuff that eventually

327
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,780
this is going to get integrated into the site itself.

328
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,620
But for right now, it's just a great way to like, I know we talked about something.

329
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,980
When did we talk about it?

330
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,180
Like it's good for that kind of stuff.

331
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,580
I can't tell you how many times a week I get pinged with, when did you talk about X or

332
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,580
when did you?

333
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,580
Yeah.

334
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,700
You know, great example is the Lineage flashing of the 7 inch Fire tablet.

335
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,980
As we were talking just then, I just typed into the search bar LineageOS and boom, up

336
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,940
came episode 44 of Self-Hosted.

337
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,940
There we go.

338
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,940
Job done.

339
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,940
So it's already working for me.

340
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,180
Now you can find this thing at notes.jupitabroadcasting.com.

341
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:21,740
We've got Coder Radio, Jupiter Extras, Linux Action News, Linux Unplugged, and of course

342
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,780
this here Self-Hosted podcast.

343
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,780
All right.

344
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,940
Well, this is the Self-Hosted show.

345
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,900
So you got to tell us a little bit about how you set it up and what's running.

346
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,300
Well, one of the coolest things that Orange managed to do was dynamic theming between

347
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,300
the different shows.

348
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,780
So I don't know if you're on the site right now, but if you click between the different

349
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,140
shows, you'll notice the top header changes.

350
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,020
So Self-Hosted is orange, Coder Radio.

351
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,020
I do like that.

352
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
Yeah.

353
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,020
That's so cool.

354
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,900
Linux Action News is red.

355
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,140
It's all backed by MKDocs and he's done a bit of dynamic CSS switching between the different

356
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,080
tabs, which is pretty cool.

357
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,520
But what we're doing is we scrape all of the show information that's on Fireside and we

358
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,620
use Fireside as our podcasting publishing platform and we use that as a source of truth.

359
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:13,460
And this Python script then takes that scraped data, uses what's called a Ginger 2 template

360
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:19,580
to substitute things like the tags in there, the hosts, any of the links that we put in

361
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,580
the episodes, that kind of thing, and it spits out a plain markdown file.

362
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:31,060
MKDocs then ingests that plain markdown file and bada bing, bada boom, we have an MKDocs

363
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
site.

364
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,060
Very nice.

365
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,700
But we are relying on a small element of non-self-hosted software.

366
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,860
We're using GitHub Actions and we're running it through a con job.

367
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,720
So at five or six a.m. every day, it just goes and scrapes the JB site.

368
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,620
So you'll see that these show notes are getting automatically updated.

369
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,220
This website gets automatically updated every day.

370
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,380
So it's never out of date.

371
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,280
Linode.com slash SSH.

372
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,100
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit towards a new account and you go there to support

373
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
the show.

374
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,920
So it's Linode.com slash SSH.

375
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,380
And yeah, of course, notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com is running on Linode.

376
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,300
Everything we build that we want the audience to be able to use, we host that on Linode

377
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,080
because their infrastructure is killer.

378
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,820
And the price is great, too.

379
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,560
In fact, Linode is 30 to 50 percent less than the other big hyperscalers out there.

380
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,540
And they've been around since 2003 doing this.

381
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:34,220
So for 18 years, they have remained focused on building out the greatest cloud that you

382
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,380
could possibly ever want as a Linux geek.

383
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,380
I mean, it's like a playground.

384
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,820
I go up there and sometimes when I just want to try out a couple of different projects

385
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,620
for talking about on the show, like, how do you know if something is worth proceeding

386
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,620
with?

387
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,860
How do you know if it's going to work for you when you're building out something like

388
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,860
you have a project?

389
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,260
Like, how do you know if this is the stack you want to use?

390
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,660
Well, I deploy it on Linode often with some of their one-click deployments.

391
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,940
And I'll test it out and I'll run it for a couple of days and see how it works.

392
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,420
And often, I keep one out of two or three things and that eventually turns into a show.

393
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,340
And then we create a project around it and we end up putting it in production.

394
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,540
And the entire time from beginning to end, we're doing it all with Linode because they

395
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,640
just make it simple, it's affordable, and it's easy to work with the team too.

396
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,460
And then on top of that, they have a really handy API that you can either use directly

397
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,220
yourself dramatically or do like I do and just kind of take the lazy route and use their

398
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,100
command line client.

399
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,940
So I'll do this to like pop a file up on their S3 compatible object storage and I can market

400
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,580
public and generate the URL in like three or four seconds.

401
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,580
And this is awesome when we're trying to get clips ready for a show or something like that

402
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,940
or we're collaborating on a project or recently, I sent a big batch of files to somebody and

403
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,940
we were going back and forth like, how are we going to even share this file?

404
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,180
I'm like, hold on a second here, I'll get you a little zip file with the URL.

405
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,380
I did that with a video of my daughter the other day that was like 170 meg to a parent

406
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,660
and Telegram was like, nope.

407
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,180
So I just used the object storage and it worked great.

408
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,180
Yeah.

409
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,980
And the command line client is like the pro way to get things up there because what I

410
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:11,620
do cause I'm such a nerd is I have a awake dropdown terminal where it's always like in

411
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,620
one of the tabs.

412
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,880
So it's like up, up, change a couple of things, hit enter.

413
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,040
It's great.

414
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,140
But on top of that, they've got cloud firewalls, they've got VLAN support, they have a really

415
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,980
powerful DNS manager.

416
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,700
They're beginning to roll out bare metal servers and they also work with infrastructure management.

417
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,700
So if you want to plug in with Kubernetes and Terraform, maybe you want to even just

418
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,060
use Linode as part of a multi-cloud strategy.

419
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
They're great for that too.

420
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:40,740
But 66% of companies will save money working with a mix of alternative cloud providers instead

421
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,900
of just relying on like one big hyperscaler.

422
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,220
So it's worth just looking into that.

423
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,020
Linode could be part of your multi-cloud strategy.

424
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,440
And if you ever run into any trouble, you ever need any help, they've got the best customer

425
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,340
service in the business.

426
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,580
And when your business is running on Linode, it's nice to know that's available.

427
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,300
And their support for the community runs deep.

428
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,040
They're making it possible for our team to get together in Denver.

429
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,440
They're making the whole road trip possible.

430
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
That's pretty awesome.

431
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,260
And not only that, but they're going to be bringing swag and giveaways like raspberry

432
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,980
pies and all kinds of awesome shirts they've made just for the trip.

433
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,340
It's just going to be a whole party made possible by Linode.

434
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,460
And they're doing that just to have a chance to connect because like us, they miss seeing

435
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,460
people.

436
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,460
It's been a while.

437
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,140
And Linode has been so enthusiastic about supporting our reunion.

438
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,500
But there's so many things I could go on about, you just got to go check it out for yourself.

439
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,320
You got to get your hands on it and see it.

440
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:42,260
So go use that $100, maybe learn something and support the show, linode.com slash SSH.

441
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:49,220
Now I came across a thread on Reddit a couple of weeks ago that Sure, who's an ISP in Canada,

442
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:54,620
was blocking Plex because it thought it was suspicious, which tingled my spidey sense

443
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,060
a little bit.

444
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,280
Because I often tell people that I share my Plex server with that the ISPs don't care.

445
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,240
It's all just encrypted traffic.

446
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,340
They have no idea what is going on, right?

447
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,980
And so I dug into it a little bit and one of the comments has some really interesting

448
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,120
information about how the Plex web app works, which I thought might be interesting to share

449
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,640
with you all.

450
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:22,140
Now Sure Protected Browsing uses a service called Zvelo, which happens to flag app.plex.tv.

451
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,640
And the way that the Plex app works in your web browser is it downloads the code to the

452
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,460
browser and then runs it locally.

453
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:36,740
So if you can't access or the web URL is blocked by an ad blocker or some kind of safe browsing

454
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,140
plugin, it just can't download the code and you can't run it.

455
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:48,860
And because of this, it could affect things running a web app on a TV, for example, might

456
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,860
suffer the same fate.

457
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:55,860
And I just thought it was really interesting that these apps aren't local, they're not

458
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:01,880
locally rendered, which is why when Plex update their UI, you don't have to download anything.

459
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,260
It just automatically happens.

460
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:11,200
Plex clients for Android, Android TV, iOS, TVOS, et cetera, aren't affected because they

461
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,520
are full versions of the app.

462
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:20,760
So if you have a smart TV or hosted Plex web app.plex.tv, you're probably going to want

463
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:27,020
to find a way to route it around something like Zvelo, which is what Shure uses to avoid

464
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,280
this issue.

465
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,140
It's hard to not be skeptical, safe browsing, that just sounds like they're trying to reduce

466
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,100
load on their network, doesn't it?

467
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,740
Or perhaps encourage people to sign up for streaming packages.

468
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:47,380
I absolutely find it abhorrent that Verizon or AT&T, they all do it here, have different

469
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:53,540
quality profiles of Netflix videos or YouTube videos and they lock you into certain quality

470
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:58,020
profiles unless you pay them more money.

471
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,660
This is one of the reasons I decided to set up my PEP Wave with their Fusion Hub VPN solution

472
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:08,580
because it routes my traffic through a VPN and they can't tell what it is and so they

473
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:14,900
don't re-encode the video for me or actually what AT&T does, each provider does a little

474
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,900
bit differently.

475
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,420
And AT&T is particularly frustrating because they just sort of brute force it so that way

476
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,820
the YouTube client and the Netflix client, they just sit there and bang their head against

477
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,660
the video streaming service asking for the best quality and it keeps failing and failing

478
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,920
and failing.

479
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,700
And then when the client finally to say, okay, fine, I'll go down to the next lower quality,

480
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,700
it tries that, that fails.

481
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,940
And then when it finally goes down to 480p, then it plays.

482
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:45,340
So you just sit there waiting while your carrier is blocking these connections.

483
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,400
You wait with your little spinner on the screen.

484
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
It's so frustrating.

485
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,540
And to see Shaw do this for Plex, it really, it stinks.

486
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,100
It stinks because the reality is they know what's going on over that Plex port.

487
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,940
They know it's not some sort of attack or some sort of weird malware.

488
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,180
They know it's video streaming.

489
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,400
And my reading of the law is the copyright violation really happens when you download

490
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,780
the file.

491
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,700
I think, I don't know, I could be wrong if anybody wants to let me know in a clear, explain

492
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,380
it to me like I'm a five-year-old way, cellphones.show.com, but my understanding is you're not actually

493
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,460
violating copyright.

494
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,560
If you stream it, that can't be right.

495
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:29,500
But either way, I don't know how Plex scoots around that particular issue, but regardless,

496
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,700
it's not Shaw's place to enforce copyright law.

497
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,540
It's just not, or, or IP law.

498
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,900
It's just, they should just be passing the bits.

499
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,900
Yeah.

500
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,180
I don't expect my water company to choose which bits of water I get.

501
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,180
Yeah.

502
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,740
Although you do want them to keep the bad stuff out of the water.

503
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,900
So that might be a bad analogy.

504
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,660
I know Alex, you are, you are very organized compared to me in your Plex collection.

505
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,300
Like you have collections for everything.

506
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,500
You've got nice consistent album art.

507
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,220
Like at some point in time, you must've just sat back, had a drink and spent like hours

508
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,500
organizing all of your metadata.

509
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,860
Well, I am now.

510
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:12,360
This week I've found possibly my new favorite Plex pick of the year, Plex Metamanager.

511
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,000
This is a Python script and it is awesome.

512
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,940
So this thing will go through using the Plex API of your local Plex server.

513
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:26,260
It uses the token that you can generate by going to view XML and get the little token

514
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,260
from up the address bar.

515
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:37,620
And what it will do is it will basically match the TMDB ID of the movie against a list of

516
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,700
different collections.

517
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:44,620
So it's built me in my Plex library, for example, a bunch of different collections based on

518
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,620
genres.

519
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,620
Okay.

520
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,620
Yes, I already had genre filtering, but this is using Plex's smart search.

521
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,620
It's just really cool.

522
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,820
You've got to go check it out.

523
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:59,260
I've got now a nineties, a noughties, a tensies, a twenties collection in my Plex library as

524
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,640
well.

525
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,460
It's just really, really cool.

526
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,980
But what got me looking at this in the first place was my wife and I were browsing through,

527
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,500
I've got about a thousand movies or so on my server.

528
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,220
And we were just browsing through the other night saying, what should we watch?

529
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:18,420
And neither of us could come to any kind of agreement about what we should watch.

530
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,860
I know it's so true.

531
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:25,820
Well, first of all, why don't I have a bunch of collections of stuff that's recently added

532
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:32,140
is one thing that Plex does out of the box, but there's no real kind of trending kind

533
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:37,420
of collection like there is through the Plex meta manager, like a Netflix or Amazon prime

534
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,420
would give me.

535
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:43,260
And with this, I'm able to sort of say, Oh, Hey, yeah, that, that new Wonder Woman movie.

536
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
Okay, cool.

537
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,220
I could go and watch that tonight.

538
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,940
So that was really the motivation behind it.

539
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,220
But this, this script takes a little bit of elbow grease to get set up.

540
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,140
The documentation is very good, but it's also very verbose.

541
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,860
So it almost put me off, but I'm very glad it didn't.

542
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,740
You need to configure a couple of YAML files and then they actually provide a Docker contain

543
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,500
that you can run the Python script out of, which just floats my boat.

544
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,460
I have it set to run every day through a system D timer.

545
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,620
And the main reason that actually we wanted to go into refreshing all the metadata every

546
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,900
day was because of the critic ratings that Plex has.

547
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:27,200
I noticed that several of the movies that I had, the critics rating and the rotten tomatoes

548
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,340
rating didn't really seem to line up with what I thought the movie was, like not even

549
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340
a little bit.

550
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,180
And it turns out that it was just a few thousand votes on those really early scores.

551
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,020
And so the Plex meta manager goes through every day and refreshes things like critic

552
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
ratings.

553
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,900
It has a cache, which you can configure, and I think I've got mindset to 30 days.

554
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,660
So it's not going to go and scrape every movie every day, but you know, once a month, I think

555
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,380
updating my critic ratings is probably worthwhile.

556
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,660
So this Python script, you set it up to run through system D every night, and then it

557
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,820
goes out and gets all the updated information, and then it writes it to the Plex database

558
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,820
directly?

559
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,820
Yeah.

560
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,940
So if you're running Plex in a container, are you running this script in that container?

561
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,380
How's that working?

562
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,260
You supply the Plex server URL.

563
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,660
So in my case, it was just 192.168.port.32.400.

564
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,660
So it's talking Plex.

565
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,460
It's not like crawling the file system.

566
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,460
No.

567
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,460
Gotcha.

568
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,860
And then how does it get access to the database though?

569
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
Through a token.

570
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,820
So when you go into your media library, there is a Plex token that you can get.

571
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:35,180
You can click on, I think it's get info and then view raw XML.

572
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:40,860
And as part of that XML payload up in the address bar, there is a, it's like a 20 character

573
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,260
long token.

574
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,300
You give this script that token and then it authenticates against the Plex API and off

575
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,380
it goes.

576
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,460
That is so cool, Alex, man.

577
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,780
I love the idea of going out and getting the updated ratings because I have observed that

578
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,820
same exact thing and I'm really glad you dug into it because I had wondered how exactly

579
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,480
does that work?

580
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,740
That is so cool that it goes out there and gets the trending stuff too.

581
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,700
I noticed too that you came across Movie Match, which is what I actually thought was going

582
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,700
to do some of this.

583
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,220
Yeah, it's like Tinder, this thing.

584
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,020
Not that I've ever used Tinder because I've been married for 10 years, but.

585
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,220
Now you're more of a Grindr guy.

586
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,500
Oh man.

587
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,940
No, I'm not.

588
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:30,900
I'm not, but it is like, it's actually more of like, uh, it's more of matching tastes

589
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,260
up with a group, right?

590
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,620
It's more about like, Hey, what do we all want to watch together?

591
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,260
And when again, going back to that problem, when you've got like a thousand movies in

592
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,520
your library, it's harder.

593
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,820
If a group of us were here in the studio legitimately, if we were all just hanging out, you, me and

594
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,220
everybody were hanging out on the couch and we were just flipping through live TV and

595
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,220
like Star Wars was like on one of the cable channels, we would just watch it.

596
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,900
There wouldn't even really be a debate.

597
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,420
That's what we would put on.

598
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:03,100
But when you actually have to choose and you want a group of people to decide, it's a real

599
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,380
first world problem.

600
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,060
Me so like Star Wars.

601
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,060
Those ones even.

602
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,060
Yeah.

603
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,500
I was a kid when that came out.

604
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,820
Episode one, I was, uh, I was like nine or 10 when that came out.

605
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,340
And I remember we were on, this is one for the British audience.

606
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,220
We were on a Norfolk Broads holiday and we were in lowest off that night and we all,

607
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:28,300
I remember walking down the road with my dad to go to the cinema from the boat to go and

608
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,300
watch episode one.

609
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,420
And it's just one of those things that stuck in my memory.

610
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,420
Ah, that's great.

611
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,780
How can you not love pod racing?

612
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,140
It's just the coolest thing ever.

613
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,140
Yeah, that's true.

614
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,660
The pod racing was super awesome.

615
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,660
Yeah.

616
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,020
I mean, I enjoy the Star Wars movies, the prequels, not as much.

617
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,100
I think the writing's horrible, but I'm more of a Star Trek guy.

618
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,900
I've kind of lost track of what's going on these days.

619
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,980
So speaking of this movie match thing, uh, essentially what you do is you and your partner

620
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,920
or your group of friends set up, uh, this app to talk to your Plex library and it presents

621
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,940
you with a random bunch of movies that you swipe right, swipe left if you like it or

622
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,300
don't like it.

623
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:09,260
And if you and your group end up with a common set of movies, it will show you at the bottom.

624
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,340
Here are the three movies that you all thought were worth watching.

625
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,940
So you just narrow things down for you.

626
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,580
You could set up like a group chat, like movie night group chat, and you drop that link in

627
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:26,180
there a couple of nights before and have everybody go through and swipe right and left.

628
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:30,020
And then when it comes time, use the new Plex watch feature and just watch it all together.

629
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,500
Socially distanced movie night.

630
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,260
Hey, it could be a thing again.

631
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,180
And now we, now we have the tools we need.

632
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,180
This is really cool.

633
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,580
So we'll have a link in the show notes or you could just Google search for movie match.

634
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,680
It's just one word, but links will be at selfhosted.show slash 50.

635
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,080
Now my final Plex pick for this week is a no spoilers script.

636
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:54,100
Have you ever been watching a TV show and seen an episode, three or four episodes ahead

637
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:02,180
in Plex and you see a character whose current storyline doesn't fit with that thumbnail?

638
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,180
Yes.

639
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,180
Well, this script will blur out the future episodes you haven't yet watched.

640
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,180
That's great.

641
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,740
So is it, it must be going through finding that JPEG and actually like applying a blur

642
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,740
to it.

643
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,740
That's funny.

644
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,700
That's really funny.

645
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,940
It will blur out the episodes based on the user who sets it up.

646
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:24,720
So for example, my server, let's say Catherine had her own account, my wife, all the episodes

647
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,860
I hadn't watched would be blurred even if she'd watched them.

648
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,700
So it's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.

649
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,700
Mark my words.

650
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,400
Plex will introduce this feature to the Plex client.

651
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,180
My prediction right here on self hosted 50 because in fuse the, that what I've been raving

652
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,700
about recently, which is also a Plex compatible client does this.

653
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,580
It's an option in the settings and it's a game changer.

654
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,860
It's what actually switched us over using infuse and now I've just stuck for all of

655
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,820
the other reasons, but it, it pre blurs the image and the description.

656
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,700
Once you've watched it, it unblurs all that stuff and it's just goes based on the watch

657
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,540
status and there's just one user within fuse.

658
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:07,800
But if you are on an Apple TV platform and you want to use infuse to watch Plex and would

659
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,360
like to do that, it's just in the settings and we love this feature.

660
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,980
So I got to imagine this is something Plex is going to implement too, just because it's

661
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,980
so fricking handy.

662
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,980
Yeah.

663
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,740
I'm still butthurt about this Nvidia shield update.

664
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:24,220
I thought I'd get used to it and I thought I wouldn't care too much, but I tell you what

665
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,420
my shield downstairs doesn't have the update, but the one upstairs does.

666
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,900
And the one upstairs is really beginning to grate on me.

667
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,740
So I might have to get an Apple TV soon.

668
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,060
I want to take a moment and thank our friends over to cloud guru for their support.

669
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,180
And I want to mention to you, they have a Linux file sharing course.

670
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,900
It's a deep dive on Linux file sharing.

671
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,600
It's a standalone course, but it's also part of a learning path intended to prepare you

672
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,700
for the LPIC2 Engineer 202 and 450 exam.

673
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,080
In this course, they're going to cover the basics and advanced configurations for Samba

674
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,500
and NFS, including configuring file servers, exporting file shares, user authentication,

675
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,900
client configuration, and mount options.

676
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,080
We'll have a link for that in the show notes, or you can go to cloudguru.com.

677
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,700
And also we have cloudfree.shop sponsoring this week's episode.

678
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,460
You can go to cloudfree.shop to get a pre-flashed TAS motor smart plug, use the coupon code

679
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,420
self-hosted to get a dollar off per smart plug.

680
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,900
And of note, the new version two smart plug has been released recently.

681
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,060
And this one's really cool because it features energy monitoring.

682
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,980
So not only do you have a free and open source firmware on this thing from the factory, but

683
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:36,720
I can now also monitor how much power my server is using without needing to tie up my kilowatt,

684
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
for example.

685
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
It's super cool.

686
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,860
So go to cloudfree.shop and use the coupon code self-hosted.

687
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,720
Greg writes into the show, Chris and the Badger, I love the show.

688
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,900
It inspired me to learn Docker this past April and convert all of my self-hosted services

689
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,900
to Docker.

690
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:57,540
I built one big Docker compose that provides the MariaDB for various components, plus the

691
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,220
swag and SSL for all my external services.

692
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,380
And I've moved over to Airsonic Advanced and Booksonic and Ghost as well.

693
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,180
All tips from the show, but here's my question.

694
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,820
How do I manage updates for the various service images?

695
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,180
Most of the compose entries are built with the latest tag.

696
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:23,540
Should I move to a specific version and definition and then rebuild it on a regular basis?

697
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:28,020
And for in-container security updates, how often should I repull the images to keep them

698
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,420
up to date?

699
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,700
Perhaps there is a guide or a white paper on different approaches.

700
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,420
I think Greg just needs some help, Alex.

701
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:42,020
Well, my advice would be straight off the bat, don't run latest because it's just a

702
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,860
disaster waiting to happen.

703
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,900
As I found out with my next cloud this week, which broke again.

704
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,560
No, no, no way.

705
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,940
Even though I talk about it in the last episode and I've pinned it to a specific version,

706
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,380
you know, a major version.

707
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,100
So 19, 20, 21, something like that.

708
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:04,180
But within those certain tags, sometimes you've got to watch the developers as well even because

709
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,700
they will just released all the security patches and all the updates for the entire life cycle

710
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,140
of that major version.

711
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,960
So you will get a lot of updates even sometimes when you pin specific versions.

712
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,660
So the only way to be sure is to go to the Docker hub page for a specific image and look

713
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,180
at the list of tags that are available.

714
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:29,540
And some providers, some developers offer specific tags to the exact specific version,

715
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,980
which ties to a specific commit.

716
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:37,540
Others like next cloud offer a stable version of a major version, lots of different ways

717
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,740
to do this particular thing.

718
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:44,740
But for apps that don't matter, maybe you'll get away with latest.

719
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,980
You know, things like traffic, for example, is probably a good idea to run that on latest

720
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,200
because that's public facing.

721
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,660
So you want the latest, you know, CVEs and things patched in that one.

722
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,980
But for the rest of them, I would probably steer away from latest just because at some

723
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,540
point or other, it will bite you.

724
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:07,780
Bevan writes in and he is looking for a security camera system for a vacation house.

725
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,140
So I think one that he probably isn't attending to be at very often.

726
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:16,860
He writes, most of the options seem to need a cloud component in order to operate, which

727
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,540
is a bit concerning since the systems are not cheap to install.

728
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,940
I'd be interested to know what you guys use and maybe what other listeners might have

729
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,940
installed.

730
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,940
Cheers.

731
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,940
Love the show.

732
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:33,820
You can go up notes.jupitabroadcasting.com and type in Blue Iris because that's going

733
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,820
to be my recommendation.

734
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,420
We've got a couple of episodes where we've talked about it in the past.

735
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:44,780
Episode 43, episode 28, 36, and we've talked about it quite a few times.

736
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:49,960
The too long didn't listen, though, is Blue Iris is a Windows app.

737
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,100
So you're going to want to have some kind of a system that has a quick sync enabled

738
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,280
CPU.

739
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:02,100
So something like the HP290 slim box, which you can pick up off eBay for about $130 at

740
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,620
the time of recording.

741
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,860
That has an eighth gen Intel CPU in it, which has quick sync.

742
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,260
You install Windows on there.

743
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,260
Yes, I know.

744
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,480
Sorry, Windows.

745
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,880
And then Blue Iris on top of that.

746
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:20,820
And then what you will need to power the hardware is a POE switch connected to POE cameras.

747
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:27,180
And you can usually get those for anywhere from $10 or $20 from Alibaba, all the way

748
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,980
up to $300, $400 each if you want to buy UniFi gear.

749
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,260
What I tend to stick with is the price point of around $50 a camera, unless I absolutely

750
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,080
need 4K.

751
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,340
And then it's about $100 a camera.

752
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,180
But it's not terribly expensive.

753
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,740
The cameras are the cheap part, essentially.

754
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,940
Running Ethernet is going to be something of a consideration because that's how the

755
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,900
cameras get their power.

756
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,980
And then also, you might want to upgrade a couple of things in the HP box are recommended.

757
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:00,060
It comes, I think, the one on eBay with a 500 gig spinning drive, for example.

758
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,140
So you might want an SSD for that as well.

759
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,780
But that's a pretty solid setup.

760
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,340
And there are lots of guides on YouTube on how to set up Blue Iris.

761
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,860
And recently, they've got some really cool features in there with DeepStack to do object

762
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,480
detection and that kind of stuff.

763
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,580
So Blue Iris gets my vote.

764
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,580
Right.

765
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,380
The cameras going over Ethernet are going to be a rock solid setup.

766
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:28,300
And I think that's really key is a lot of the cloud solutions are all Wi-Fi cameras.

767
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,900
And Wi-Fi cameras are going to work 90% of the time.

768
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,420
But wired cameras are going to work 100% until there's like a hardware failure.

769
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,660
Now with Blue Iris, Alex, because I'm unfamiliar with it, is there a remote viewing component

770
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,860
so we could pull it up on a mobile device?

771
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,860
It's so cool.

772
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:50,260
There's an app for all the major mobile platforms, as well as a web browser, like a web interface.

773
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:57,340
So I can just type the URL of my server, which happens to go through my traffic reverse proxy.

774
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,700
And straight away, I'm thrown into a web interface that is HTML5.

775
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,400
And I can see all six of my cameras, boom, right there.

776
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:12,420
So if I hear a noise, or the doorbell goes, or something like that, I just type in bi.mydomain.com

777
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,140
and boom, straight in the browser, I'm good to go.

778
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,780
And that's another thing about the local wired systems is those camera feeds are going to

779
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,900
come up a lot quicker.

780
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,060
The cloud-based systems are going to have to connect to the service first.

781
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:27,060
There's usually somewhere, like on a good day, a three-second delay.

782
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,980
Sometimes it can be a 30-second delay.

783
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,980
I don't like it.

784
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,900
Now I normally would sit here and I'd tell you about my Wwise system.

785
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,980
I have the WYZE cams that are going into a Shinobi box.

786
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,500
But I don't love this solution because the cameras are not super reliable.

787
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,940
And so I would not recommend them for a security system like what you have here.

788
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:53,060
I have it for, we're off-grid somewhere and we come back and somebody's broken into our

789
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,060
rig.

790
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,860
I want to have a good shot that I've caught something on camera.

791
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,980
That's really what I have my system for.

792
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:02,620
But I don't know if I would trust it to run 24-7 because they're Wi-Fi cameras.

793
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,300
They're doing it over RTMP or RTSP.

794
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,820
It's just not super reliable.

795
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,660
Now I've never used the next system I'm about to talk about so I would not normally recommend

796
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,660
it.

797
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:18,220
However, I have gotten a couple of emails and people have said that if you want a system

798
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:23,700
that's kind of like a midway system, I've heard that the Arlo camera system is good

799
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,780
for that kind of thing.

800
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,780
You can get it like on Amazon in like a three to six camera kit.

801
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,220
And what's kind of different about this is it has a base station unit that the cameras

802
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,920
connect back to locally on your LAN and that's where the video is stored.

803
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,740
And so that does seem compelling to me and I guess it has a pretty flexible setup system

804
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:49,380
and you can get a three camera kit for 385 bucks off of Amazon when it's not on sale.

805
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,340
And I don't know how great it is but the people who've written into the show seem to really

806
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,340
like it.

807
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,000
The cameras seem to work indoors and outdoors.

808
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,780
Never tested it myself but if I had 385 bucks to burn, I may give this a go one day because

809
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,620
I do like the idea of making this as much of an appliance as I can and I am not really

810
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,180
in a situation to run Ethernet and do POE.

811
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,580
Now I do have a couple of those Wyze cameras plugged into Blue Iris as well.

812
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:19,540
One thing of note though is that the new V3 cameras don't support the RTSP firmware yet.

813
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:27,960
So if you're thinking about getting those cheap $20, $25 Wyze Cam V2 cameras, just be

814
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,940
aware you'll need to put a custom firmware on there.

815
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,180
Yeah, my advice would be don't do Wyze right now.

816
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:39,060
The Wyze 2 is just not fast enough to do the feed reliably and the V3, while it has a faster

817
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,760
processor and better optics, doesn't have the firmware yet like you were saying.

818
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,760
And I would hold off on purchasing a Wyze camera system until then because what I like

819
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,540
to do is bring all those feeds back into Shinobi running on my Raspberry Pi.

820
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,160
But with the V2 Wyzes, they drop off several times an hour right now.

821
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,160
It's no good.

822
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,160
There's gaps.

823
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,820
And I think the V3s would be a lot better but you have to wait.

824
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,060
So I'd say hold up when we come back on the show and say we've tested it, go for it.

825
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,140
But in the meantime, if you can, wired is the way to go.

826
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,500
And don't forget, as we talked about at the top of the show, we have a big Jupiter Broadcasting

827
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,220
Meetup coming up very, very soon, both Salt Lake City and Denver.

828
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:22,220
And don't forget to go to JupiterGarage.com and grab some self-hosted 50 merch.

829
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:27,700
For the next couple of weeks, we're running member pricing on the store to celebrate Episode

830
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,700
50.

831
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,980
So you got a limited amount of time to get over to JupiterGarage.com and pick yourself

832
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,740
up some stickers or shirts or I don't know.

833
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,800
There's all kinds of stuff over there.

834
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,800
I'm not you.

835
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
I don't know what you do.

836
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,060
And if you want to support the show, you can get a self-hosted dot show slash SRE.

837
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:46,380
I got a memo the other day that we might be doing a special discount for all original

838
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,380
merch.

839
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,380
That's right.

840
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,140
Crazy Self Hosted is giving away prices.

841
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,180
We're dropping prices.

842
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,920
We're slashing prices for members only.

843
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,180
We'll have a discount code that will take a little bit off any original merchandise

844
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,180
items.

845
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,020
And when you go to JupiterGarage.com, there's a products drop down menu.

846
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,220
And if you choose original merch, members are going to get a percentage off all that.

847
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,940
We'll have details in the members only post show coming up.

848
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:10,940
Absolutely.

849
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,740
Now, for all the ways to go and get in touch with us, you can get a self-hosted dot show

850
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,820
slash contact and you can find me on Twitter at ironic badger.

851
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:22,900
I'm there too at Chris LAS and this here show for news announcements and whatnots at Self

852
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,900
Hosted Show.

853
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,420
Thanks for listening, everybody.

854
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:55,020
That was a special episode 50.
