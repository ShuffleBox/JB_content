00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Well, I'm pleased to welcome back to the show. Mr. Chris Fisher. Welcome back, Chris.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,440
Thank you, Alex. I just got done drying everything off only a few moments ago.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,120
We missed you, man. So it's story time. I need to stay a while and listen.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,560
Yes. And first of all, thank you to Morgan for filling in. I, at the last minute,

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,480
had to jump out when I realized that my laptop had got soaked and I didn't want to turn it on.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,200
And so I told Alex, you gotta find somebody to fill in for me.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,240
All right. So I was setting up to go camp out in the woods. Brief story.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,920
And I wanted to get out to the woods and get set up in time for the show.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,040
And so I was in a bit of a rush and I thought, because I'm an idiot, I thought, hey, you know,

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,880
be a great idea is I'll do some updates on this laptop. And I've got this really old 2013 Mac

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,000
book that runs Arch Linux, by the way. And so it's for me, it's like this thrill to boot it

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,120
up about once every six months and see if when I do an update, if the installation explodes or not.

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,280
Right. So I thought, well, I'm running around packing up the RV. I'll set this thing to do

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,840
some updates just so I can, you know, have like a little thing to do for my ADD brain

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,440
and check in on it. And so I'm packing up and I go around and I collect all of my electronics because

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,760
I, my kids and I had been going through some stuff. And so we had the fire tablets were down

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,720
off the wall that we use to control home assistant, our front end and some game controllers were out

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,120
and we're going down the road and we want to get there quick. So I just took this basket and like

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,960
a good little boy, I picked up everything and put it in my basket. And of course, I don't want that

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,040
basket to spill. So I, I set it in the back in the bathroom and finished up my laptop and closed the

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,080
lid and went about packing up the rest of the RV. I'm driving down the road for probably 20, 25

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,800
minutes. And I realized I should probably get gas because I'm going to be off grid for a while. And

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,400
if for some reason we don't get good solar, I'm going to need to be able to run my generator.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,160
So I, I, I pull up to a gas station and I start to pull in, which is a downhill kind of turn in.

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,880
And as I pull into the gas station and begin to decline down into the parking lot, I hear like,

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,720
like a wave sound behind me. Like, I'm like, is there a noisemaker on? And I, I turn around and

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,000
look over my shoulder, Alex, and I see this wave of water coming down the middle of the hallway of

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,600
my RV. It sloshes down into the, into the, into the step. Well, it's all over the place. It's

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,240
coming down into my feet while I'm driving. It was everywhere. How tight did your asshole

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:29,200
pocket when you saw that Alex in like one motion, I like grabbed the radio and I radioed to my wife

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,360
because she's chasing me in the car behind there. You got to get in here quick. We got an emergency.

32
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,400
I throw the radio down. I parked the RV stand up and I began just walking straight to the back. And

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:52,080
as I approach the back of the RV, I hear a sound I immediately recognize it's my water pump and it's

34
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,840
pumping and it's pumping and it's pumping. It shouldn't be on, but in our rush to leave, I had

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,000
left it on and didn't notice. And so I flip it off as I opened the door and I look right at the sink

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,840
where I just instinctively knew the problem was going to be somehow I knew, and I could immediately

37
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,520
see the entire chain of events. I had left that big old heavy Mac book on the counter. And when I

38
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:24,160
went down the road, it slid down the counter, slid just right and fell into the sink. And as it fell,

39
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,720
it turned the faucet on, which is where my basket full of electronics was sitting. Oh, that be

40
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,120
turned that that Alex, it turned into a bathtub. Alex, it was, it was so bad. Alex, it soaked

41
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,560
everything and then proceeded to spill out from there into the rest of the RV in about about 17,

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,880
17, 15, 20 gallons ish. It's hard to say. Yeah. Got the laptop, got all the fire tablets, got the

43
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:56,960
game controllers, got all the charging bricks, everything, not to mention flooded the RV. I had

44
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,240
to act quick. And so thankfully I was able to position the RV in such a way that it kind of

45
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,440
tilted it. So I could just get all the water to pour out into one direction. And then I just spent

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,400
like two hours drying it up. And then we moved out to our spot in the woods and spend another

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,400
couple of hours trying to dry it all out. I lost a lot of devices. A lot of good devices died that

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,400
day, Alex, but not that stupid old Mac book. It's still kicking even though it got water in the event

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,000
in the vents and all of that, it's still kicking. So the device that caused the problem just ran

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,440
away going tee, not today. It's doing great. Yep. Although its power adapter bit the dust. So I

51
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,280
don't know exactly what its long-term plan was. That's like cutting your nose off to spite your

52
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,480
face, isn't it? That's why you should plan and plan to learn. Visit our sponsor, Cloud Guru,

55
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,440
You know, that story just hurts me so deeply because water and electronics, you just have

56
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,800
this pathological thing that they don't go, they just don't mix. I've probably missed out on several

57
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,200
experiences in my life because I had a phone in my pocket. I'm like, well, I'm not going to go and

58
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,120
run in the ocean or whatever it is because I've got a phone in my pocket.

59
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,400
And so many devices, obvious statement time, but I really was feeling this,

60
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,800
so many devices have the battery built in. And so there's just nothing I can do.

61
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,360
Yeah. Damn, man. I feel your pain. I really do. Yeah. It was rough. It was rough. And so now I

62
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,800
have to selectively choose what I'm going to replace and what I'm just going to try to live

63
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,720
without. Oh yeah. And you just missed Prime Day. I know! That crossed my mind because I had a couple

64
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,920
of fire tablets in the mix. Gone. Womp womp. All right. So you got something to cheer me up?

65
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,320
Well, I was watching YouTube the other day, as is often the case in my household, and I was

66
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,480
watching a video by Techno Tim and he did an Orthalia introduction. This is a single sign-on

67
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,080
service that basically allows you to have one login cookie get set, which then allows you to

68
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,840
log into all of the services that you select through a set of rules that you configure to say,

69
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,080
right, if I want to access Nextcloud, as long as I've got this token set, then I'm all good. And

70
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,040
then you could do it for a wiki or any of the services that are running on your system.

71
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,000
And the really nice thing is it's configured with a single line of Docker Compose configurations.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,160
So you just add a single line to declare that you want to use Orthalia as what's

73
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,000
called a piece of middleware in the traffic configuration. And you're good to go. And that's

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,160
it. I see. So it is, first of all, we should mention it's open source. And it essentially

75
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,880
takes authentication requests using NGINX and provides the authorization for those

76
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,080
authentication requests. Yeah, not just NGINX, it supports traffic as well as a bunch of others.

77
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:05,440
And it actually more recently supports Kubernetes Ingress controllers, which is nice as well.

78
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,480
All right, I'm checking it out right now. And it actually looks like it has a pretty good interface

79
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:15,840
too. So this will have linked in the show notes or you can go to AUTHELIA.com. Yeah, you don't

80
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,480
really need a whole bunch of interface for a login client. Essentially what happens when you

81
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,480
have a service that's backed by this, let's say I go to wiki, my personal wiki, my tiddly wiki,

82
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,040
traffic will detect that I've set that piece of middleware as part of the chain of traffic that

83
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,920
it wants to go through. And so AUTHELIA will then pop up a standard web form. I'll type in

84
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,280
my username and password. It does support two-factor authentication. So even for services

85
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:49,200
that don't have 2FA natively, I can use AUTHELIA to add 2FA to those services as well. And then

86
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,160
just transparently that token lasts for the length and duration of your session. You can

87
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,960
figure how long it is. I think it's five minutes by default. Any other service that has the same

88
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,840
rule on your system, it will reuse that authentication token. So if you're switching

89
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,800
between a bunch of different services on your system, log in once and you're logged into all

90
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,000
of them all at once automatically. Boy, that does seem nice. It has a lot of great features in here.

91
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,040
All right. Well, it sounds like something to check out. We talk about this kind of stuff also

92
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,920
when we talk about things like hosting your own password manager or hosting your own email.

93
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,520
I wonder if there's an audience and I wonder if you out there too, I wonder if there's a portion

94
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,400
of the audience that thinks I'd never want to host this. This crosses a line. This breaks and

95
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,640
things get hosed. And so I wonder if there isn't a discussion to be had there, Alex, about where that

96
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,640
line is for us and if we ever consider dropping something and saying, you know what, I'll just

97
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,840
go with a commercial service for this. Is this grumpy old man Alex coming out here? But my

98
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:58,880
tolerance for stuff breaking, be it an update, be it a dodgy power cable, whatever the reason,

99
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,880
my tolerance is so low these days. And a couple of episodes ago I mentioned I had my server on

100
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,240
the desk next to me because I was troubleshooting some issues with hard drives failing. Turns out

101
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,120
it wasn't the hard drives failing and I wasted maybe three weeks on trying all sorts of different

102
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,200
drives and cables and disk controllers. No, it was the power cable from the power supply to the

103
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,280
drives. No kidding. I wasted three weeks on that damn thing. And that just left me with a huge

104
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,960
bitter taste in my mouth. And I'm not going to stop self-hosting. Don't worry audience, we're okay.

105
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,760
But there were just moments in that three week period I was like, screw this. I just want to

106
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,840
throw the towel in and just be done and just pay Netflix or whoever it is. Wow. In that same period

107
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,680
of time, I think you also had a certain home assistant update not go so well too. So you

108
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,560
were really getting it from both ends. Yeah, that's the thing. And this week, another example is

109
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,920
that Nextcloud just stopped working for some reason. I have no idea why. I've been sat on

110
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:07,200
Nextcloud 19 for the last year plus. I haven't touched it. I pull in the regular updates that

111
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:15,200
they provide to the 19 branch through Docker Hub tagging, but I don't update major versions on

112
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,480
Nextcloud unless I have a good reason to because I don't want all of the new stuff. I just use it

113
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,720
for documents. That's pretty much it. Right. I actually figured this out because I got a notification

114
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,200
on my phone because photo upload had stopped working. It said this server is in maintenance

115
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,680
mode. And I'm like, okay, yeah, I remember. I've had this before. So you Google it. First result

116
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,360
says go into the config file and edit a single line that says change maintenance mode from true

117
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,720
to false in the config.php file. So I did that. It was already set to maintenance mode false.

118
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,400
So I'm like, okay, well, clearly something's going on here. So I then start looking into

119
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:02,560
the Nextcloud container logs. And then it said something about character encoding, UTF-8 charsets.

120
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,000
And I just, at that point I was like, oh no, here we go. This is going to be a long evening.

121
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,840
Long story short, I ended up having to go into the MySQL container itself with a Docker exec command.

122
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:22,960
Get into the MySQL nitty-gritty details, delete and change a couple of data types from

123
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,040
varchar to text fields and all this, you know, stuff that's way over the head of most people

124
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,840
doing self-hosting, unless this is your day job. And I just thought to myself, who is this stuff

125
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,440
targeted at? If I was paying for Nextcloud as a hosted service, I mean, these things exist,

126
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:49,040
like Google drive is similar, OneDrive, you know, all these different cloud file repositories.

127
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,040
If these things broke and I had to jump through all these different hoops to fix them,

128
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:00,800
I would just migrate to a different service. And yet, because I feel a certain sense of obligation,

129
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,160
partly because of this show, but also partly because of my beliefs towards self-hosting in

130
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,720
general, I power through it. But sometimes I just want to throw the towel in, you know?

131
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,640
Did you ever get to the root of why that Nextcloud issue just cropped up?

132
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,520
I think it was because of the character encoding. So what I ended up doing as part of the

133
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,880
troubleshooting process was like, right, okay, well, I'm in the weeds here. I may as well go to

134
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,720
Nextcloud 22 whilst I'm here. Yeah, that would be my line of thinking too.

135
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,920
Yeah. And then I thought it didn't start because I thought, oh, it's some database

136
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,120
schema changes have probably happened and it's just not tested properly on 19. Okay, fine.

137
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,600
I'll go to the next major release that's stable. Yeah. And so like I said to you, I had to drop to

138
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,640
the MySQL command line, delete a couple of tables that were failing the repair because there's an OCC

139
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,440
command. So you can log into the Nextcloud container and run, there's like a shell,

140
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,520
like a CLI tool built into it called OCC. Own Cloud Client, I would imagine is what it stands for.

141
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,800
Don't quote me on that. And you can do a bunch of maintenance stuff. You can turn maintenance mode

142
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,960
on and off. You can repair things, et cetera, et cetera. And it kept failing on this line item

143
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,440
to do with news articles, which is a plugin I don't even use anymore. I think I enabled it

144
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,800
for testing and then forgot about it. And much like my Home Assistant update, I probably missed

145
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,000
it in the logs because I don't necessarily look at the logs every day because I've got other stuff

146
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,040
to do. And yeah, once I deleted the news, once I'd gone into the correct database table and then

147
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,800
deleted the three or four lines that were causing the schema migrations to fail, then the upgrade

148
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,240
proceeded and it was all fine, but it took me a couple of hours. I've had those moments where I

149
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,120
thought maybe a server was dead and gone. And I thought, I don't know if I ever want to rebuild

150
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,160
this. And then thankfully, they came back and then I thought, okay, I better get my backup game.

151
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,480
I better get my backup figured out. Yeah, because you really got it. You got a hardware failure in

152
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,400
your server. You got a software failure in Nextcloud, a pretty dramatic Home Assistant

153
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,560
failure based on some deprecation and changes. I mean, you got it one after another. I recently

154
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,120
also had a Home Assistant update go south when the OS update didn't complete correctly, the system

155
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,920
locked up and then rebooted and then it couldn't get an IP until I had fiddled with it for quite

156
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,960
a while. And for a brief moment, I thought to myself, should I just bail on this and maybe just

157
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,200
go back to a traditional server and Home Assistant core container and just keep it simple.

158
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,280
And then it gets working again. And then I think, okay, no, this is better. And I like this.

159
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,160
And I think to myself in the grand scheme of things, this is the cost of having full control

160
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,800
over these services. And it does give me a better appreciation of the value that the cloud providers

161
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,200
are offering. And it makes me also understand how valuable my data must be if they can pay for these

162
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,080
services based on mining my information. Like, wow, there must be some real value there because

163
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:13,600
it's not cheap. And to keep something reliable like file services for a 10-year streak actually

164
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,320
takes an incredible amount of effort. Yeah, you're not wrong. I mean, these guys, they were entire

165
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,120
jobs, site reliability engineers. That's the name of our supporters club that we have. And

166
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,160
there's an entire job dedicated to keeping things up and stable and reliable. And these guys,

167
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,880
they write software, they write scripts, they do all sorts of Ninja magic to keep these services

168
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,760
online. I think part of it, Alex, is giving yourself, and you've done this, the ability

169
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,800
to rebuild fairly quickly. You do that. If you adopt something, you make sure that you can redeploy

170
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,520
it as necessary and those kinds of things, I think they help a lot. But I think this show

171
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,560
should ask the question more often, is there a cloud service that could do that? And I think

172
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,760
is there a cloud service that could do this? And if there is, why are we not choosing to use it?

173
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,480
Because it is a big trade-off every time. And the more critical the service is to you,

174
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,400
I think the more serious you have to consider that. Trying to think of a good example, I suppose

175
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,560
Wiki would be a decent one because you can probably throw some stuff up on GitHub in a

176
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,600
random repository with a bunch of text files and call that a Wiki if you want to. You could also

177
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:34,720
go to some random website and buy probably Wiki capabilities, but there's nothing quite like

178
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,400
hosting your own and keeping that kind of information in-house because the role of Wiki

179
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:48,880
in particular fulfills often is to store proprietary custom information, maybe Wi-Fi

180
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,160
passwords for your house or something, or the code to the safe so that your wife can open it

181
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,960
when you're out or something. I don't know what people store in their Wikis, but there could be

182
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,720
some sensitive information in there.

183
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,160
It sounds like you have a code for a safe that if I was ever on your land,

184
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,600
I should try to get that code.

185
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,360
I've got to buy the safe first.

186
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,400
I was like, he has a safe? Oh, okay. But it's a good example. You're right. I have been thinking,

187
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:22,000
how could I leave my wife notes in a way that is fully secure? And there is this feeling that

188
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,040
I think is actually pretty special and it's this total feel of control. And I feel this when I am

189
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,520
off-grid and I'm generating my own power and I've brought my own food and I don't need anyone to

190
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,720
do anything. For a brief moment, I feel like I'm truly in control. And I have that same sense when

191
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:49,520
it comes to everything being offline in my RV and being self-contained to the RV and having gone

192
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,280
through this project off-grid where I offloaded a bunch of services and got everything running

193
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:02,160
locally. When I get access to that stuff, it's this feeling of confidence that we get so sparingly

194
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,640
now with so many cloud services that are integrated with our mobile devices or integrated

195
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,680
with commercial desktops, less and less consumers and technology users have control, less and less.

196
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,240
They have less control than ever of modifying their devices, of controlling their devices,

197
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,120
or even determining who has access to their data or if it can be scanned or any of that.

198
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,640
And so when we have these areas, we can actually exercise that control. We have to keep doing it

199
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,880
or else it will go away. If there's no users of these self-hosted services and if there's no

200
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:43,440
market demand for this control, eventually the developers and the companies that serve that niche

201
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,640
will dry up. And so it's like you have to always be looking like where can I exercise that control

202
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,920
and where does it matter the most? And that's kind of where I've come down on it. It's like,

203
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:58,240
okay, this information, like secret stuff I want to give my wife, that is always going to be on my

204
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,280
land. I'm just never going to put it anywhere else. And thankfully, I've come up with a little system

205
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,000
where it's just some markdown files. It's really simple. It's not a big effort to actually do it.

206
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,640
You are right. There are an increasing number of companies doing stuff for this marketplace.

207
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,480
Tuya, we talked about it last episode with Morgan, have announced a native home assistant

208
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,120
integration as part of their product line. So these things are happening and you see,

209
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,720
what's his name? Linus Sebastian has just bought a new house and he's talking about how he's going

210
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,840
to implement smart dampers in every room so he's not air conditioning every room and how there is

211
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,720
lots of proprietary services that could do this stuff and how it's just all so overwhelming. And

212
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,440
I think that's largely what I'm feeling too. It's just a bit overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I

213
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,920
could do. It's not even necessarily just when stuff breaks. It's that feeling of once I put my

214
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,680
daughter to bed or something in the evening of, okay, I've got a couple of hours before I go to

215
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,440
sleep now. I don't want to just sit and veg and watch cartoons necessarily. I'll do that

216
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,080
whilst I'm doing something else. But what out of my huge long list of ideas that I've got,

217
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,440
should I pick? And, oh, I can't be bothered. I'll just watch cartoons.

218
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,880
You know what I've been doing is like the really simple stuff. I went through my home assistant

219
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,960
dashboard and I made individual, I chose like individual icons for each entity. So each light

220
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,200
bulb has like a unique light bulb icon, really just slow kind of paced work while I was watching

221
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:36,240
Rick and Morty. So it's like not very high cognitive load, but I can sit there and fiddle

222
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,800
with something. And then the other thing that I did recently, it was one of those moments where

223
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,960
I was like, I don't need to build something complicated here. I could just get a couple

224
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,400
of window fans off of Amazon that have manual controls, plug them into some smart plugs,

225
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,760
and I could have some set to input and I could have some set to output. And then I could just

226
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,360
set up automations to turn the smart plugs on and off. And it was one of those moments where

227
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,280
I was like, I could just do something very simple for cooling. And it would probably take me 35

228
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,000
minutes to set it all up. And I was so down in the weeds with all of these things. Like I could

229
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,800
build a new virtualization backend, and then I could set up individual host OSs and then put

230
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,480
containers in there. Like I was going through this entire thing about how I wanted to rebuild

231
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,840
all of the infrastructure. And then I thought, you know what else I could do is I could just

232
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,400
spend 30 minutes doing this tonight. And I'll spend 30 minutes doing that tomorrow. And over

233
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,440
a couple of nights, I got it all done. If it works, it ain't stupid. linode.com slash SSH.

234
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,520
Go there to support the show and get $100 in credit on a new account. Linode is our cloud

235
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,640
hosting provider. When we're building something that we want to experiment with, we do it on

236
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,640
Linode. There's a lot of quick ways to deploy. They have 11 data centers to choose from. They

237
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,040
have crazy fast network connections and a whole range of types of servers. So you can

238
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:57,040
get like a $5 a month system. But sometimes we want some dedicated CPUs or GPUs. They have a

239
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,880
lot of choices. Roger wrote into the show to say that he used Linode to replace Zoom with

240
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,520
something he can host himself. He says, along with just about everybody else, the Milwaukee

241
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,280
Linux users group had to go to virtual due to COVID-19. And as you might expect from a group

242
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,800
of Linux users, they weren't a big fan of using Zoom. They wanted to use Jitsi. So they looked

243
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,880
around at different providers and they chose Linode. They picked the $5 a month machine,

244
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,040
and they also chose to do the automatic backup service. So that way there's just backups that

245
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,480
are just taken care of. They installed Jitsi Meet on that system, and they're now using it

246
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,440
with Nextcloud Talk to do the video calls for their lug, all running on Linode.

247
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,680
You know, what's really nice about this too is Roger was able to prototype Jitsi and Nextcloud

248
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,520
and try them all out really quickly in environments that are production-style environments. You can

249
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,960
really get a sense for how it's going to perform. And it's pretty great because at one point,

250
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,840
they made a change to Nextcloud just before the lug meeting and it broke. So Roger says they were

251
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,000
able to use the snapshots that they got with the automatic backups and just roll it back.

252
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,520
So it was basically a non-issue. And then after the lug was over, they were able to

253
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,400
continue on with the Nextcloud update. And that's just an example of how you can use Linode, you

254
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,280
know, to run your own Zoom instance. Or they also have a one-click deployment for owncast,

255
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,640
which is essentially a Twitch in a box. You can use it for that as well. There's so many different

256
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,680
choices from hosting your website to their object storage. Like I use it for like a sync thing

257
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,600
instance. Just go try it out, learn something, and experiment with that $100 and support the show

258
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:48,640
at linode.com slash SSH. Now, in case you haven't heard, we're getting together in Denver. I'm

259
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,680
looking forward to this. And not only is Alex going to be there, but he's going to be our trivia

260
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,320
master at the meetup. So you got to come just to say hi to Alex. Looking forward to that. I've

261
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,120
been working hard on the trivia questions. I promise you there'll be a bunch of Linux questions.

262
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,120
There'll be some, you know, general knowledge stuff, but there's also going to be some like

263
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,480
older, more esoteric hardware questions as well. I've been having a real fun digging out some of

264
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,600
these questions. I'm looking forward to that. So we'll have the meetup details. We have two

265
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,000
meetups actually planned. Alex is going to be at the Denver meetup, but there's also a Salt Lake

266
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
City meetup on the books. Details are over at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting. And then

267
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,640
additionally in LadyJupes, my RV, I will have a live tracker and there will be more details

268
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,400
and if it works out, we'll do a little micro meetup. Could just be, you know, just come by

269
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,680
and say hi and we'll have this embedded web page that you'll be able to view over at ColonyTracker.live

270
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,760
that'll show you right where we are at. It's all in the works right now. Just in this last week,

271
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,320
we got the backend set up for own tracks to record where I'm actually going to be at. And

272
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,080
that's a pretty neat deal, Alex. How are you doing that? Is that up on Linode or something?

273
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,520
Oh yeah, of course. Of course. Naturally.

274
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:08,880
Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, we just decided to do a dedicated lower end Linode,

275
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,880
because what we want to do is put a little website on there that has the details and stuff. And then

276
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,680
own tracks itself is kind of like in multiple components. And so the recorder is a Docker image

277
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,600
that you can deploy. And that's like a lightweight backend that stores the location data. And you can

278
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,440
publish your location information to it in two different ways, either over HTTP, or you can

279
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,760
publish your location information to it in two different ways, either over HTTP, or over MQTT.

280
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,880
And then the recorder, as the name implies, records the information and then makes your

281
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:45,680
location data available, which is all completely under your control via a various set of APIs,

282
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,960
some of which can integrate directly into Home Assistant. So you can actually use own tracks

283
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,360
to provide Home Assistant with your real time location, which is a fantastic way to control

284
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,440
automations. And one way that we use this, not with own tracks today, but soon, is when no one

285
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,400
is at home. If some of the lights, which always happens, get left on, which never fails to get

286
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,200
left on, then if no one's home and a certain amount of time has passed, the lights just

287
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,080
automatically turn off. And that's just a simple way to use the automations. Or in the winter,

288
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,000
if we're approaching and it's cold, the heating turns on. Really simple stuff, stuff that we just

289
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,240
don't want to even have to think about. But the key is getting your location into Home Assistant,

290
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,880
and own tracks can essentially be that source of information. I'm using it for a live embedded map

291
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,960
on a web page, so that way you guys can find me and we can meet up. And I'll be running the own

292
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,560
tracks client, which publishes that information to the recorder on my pixel. That's so cool that it

293
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,000
uses MQTT to do that. Yeah, isn't it? It's clever. It seems like actually a great use of it because

294
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,960
you could see how, when you have maybe a loss of connectivity, it could queue up. And then when you

295
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,400
connect, it can just transmit the bits that were queued while you had no signal. It's really smart.

296
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,160
Perfect. It's exactly what it was designed for. Now, my favorite robot vacuum firmware,

297
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,960
Valitudo, had a big release last month, and I finally got around to updating it and installing

298
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,360
it this week. I'm a glutton for punishment, aren't I? There's lots of stuff breaking and

299
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:24,560
I still go ahead and install these updates. And guess what? What? Did it break? Well,

300
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,120
I mean, no, the updates went fine, but there'd been some changes to how the vacuums get

301
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,120
communicated with from Home Assistant. They've deprecated the vacuum.send command, which was

302
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,600
what I used to say, hey robot, go, you know, hoover the bedroom or something. And they've

303
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:51,040
deprecated it for an MQTT publish command. So we're both using MQTT here in wildly different

304
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,840
use cases, but I just think that's so cool how it's the same technology. It is pretty neat. And

305
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,800
just as a side note, I hate it when stuff like that gets deprecated. I think the whole Z-Wave

306
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:08,480
stack that I'm using in Home Assistant has been deprecated, and I just don't want to reset up my

307
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,000
Z-Wave network. And I don't know what that migration process is like, and I just don't

308
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,320
want to deal with it. And that kind of goes back to your topic earlier. It's working. I don't want

309
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,280
to break it. I don't want to have to do anything with it because it's just so part of my infrastructure

310
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,800
now. It no longer feels like a separate system. It feels like it is part of my home, and I don't like

311
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,240
messing with that stuff anymore. And equally, because it is part of the house, the uptime

312
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,880
needs to be as close to 100% as possible. And then you have to balance that off against applying

313
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,120
updates because it's part of your house. You don't want to not update it for 10 years.

314
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,200
I mean, some people would just say, if it's working, leave it. But I keep it up to date

315
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,400
because I feel like I want to be compatible with future technology and future functionality.

316
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,000
I mentioned to you earlier, I was like, maybe I should rebuild the whole setup and I should base

317
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,680
it on virtualization because the safety that a virtual machine gives me, that snapshot capability

318
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:10,640
and that holistic restoring of a system or taking a copy of it and setting it on a shelf and saying,

319
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,560
this is known good. That is so appealing to me. And it feels like it gives me a safety net to what

320
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,200
seems like a risky proposition to keep updating all of these systems all the time.

321
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,360
That's where I keep thinking, maybe I got to rethink the way I'm doing stuff. And that's

322
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,280
where I go down the rabbit hole and go, oh, it's too much. Not right now.

323
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,560
Mason Do you use a hypervisor at all for anything?

324
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,120
Ben No. Right now, the system's built around

325
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,840
these Raspberry Pis. There's not a lot of overhead there. So I'm just running containers on Ubuntu

326
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,920
LTS on Pi 4. But I would be willing to replace, you know, the two or three Raspberry Pis it takes

327
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:53,680
to do this with one fairly low energy x86 machine. And then I'd have sort of my, you know, my choice

328
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,120
of virtualizers at that point. Mason

329
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,840
Well, good news for you. Proxmox have just had a big release.

330
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:05,840
Version 7 was released on the 6th of July 2021. And it's based on Debian Bullseye number 11.

331
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,720
I'm sure most of you know this bit of trivia, but those of you coming to the Denver meetup

332
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,160
might want to pay attention. I might have given a question away there. Damn it.

333
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,760
Ben I love it. No, that's good. That's good.

334
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,800
Because if they're a listener, they get a heads up and no one else will know.

335
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,120
Mason Free trivia question coming your way.

336
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,960
Which kids movie does Debian name its releases after? Maybe you'll know. Maybe you won't.

337
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,560
It's just the sort of thing you have to come to the meetup and find out about.

338
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,200
Ben All right.

339
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,960
Mason Now what else is included in this release? They've got a bunch of new

340
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,360
versions of stuff. So ZFS is now 2.04. QEMU has been bumped to version 6.

341
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:50,880
And there's a new kernel 5.11. So it's really good to see that Proxmox are pushing the envelope

342
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,440
here and updating lots of their core systems. The reason I say that in particular is because

343
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,880
Debian has a bit of a reputation for being a bit old and crusty. And you look at the versions of

344
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,440
some of these packages and they're not that far off what is shipping in Arch.

345
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,760
Ben Right. I mean, a 5.11 kernel is older than what's in Arch, but it's newer than what's in

346
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,520
most LTS distros right now. And they've rolled out more recent ButterFS support, which I think

347
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,120
is kind of a big deal. It's nice to see essentially ButterFS and ZFS get near parity support in

348
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,680
Proxmox.

349
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Mason It absolutely is. And I think this comes

350
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:29,280
back to a point that I hear quite frequently on Linux Unplugged actually is that we need to start

351
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:36,160
taking ButterFS seriously and stop just treating it as a bit of a joke because Facebook and all

352
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:42,560
these other massive companies that have things at significant scale are putting a lot of blood,

353
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,240
sweat and tears into the ButterFS subsystems. And it does seem to be cropping up in more and more

354
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:56,640
places. And for me, I'm actually starting to use Proxmox as my default distro for server OSs,

355
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:04,240
because it has ZFS baked in. So I don't need to futz about with DKMS or an AUR package to

356
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,320
install a custom kernel. I don't have to worry about the licensing. It's just taken care of.

357
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,920
I mean, the same is true of Ubuntu. But the thing that Proxmox gives me most out of all of this

358
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:22,480
other stuff is a really slick web UI to manage virtual machines and LXC containers.

359
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,920
Ben Great point. And I think that is something

360
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:32,400
that you and I probably underplay. I think for a lot of new users, that's like the biggest deal.

361
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,960
Ben Right. Yeah, absolutely.

362
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,720
Ben Yeah, I completely agree on your points about ButterFS too. I think

363
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,760
the thing that you have to remember is what ButterFS offers is a file system that does

364
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,080
copy on write, transparent compression. It can offer encryption, it can offer SSD trim support,

365
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,840
and it's extremely low memory. So it works really good, say like in a Raspberry Pi situation,

366
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,360
or in a laptop with a single SSD. Those are some use cases where ZFS is really not a great

367
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:09,360
choice there. And I really love the combination of the two. I think it makes for a really reliable

368
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,240
home server. And the way I use it now is ButterFS is on the root file system. So the system can boot

369
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,080
regardless of what's going on with ZFS. If your DKMS module fails to build for some weird reason,

370
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,680
which has happened to me, your system still boots because the core system, the file system,

371
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,640
is ButterFS. And then your really large data sets with your multiple disks that are in some sort of

372
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,160
RAID configuration, that's where I go ZFS. And that mounts almost every time the system reboots.

373
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,280
But if it doesn't, because the root is ButterFS, it's guaranteed I can get in there and get the

374
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,720
system repaired. And we can then get other things online like getting ZFS to mount.

375
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,360
And perhaps the biggest feature that we haven't touched on, the single most important improvement

376
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,400
in Proxmox 7, I can now download ISOs in the web UI. Hooray!

377
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,320
Oh yeah. So you give them a URL and it downloads, or does that mean you can download it to your

378
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,120
machine?

379
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,600
Both. So what happens is you plug the URL into the little form that says I want to

380
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,240
download it to this particular area of storage. And then at the bottom, this is a really nice

381
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,320
feature. It has an optional box at the bottom for you to fill in the MD5 hash in there.

382
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,600
So it will automatically verify the download for you as part of its automated process.

383
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,320
Now, a lot of people seem to think that Proxmox isn't free as in cost. It's open source.

384
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,640
So it's free as in speech and it is also free as in beer. The reason I thought it wasn't free

385
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,920
is because it has this little nag screen that says you do not have a valid subscription for

386
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,040
this server. And all that simply means is you have the enterprise repos enabled, which are

387
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,960
some air quotes, better tested packages. I don't know quite what that testing entails,

388
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,840
but that's what the Proxmox team say anyway. And so you can support the project and give

389
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:05,760
them money and they will enable your server to get rid of that nag message. Or you could

390
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,640
use automation. You could use, I've written an Ansible role, which several of our community

391
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,760
have now contributed to as well because open source is just that awesome. And what that does

392
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,840
is it goes in and removes the repos for you, changes a couple of lines in the web UI files

393
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:28,160
on the Proxmox system and removes the nag for you automatically. Just one more use case for automation.

394
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,400
And speaking of automation, we want to mention our friends over at a Cloud Guru have a course

395
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,040
that we'll have linked in the show notes just for you. It's the Red Hat Certified Specialist

396
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,480
in Advanced Automation and Ansible Best Practices. In this course, they're going to cover the topics

397
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,000
on the EX-447 exam as well to make sure you're ready to take that. If you're planning on expanding

398
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,760
your Ansible knowledge, this is a great course for you. You'll have a better understanding

399
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,200
of the topics on the exam and around Ansible and Ansible Tower and managing an Ansible inventory,

400
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,440
and of course, templates as well. So you'll have to go over to our show notes to get the link to

401
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,280
go directly to this course. That, of course, is over at selfhosted.show slash 49. You'll see the

402
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,760
link for ACG and that'll take you to the Red Hat Certified Specialist in Advanced Automation for

403
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:22,640
Ansible Best Practices. Did you get the update to your Shield yet? Alex, I am so, so disappointed

404
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:29,120
in this. I loved the Nvidia Shield so much. I've bought three of them in total. I've recommended

405
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:37,200
them to the audience. And I know that some people out there have also noticed that Nvidia has decided

406
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,200
to improve your experience by taking the top row, which used to be reserved for your favorite

407
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:54,000
applications, and now put full wide advertisements right there at the top, including folks in bondage,

408
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,560
folks doing all kinds of crazy things, like guns and violence and smoking. I've seen the whole

409
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,320
range. Thankfully, we're not really that kind of... It doesn't really bother me that much,

410
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,520
and it's in my bedroom. It's not like the family uses it all the time. But I really do not like

411
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,720
the fact that I cannot turn it off. And I think it's on my list to replace now, Alex.

412
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,120
I'm really disappointed. It's such a great device. Yeah, it's been a really interesting one to watch

413
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:29,200
the kind of cancel culture online react to this one. I mean, on the one hand, I don't really care

414
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:37,840
that much. They've taken an interface that was very clean and just got the job done and didn't

415
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,640
really have any cruft to it whatsoever. And then, as you say, they've polluted it with a bunch of ads.

416
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,680
I mean, that on the one hand sounds pretty terrible. But I mean, on the other hand,

417
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:56,000
I just don't find myself really caring all that much. I've been browsing the Nvidia Shield

418
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,800
subreddit for the last few years, and there's lots of people now posting custom launchers

419
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,720
that you can install on the Nvidia Shield. I mean, it's just Android underneath, right? So,

420
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,360
you could install a custom launcher if you want to. And I think all this is going to serve to do

421
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:18,160
is motivate those who do care about such things to release better quality third-party launchers

422
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,720
rather than relying on the Google-provided one. I think I'll probably just switch it to an Apple TV.

423
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,760
I have found that the Apple TVs perform even better than the Nvidia Shield, which I felt like

424
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,880
was pretty well-performant. This is the exact kind of thing that will never happen on the Apple TV

425
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,840
platform. And the UI has been very consistent now for years. The other thing is that it wakes

426
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,680
and it controls the TV more consistently than the Nvidia Shield has too. So, I think I'm just

427
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,560
going to switch it out. I wanted to keep it because I like the idea of having both. And I

428
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:58,240
really love Kodi. That's a big reason why I keep the Shield is I really love Kodi. But Infuse on

429
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,400
Apple TV, it replaces Kodi. In fact, I actually have to say, I think maybe Infuse is probably

430
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,600
better because it's just a newer app built with more modern technologies. And I think

431
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:15,440
and they've just steadily added the features you need. It doesn't quite have the plugin ecosystem

432
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,280
that Kodi does, but Infuse is a really great local file playback, play from your file shares,

433
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,920
all that kind of stuff. And it syncs via iCloud to your other Apple TVs. So, your settings,

434
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:35,200
you set it up once and it's... Oh, and also out of the box supports syncing play status with Plex.

435
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,560
And I can't remember if it does Jellyfin, but it's a really good app. And so, it does the job

436
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,240
that Kodi does. And so, I think it's just time to... I think I'm done with Android TV. I'm going

437
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,520
to keep a couple of Chromecasts around and that's going to be it. Well, if there's one thing we've

438
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,120
learned from the internet, it's the adverts always make everything better. I mean, YouTube's better

439
00:39:53,120 --> 00:40:00,560
because of all the ads. Radio is better because of adverts, right? I mean, I struggle to think

440
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,880
of a single example where an advert makes things better. I think I wouldn't have even minded as

441
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,960
much if it was only showing ads for services that I maybe have active logins for on the device.

442
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,840
But it's showing me advertisements for services that I don't have and will never subscribe to.

443
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:21,040
So, that drives me crazy. And then I think the other thing is if it was at the bottom of the UI,

444
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,840
if they hadn't taken the row of icons and lowered it. And so, now you have to navigate down and

445
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,480
that would have been better as well. What do you make of the argument that the Nvidia Shield was

446
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:39,760
a premium device? This is quite a pervasive argument on Reddit that it's a $200 device.

447
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,720
It's a premium device. I've chosen this over something like the Google Chromecast, the new one

448
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,760
with the remote that has this same UI, by the way. What do you make of that argument? Because to me,

449
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,440
I think I kind of agree with it in that, yeah, one of the reasons I paid for the Shield, I paid

450
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,960
the extra money for two of them in this house, was because it was so blazing fast and because

451
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,680
I didn't have this stuff rammed down my throat without asking for it. Nvidia have just patched

452
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,840
this thing for years and years and years, and it's just been very reliable. And unlike you,

453
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,920
I'm left feeling rather deflated about it. Yeah, it feels like a play to get affiliate

454
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,640
revenue for stream signups. And it's like they have a user base out there. They're not selling

455
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,240
them as much anymore because they're not as competitive as they used to be. And there's

456
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,360
cheaper options out there. And I think the Apple TV is starting to eat up some of its market share

457
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,200
as well, because I think other people have realized it's a better box as well. And so I

458
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,760
think Nvidia felt, let's monetize what we've got here because they get some ongoing affiliate

459
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,920
revenue from those subscriptions, depending on the deals they work out. That's too tempting,

460
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,520
I think, for them to say no to. And I do agree that it is a premium device. It absolutely is.

461
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,760
I think $200 is on the cheap end. I think if you buy the... The first one I ever bought was the one

462
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,960
with like the big hard drive and all that, and the controller. I want to say that was like $300

463
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:07,200
or something. I bought that box because Rokus and cheaper boxes had that kind of crap. It's one of

464
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,760
the reasons I didn't get a Fire is because the Amazon Fire does this as well. It's rows of

465
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,520
advertisement. And so I didn't buy an Amazon Fire. And so I didn't buy a Roku. I bought an Nvidia

466
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:26,000
Shield specifically because it didn't have this crap on it, right? And so to have them retroactively

467
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,840
add that, like that wasn't the deal, bro. When I spent $300 on your kit, this wasn't the deal.

468
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,720
I just hate it. And I think the custom launcher solution is not a bad one, and maybe one I will

469
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,600
explore, but it's unfortunate. It's sort of like when people tell you to solve the problems with

470
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,080
an Android phone by flashing a custom ROM on there, it's like, come on, man. Yeah, I know you

471
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,600
can do that, but most consumers aren't going to do that. They're just not.

472
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,760
On that note, Will actually wrote in, and that's why we're talking about this, asking if you could

473
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,560
put lineage on the Shield. And I think that's a pretty interesting idea, actually. I don't think

474
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:07,200
it's supported today, but certainly moving forward, I could see a much more motivated community

475
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,440
emerging around this kind of stuff now. I tell you what, if a decent lineage image showed up for that

476
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,000
thing, I'd try it. Yeah, me too. And I mean, even though I just said most people aren't going to,

477
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,040
the vast majority of consumers who bought this won't. I'd use it. Now, another option you've got

478
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:28,080
is to replace the TVLauncher.apk via TeamWinRecoveryProject to one of the old versions

479
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,040
of the launcher that doesn't have ads on the home screen. You'll need to unlock your bootloader to

480
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,160
do that, but it doesn't require root or anything like that. Well, David from North Carolina wrote

481
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,640
in, he said, I'd love to know a little more details around the solar panels that Alex recently had

482
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,040
installed, especially since they seem to integrate with Home Assistant. I've been trying to convince

483
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,440
my wife that it would be a worthwhile investment. Love the show and keep up the work. Thanks, David.

484
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,400
And I think he's like extra excited because he's from your home state. Yeah, North Carolina. Hey,

485
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,160
David, how you doing? Is it called a home state now? I mean, your new home state?

486
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:06,960
Is it? I don't know. I still refer to England as home, and I still watched England crash out of the

487
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,760
Euros in the final, and I still went like a small child when that happened, but you know.

488
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,840
But you also have the first state that you called home in the U.S. It's also the first state where

489
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,080
it's the first place in the world where I had a child. So, you know, there is that. So I think

490
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:28,160
it's like as far as states go, it's your home state. Yeah, it probably is. So what do you think?

491
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,640
You got details for them? I've got a few, yeah. I don't have, you know, specific model numbers or

492
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,840
anything like that, but I went to a company called NC Solar Now. I looked at Tesla and a few others,

493
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:43,680
but the NC Solar Now folks were the ones that came out with the, you know, the best overall

494
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,920
price and package and service and financing and all that kind of stuff. And I ended up going for

495
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,600
a SolarEdge system, and this has a home assistant integration which connects to the, they've got

496
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:01,360
this website, and it will connect through the API to the website for up to 15 times an hour,

497
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:07,040
I think. It can poll the website through the API. And it was just a case of providing an API key.

498
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,720
It took literally five minutes to set it up. I had to spend an extra few hundred dollars on the

499
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:20,480
little Zigbee monitoring device to enable the inverter that's outside to talk to the internet,

500
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,680
because by default it doesn't come with any Wi-Fi capabilities. But apart from that, you know,

501
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,520
extra few hundred dollars to get the monitoring capabilities, yeah, it's been very straightforward

502
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:37,360
to set it up. And not only does it talk to home assistant, but the SolarEdge company also provides

503
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,320
a really nice dashboard and a really pretty slick mobile app as well. So I've got a little widget on

504
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,880
my Android home screen that tells me exactly what my solar is doing right now, which is pretty cool.

505
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:57,040
That's great. Yeah. I love that they're using Zigbee for that. Just the thing, Zigbee's all

506
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,360
over the place here. Nate wrote into the show asking about security implications for sharing

507
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,320
Ansible playbooks publicly. You know, he sees them on GitHub, all of that. He got thinking about this

508
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,160
after he listened to an episode of the Darknet Diaries, and he wondered if you have any thoughts

509
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,000
on it. Well, all of my stuff's open source on github.com slash ironic badger slash infra.

510
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,480
You know, I have open sourced everything for years now. That's kind of my default policy.

511
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,760
So I sure hope there isn't a privacy implication of doing that, you know?

512
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,000
Good answer. Yeah.

513
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,880
I do encrypt everything using Ansible Vault. So all of my secrets and things like that are

514
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:41,760
stuck behind AES-256 encryption. So hopefully, unless I commit a secret directly in clear text,

515
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,040
I think I'm okay. Yeah. I just, you know, when I go through your GitHub,

516
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,720
I just look at it. I think, you know, everything looks pretty good except for that passwords.txt

517
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,040
file where you just put all your passwords in there. Well, funny story on that. I actually

518
00:46:53,040 --> 00:47:00,160
published my Gmail password one time to that repo. And I had a guy, a listener in Australia,

519
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,200
message me like it must've been first thing in the morning for him because it was just before

520
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,760
I went to bed saying, hey, by the way, did you know that commit you pushed 12 minutes ago has

521
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,280
your Gmail password in it? And I'm like, okay, first of all, thank you for letting me know. Secondly,

522
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,000
it was 12 minutes ago. Like, were you just waiting for me to push something?

523
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,800
He's got some sort of like alert.

524
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:30,800
So to get around that, Nick Busey from the Home Lab OS project helped me out with a pre-commit

525
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:37,760
hook that I have in my Git repo that just checks that my secrets file is encrypted before I push

526
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,120
and do a Git commit and push. That's been very, very useful. It doesn't protect against me actually

527
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:49,040
putting API keys and variables and stuff like that directly into other files, which, you know,

528
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,360
there comes a point where you've got to be like, right, okay, this, you know, my safety net is

529
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:59,920
checking that file is encrypted or not. It's not going to go and scan every single file. So yeah,

530
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,760
I guess it's up to you whether you feel comfortable with that risk or not. And I tend to think that

531
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,240
I tend to think that even if you're using a private repo on GitHub, you may as well treat

532
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,280
that as a public repository anyway, because one day it will be whether you like it or not. So.

533
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,280
And it really just means, can you stick to like a good hygiene with that kind of stuff?

534
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,040
If you'd like to get your question in or have a comment or something you think we should check

535
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,800
out, let us know. Go over to self-hosted.show slash contact. And you can go to self-hosted.show

536
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,600
slash SRE to show your support for the show. Yeah. Become a member, get access to the post

537
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:39,280
show and of course help us keep the show on the tracks. I think this episode, we're going to talk

538
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,160
about the future of the gasoline engine and the internal combustion engine. Oh, I have thoughts

539
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:50,080
on that. Interesting. Yeah, me too. Now I was browsing some, I always seem to come up with

540
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,280
YouTube on these things, don't I? But anyway, about steam trains the other week. And I found

541
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:01,280
this union Pacific steam loco called the big boy. And this thing is freaking enormous. And it was

542
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:08,400
designed in the early part of last century to get over some of the Rocky mountain passes because

543
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:14,800
they're just so vast here and the trains are so heavy. And so union Pacific have actually restored

544
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,920
one of these big boy steam locos, which is essentially two massive steam locos glued

545
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,080
together. This thing has basically two sets of drive wheels and two full sets of pistons. And

546
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:32,160
it's just awesome. Just go look it up. Big boy union Pacific steam loco. And it's going on tour

547
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:38,800
in August around the US. So it's leaving Cheyenne, Wyoming and going all the way down to Houston

548
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:45,840
past our beloved cheese bacon hometown of Beaumont. I know he lives in Denver now, doesn't he? Okay.

549
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,960
Well, so much for that. You could say it's his original hometown though. So much for that plug.

550
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,080
So yeah, it's going up to, I think, through Dallas at some point and then up through Kansas

551
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:02,160
city in St. Louis. So if you're in the center of the country, by all means, go take some pictures

552
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,000
for me, cause I'm not going to be able to make that one. But throughout August, it's traversing

553
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,480
the country. That does look like an incredible route actually. We'll have a link in the show notes.

554
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,320
When you go there, they have a map that shows you the route that they're going to be on. Well,

555
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,320
you know, it's either side of our Denver meetup, don't you? So I reckon if you were creative with

556
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:22,880
your schedule, Chris, you could probably find it for a day. Our route for the Denver meetup in

557
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:31,600
total is going to be just over 5,000 miles. That's a long way. I drove that myself in 2018. We flew

558
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:38,640
into Orlando, drove up to DC, drove down to Austin to meet you for the first time, and then up to

559
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,400
Denver. And that was about 5,000 miles. We did that in three weeks in a car. I mean, it wasn't

560
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,800
our house. No, I'm going to be in a land yacht. Yeah, that's for sure. But if you're going to be

561
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,400
in the area, don't forget that we have those meetups coming up and you can get details

562
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,200
at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting. Make sure you don't miss the next episode,

563
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:03,040
episode 50. We've got some cool stuff lined up for you. And rumor has it there might be some swag.

564
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:09,520
Hmm. In the meantime, you can find Alex on Twitter. He is at Ironic Badger. I'm at Chris

565
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:16,960
Elias, and the show is at Self Hosted Show. And thanks for listening, everybody. That was

566
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:42,960
Self Hosted Show slash 49.
