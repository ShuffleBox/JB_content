1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
Well, I'd like to extend a congratulations to Sir Lewis Hamilton on his 8th world driver's title this this past weekend

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,240
Wow

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,680
I've only got two. I mean technically he didn't actually win because of some oh utter shenanigans in the formula one management camp

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,800
But that's probably saved that's probably best saved for a rant down the pub sometime

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,480
Oh, I know it was rough alex. I saw your twitter feed and it was going to be a rough recording day for you

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, man, you know, I followed formula one since I was

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,480
Six seven years old so a long time

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,120
And what went down on sunday?

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,280
Ranks as the most corrupt fixed thing i've ever seen in sport. I think possibly ever

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,920
If you're not a formula one fan, you have no idea what i'm talking about

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,840
but if you are hopefully you're in solidarity with me and lewis because it was uh

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,240
Yeah, it wasn't cool

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,600
Your faith has been shaken. I can tell. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,440
Why do I bother getting emotionally involved in something where they can just change the rules in the last lap? That's the

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,840
that's the crux of my

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
of my beef

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,040
Hmm, I hear you

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,800
I hear you see I get

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,640
I get really upset when uh

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840
When I just watch sports

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,440
I generally just I either get like really super sucked in in any kind of sport or I cannot pay attention at all

22
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,800
It's one or the two for me. And so it's not generally a pleasant experience

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,280
I mean i'm used to disappointment. I have been an english football fan my entire life

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,480
And I am used to not winning major tournaments or going out at some highly tense moment

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,960
But at least the rules of engagement are followed from end to end. However, corrupt fifa may or may not be

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,720
uh, but the fia man who that was some

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
Grade a horse manure on sunday

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,040
This will never be forgotten. This will be the day never

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,520
and i'm i'm sorry, I mean, you know max Verstappen he is a worthy world champion, but

30
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,440
This is his first and it will forever in my opinion be tarnished. So, uh

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,920
unfortunate for him, but

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
It's the way it goes sometimes

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,760
anyway, should we talk about something that is a little less morbid and uh, well depends on your point of view I suppose this uh,

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,720
This aws outage this this past week

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,800
It's a little rough for some and once again, I don't know why but this is maybe my favorite part

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,120
AWS is a big old outage you go to their status page. Everything's green. It's all good. Alex. Nothing's down

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,320
Meanwhile, the services you depend on are just totally not working

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,940
And now amazon just said that network devices got overloaded. That was their essential

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Basic statement on the problem like oh quite the post-mortem there. Okay network devices got overloaded. All right

40
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,240
Why why didn't your status page work that kind of stuff? That's like saying, you know, i've just crushed into a tree

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,320
Well, why did you crash into a tree alex? Well because I didn't turn

42
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,400
My wheel enough to stay on the road. Yeah, I mean technically that's accurate. Why didn't you turn your wheel enough? Oh, I don't know

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,840
Yeah, that's true. Uh, they do say they're gonna work on trying to get the uh status page working better though

44
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,000
But along with this we've also I mean this is a trend we've talked about before it's like everything goes along

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,000
It's working great until there's an outage

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,600
And so a lot of things quit working that are associated with this

47
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,320
Some of the services we use to produce the shows quit working

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,200
Uh, and then kind of unrelated to this I believe wise also had an api outage so you couldn't get access to your wise devices

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,640
And as they expand into door locks and other things like that motion sensors and whatnot like that matters a lot

50
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,080
Absolutely does. Yeah, I mean i'm not

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,260
I'm not party to any of the internal amazon discussions

52
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,480
That uh, you know is to root cause analysis and that kind of thing

53
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,760
but what I do find interesting are the

54
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,200
butterfly effect impacts to smart home users and things like

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,000
Right, right

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,400
We've put a few links in the show notes that I just got from twitter by typing in smart home aws outage

57
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,720
And I found people whose christmas lights weren't working whose robo vax weren't working whose smart plugs had stopped working

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,120
All because the cloud in us east one had had stopped working

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
And I mean, you know stuff like my home assistant nebu kasa

60
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,960
That stopped working for a few hours because that must have some reliance somewhere on amazon and

61
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,400
You know, you look at the the way in which aws telly to architect your systems, you know, they

62
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,040
Pioneered the availability zone concept. They pioneered the multi-region concept

63
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,680
The trouble is certain core services like root 53, for example their dns service

64
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Are based out of us east one

65
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,920
So if that site goes down doesn't matter how highly available your system is you can still be impacted by outages like this

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Yeah, and there's so many things that you

67
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
end up using they

68
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,960
They're either services applications or devices that become dependent on something like amazon

69
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
And you don't even know it until it's out

70
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,320
Like I didn't realize some of the podcasting tools we were using

71
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,360
Actually, we're on amazon and we're using that particular data center. I found out though. I found out the hard way

72
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,720
It makes you really stop and think about the homogenization of the internet in general really, you know stuff like cloudflare and amazon

73
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,120
Uh to some extent google, uh, although I don't think their compute is terribly well utilized

74
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,400
Or i'm probably way off base with that given how big google itself is

75
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,640
Uh azure as well, you know, you know, there's five or six companies that control the lion's share of the internet's traffic

76
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,840
And if one of those companies has a problem then we all do which makes me question

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:48,800
What's the point in architecting for high availability and spending all these hours spinning our wheels on kubernetes clusters and all these other

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,240
complex abstractions on top of

79
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,800
these sandcastles effectively of cloud architecture when

80
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,160
When no matter how much work I put in to keep something available

81
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,920
Something completely beyond my control somewhere else down the pipe is going to cause a blockage

82
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,240
yeah, the other thing that drives me kind of crazy about it is we're really not taking advantage of some of the strengths of tcpip and

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
The way the internet can be routed around

84
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:24,400
It it really lends itself to a decentralized internet and what we've done for convenience and quality of service and whatever

85
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,520
Is we've centralized and we're ignoring one of the key original design strengths of the whole network by doing so

86
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,680
And I don't I don't know if the solution is is all of us, you know, we just self-host even harder. I mean that definitely

87
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,600
helps isolate us individuals from these outages

88
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,480
But there are circles of the internet that are talking more on and more about

89
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:53,600
Decentralization and ways they can they can become more available and and less of a single point of failure

90
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,700
I was just talking with dave jones who is behind podcastindex.org

91
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:05,040
And they're using ipfs for some of their file storage trying to prevent any single point of failure for a server outage

92
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
Really makes you stop and think like

93
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,760
The mars rover or the mars copter I think is uh vulnerable to this log4j vulnerability

94
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,140
Like there's just so much there's so many libraries. There's so much abstraction

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,760
Between us and the hardware these days

96
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:28,080
It's really impossible for a mere mortal to keep track of where all this stuff and where all these dependencies are going to lie. So

97
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,040
You know, I don't know what the answer is

98
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,520
with regards to aws because clearly they are the dominant force in cloud computing, but

99
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,560
So far as i'm concerned in my own personal

100
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Fiefdom of my house

101
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,640
Uh, I you know, I didn't really notice a huge amount on the day-to-day

102
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Except for the nebucasa stuff when I was at the supermarket. I wanted to just turn the heating down a bit

103
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,520
Uh, because I thought we were coming straight home and we weren't you know, um

104
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,240
Besides that I didn't really notice a huge impact

105
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,640
Yeah, and that's because I use things like wled and for my smart lights and vale tudo for my robo vac and tasmota

106
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
For all my smart plugs

107
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,360
all of those things are

108
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,280
Basically disconnected from the internet and I fully own those pieces of hardware now

109
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,120
So that no matter what happens to those cloud services

110
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,080
i'm good, and this isn't to say, you know local good cloud bad because sometimes there are benefits to cloud services, but

111
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,920
Uh more and more. I think the layperson is beginning to understand maybe a bit like the privacy argument

112
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,320
There's there's just been enough times it's happened now where they're thinking. Hmm. Hold on a minute

113
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,920
Maybe there is something to this metadata collection. Maybe there is something to this internet of shit type stuff

114
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,760
Maybe there is yeah, that's a good point

115
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,980
It's like it is maybe each outage is kind of pushing it into a new wave of people that are recognizing

116
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,560
The problem I kind of just have this general philosophy too. It's like for an application to be whole

117
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,880
I prefer as much of it to be on my land

118
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,680
in part for security and privacy, but also

119
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,560
You know, I I started using the internet in an era of very limited bandwidth

120
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,840
I sometimes still have very limited bandwidth and I don't like just extra chatter going out over my internet connection that doesn't need to

121
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,040
Every packet matters in my opinion and why?

122
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,200
Why send spammy little packets that are just maybe like messages back and forth for what i'm typing when I could run all that

123
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
on my land so that definitely

124
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,520
is a mindset of mine that sort of

125
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
Has kind of I guess paid off

126
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,600
Over the years, you know old man doesn't want to use up his modem bandwidth

127
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,600
But you know as the as we just modernize and more things go online

128
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,960
There's also just things you have to use that are cloud-based. There's no way around it sometimes and

129
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,680
Yeah, it does go out

130
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,440
I I have yet to have it cause an actual genuine issue for me, you know

131
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,560
It's an inconvenience mostly maybe a show goes out a couple hours later, but in my it life

132
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,480
I did have lawyers as clients and there would often be like

133
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,440
This extreme time pressure to turn around a contract that has something to do with, you know, some 10 million dollar deal

134
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,440
And we did have a situation where the exchange server went down

135
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,280
And it was like red alert all hands on deck get this thing back up as fast as possible

136
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,200
We've got to get this email out because everybody's self-hosted back then and so you can also sometimes have these outages

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,320
When you self-host and you know in like i'm sure this is probably happened to everyone who's listening to self-hosted for a while

138
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,600
It's going to fail when you're on vacation or something like that

139
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,160
You know like my server here at the studio, which had been running fantastic, of course

140
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,840
Crashed while I was on my road trip and I was stuck in tucson and I couldn't get back here for a week to check

141
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,520
On what was going on

142
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,680
So that stuff happens when you self-host too, and you know, it's all on you to fix it

143
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,200
Speaking of I know I mentioned briefly that log4j vulnerability in the last bit

144
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,360
The linuxserver.io team have posted an info notice. I think this is a new thing

145
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,740
They've started doing over at info.linuxserver.io about the log4j vulnerability

146
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,040
Essentially, this is a very critical vulnerability in java

147
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,680
Which leads to denial of service and remote code execution in java apps

148
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,800
It's in java version 11. So it's quite a recent version of java

149
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,560
I think you and wes did a full breakdown in this week's land didn't you?

150
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,560
Yeah, we got all the details in there and the steps you'd have to go through to actually trigger the exploit

151
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
But spoiler is yeah

152
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,320
You could actually even get this thing to remotely connect to remote urls and pull down shell script and run it

153
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,840
So it's not good. It's not good at all. And ironically it was found by minecraft users

154
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:57,600
Who figured out they could take control of the minecraft server because most developers and for totally reasonable reasons

155
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,360
Are logging

156
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,800
The commands their users are entering into the shell so they know what the user was doing

157
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,800
And if you take advantage of that, well, you could probably guess where that leads

158
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,320
So there's a lot of minecraft servers out there that people have set up for themselves that are self-hosting that have to get updated

159
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,120
And you know what? I say good on linux server ios for uh going through and kind of letting people know what's up

160
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I think that's also pretty nice to see

161
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Just because I use a lot of their containers

162
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,080
The main one that stood out for me was the unify controller as being vulnerable. Obviously that's got some pretty

163
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,160
Pretty good network level access to your stuff. And so if there's a vulnerability there you want to be on top of it pretty quick

164
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Um, there is a version released now with a workaround applied as well as an upstream fix. So if

165
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,840
You're running unify from linux server in a container go ahead and pull down that update. There's a few others on the web page as well

166
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,440
Yeah, I know some of our listeners use uh airsonic and that's one that's currently vulnerable as well

167
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So watch out for that

168
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Now i've been in the market to buy guitars in the last couple of weeks joe and I have been talking endlessly about guitars lately

169
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,320
and uh

170
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
A lot of that has involved me

171
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,820
A lot of that has involved me f5ing a lot of websites to try and you know

172
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,460
See what's coming up on the use market all that kind of stuff

173
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,260
And so I thought there's got to be a better way to monitor these web pages and I came across an app pick

174
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
Called change detection.io

175
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:28,820
This thing bills itself as the best and simplest self-hosted open source website change detection monitoring and notification service

176
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,580
cool

177
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,220
This looks really good. It gives you a little dashboard and shows you when a page was last checked

178
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,460
When it last changed and then gives you buttons to check the difference to recheck it. Mm-hmm

179
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:48,020
This is so neat. It's really nice and some of the examples they ship out of the box are for things like the covid

180
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,500
UK government page for example

181
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,860
So, I mean if you wanted to know when the guidelines change for that for some reason

182
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,460
Uh, you could have this send you a notification with the diff of what changed so you don't even have to go to the website

183
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,460
And look it up

184
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:07,700
I have mine pointed at the gibson demo shop, for example, and you know for me it just lists

185
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,460
It just looks at the guitars that are on there and every time a new guitar gets added

186
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,380
I get a push notification through apprise to my phone with the link to the website so I can just click on the link and

187
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,500
Go and have a look at that new shiny guitar that I can't afford

188
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,780
Linode.com

189
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:30,260
Slash ssh and linode has done the work to make sure that log for shell is not going to be a problem on their infrastructure

190
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,540
It's where we host everything. They're so dang fast and they got 11 data centers around the world

191
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,060
We got a testimonial from deckbot recently says hey chris in the badger

192
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,740
I recently moved homes and in the process I knew I needed to put a home server into storage for about a month

193
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,580
The server is my samba server on zfs, but I also had two cores and eight gigs of ram dedicated to a minecraft vm

194
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,100
Knowing that they would still want to play while we were moving to the new house

195
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:00,660
I set up a five dollar nano to install the minecraft server and upload the world using linode's game server how to as a guide

196
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:07,140
Testing it though. It showed maybe things would work. Okay, but I saw crashes that we started to use it more and I realized

197
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,620
Minecraft was ram constrained

198
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,460
But linode's single click upgrade to the next nanode was fast flawless and fixed the service performance needs right away

199
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:22,660
Best of all the single core two gigabyte nanode on the cloud was beating the performance of my locally hosted two core

200
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
eight gig vm

201
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,900
You know what deckbot I see that all the time

202
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Like I say, I used to do things in vms

203
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,940
But this is what linode does they build and manage servers and they've been doing it for 18 years

204
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,940
So they know how to make these things fast

205
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,580
And on top of that they got a great dashboard and they have the best customer support in the business

206
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,580
It's where I test things. It's where I deploy things. It's where I learn about things

207
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,220
So go get a hundred dollars and try it out for 60 days kick the tires for yourself and support the show

208
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,880
linode.com slash ssh

209
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,400
New month new home assistant update. They just released their 2021.12 update

210
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,200
And along with that there was also a three-hour live stream. Uh, the big state of the stream project

211
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,720
Yeah, it's the end of the year. I think they're gonna just do this now all the time

212
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,320
Um before we get into the details of what they announced

213
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:20,040
Did you see the vr thing that they showed that how they do their team meetings now? I did it felt very uh,

214
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,360
Like a rudimentary version of ready player one or something like that, you know, yeah. Yeah

215
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,120
Yeah, uh, well paul has filed up on twitter and he said we at nubukasa, uh are doing all of our meetings in vr now

216
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,920
It feels more like being together compared to just a grid of webcam feeds, especially for our collaborative sessions

217
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,520
It's a big win

218
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,880
We use horizon workrooms on the oculus quest 2 which is the standalone headset that runs android

219
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,840
They don't connect to a pc or anything like that

220
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,720
And he says why it's better for them is number one reason is body language compared to webcam

221
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,720
Your hands and fingers are now included on the call so you can point to things you can gesture

222
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
You got emotions you can draw on a whiteboard

223
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,320
Spatial audio actually lets you know where people are and makes it more immersive. But here's the other thing I didn't consider

224
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
And this made me go, huh?

225
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,280
It's faster

226
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Vr is faster because webcams you're actually doing like an h264 video stream or something like that, right?

227
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Or vp8 or whatever

228
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,520
But in vr it's audio and then it's just the data

229
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,520
For the movements and stuff the updates for the movements and they're not actually sending the video feed of it

230
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
They're just sending the data feed

231
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,960
And so what you get is you fix this like oh, no you go. Oh, i'll go. Oh, can I oh

232
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,240
Uh, uh, uh, like that's gone now because the latency is so much better plus you can see people are like

233
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
You know gesturing with their hands and whatnot

234
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,560
Actually kind of made me think here's what I kind of clicked for me. I thought to myself this sounds so silly, right?

235
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
until then I thought

236
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Well, what if we use this for podcasting? Like what if you and I were doing this right now?

237
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,440
Right

238
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,600
That'd be pretty cool. That would be interesting

239
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,280
I'd I'd need to invest in some vr gear and obviously if I tell the wife, you know

240
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,560
I need to buy vr gear for podcasting, which is an audio medium

241
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,120
And I need some kind of expensive video headset. I think that I go over really well

242
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,820
Yeah, yeah, because really you're going to want to get like the upgraded strap and you're going to want the controls

243
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,000
Uh, so you're like 500 bucks on amazon and then like to get good headphones that plug into it easily

244
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,040
That's like another hundred bucks

245
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,680
So you're almost to the price point of the of the style that you can plug into a to the pc

246
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,920
And it actually has good graphics almost to a price point of a ticket to come and see you

247
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
Yeah

248
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,480
That's true

249
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,440
Yeah, oh, yeah. All right. Well anyways, uh, the other thing that they just kind of slipped in there

250
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,480
Maybe I missed this because I haven't been following this super closely

251
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,280
But you know the home assistant amber their little hardware device that they had crowdfunded. Well, I guess now it's called the home assistant yellow

252
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,480
So

253
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,320
The change in the name is still based on the pi compute module for still got that m2 expansion slot in the zigbee module

254
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,080
And gigabit ethernet

255
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
Uh, and it's still available to order

256
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,440
But uh, yeah, it's going to be a little bit I think before it's shipping and now it's called the yellow not the amber

257
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,280
well, like anything this year, you know, I think you just got to accept the fact that

258
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,800
You know, for example the 1080 ti that I have in my graphics card as in my gaming rig

259
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,560
I'm fine with that. I mean if I could have bought a 3080 or whatever at retail

260
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,520
For msrp i'd have probably done it but

261
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:33,560
You know, I think in in 2021, we just got to accept the fact and and 22 now that these shortages are going to continue

262
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,160
I think I was watching a

263
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:42,200
A jay's two cents video the other night where he was reciting some insider information that he has from his contacts at intel and nvidia

264
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,480
who

265
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,760
said

266
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,360
That the shortages at the end of 20 were going to continue through 21

267
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,440
And now they're saying the same thing at the end of 21. They're going to continue through the end of 22. So

268
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,000
Eh, it is what it is. We've all just got to end up being a bit more patient. I think

269
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,640
well, you know, I

270
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:06,440
There's a lot of negatives to it in the rv community. It's a massive problem parts are super short

271
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,760
and now there's rumors of a def a diesel exhaust fluid shortage, which

272
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
The diesel pusher rigs need to go down the road

273
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,000
So they're like the shortages. I don't want to make light of it. It's really bad

274
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,800
However, one silver lining that I would love to see out of it is people repurposing old pcs like i'm doing this

275
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,520
i'm kind of thinking like how can I just sort of spread stuff out a little bit or take advantage of stuff and

276
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Instead of going with something new

277
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:36,840
Trying to refurbish something old and I think that's actually a good way for us to be thinking absolutely more

278
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,600
Yeah, I mean all of the systems in my house are based around the eighth gen

279
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,960
Intel cpu socket i've got you know, my backup server my desktop my main system

280
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
my desktop my main server

281
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:54,440
And my work desktop. They're all you know, all four of those systems have uh, my blue iris system five

282
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,920
all five of those systems have eighth gen cpus in them so that if anything fails in there

283
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,440
I don't even have to think oh what generation of cpu does that specific motherboard have no

284
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,120
It's eighth gen it's done right and you know if you do the comparisons between an eighth and an eleventh or an eighth and a twelfth

285
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,280
Okay by you know four generations there might be 10 or 15 percent difference

286
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,440
But is it worth the thousands of dollars to upgrade at this point?

287
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:31,080
No, and I remember, you know, I remember like 10 years ago when I went from a core two duo to one of those uh, lga

288
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,280
1366 i7 960s

289
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:41,480
Oh that was like that was like lightning that thing and I think it coincided with getting an ssd for the first time

290
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
For the first time as well. Oh

291
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,440
Yeah, it's a sweet upgrade

292
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,960
We just don't have leaps like that anymore. I mean, I know mvme is a lot faster

293
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,040
than sata and

294
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,920
Ssd are a lot faster than spinning rust, but I think a lot of the main

295
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
speed generational bottlenecks

296
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,840
Between you know an eighth and a twelfth gen cpu. Okay. There's pcie gen four is a slight change but

297
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:10,280
On the daily i'm never really thinking god my computer's too slow these days. I

298
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,000
Think you're seeing kind of a big leap over in the apple side right now

299
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,480
And I was just thinking about this this morning, man

300
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,560
I was just thinking i'd really like the asahi linux project to just come along a little bit more so that way I could try

301
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:30,760
Out the m1 mac mini as a home server in the rv because the damn thing takes 28 watts at max load and that's at max

302
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:37,160
load and it takes a lot less down to like six or seven watts at low load, which is just I can't

303
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,360
I can't even fathom that I can't I've seen the numbers and I still don't believe it

304
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,400
And it makes for me like the perfect home server if they just if I could just get macOS off

305
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,680
My MacBook Pro that i'm using to record this episode right now

306
00:22:52,680 --> 00:23:00,280
According to iStat is using eight watts to drive a 4k monitor a 1080p monitor and the laptop internal display

307
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,160
Plus all the USB audio processing that it's doing and eight watts

308
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:12,040
So it's nice to see that kind of shift but yeah as far as like gear i'm using for my home systems and servers right now

309
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,160
Yeah, the older stuff is is plenty plenty fine

310
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,280
I mean i'm running i'm still running home assistant on the home assistant blue and on a raspberry pi

311
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,080
And I did do the new upgrade. I did the because on the on the blue, you know, i'm using their OS

312
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,080
So now i've been upgraded to their new OS

313
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,560
And to the new version of home assistant. It's got that brand new configuration panel. It looks a lot better. Yeah, I don't like it

314
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:41,480
Really? No, I think it's cleaner. You know, it's more organized. It feels I don't know more like how it should have been probably all along

315
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Hmm, maybe but it's you know

316
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,920
Commodity over here. It's changed for changes sake it feels, you know to get to my supervisor panel. It's an extra click now compared to what it used to be

317
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:57,000
True. Yeah, uh, I did. I did see some grousing online about that. I had to downgrade as well

318
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,480
I had a bunch of my automations stop working, uh, particularly around zigbee stuff. Oh, no, so I actually I went to uh,

319
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,520
Dot 12 dot zero, I guess

320
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,960
Uh, and then I upgraded to dot one

321
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,320
The zigbee stuff still wasn't working. So I was like, right i'm going back to dot 11 then

322
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,520
Uh, so there I will stay for a little while and see what happens

323
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,600
Crap I uh, I have not upgraded the rv yet. I've only upgraded the studio. That's how I do it

324
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,640
I do the studio first and then if the studio passes i'll do the it's no big deal with home assistant os and the

325
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,720
snapshots that you can take

326
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,480
so you just put them in google drive and then you just download it and restore and it's as if nothing happened, you know,

327
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:42,120
So my biggest fear is somehow some update writes something to my z-wave controller or something like that, you know

328
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,200
Don't hurt the z-wave network. Just yeah, I could see that. Yeah

329
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,440
So there was a new configuration panel. What about what did you think of the button entity stuff?

330
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,360
I like it. I've been waiting for something like this because

331
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,600
My wife likes to sometimes use the physical buttons on like a led

332
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,440
Light strip or or a smart plug. She'll sometimes if she's just there. She'll just use the button and that's great

333
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,640
But every now and then home assistant does lose state sync

334
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,000
And so it'll show off or on when we've pressed the button physically

335
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,320
And so now I think i'm just going to replace those with this kind of button, which just makes a lot more sense

336
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
just it's just

337
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,040
A switch you press it has a state on or off

338
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,080
But it doesn't move back and forth. It's just a switch that you press

339
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:33,240
It has a state on or off, but it doesn't move back and forth indicating what its state is. It just says like press

340
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,560
I think that's clean

341
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:42,120
I like to see this feature users can now be created that are able to log in only from the local network

342
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,440
So, you know if you want just a purely local user you can create that

343
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,520
I'm also pleased to see for you the new jellyfin integration

344
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,200
Yeah, how great of timing is this?

345
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,280
Yeah

346
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
um, the only problem is

347
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,960
currently

348
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,960
limited to music only

349
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,120
Which is not great. I'm sure they're going to get there, right?

350
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
But it's a good starting spot. We'll see

351
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,800
I would like to see of course video and all of that

352
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,800
Also nice that the hue integration now supports the version 2 of api for the hue lights and hue devices

353
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,320
Which means they show up a lot faster. That's good to see and I have a pie hole

354
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,600
I know you don't use pie hole

355
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,240
But I have pie hole and that integration has been updated to indicate when pie hole needs an update which is nice, too

356
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:32,440
A few integration changes one thing that came up in the presentation from powerless was some of the work that's been done

357
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,120
In the esp home project that's been upstream to other projects

358
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,040
Yeah, I actually tried setting up for my christmas tree. I did a bunch of

359
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,320
Led's for my christmas tree with running wled

360
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,360
connected to an esp8266 and

361
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,240
Back in the day. I've done a live stream with you actually a couple of years ago now

362
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:57,000
Yeah, where we had to create an arduino sketch and then upload it and then do all this esp tool-based flashing

363
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,400
Now you can just do it all in the browser and it picks it up in the browser

364
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,440
Oh man, you've got to try it. It's amazing

365
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,200
I love seeing that. Yeah, they give it they give it as due on the live stream now, too

366
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,240
Now that they're all part of the same family. That's good to see

367
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,680
And so I did do the home assistant os7 upgrade. I mean, there's not a lot in this one

368
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:25,960
Uh, the broadcom and atheros ethernet drivers got updated. That's good to see and this brings the linux kernel up to linux 5 10

369
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,400
8 3

370
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:33,900
The reason why that kind of matters is linux 5 10 is an lts kernel that will be maintained through the end of 2026

371
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,000
Um, and so if they're going to be rolling their own os

372
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,000
Which i've always kind of been hesitant about but i'm warming up to more and more as time goes on

373
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,800
When I see things like they're using the lts kernel that to me shows that they're making some good long-term thought choices

374
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:53,080
They're about like how to build something that's going to be potentially run on an iot device for a while

375
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,200
And I that made me feel a little better when I saw they're doing that

376
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,520
So I went ahead and did the upgrade first. I do the os update first. Well first I do a snapshot

377
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,040
Then I do the os update reboot everything and then when it comes back up

378
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,640
I do the home assistant update and uh, it all went pretty good for me. I I don't have nearly the

379
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,280
depth of automations here at the studio that I have at the rv or likely you have at home alex, so

380
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:22,920
I'll probably wait another week or two before I upgrade the rv just to make sure nothing's going on with zigbee and just to make

381
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,840
Sure nothing's going on with z wave and just to make sure my automations are okay

382
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,880
I mean look I know what's going to happen is if I post in the forum saying I had this issue someone's going to say

383
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,440
well, you've been ignoring this thing in your log files for the last six months this deprecation notice and

384
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,600
I don't know. I just can't be bothered to deal with it. So I downgraded for now

385
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,200
Anyway, speaking of which I think it's time. We did some feedback. Don't you?

386
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,840
Yeah, we wanted to do a bunch for this episode. In fact, we were going to mention it earlier. It's episode 60

387
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,520
It's a feedback special

388
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,120
Indeed 60 episodes. Wow. That's a that's a lot of episodes

389
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,200
When in fact if we've been doing weekly we were 120 by now

390
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,800
Whoa

391
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,080
You see my maths there was it's uh, that's quick pretty quick

392
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,940
Anyway red asks. Do you guys have any naming conventions for your home assistant automations?

393
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Oh, that's a great question

394
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,600
I should I if you were to look at my automations right now, I think i've

395
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,800
I think i've tried three different naming schemes

396
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,160
Uh, you know over the couple years that i've been running home assistant now

397
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,640
It's kind of embarrassing

398
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,760
You are an xkcd comic personified. Are you? Yeah, it's kind of embarrassing

399
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,760
I mean i'm trying to do something like I try and group them, you know button dash

400
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,160
office lights toggle

401
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,200
button dash toggle music room lamps, whatever it is

402
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,680
Uh climate dash

403
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,320
Up and downstairs set to 18 celsius that kind of thing at 8 a.m

404
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:53,160
I try and make the titles as descriptive as possible starting off with you know, the type of event first, you know

405
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
Integration I suppose first. Mm-hmm

406
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,800
Uh, and then if that doesn't work i'll do things like notify dash

407
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:05,480
So I just have like a single word and then a hyphen and then an explanation of what it does that seems to work. Okay?

408
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,760
Yeah, it's pretty close to what i've i've pretty much landed on

409
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,920
Mine's a little more rudimentary. It's just like if it's if it's a heater and it's being turned on it's heat on dash

410
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:22,060
Name a heater heat off dash name a heater, but i've pretty much retired all of those now that i'm using the generic thermostat

411
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,040
I used to have a whole bunch that started turn on turn off this turn on that

412
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,360
And when you're looking through a whole group of stuff

413
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,200
You kind of want to group things together a little bit like you want all the bedroom automations to be together

414
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
You want all the kitchen things to be together?

415
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,280
Yeah, and so, you know, you've just got to find a logical grouping that works for you and stick with it

416
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,360
That's how I would do it to

417
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,320
Do it so that way all the same areas look all in the same spot

418
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,800
When you're looking at the damn list

419
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,000
All right, alex

420
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,520
Our next one comes in on how to approach a company about building a home assistant integration based on their api

421
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,160
So this is a tricky one a listener of ours

422
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,600
Ran into um, and they have basically

423
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,200
Created an integration that they realize may actually get them in trouble. And so

424
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:14,360
They're wanting our opinion on the best way to approach companies. It's a european company. Um, they're big in this space

425
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,940
So should they open source the library and just hope for the best should they try to contact the company and get permissions?

426
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
What are your thoughts on how they should approach them?

427
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,480
Well, I think it depends on the company. Um, so I mean in the question which is linked to in the show

428
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,580
Notes, there's an awful lot more detail. But essentially this one revolves around reverse engineering token generation

429
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,080
So, I mean if you were to contact this company and say

430
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,360
Hey, I have been able to achieve this result

431
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,480
You will end up in one of two situations one. You'll end up in the swedish school

432
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,880
Voting app situation. I don't know if you saw this uh this in the news a little while ago a couple of parents

433
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:01,800
A couple of parents, um, basically reverse engineered their school district's app to allow parents to talk to teachers and all that kind of thing

434
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,480
So that they could access the api that was publicly available

435
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,640
and then

436
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,800
Build another app on top of it that was better

437
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,360
So you might end up in a situation that they did

438
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,760
Where the government the local government comes after you and starts issuing cease and desist letters and say hey stop that you're hacking us

439
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,600
Blah blah blah blah blah

440
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:27,240
Because they don't understand that the publicly available api data is just that it's not hacking. It's just it's available

441
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,880
That is how an api works. Yeah, or

442
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,000
You'll end up in a situation where the company is receptive and you might end up with a job out of it or some kind

443
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,400
Of situation where they're open to people

444
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,120
Willing to work with things like responsible disclosure and all that kind of thing. So yeah

445
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,040
Yeah, don't go posting it all over reddit and twitter as your first port of call

446
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,120
talk to the company first if you're worried it's going to get you in trouble and see what their response is and

447
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,040
Then you can start going down the responsible disclosure routes and all the rest of it

448
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,360
yeah, I think that's all probably pretty good advice you could also try to

449
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
You know, maybe go a little linkedin spelunking

450
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,720
See if you can find some people that might be in the right areas of the company for you to reach out to

451
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,640
Uh, if the company has a forum that they run sometimes some of the employees are active in there and you can kind of get a sense

452
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
Start get an idea who you're dealing with

453
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,440
This has got to be a wider problem, you know, even when you're not cracking tokens and whatnot

454
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,600
There's a lot of crap out there that could do with some home assistant integration and they just need somebody to come knock on

455
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
their door like it

456
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,160
It is a crime against humanity

457
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:36,360
That the victron, uh folks that like do my inverter and my charge controller and manage all the power in my rv

458
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,640
It's a damn crime against humanity that they don't make a home assistant integration available

459
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,680
Not only does the victron system support mqtt

460
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,440
But it also supports modbus over ethernet and tcp. So there's like two

461
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,560
Really straightforward ways that they could build an integration to get that data

462
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Which would be life-changing?

463
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,800
Life-changing and i've talked to people who built all their own solutions for this stuff

464
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:07,320
But it's just a great example of like you can find people out there that are reverse engineering it right now for these victron systems

465
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,400
But really what it needs is the company to either document this stuff or come out and do it or or

466
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,080
Enable a community to build something right? That's what we need. And I don't know how we start changing that culture

467
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,420
Because when they're looking at how they're going to spend their engineers time and resources

468
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,160
You know, it's a it's a hard thing to pro and con

469
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,280
It looks it just looks like a waste of time when you're doing it on a pro and con list

470
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,720
I wonder how many more sales people like victron might make

471
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,940
If they advertise the home assistant integration

472
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,620
That's perhaps the angle that you have to approach is is the business angle

473
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:43,580
To get the product owners interested in spending those development tokens on

474
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,020
What we want them to do. I think it was frank. I think frank on the live stream for home assistant

475
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,940
Said that vans and and mobile applications are actually a very

476
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:59,820
Large use case for home assistant which blew my mind. I'm like, hey, that's that's me like but that's actually like something that

477
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:06,380
is a big enough use case it was brought up on the live stream and um, yeah, when you're looking at the energy monitoring capabilities and

478
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,260
Logging and long-term logging now available in home assistant

479
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,220
Uh, yeah, that'd be powerful

480
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,860
Well, james writes in

481
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:20,140
In defense of portainer after last week's character assassination. I think we gave it. Hey guys

482
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:27,420
I just listened to 59 where y'all talk about portainer whilst I do love ssh and docker cli for most of my personal life

483
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,020
I think portainer is great at two things at my company

484
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,780
Number one it provides discoverability for new users

485
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,040
We're slowly dragging our company into the wonderful world of containers

486
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,660
But it is slow getting everybody on board

487
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:48,140
Having a nice gui to show all the options for docker run and to easily store things like docker compose stacks

488
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,940
Or private registry credentials where anyone can access them is a huge benefit to us

489
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,140
Number two, it also provides some level of access control even in the free version remotely

490
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,300
While we could just set up os users for everyone on our big docker test server

491
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,860
It's much easier for me to just let portainer handle it and somewhat lock it down

492
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,780
Especially when it comes to things like the qa team who don't really care about how things work under the hood

493
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:23,420
They just want to click a button update a container and do their testing. Thanks. I love the show james fair enough

494
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,820
Yeah after we recorded and I was chatting about it with wes

495
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,460
I it did kind of dawn on me. Oh

496
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,640
Right when you got a team of people that might need to poke in on these containers

497
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,900
I start to appreciate a tool like this a little bit more like we have more systems

498
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:46,060
in the cloud on linode than we probably should without some sort of tool like this because there's a lot of containers out there that

499
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,580
We have running and you know, you've got some and wes and I have some running

500
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,300
I've got some that only i've set up wes has some that only he's set up

501
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,580
We've got a lot of applications that are running in containers up there

502
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,540
I could see how portainer would be nice to manage all that

503
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,820
I think we're probably pushing what you could do with the free version though

504
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:08,780
I mean don't forget I work on a daily basis with open shift and that really is the value add proposition of open shift

505
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,900
I mean, there's a few more to it when you start getting down into the technical weeds

506
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,620
but really it's presenting a

507
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,180
Cohesive single pane of glass across different clouds

508
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,900
That's really the value out of open shift the hybrid cloud thing that you hear that's that's what it's doing

509
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:31,740
Is it's giving people a standardized interface to access the underlying abstractions, which in this case are containers

510
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:36,380
You know and and james who writes in does make a valid point that you know

511
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:44,380
You can use gooey's to solve that problem. I would argue that also you could use just simple bash aliases and some good documentation

512
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:51,740
But you know, I worked with some qa teams in the past that really don't care how it works under the hood. They don't care if it's

513
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:58,940
The perfect technical solution. They just need to close their ticket and move on to the next one. Well, and that's why often

514
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,780
especially

515
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:07,180
Internal projects you'll go to a web page and there's a button and that button, you know, it's just some hack script

516
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,900
That's just doing something to like, you know

517
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,540
Check something and check something out and put them in the right spot for the qa like it can get real hacky

518
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,580
But they don't care

519
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:20,540
I'll tell you what I would like to see for jb and this is my own personal wish list that you don't know what I'm

520
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,900
Thinking yet. So this is a voyage of discovery for you here chris. Ooh

521
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,860
Uh, you've been talking about this new server in lup where you want to do tumbleweed or something

522
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,940
Crazy with susa. I don't know what you're smoking over there, but the audience voted

523
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,780
I'm, not i'm not convinced in the legitimacy of the results, but we're proceeding to maintain faith

524
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:45,980
Well, I was thinking why don't we look at something like k3s, which is like a lightweight kubernetes from the rancher team an open source

525
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,780
thing

526
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:53,260
That is you know based around kubernetes, which is an industry standard deployment mechanism that we could

527
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:58,380
Adopt as a network, you know, hmm. Hmm for the on-premise and cloud systems

528
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,460
Perhaps yeah, I mean it's a lot of work for me, but uh, i'm not afraid of a challenge

529
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,580
Hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we should talk more about it. We should have like a little powwow with west and like, uh, you know brainstorm

530
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,660
I mean there's a bunch of problems to solve like dns and load balancing and

531
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,620
you know access control all that kind of stuff, but

532
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,780
For me when we had that hedge talk outage a couple of weeks ago, it just for me

533
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,740
It was a red flag to say hey chris doesn't have access to this box. Hmm. Perhaps you should fix that alex

534
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,740
Perhaps we should have a more centralized

535
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,720
Way of managing all the jb core services that we use to do the production of these shows

536
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:42,380
Backblaze.com slash ssh go there to get a free trial. No credit card required. Yeah, it's backblaze

You can directly download them from the web

541
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,820
Or I mean if it's a lot you can even restore them by mail you purchase a disc

542
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,380
They'll overnight it to you and then you can just return it to them when you're done for a refund

543

They also give you access via their mobile app. They've restored over 50 billion files for their customers

544
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,980

552
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,480
Okay, so five writes in with a science fiction self-hosted vision this is a bit wacky so bear with me

553
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
All right, get in story mode

554
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Stay a while and listen

555
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,840
Okay, so I perceive my data as captives on a titan class closed system ship

556
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,500
Some of the captives are treated quite restrictedly

557
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:11,780
Whilst others might be provided with what seems like paradise with ample food and simulated sunlight and fauna and so on

558
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:17,140
As we know what appears to be too good to be true typically is too good to be true

559
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,260
There's no telling when the captors decide to unleash a vicious creature or deadly virus on the captives

560
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:30,340
I envision projects like home assistant jellyfin and matrix as emergency life pods liberating the captives

561
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:36,420
It would be suicide to take on the whole armada at once, but we are able to rescue a few captives from each platform

562
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:42,500
Once our libre starship is prepared for their arrival. The captives can adjust to the stable lts systems

563
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:49,380
And these systems could also be stable container-based systems. Look i'm not judging after the freed captives are acclimatized

564
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:54,420
We can fly off and break free the next victims behind proprietary space jails

565
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,940
Keep the jupiter broadcasting beacon illuminated for the wayward souls

566
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,140
Okay

567
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,180
I want whatever he was having when he wrote that in that's great

568
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:12,340
It is true though. I kind of you know, like last episode I was kind of grousing about hosting matrix

569
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,980
But I do feel like it's a bit of a hedge I I totally admit

570
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:23,780
That discord gets more engagement has a way bigger network effect

571
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,380
It's way simpler for users to get going on and from an administrator's perspective. It's so much less work

572
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,380
but

573
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,820
matrix is ran on my own infrastructure, you know and

574
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:42,260
Like the I I like that I can have an at jupiter broadcasting account on there. It's a like my domain

575
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:49,460
And so I feel like it's a bit of a hedge from when it seems like eventually discord's going to turn into like a piece of crap

576
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:56,340
As all of these social platforms tend to eventually do and so we keep it going, you know, and I also

577
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:04,420
Like the challenge of figuring out how to manage something like a synapse server, which is a constantly growing and and changing beast

578
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,620
It's just a it's an interesting infrastructure challenge, too

579
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,740
Charles writes in he says i've been listening since episode one

580
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,900
I have an idea for discussion on the show that i'd like to hear you guys chew on

581
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:21,460
What about self-hosting git? Is it worth that over using something like github? I see so many people in the community

582
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,180
often open source software users

583
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:30,900
That are just up on github when we have solutions like git lab and get tea and of course, there's just plain git

584
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,940
I'm, not a developer myself, but i'm trying to move my self-hosted services to get based docker

585
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,980
Compose files. Thanks as always so charles wants to know

586
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:45,060
Your thoughts on like running your own git lab or just using github because I know you use github quite a bit for stuff

587
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,540
Doesn't have to be

588
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:53,060
An exclusive relationship with github. So that's the thing right? I mean I run a githy server at home

589
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,820
And I mirror every single git repo that I have on github

590
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,060
Using their mirroring functionality built into git tea to my local instance

591
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:06,820
so I generally go with github on stuff that I know other people are going to see or want to see or

592
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:12,420
I think they might find useful just simply for that network effect and then everything else, you know

593
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,420
Like my personal wikis and stuff like that

594
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,820
That I don't want sachet to have access to

595
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,780
I keep them in my local githy instance and they never leave my land. You know, it's just

596
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:28,100
It there are different classifications for different types of data in my opinion and you know

597
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:34,580
You just got to figure out which one which service works best for that particular piece of code or whatever it is

598
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,660
Man, if that doesn't just sum up

599
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,940
How I kind of weigh the pros and cons of what I cloud host versus what I self host right there actually

600
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:49,060
Because you're using git for your notes system, right? So that's you know for that reason. Yeah, i'm still figuring that out actually the obsidian

601
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,660
Mixed with drone ci and uh an engine x based container running mkdocs

602
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,780
I am still working on that blog post, but I don't know my you know, since i've become a parent my time just evaporates

603
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:05,380
I just can't get the blog posts out like I used to I am still working on it and I am still using it but

604
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,260
Maybe i'll get it out before the end of the year, but we'll see

605
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,540
Pew pew pew. All right. It's our last one. Pew pew pew pew and we'd love to get your feedback

606
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:18,740
Uh, we try to get a couple in every episode and every now and then for a special version of the show like additions

607
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,260
You know like these 60 milestones. It's great. Thank you. Thank you

608
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,500
Like these 60 milestones, it's great to have your feedback so we can just go through all of these

609
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,340
So please send us your thoughts your questions your ideas

610
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,700
Your cool builds whatever it might be at selfhosted.show

611
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,540
Contact and deck bot takes us out with the last one

612
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,980
saying I often hear comments like infrastructure as code as well as

613
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,060
Sentiments like your servers are cattle not pets. Well as a linux system enthusiast

614
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:56,580
I disagree with that premise my servers are pets. They are special in my heart that said

615
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,500
Once a decade when I finally get around to replacing the hardware i'd like to spend less time potty training them

616
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:12,180
He goes on to say is there a recommended guide book or a primer for ansible or some other such tools

617
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,380
That would be good for us hobbyist admins. Thanks for the show

618
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,980
It always gets me to try new things kind regards deck bot

619
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:24,660
I mean, there's a huge bunch of content around for ansible, uh, jeff gehrling friend of the show

620
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,580
Uh, he's got an absolutely amazing ansible 101 series on youtube

621
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:35,140
Uh, there's a book I read a while back called infrastructure as code by keith morris, which i'll link to in the show notes

622
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,040
As well, um in that book he lays out an infrastructure

623
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,500
framework for defining every part of your infrastructure as text files

624
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:47,620
Um, and sometimes as we call it code so infrastructure as code. That's what the phrase means

625
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:53,860
And essentially, you know my take on infrastructure as code is it's actually helping me be less stupid

626
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,940
Because I can't tell you how often I set a system up manually

627
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,020
Even if it's a very simple task like installing one or two packages

628
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,500
uh, and then a year or two elapses and I come back to that server and i'm like

629
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:14,500
What did I do that for how why? Mm-hmm. And so for me, it's just a case of saving myself a future self a bunch of time

630
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,780
Yeah, I think the other thing I would really like out of it and one of the reasons why I want to get into this

631
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:26,020
mindset myself is uh, I you can build on things you've figured out before because the

632
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,660
The code is a documentation of sorts you document your infrastructure there

633
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:35,140
So you can go back and review what you figured out and you can build on top of that for future deployments

634
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:39,300
Which I like that a lot, but I I am with you deck bot in that. Um,

635
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:44,660
My servers like my home server in the rv and the server here at the studio

636
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,540
They have real special places in my heart. Like I

637
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,100
I have inappropriate

638
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,580
feels for both of those rigs

639
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,420
but

640
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:59,780
I get with what the sentiment actually is going for when you treated this cattle. The idea is it's

641
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:04,260
It's something that if it had to be replaced if its life cycle was complete

642
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,340
It's easy

643
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:11,060
To replace it's easy to swap out the more I think about the analogy. It's kind of gross but

644
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:18,180
It I get the idea because if you adopt that that mindset then your data tends to be protected and isolated your

645
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,580
Configurations tend to be off the rig and you're actually in a much better place should there be some kind of hardware failure or other

646
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:30,800
Disaster just adopting that mindset and kind of deploying things like that. So even even if you still have like the real inappropriate man

647
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,800
Feels like I do

648
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,040
It's still probably a better way to manage them and keep them

649
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,760
And it's getting to the point now where i'm kind of feeling like what alex was alluding to earlier is just like

650
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,560
wiping a clean slate

651
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,640
Redeploying everything and doing the whole thing from the ground up that way, but it just is such a massive project. But

652
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,160
Of course if we ever do it, I think we'd probably document the journey here on the show. Yeah, and you know, we do have an infrastructure

653
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,640
Repo for the show as it stands at github.com

654
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,840
Self-hosted show slash infra which i'll put a link to in the show notes

655
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,480
There's a bunch of terraform in there and ansible in there that I use to deploy all of the show infrastructure that that I manage for

656
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,440
chris

657
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,640
um

658
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,140
But you know, even if you're only implementing a few principles

659
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,780
Within the infrastructure as code kind of ethos

660
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:21,140
You'll still have a lot further down the road and a lot of people that don't even know what that phrase means

661
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:26,420
So, you know ten percent of of something is ten percent more than zero

662
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,420
That's right, I like your math today dude, you're like your math whiz

663
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,620
You know, I feel like I should mention

664
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,900
There's there is a possibility. This is going to

665
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,420
Get cancelled because of the news out there, but I feel like I want to mention that

666
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:49,460
If things go, okay, you know, uh corona wise we are going to have a meetup at the studio january 2nd

667
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:55,240
And i'm trying out get together because get together is a meetup alternative that you can self-host

668
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,300
I'm trying out their hosted version right now to see how people like it for this small event

669
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,860
And it's get together dot community

670
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:07,960
Slash jbhq or i'll just have a link in the show notes if you'd like to join us. We're going to have a new server christening party

671
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,520
On january 2nd, assuming I can get everything done by then. I actually haven't even got the things powered on yet

672
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,720
I've been so busy

673
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,840
And then there's also the whole corona thing so it's all up in the air

674
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,720
But if it happens that's where you'll find out about it, even though it says it's at 3 a.m. For some weird reason

675
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,360
Also, i'd like to mention that we've now launched based on popular demand

676
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:32,440
A network-wide membership

677
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,960
And if you sign up before the end of december, it's coming up quick

678
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,000
I'm taking two dollars off a month for a year

679
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,540
So it's less than the price of two membership two show memberships

680
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,800
And you get access to all the network goodies every show's special features and goodies

681
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,720
And any new shows we add and it's also the only way to get linux action

682
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,080
News totally ad free and of course it supports the network. It gives us that flexibility

683
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,640
To be picky with the sponsors that we choose

684
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:05,640
It lets us do extra little things like get togethers every now and then and of course it gives us a runway

685
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,480
To make sure that while we are working on developing relationships with sponsors or whoever it might be

686
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,880
Show production continues

687
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:18,600
That's critical. So jupiter.party if you'd like to join us, you can sign up for the link in the description

688
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:23,160
That's critical. So jupiter.party if you'd like to sign up for the whole network membership

689
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,920
There's also a gift option right there

690
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,200
And of course you can maintain your self-hosted membership if you'd like to just support the show

691
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,340
If this is your favorite thing that's what you listen to selfhosted.show slash sre

692
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,920
You get our special post show and everything like that. Even if you can't support us with a membership though

693
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,160
We still really appreciate you listening downloading and maybe sharing it with a friend

694
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:47,880
And the question we've had a few times actually is once I am a member. How do I get access to the member feeds?

695
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,680
So, um, you can log in

696
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,680
at any time to the member area

697
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:59,640
But right after you sign up it'll actually redirect you to a feed page and it will generate a feed for each show

698
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,400
and um

699
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,320
If I add a show down the road you log into the membership area and you just go pull that new feed

700
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,960
And then you just got to go pop that in your podcast player. That is

701
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,080
It's a custom dynamic feed created just for each member

702
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,080
And we do we do make it possible to subscribe to just the ones you want to listen to so maybe you don't want all

703
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:22,840
The shows I mean, I know it's wrong with you, but maybe you don't uh, then you can just pick the ones you want in there

704
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:31,160
Well, very good. Thanks for supporting the show if you're an sre already and good work chris and uh, and wes on that membership

705
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,760
Something that's been in the works for a very very long time. Yeah, you know what?

706
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,160
You know what? It was like we had to connect multiple platforms together, uh three

707
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,400
And then there was like contract stuff because now all of the shows which I didn't say earlier

708
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,400
But this is kind of a big deal too. It's not limited ads anymore. It's ad free

709
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,640
Unless like unless I didn't like manage to get all the ads and I was supposed to

710
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,720
Which shouldn't happen but uh, that's also been a big thing

711
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,400
We've been working at the same time so we could kind of do an upgrade because it's now been a year of memberships

712
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,680
And so we wanted to go from limited ads to no ads

713
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,440
Uh, because you know, and you know what else I hear from some people they don't mind the ads

714
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,560
That's fine. Like you know what? Thank you. Really?

715
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,920
Because we need people listening to the ads too. It helps that way as well

716
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,440
So it works out both ways and it I like having that mix

717
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,520
Because it kind of gives us the flexibility to to be kind of picky to you know, you get these

718
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:28,380
You almost get like these spam level sponsors that just want to blast all podcasts

719
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,780
You hear them all the time. You probably can think of a few of them off the top of your heads

720
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:37,580
And that just doesn't serve our audience, right? So that's why I think the memberships are great

721
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,860
You mean you don't want a new mattress in a box every week?

722
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:49,340
Yeah, there's a lot of those uh, we'd love your feedback like I said earlier self-hosted show slash contact and uh,

723
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,380
You can also find there is a self-hosted. Um, besides we mentioned the discord

724
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,780
There is a self-hosted discord self-hosted show slash discord, but there is also a matrix room

725
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:02,140
On our jupiter broadcasting matrix server at colony

726
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,700
dot jupiter broadcasting dot com

727
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:10,060
Rumor has it as well. We're stopping twitter plugs for the foreseeable future now that jack's out

728
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:15,740
I mean i've been rolling back. Yeah, I feel like if jack's out. I mean do you do you love twitter?

729
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:20,620
I don't love twitter. I use it. I like it for replying to people. That's what I like twitter for and that's about it

730
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,660
You know

731
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:25,260
It's nice, you know, I put out a post the other day saying has anybody got any old hardware?

732
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:30,620
They're looking to get rid of or to sell because I want to benchmark a whole different bunch of quicksync cpus

733
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,820
Um, which i'm working on an article for that

734
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:40,060
And i've actually had a listener send me a fourth gen cpu who lives in charlotte sent it over

735
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:44,460
So i'm going to borrow that for a few weeks and do a benchmark. Was that a connection made by twitter? Is that weird?

736
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah through twitter. Gotcha. Um, so if you have an old

737
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,680
Old quicksync motherboard you're no longer using let me know via twitter at ironic badger

738
00:54:54,320 --> 00:55:00,000
And uh, I still plugged it. It's just happy. That's okay. I mean, I still like the interactions I have with people on there

739
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
I've just been thinking like

740
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,800
If they were going to follow us, they probably have done it by now

741
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,240
So now i've been thinking like maybe i'll plug the matrix

742
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,160
We also have a telegram channel at jupiter broadcasting.com telegram

743
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,720
But you know i'm on there at chris lass

744
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,480
If you tweet at me i'll tweet you back

745
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,440
And if you want to find all of our show notes, you can go to notes

746
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,400
Jupiter broadcasting.com for a searchable archive of the jupiter broadcasting show notes

747
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:46,160
Uh, and so all that's left for me to say is thank you very much for listening everybody. That was self-hosted.co.uk
