00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
Have you noticed lately that the self-hosted and homelab subreddits freaking love their

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,880
dashboards?

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,640
Yes, it's dashboards all day, are you kidding me?

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,720
Every third post is, oh, I'm just humble bragging about all the self-hosted services I've got.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,960
And I always feel like my dashboard is not as pretty as it could be.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,920
I mean, they're not even as nice as your dashboards and these dashboards are like, they look like

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,920
you should be controlling a starship with some of them.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,200
The word dashboard has become a sound to me.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,440
You've just said it too much.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,440
Dashboard, dashboard.

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,440
Yeah.

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,480
I mean, there's lots of options, right?

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,160
There is Homer, there is Heimdall, there is, I mean, there's dozens of them.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,440
I get why people like them, but they're just another thing to become out of date.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,480
And I find that even if I set one up, the entropy to keeping it up to date is too high.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,280
And six months later, I haven't opened it for a while and, oh, I don't even run that

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
service anymore.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,400
Why is that still on there?

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,280
And it gets worse the more devices you have or you remove or add.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,560
And in some cases I have devices that go offline or online depending on my location.

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,720
And then the dashboard's like messed up temporarily while I'm traveling.

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,680
And then I just like debate the entire time if I should remove it.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,280
And God forbid I take something out and then I have to go everywhere and make sure I've

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,580
got it removed from my Lovelace dashboard and my Heads Up dashboard.

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,540
It's just like, it's dashboard overload for me.

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:30,200
But I get that people like, they like sharing them and I kind of like, I like viewing them

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,960
sort of like I enjoy viewing desktop screenshots.

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,120
Oh, that's an interesting way to do it.

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,920
And sometimes I'm like, never going to do that.

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,360
I'm just never going to go that far.

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,640
It's discovery, you know, oh look, this person's got 47 apps.

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
What's this one do?

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
Yeah, that's true.

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
That's true.

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,540
Well, go see what you can do at the all new, a Cloud Guru.

36
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,320
They are the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux and other modern tech skills, hundreds

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,600
of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,040
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloudguru.com.

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,840
Did you see the Plex Amp update?

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,320
Wow, Alex, I was wondering if you caught this, I was going to ask you if you saw the new

41
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Plex Amp.

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,440
Yeah, it's a big update for iOS and Android.

43
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,880
And I think at least the iOS one will be released soon, but there's a desktop version of Plex

44
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,460
Amp now as well, which I didn't even know.

45
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:25,300
And they've added one feature that I've wanted since the very first time I tried Plex Amp

46
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,900
and it's the shuffle button.

47
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,400
So happy to have a shuffle button now.

48
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I don't know what to say to that.

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
And I know you're going to be elated to see that they've also added Siri support.

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,840
So now you can play music on Plex Amp through Siri, which I'm sure you're going to use all

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
the time.

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,040
And as you know, as being a heavy iOS user, I'm not, I'm still on Android.

53
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,840
I tried to switch to iOS in January, but was wearing a lot of face masks in the hospital

54
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,400
and face ID and all that, I ended up going back to Android.

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,960
So I was delighted to see that they've now added Siri support.

56
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
That's true.

57
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
That's true.

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,320
And it works, you know, it's very simple.

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,540
It's nothing really to write home about.

60
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,520
That's probably stuff that I should have had a long time ago.

61
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:17,480
I think in general, Plex Amp is probably one of my favorite Plex adjacent ecosystem applications.

62
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,040
We get people that write into the show and they'll say, why do you guys use Plex?

63
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,560
There's Jellyfin, there's other alternatives.

64
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,080
There's just this ecosystem around Plex now between the friends that I can share with

65
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,880
like Alex for library sharing options, but also these apps around Plex that break off

66
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,440
like the music experience into this individual app that's dedicated to just music.

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,960
It's just wonderful and it's nice to see it get updated to version 3.4.5.

68
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,920
It really makes the music experience in Plex quite pleasurable, to be honest with you.

69
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,240
And the design language they've used for the application brings it up to the same sort

70
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,080
of polish as something like Spotify or something like that.

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,920
It is just a 100% native looking music app and I think it's freaking great.

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,020
There's some things that aren't so freaking great though.

73
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,520
Good and bad, I suppose Plex revealed that it recently completed a growth equity round

74
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,480
of $50 million from an existing investor.

75
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,800
And the company intends to invest its money in a mission to become a one stop shop for

76
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:27,080
movies and TV and it aims to do this by addressing one of the most frustrating aspects today

77
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,880
in the legal streaming market, they say, and that is fragmentation, all the different streaming

78
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
services.

79
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,600
They want to bring it all into Plex, including your pirated content or whatever else you

80
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
might have on there.

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Like your home.

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,960
Like for me, we use Plex for just home videos that we record that we don't want to put up

83
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,160
like on YouTube or something and they want to bring it all into one UI and you can search

84
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,480
all of it from the stuff in your own library to the stuff that's on Hulu to Netflix and

85
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,620
Amazon Prime and Plex is they're going to work with these companies to get API access

86
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,540
and integrate it all in there and try to try to make an experience where you go to one

87
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,240
app and you get all the streaming services.

88
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,080
I mean, I understand why they're doing this.

89
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,800
The revenue streams of a few Plex Pass subscribers surely can't self sustain the company.

90
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,200
I mean myself, as an example, I paid $75 for a lifetime Plex Pass half a decade ago, more

91
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,460
than probably, and they haven't seen a penny from me since.

92
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:33,960
And so I can understand how Hulu and Disney and Prime and Netflix are juicy targets for

93
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,820
them to try and integrate into one place.

94
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:43,520
But if I was Netflix or Prime or Disney, I'm not sure I would want people going outside

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,160
my walled garden because the whole reason that these companies have dedicated gardens,

96
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,920
walled gardens for their content is so that they can do analytics on it and they can track

97
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,520
you through minute by minute, second by second of what you're watching.

98
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,240
I mean, the Grand Tour is a great example of this.

99
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,120
Old Top Gear turned into the Grand Tour with Jeremy Clarkson and all that, one of my favorite

100
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,920
TV shows of all time.

101
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:14,000
And a couple of years ago, Amazon decided to kill the studio part of the Grand Tour,

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,400
which was my favorite part, in favor of just doing these epic specials.

103
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,640
And now we only get two or three episodes, well, less, a couple of episodes a year of

104
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
the Grand Tour.

105
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,600
And they're these grand expeditions where they go to Madagascar and they put tank tracks

106
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,280
on a Ford Fiesta and stupid stuff like that.

107
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,080
Whereas what I watched the Grand Tour for was the cocking about between three old men

108
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,640
sort of taking the Mickey out of each other.

109
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,040
But the reason they did that, Amazon, was because their analytics showed that most people

110
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,320
didn't watch the studio segments.

111
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,920
You know, I can understand why they would make that change.

112
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,640
But if you're Amazon and you're giving away API access to Plex, presumably you would bake

113
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,240
in some of those analytics through the Plex client.

114
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,640
But one of the benefits of having people in your app is that they're not going to exit

115
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,320
that app to go to Netflix to go and watch a specific show over there.

116
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,040
They're just going to carry on browsing in the portal they're already in.

117
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:20,840
If Plex presents all of these different things in one place, the value prop to subscribe

118
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,880
to these different services becomes just too generic at this point.

119
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,960
And I just don't see it working, do you?

120
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,840
I have to say, I completely agree, Alex, and it goes just beyond like analytics and whatnot.

121
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,460
But there's also a technical angle.

122
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,640
Perhaps they want to tweak how the playback engine works with their particular type of

123
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,620
CDN, or maybe they want to feature content for some special show they've just released

124
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,620
or some big movie.

125
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,800
I just read this morning that Paramount Plus is planning to do a movie a month on their

126
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,560
Paramount Plus streaming service.

127
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,960
And I got to imagine that every time one of those movie drops, they're going to do some

128
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,400
sort of big presentation in a carousel that lets everybody know our new content is here.

129
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,960
I just can't imagine Plex accommodating all of those whims.

130
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,480
All of these companies just got to become their own cable network essentially with their

131
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,960
streaming service.

132
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,880
And we've just gone through the last 10 years of them figuring out how to actually stream

133
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,200
video and they're just starting to get good at it now.

134
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,560
You know, Netflix had to set the example.

135
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,600
And so I just don't really see this taking up.

136
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,160
Maybe if Plex was willing to do something where they got access to the search API, and

137
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,120
then if you selected a video, say it was the Grand Tour, it would then just launch the

138
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Amazon app.

139
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
But how valuable is that?

140
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,140
And how do you even do that, say, like in a web version or something?

141
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,920
My Google Assistant does that already with voice search on the Nvidia Shield.

142
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,160
It'll search through all the apps for me.

143
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Right.

144
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,520
And Roku's trying to do the same thing and Apple wants to offer the same thing with the

145
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,800
Siri remote.

146
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Absolutely.

147
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Yeah.

148
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,920
And $15 million isn't enough to do this.

149
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,120
So they raised 50 million from an existing investor.

150
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,520
And as part of that, it includes 15 million in new capital for Plex, which they're going

151
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,240
to invest in in this mission.

152
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,120
That's nowhere near enough, is it?

153
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,720
I can't imagine unless they see a way of monetizing this maybe through affiliate links or something

154
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
like that with the streaming providers.

155
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Maybe.

156
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,160
You know, Alex, that doesn't even touch on what I don't like about this.

157
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,540
And that is this whole single pane of glass.

158
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,000
They actually use that term experience.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,680
I use Plex intentionally for a curated experience.

160
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,620
I don't want to see everything because it's a family, sir.

161
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,940
It's something that we use for our family.

162
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:33,460
That's why I take the time to put things on there individually, myself as the dad or when,

163
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:39,360
you know, the mom requests something, I have a UI where they can go in and they can request

164
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
things.

165
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,400
It is intentionally separated from everything else.

166
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,840
And there is an app on the screen.

167
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,440
They launch it, they go in there and now everything's safe.

168
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,400
I have parent stuff separated out from kids stuff and I have really no interest in mixing

169
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
it on.

170
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,520
I can't tell for sure at this stage, but reading between the lines, it does look like they're

171
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,400
going to give you the option to not mix everything together, but it will be mixed by default.

172
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
I mean, I guess time will tell on this one.

173
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,000
I kind of hope we're proved right because I really agree with you.

174
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,120
I don't want to see this stuff, like the reason I have Plex is because I want to control what

175
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
I see.

176
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,600
So yeah, I'm with you on that one.

177
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Yeah.

178
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,280
It gets my head spinning immediately on, well, what would I go to?

179
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,480
Well, what I transitioned to because I've got a lot of time invested in my Plex library.

180
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,560
And so one of the things I've already done on our Apple TV is I've switched to using,

181
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,880
I've talked about it before on the show, I switched to using Infuse and I'm going to

182
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,040
put a link to it again.

183
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,440
It's a paid app.

184
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,080
It's like Kodi for Apple TV and I don't use that lightly.

185
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,680
I have a lot of respect for Kodi, but this is like Kodi for Apple TV.

186
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:52,160
It can bring together multiple servers over network connections, Google Drive, Dropbox,

187
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,400
and it supports Plex.

188
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,840
It'll do your watch status and everything that you would need to track in Plex.

189
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,600
And it's just a, it's a fantastic UI and it has much better AirPlay support.

190
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,800
So if you use HomePods with an Apple TV or you're using some kind of crazy AirPlay setup,

191
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,420
Infuse does it perfectly where the actual Plex client on Apple TV and iOS is not actually

192
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,560
great at that stuff.

193
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,040
It sometimes has issues.

194
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,440
And so when I see this news about one meta search engine for all streaming, I think,

195
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,040
yeah, that's all good guys, but you're not even, you're not even enticing me to use your

196
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
own app these days.

197
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,000
Like there's other things to focus on and I have a lot of respect for the Plex folks,

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,440
but it is just what it is now is I'm using Infuse and you can get it at firecore.com

199
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,440
slash Infuse and they've just recently released a Mac desktop version too, which is kind of

200
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
a neat idea I suppose.

201
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,460
I know lots of the audience are frantically screaming at their, their podcast devices.

202
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,560
What about Jellyfin?

203
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
What about MB?

204
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,520
Well, maybe one day, maybe you and I eventually will become Jellyfin guys in the future.

205
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
It could happen.

206
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,360
I do, uh, I do experiment it with from time to time.

207
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,280
Have you ever kicked the tires with Jellyfin?

208
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,120
I have, and I went back to Plex.

209
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Okay.

210
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
Sorry.

211
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,600
I mean, it's a, it's pretty good for what it is.

212
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,960
Uh, it's just Plex as a headstart and, uh, the, the fit and finish of the UI and the

213
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,500
experience I have there is, is much better on, uh, on Plex than Jellyfin.

214
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,280
What would it take for you to switch?

215
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,560
I think when it's, uh, suitable for my family members, you know, that they have a lot of

216
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,360
time invested in learning Plex's various UI changes over the years.

217
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,960
And they kind of figured out how it works now for the most part.

218
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,720
Once Jellyfin's at that kind of level of, of polish, it's just not yet though.

219
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,680
Linode.com slash SSH.

220
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,400
Linode is the largest independent cloud computing provider.

221
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,520
And when you go to linode.com slash SSH, you'll get $100 in 60 day credit towards a new account.

222
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,620
And you can go there to support the show too.

223
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,360
We were just talking about media servers.

224
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,960
Well, Linode has a one click application deployment for Plex.

225
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,560
If you want to get a Plex server up in the cloud, which is a great way to share with

226
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,680
friends and family at super fast streaming speeds.

227
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,040
Of course, you could just build your own stack and deploy Jellyfin or anything you'd like.

228
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,080
And no matter what skill level you're at or what technology stack you're familiar with

229
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,640
using, Linode will help you get it going online.

230
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,520
They have a really easy to use dashboard.

231
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,780
And if you have any trouble getting things going or run into any kind of problem, Linode

232
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,840
has amazing, fantastic, great, outrageously good customer support.

233
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,760
By phone or ticket, they're going to help you get it solved.

234
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,520
If you've got one rig or you're like me and you're crossing like the 15 rig mark or something.

235
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,880
I mean, it's getting crazy because we use Linode for everything and it's not just like

236
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,040
haphazardly.

237
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,820
We think about every machine we deploy and we decide, okay, is this going to be the machine

238
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,740
that is just a dedicated box?

239
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,200
Maybe it only runs one application or it runs just a couple of things.

240
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,220
Or is this going to be something like an application server?

241
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,080
We have a couple of these too, where these are more powerful Linodes and we run multiple

242
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:58,000
containers on them running multiple applications from mail to encoding services to matrix to,

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,080
well, really you run the gamut.

244
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,360
Anything we're just talking about on the show, we pretty much hosted on Linode.

245
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
People ask me, why Chris?

246
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,680
Because there's a lot of places to host.

247
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,600
Well, the reason for that really comes down to a few core things that I think are pretty

248
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,680
important.

249
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,760
Number one, it is a really good product.

250
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
It's very fast.

251
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,320
They have 11 data centers worldwide.

252
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,840
The interconnects between the data centers.

253
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,280
I think beat what everybody else has, hands down.

254
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,280
Linode is their own ISP, so they just have a networking opportunity that people that

255
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,880
haven't been around as long don't have.

256
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,600
Additionally, they're dedicated CPU rigs.

257
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,960
They're just faster than other people's dedicated CPU rigs.

258
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,460
I like that.

259
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,840
Then you factor in that they're really just good Linux loving folks.

260
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,360
They have been since 2003 and that factors into some of the decisions and how they've

261
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,020
built the product and those things appealed to me.

262
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,060
They make it easy for me to use and I feel like it's very simple, but when I need power

263
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,400
in that dashboard, it's there.

264
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,600
Then there's services like their S3 compatible object storage.

265
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Now, this is great because I can use S3 object storage for backup, for configs that I want

266
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,620
to store off-site, or we use it as the backend storage mechanism for our next cloud instance

267
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,600
so we're not having to sit there and fiddle with different disk sizes like amateurs.

268
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,200
We just throw it on the S3 storage.

269
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,000
But Linode's so fast that it really is very performant and it's a great way to build a

270
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,360
static website.

271
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,920
There's so much you can do there.

272
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,220
If you just need something simple like a portfolio website, or if you want to run the backend

273
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,920
infrastructure for your team collaboration or for your e-commerce website, Linode's going

274
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,240
to be able to do it all.

275
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,520
So go to linode.com slash SSH.

276
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:37,480
Get that $100 60-day credit on your new account and then just see what it can do.

277
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,840
See what we've been talking about and see why we use it for everything.

278
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,400
linode.com slash SSH.

279
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,240
Now what do you do for home assistant wall panels?

280
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,880
I recall you bought a fire tablet a while ago, right?

281
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,400
I have a couple of them now, yep.

282
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,680
I have a 10-inch one and a seven-inch one that I have mounted in the in the lady juke's

283
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
RV.

284
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
How are they working out for you?

285
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
Do you like them?

286
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,680
Pretty good.

287
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
Pretty good.

288
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,160
Not very good performance.

289
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,120
And also one of them, even though I bought the no ads model, has ads on the lock screen

290
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,320
and I find that frustrating.

291
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,280
So the performance is not fantastic, but just sitting there with a web page up and after

292
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,120
I install an app, after I sideload an app like an animal to keep the screen on, they

293
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
get the job done.

294
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
All right.

295
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Well, I've got a solution for you.

296
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:34,040
My wife has or had, it's mine now, a fire seven-inch HD tablet from 2015.

297
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,520
We paid 35 pounds for this tablet six years ago.

298
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
The battery is crap.

299
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,040
I mean, the battery was crap when it was new.

300
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,120
The screen is bad.

301
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,820
It was bad back then, so it's really bad now.

302
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,840
It's just not a great device, let's be honest, but it was 35 pounds six years ago.

303
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:00,880
And I thought to myself, wouldn't it be cool if I had a wall-mounted tablet dashboard?

304
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
Good for you.

305
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,600
In my workshop, I've been doing some automation around the woodworking blast gates that I

306
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
have.

307
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,440
We'll talk about that more in an upcoming episode.

308
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,120
And then basically I just wanted a touchscreen panel that I could just jab my fat fingers

309
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,400
on and just open a certain blast gate.

310
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,920
I didn't want to spend any money because it's already, woodworking is already expensive

311
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
enough.

312
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,720
Did you think about going with a voice tube out there before this or do you already have

313
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
one?

314
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,160
Well, I have a voice tube out there.

315
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,320
It's the lady cylinder and I, I don't know, I've kind of really gone off shouting orders

316
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,400
across the room at these things.

317
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,560
In the rental house last, before we bought this one, everything was on the Google voice

318
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,440
system, but I didn't set any of that up once we moved and I haven't since and I just don't

319
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
miss it.

320
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,400
I'm mixed on it myself because there's sometimes you have to restate yourself and you always

321
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,040
feel like a fool when it gets it wrong.

322
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,600
There's always that thing where you're making eye contact with the cylinder waiting for

323
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
it to light up.

324
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,880
And I'm like, Oh yeah.

325
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,600
And then in my situation you add every time we're off grid, of course the voice transcription

326
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
doesn't work.

327
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,560
So that's really where I was like, okay, we got to have tablets.

328
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,760
And also it's nice to glance at it and just see what's on and what's off.

329
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,640
So how did you go about accomplishing this?

330
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,720
Well, I put Lineage OS, which is an open source version of Android.

331
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,720
I think it's what came out of the cyanogen mod project a few years ago.

332
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:33,120
I put Lineage OS 12 on this tablet and performance is better than the Amazon OS that was on there

333
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,960
before, but it's still a six year old device.

334
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
You know what I mean?

335
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,320
Well, any performance improvement would be good.

336
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,960
This has crossed my mind before.

337
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,080
I have thought about doing this.

338
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,240
I just wasn't sure if it was really worth the bother.

339
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,560
It was a bit of a pain, right?

340
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,800
I had to unlock the bootloader, which involved, I had to take the back off the tablet, bridge

341
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:59,200
a couple of pins on the motherboard to ground the bootloader out so that it would boot into

342
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
the bootloader mode for Android.

343
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,880
I don't know if you've ever done anything with ADB and fast boot.

344
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,000
A while ago, but yeah.

345
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,120
I had to use those tools to put a custom recovery partition on there.

346
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,840
So I used Team Win Recovery Project, TWRP and sideloaded on there a bunch of different

347
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,160
APKs and the Lineage OS ROM.

348
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,660
This process probably took me an evening of mostly futzing about and getting into that

349
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,600
bootloader mode was the hardest part.

350
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,720
Are you using Windows to do any of this?

351
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,960
I have all three in this room, so between the different devices.

352
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,800
Does it require Windows is what I'm asking?

353
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Do you need Windows?

354
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,440
Because I'm out.

355
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,160
That's a disqualifier for me right there.

356
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,880
I think this one works best under Linux.

357
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,920
I actually just used a Raspberry Pi in the end.

358
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Oh, okay.

359
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
I have those.

360
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
I know you do.

361
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,480
I ended up just using a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu on so all right, now you're talking

362
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,320
about language, so it took you a little bit of an evening, but it sounds like if I followed

363
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,560
some tips from you, maybe it wouldn't take me that long.

364
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,040
Well, this is for the specific revision of the 2015 7 inch Fire tablet, so I don't know

365
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,920
if the newer ones have a more locked down bootloader.

366
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,520
That's the key is once you can get a custom recovery software on there, you can install

367
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,960
whatever image you like.

368
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,200
My first question, once you get the OS on there is do you do G apps and do you need

369
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,600
G apps for this for this tablet?

370
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,420
No, you definitely don't anymore because of F Droid.

371
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:33,280
So my use case was to use this thing exclusively for home assistant, right?

372
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:40,240
And so linear Joe s out of the box ships with no Google software whatsoever, which is awesome

373
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,640
on such an underpowered device.

374
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,960
And then so I just loaded F Droid.

375
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,880
I went to the F Droid website, enabled unsigned or unknown sources for APK installation, installed

376
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,440
the F Droid APK, and now I have a Google-less app store and home assistant is available

377
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
in that app store.

378
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,240
So happy days.

379
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,400
And how are you doing the screen?

380
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Are you letting it sleep?

381
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,080
Are you leaving it on all the time?

382
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,280
Because it's going to be used very infrequently, uh, I have just used the standard lock and

383
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,480
unlock and it's going to take me a couple of taps to unlock the screen, but I use it

384
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,440
a couple of times a day.

385
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,440
If that so.

386
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Yeah.

387
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
Yeah, that makes sense.

388
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,000
Now, the other question I have is, are you using the web dashboard or did you load the

389
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,640
home assistant app and interface with it that way?

390
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,320
Yeah, I loaded the app through F Droid and, uh, the, the performance.

391
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,600
So I have a lot of experience with how long it takes to load that up on my phone and it

392
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:41,680
can take a beat sometimes performance of Lovelace and, uh, the, the interface of home assistant

393
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,160
should be better, shall we say, even on modern hardware.

394
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,480
So you can imagine on this six year old device, it takes a good 10 seconds to load.

395
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,640
Once it's loaded, it's fine.

396
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,120
And it works just fine, but it's that initial load that can take a while.

397
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,440
If you have a guide or anything like that, there's something we could share in the show

398
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
notes.

399
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Yep.

400
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
It's already in there.

401
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,000
That'll be at self hosted dot show slash 44.

402
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,960
We talked about health checks IO last episode and in there I asked you about monitoring

403
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,880
if API's or services are up and you mentioned Prometheus, well, I want you to tell me more

404
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,160
about it because we got a few people that bit via email.

405
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,720
Yeah, we did actually.

406
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,600
And I was quite surprised to see just how many people either already use Prometheus

407
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,280
and wanted to tell me all about how awesome it was or didn't use it and wanted to know

408
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
more.

409
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,880
So here's a little primer.

410
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,960
Essentially Prometheus scrapes data on remote servers, gathers it into one place.

411
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:43,440
You write queries to query that data and present it in a dashboard or forward on certain things

412
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,960
to something called alert manager, which can then alert you.

413
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,480
So if your disc percentage, for example, on a remote system goes above 80% used, you could

414
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,780
have it notify you of that and say, Hey, you should probably go and delete some stuff before

415
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,460
this server fills up.

416
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:06,640
Now what I ended up using it for is my VMware box downstairs, it's now just my home lab.

417
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,920
It's not actually my main server.

418
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,240
It's just performing OpenShift home lab duties for me and I put it into a case where fan

419
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,460
control was a bit of an issue.

420
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,440
And so I mentioned in the previous episode about a fan controller, the Corsair commander

421
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,160
pro that is usable on Linux now.

422
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:33,360
But one of the things I wanted to do was actually get a feel for how the CPU temperatures were

423
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,160
in that system over time, because I've got a couple of hard drives in there and you know,

424
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,420
if things are getting toasty, hard drives tend to die pretty quickly.

425
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:48,380
So what I wanted to do was monitor that VMware vCenter instance with Prometheus and have

426
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,920
it alert me if there was a problem.

427
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:55,960
I ended up using this thing called VMware exporter and there's a link to the Docker

428
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,620
compose snippet in the show notes.

429
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:06,440
And this thing, basically what it does is it logs into vSphere's API every pre-prescribed

430
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
interval.

431
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,200
I think I've got it set to like 15 seconds or something, scrapes a bunch of data available

432
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:18,240
through the vCenter API, which includes stuff at the host level like CPU temperature, but

433
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,700
also includes the IPMI data like the voltages and all that kind of stuff.

434
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,820
So it's pretty granular and pretty detailed if you want to know that stuff.

435
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,600
And then it imports it into the Prometheus real time database.

436
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,080
And from there, once it's in Prometheus, I can query it using Grafana or whatever else

437
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
I want to.

438
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:44,640
And I use a container called PryOrder, I think is how you say it, PryOrder VMware exporter,

439
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,260
super simple little Python app and just does the job.

440
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,020
What kind of hardware utilization, I guess, is what I'm asking.

441
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,220
So if I have a system, I have an existing Xeon box here at the studio.

442
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,280
It's probably about 30% utilized CPU wise and memory wise.

443
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Do I need something more powerful?

444
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,000
Do I have enough headroom for running these kinds of services?

445
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,240
A Prometheus itself is pretty lightweight.

446
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,420
With any real time metrics gathering system like this, we'll probably want to put it on

447
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,580
some kind of a flash based storage media.

448
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:18,200
So you'll need a few gigabytes scratch disc for that to use.

449
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,800
But then once you've done that, you need to create what are called scrape jobs, which

450
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,280
is how you tell Prometheus what to look for and what to kind of gather in terms of metrics

451
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,480
on remote systems.

452
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,680
You can figure that in my favorite language of them all, in a YAML file.

453
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,500
And once you've done that with Prometheus, you kind of set it, forget it and never worry

454
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,780
about it ever again.

455
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,680
And then how long does it collect for forever?

456
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,800
How long do you do it for?

457
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,320
I haven't really worried about it.

458
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,760
I just sort of forever keep them forever.

459
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Yeah.

460
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,800
I mean, I guess if you're in an enterprise situation where you're scraping 10,000 servers,

461
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,440
that might be an issue, but I'm not so yeah, so maybe not a big deal.

462
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
You could be.

463
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
That'd be kind of fun, wouldn't it?

464
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,000
Go back 10 years and look at stuff.

465
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,800
Oh, well, I mean, look, this is how these big guys do it.

466
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:11,080
I mean, Kubernetes clusters the world over and monitored by Prometheus.

467
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,360
OpenShift actually ships a bunch of stuff with Prometheus built in.

468
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,320
And so this is one of those technologies that if you're thinking about getting into DevOps

469
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,080
and that kind of space of site reliability engineering, these are the sorts of tools

470
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,640
that you should be mucking about within your home lab and trying to figure out how they

471
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,200
work and understand them because you'll be able to take that knowledge and use it to

472
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
get a better job.

473
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Yep.

474
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Great skill to have.

475
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
I just like the idea.

476
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,680
I just like the idea of picturing you like 10 years from now looking back at some graph

477
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,680
analogs and just kind of getting nostalgic from graphs and logs.

478
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,920
My CPU is 33 degrees on May the 5th, 2021.

479
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
Hey, great.

480
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,560
Ah, I remember that.

481
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,320
Those were the days.

482
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,440
Cloudfree.shop.

483
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,960
Head over there and buy from a community member who has built a business out of creating devices

484
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,200
that are ready to go without any cloud restriction.

485
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,520
And they posted an update in February and you got to mention in here, he says, did we?

486
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
How cool is that?

487
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,600
He says, I need to also thank Alex and the self-hosted podcast.

488
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,360
I've listened to Jupiter broadcasting podcast for over seven years and without our partnership,

489
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,880
Cloudfree would not have grown nearly as fast as it did.

490
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,040
And I got to say it hit me in the feels because the picture they have in that looks a lot

491
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,520
like what we're doing for the Jupiter garage shipping right now.

492
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,760
And I just totally realized like I'm learning a lot of the same stuff that they had to learn

493
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,480
to do Cloudfree right now.

494
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,120
And so I felt very like, like I had a kinship all of a sudden and I thought that was really

495
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,800
great that they, they had a really, this is a really good, this is a really positive update.

496
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,640
It looks like things are going really well for Cloudfree and that's why we like to mention

497
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,640
them.

498
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,320
It was an idea that I think needed to happen.

499
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,760
And it's, it's a great way to go get devices at a very reasonable price, like outdoor and

500
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:03,440
indoor smart plugs, Zigbee dongles, temperature sensors, motion sensors, Z-Wave buttons, door

501
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,720
sensors, all that kind of stuff that you might want to, you might want to hook up to home

502
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,180
assistant, but you know, you don't want to have to bother with the reflashing yourself

503
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:14,880
or worrying about the required cloud connectivity that they ship with by default.

504
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,240
Cloudfree just takes care of all that.

505
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,320
That's why we like to give them a mention at cloudfree.shop.

506
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,560
And when you're over there, don't forget to use the coupon code self-hosted so that they

507
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,120
know we sent you.

508
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,040
All right, feedback time, I think Daniel writes in, I'm currently using a Synology

509
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,480
216J with an EXT4 volume mirrored on two drives.

510
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,920
I'm curious about how I might go about upgrading here and prioritize backup ergonomics.

511
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:45,200
Right now I don't have snapshots and I'm considering switching to ZFS or ButterFS, brackets, please

512
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,600
don't fight.

513
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,720
How can I do this without purchasing a huge external hard drive to move everything over

514
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,040
whilst I build a new volume?

515
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,520
So NFS seems kind of antiquated and I'm wondering if this is the fastest way to mount things

516
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
over the network.

517
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Is there a better option?

518
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Hmm.

519
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,000
A little NFS hate there, huh?

520
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,840
No, I used to think that too.

521
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,880
You know, actually that's sort of the beauty of NFS is that it's so simple.

522
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,600
It is extremely efficient, but there are lots of ways to transfer files over the network.

523
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,840
It is old, but you know, one way you could look at old is tested, you know, reliable.

524
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
Right.

525
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
Boring.

526
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,100
And it's still in production.

527
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,400
So this is an interesting question.

528
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,000
It's like I want to do something that's kind of risky, like switch to ZFS or ButterFS,

529
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,340
but I don't want to have to purchase an external hard drive to back everything up to.

530
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,280
And there's definitely part of me that's like, that's just not how it works.

531
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,040
I just want to say, you know, when you're messing with important data, you do kind of

532
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:47,760
want to externalize it because you can convert an extended for partition in place to ButterFS.

533
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,480
I've done it a couple of times actually.

534
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,520
I was just having a conversation with somebody earlier this morning about just that thing.

535
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,840
And it'll work, but I can't tell you it's risk-free.

536
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,640
It is absolutely not.

537
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,280
And so I don't know how you get around that.

538
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,540
Do you have any ideas on maybe like pulling other disks on your LAN or I mean something

539
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,880
out of the box?

540
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
Not really.

541
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,520
I mean, it goes back to that whole RAID is not a backup type thing.

542
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,520
So even if you have a volume mirrored on two drives, unless that data exists somewhere else

543
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,580
as well, I would pretty much say that data doesn't actually exist at all because if that

544
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,260
mirror was to go pop, that data is gone.

545
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:33,720
So this is probably not what you want to hear, but I would buy that external hard drive,

546
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,360
mirror everything onto that external hard drive, free up the two drives that you want

547
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,920
to put ZFS or ButterFS onto, and then you should be good to go.

548
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,600
That I completely agree with.

549
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,220
And now as an aside, I want to just acknowledge that I do feel like we go about our daily

550
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:54,680
lives totally underutilizing lots of free space on the systems on our LAN.

551
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,440
And I know there's a couple of projects out there to crack this nut, but if anybody listening

552
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,960
is using something and it has been using it for a little bit to take advantage of maybe

553
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,800
a machine over here that's connected via Ethernet that has 120 gigs free and this machine over

554
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,080
here that has a terabyte free and I have a machine over here that has 500 gigs and a

555
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:19,040
machine over here that has four terabytes free, and I just need temporarily, I just

556
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,760
need somewhere to store an extra seven terabytes a day, it's like, could I pool everything

557
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:29,480
somehow together and then somehow trust that this network file system would work?

558
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,120
And there's ways you could hack it together, especially on Linux with different mount points

559
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,140
and all of that, but I just don't know of a solid one.

560
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,900
So selfhosted.show slash contact, if anyone out there has something just out of curiosity,

561
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,160
just be a fun thought experiment to pool the storage on my network.

562
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,000
I don't think I'd use it for anything in production or for backup though.

563
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,640
Just don't think I would.

564
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,880
The next one comes from Mike and he's responding to a question I proposed last week about using

565
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,720
home assistant automations to cycle the charging of batteries on and off so that way devices

566
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,380
don't sit at 100% charged for days or they don't stay at 0% charged, maybe something

567
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,840
in the 40 to 60% range.

568
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,240
It'd be lovely to have an option to say, today I want everything charged to 100% because

569
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,080
we're going on a road trip today and we need everything charged up.

570
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,000
And we got a couple ideas suggested and I liked Mike's and I wanted to give it a read

571
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
here.

572
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,520
He says, since there's really no out of the box solution right now, I'm creating a script

573
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,400
that scrapes my laptop's battery info and then we'll publish it to my home assistant's

574
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:38,400
MQTT broker and then home assistant will act on that data to power cycle my laptop's power

575
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
supply.

576
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Keep up the show.

577
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Thanks.

578
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
And Mike, good idea.

579
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,400
That's great for the laptops.

580
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:50,760
The impossible nut that I'm trying to crack is like iOS devices, maybe even drone batteries,

581
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,520
things that don't even have an OS to scrape from, but you'd almost need like a time-based

582
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,840
system I suppose.

583
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,800
I'm still chewing on it right now.

584
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,920
I just kind of do it manually and it's not bad, but an example of a system that I probably

585
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:10,620
don't unplug and cycle the battery as frequently as I should are those fire tablets that are

586
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,920
plugged in and mounted on the wall.

587
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,500
I do power cycle them on occasion, but not regularly.

588
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,120
And with the home assistant app on Android, like there is something I could do there,

589
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,560
but I'm not looking for onesy-twosy solutions.

590
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,120
I'm kind of looking for something that would work for everything.

591
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,600
I'm going to plug something that our community started about six months ago called Halcyon

592
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,740
Home Assistant Linux Companion App.

593
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,360
And there's a link in the show notes, halcyon.casa.

594
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,900
It's a Rust-based application designed to run on Linux systems to present those metrics

595
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,680
to home assistant.

596
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,640
It's early days and it needs some love and some work still, but if you're interested

597
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,320
in that, check out, there's a dedicated channel in the Discord for Halcyon as well.

598
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
And it's written in Rust.

599
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
So what more could you want?

600
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,320
I love that.

601
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,360
Now, Brad writes in, I'm looking into moving off Google Photos like everybody else, it

602
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
seems.

603
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,960
I've landed on Plex Photos as my solution.

604
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,600
I have some friends that are also self-hosters and I've given them WireGuard access and they

605
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:18,040
said I can have a few hundred gig of storage on their networks for my photos and vice versa.

606
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,800
What I'm stuck on though is an encrypted backup method for backups.

607
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,280
I've tried Duplicati.

608
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,480
I've tried some other backup solutions.

609
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,240
I don't really care about how it backs up file changes as the library is growing.

610
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,040
I'm not editing the photos, so only incremental is needed.

611
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,280
They do need to be encrypted though, because they're going to be on a remote LAN.

612
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,520
Now I haven't done a lot of research on this yet, but do you know of any software that

613
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,240
does an automated one-way backup, phone to server for example, to get the photos off

614
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,400
my phone and onto the server where I can delete them off my phone and they will stay on the

615
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
server.

616
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,760
Looking forward to future episodes.

617
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
Thanks, Brad.

618
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,800
This is a good question.

619
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,440
Duplicati is not quite cutting it.

620
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,960
And so what do you step up to essentially?

621
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,760
And you don't want something probably that's a lot to manage either.

622
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,520
Oh, Duplicati's just wound me up over the years.

623
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,080
You know, it just silently fails and stuff just breaks and there's no way to monitor

624
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,100
it and you can only configure it through the GUI.

625
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
It's a great app.

626
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,960
It just isn't very reliable, which is not really suitable for a backup system.

627
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,960
Yeah.

628
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,080
I don't know where the failure process, when my backups failed, when my Google Drive payment

629
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,080
expired or it was switched, I don't know where the failure was exactly.

630
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,800
I don't know if there wasn't a notification, but I don't know what.

631
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,440
It was ultimately it was my fault.

632
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:42,040
I thought about recommending Borg, which is a really solid backup, open source solution.

633
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,920
It's pretty space efficient.

634
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,080
It gives you good encrypted backups.

635
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,440
It supports compression and it'll use fuse too, so you can do kind of creative ways to

636
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,400
mount file systems, which could be kind of nice.

637
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,760
And it has a pretty large community.

638
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,880
You can find it at borg-backup.org.

639
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,840
That might be worth looking into.

640
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,760
Borg is an alternative.

641
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Restik is another one.

642
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,720
We mentioned Auto Restik and Restik last episode.

643
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,880
That's another one.

644
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,680
But for getting the things off your phone, I've just been really happy with the NextCloud

645
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,140
app.

646
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:18,180
It backs up everything off my phone in full quality to my NextCloud instance.

647
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,880
And then from there, I can do with them whatever I want to.

648
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,360
That's the one we hear the most often from the audience, too, is the NextCloud solution.

649
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,600
We have gotten a recommendation a couple of times into the show about Photosync as well,

650
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,520
which is in the Android Play Store, Photosync, one word.

651
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,720
And the nice thing about Photosync is it supports various different kind of network backup

652
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,180
options, even Samba, if you want to go that route.

653
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,600
You could just back up your photos over Samba from Android.

654
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,680
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes as well.

655
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,520
Now you mentioned in your question about Plex photos, and this is a really bad time to be

656
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,960
adopting Plex photos as a solution, unfortunately.

657
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,640
Plex document on their support pages that as of June 2021, camera upload is going to

658
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
be discontinued.

659
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
Womp, womp.

660
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
Yeah, boy.

661
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:09,340
And I think a lot of us are just getting, we're just getting a little Plex skeptical.

662
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,620
We're still Plex hopeful, but we're getting Plex skeptical.

663
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:19,800
And I do have to admit personally that Plex skepticism I'm feeling right now would probably,

664
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,440
would hesitate from using Plex photos myself for back, and I'm not using it because of

665
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
that reason.

666
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,060
Dare I say Plex are becoming the Google of the self-hosted world, just killing stuff

667
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:33,160
randomly and not focusing on the core products like they should be.

668
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
I don't know.

669
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,360
I guess I feel it's kind of mean.

670
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,940
They are such a smaller team that they do have to be a little more conservative about

671
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,720
where they spend their time and money where Google's like this, you know, this just financial

672
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,840
monster powerhouse supplied by an endless amount of ad money.

673
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,960
So it's like, come on, you know, maybe you could keep this going.

674
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,520
Maybe you could invest a little more in Stadia, you know, like right now they're killing Stadia.

675
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
Drives me crazy.

676
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,720
I know it's not a self-hosted thing, but dang it.

677
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,120
Well, everybody knew that was going to happen even before it launched.

678
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,120
I know.

679
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,840
Like did you see like some big exec just left, like the top Stadia exec just left Google

680
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
or something.

681
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Oh, really?

682
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
Yeah.

683
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,840
Not good.

684
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Not good.

685
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,320
I was a big fan of it, even though I often have no internet when I'm out traveling.

686
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,560
I just love the idea of being able to play Stadia on any machine I want, Alex, you know,

687
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,880
games on a machine with just a really crappy video card.

688
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
I don't care.

689
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,200
Here's some neat ideas.

690
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,720
Well, I'm actually thinking about building my own self-hosted gaming setup here in the

691
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,320
studio just using Steam though, you know, just have it on the LAN and just stream it

692
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,320
to the boxes that way.

693
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Use Steam, use Parsec, Moonlight, all these different streaming protocols, lots of different

694
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
ways to skin that turkey.

695
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,360
I want to say thanks to our members at selfhosted.show slash SRE.

696
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,840
Become a site reliability expert.

697
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,280
Keep the show on the air.

698
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,700
And as a thank you, as a special thank you, as a golden thank you, a limited ad feed,

699
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,700
just nice, tight production.

700
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,360
It's a nice, tight, quicker show.

701
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
Isn't that great?

702
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,040
All the Drew Lovin, just less ads.

703
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,440
And you also get extra content, a post show, you get a post show where I'm going to try

704
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,920
to propose, Alex, try something new for the summer.

705
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
We'll see how that goes.

706
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,920
Oh, no.

707
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,120
How much is this going to cost me?

708
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,840
Oh, yes, it will cost you.

709
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,000
Also thank you to a cloud guru.

710
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,400
You can find them on social media.

711
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,040
They're just slash a cloud guru everywhere.

712
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,520
Pretty easy to find them.

713
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,680
Selfhosted.show slash contact is the place to go to get in touch with us.

714
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,800
