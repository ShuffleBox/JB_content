1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
So the last episode, 69, we recorded on 420, and today, somehow, is Star Wars Day!

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,440
Happy Star Wars Day, everybody!

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,940
Yay!

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,940
Yay!

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,700
I mean, that joke was funny when I was about eight years old, and it's... still funny now?

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,200
Is it?

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,900
I've never been a big Star Wars guy.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,400
Oh...

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,200
I'm not like an anti-Star Wars guy at all.

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:27,100
I'll enjoy me a little Star Wars, but I just haven't really been into much, other than the Mandalorian, which is fantastic.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,900
But who shot first? That's the question.

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,000
We all know who shot first. Han shot first. Come on.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, of course, joining me today, we have Chris. Hello, Chris.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,900
Hello!

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,700
Brent.

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,400
Hello!

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,800
Who you all know from Linux Unplugged.

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,500
And we also have from our Discord, for our community spotlight this episode, Fuzzy Mistborn.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,200
Hello, Fuzzy.

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello!

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,300
Nice to catch up with you again.

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,600
We met you at the meetup, didn't we?

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,500
Yes, you did.

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,900
And you were the guy with the Steam Deck that we were all very jealous of, and the electric car, and...

25
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,900
We'll get into all that business in just a little bit.

26
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,900
But I think Chris has got an update about his new show festival.

27
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,400
Oh, really? You're going to... Oh, thanks, Alex.

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,300
Yeah, well, actually, I wanted to mention it here on the show because we are kicking off a total website rebuild project.

29
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,900
And Alex, you joined me with Brent and Wes on the last episode,

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,000
and we talked about what we want to do, and how we kind of want to build the new website,

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,800
and we're taking in ideas, and we've launched some GitHub projects around it.

32
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,900
And so all of the details are in Office Hours 3.

33
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,300
So if you go to officehours.hair.com,

34
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,900
then you can listen to that episode and hear what Alex and I had to say about what we want to do with the new JB website.

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,700
And we're really looking for input because we have to have it done by the end of summer,

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,000
because Scale Engine, who we've been with for like 12, 13 years, I was just looking,

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,200
they are no longer in the WordPress biz.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Nothing like a deadline, is there?

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,700
Yeah, and so they're getting out of it by the end of summer.

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,600
And so we got to get the website moved, and we want to rebuild it, and we want to self-host it, of course.

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,900
So officehours.hair, help us figure it out, join the conversation.

42
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,300
We'll figure it out together.

43
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,600
There's a link in the show notes to a very active GitHub issue, actually,

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,600
where there's lots of people throwing out lots of different ideas about how we can self-host different stacks,

45
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:14,800
anything from Ghost to GitLab to Grav to Hugo, all those sorts of things.

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,000
Like Chris says, there's an Office Hours episode where we all discuss the various requirements that we have, I suppose,

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,500
and trying to build like a podcast network website, you know, where there are...

48
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,500
How many shows do you have? Like six? Eight?

49
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,900
Yeah, six shows, I guess. Five active shows, then you have extras, so six.

50
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, and then you've got a bunch of archive shows, too, which you want to present to people.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,600
And then there's about, I don't know, a million guests on all the shows that you need to update, all their various content.

52
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,700
There's a lot.

53
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,500
And you think, well, we could design a whole database around this.

54
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,500
You could design a whole CMS, you know, if you're not careful.

55
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,000
We're trying to be cognizant of the fact that people will be giving up their free time to help us and all the rest of that.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,300
If you've got any opinions, any thoughts, please head over to the Jupiter Broadcasting GitHub organization

57
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,800
and give us your feedback in the issue number eight linked in the show notes.

58
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,700
I'm excited about what we might build.

59
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,800
We've gotten some really good ideas already, things we hadn't even considered,

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,500
like maybe the ability for certain community members to update episode pages and show notes

61
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,400
with things that were either missed or maybe links that die.

62
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,200
There's all kinds of ideas that are floating around right there.

63
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,300
So we're just kicking off the conversation, but we also need to move kind of quick.

64
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,300
It's one of those things.

65
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,100
I can't tell you the number of times as a listener of a various podcast, I go to the show notes.

66
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,600
I'm like, what was that thing?

67
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,800
And they didn't put it in the show notes.

68
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,500
And I know that we are guilty of that, too, because I have listeners writing and tell me that we're guilty of it.

69
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,000
And it would be great if they could, you know, submit their their feedback.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,300
Now, a few episodes ago, we had the orange one on for our very first community member spotlight.

71
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,000
And today we're joined by Fuzzy Mistborn. Hello, Fuzzy.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,600
Hello.

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,700
Yeah, so you're drinking a tasty beverage over there. What do you have?

74
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,200
I have a beer from a local brewery that is a triple golden ale.

75
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I see both Brent and our guest have a beer.

76
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,900
I don't have a beer.

77
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,000
Actually, this is a hopped cider.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,600
Thank you very much.

79
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,200
Oh, okay. Okay.

80
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,800
So you and I have been talking for many months, probably over a year at this point in the Discord.

81
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,400
I'd say we're pretty good friends in there.

82
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,300
We've been talking about so many different projects and, you know, EVs, for example,

83
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,200
so many things in common. I thought it'd be great to get you on and talk about various things.

84
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,100
So let's start with that electric car, shall we?

85
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,900
I know it's not self-hosted related, but I'm really curious about how your journey with the Ionic 5 is going.

86
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,100
I've had it now for about a month and so far it's been fantastic.

87
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,600
Of course, the first two weeks of it, I go up to my parents who live about four hours away

88
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,800
and I drive down to Raleigh, which is about eight hours.

89
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,800
So I put about 2,000 miles on the car in about two weeks.

90
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,400
Is there any way to do it? Proper shakedown test.

91
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,200
Yeah.

92
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,500
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That was definitely an experience.

93
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,100
So I definitely got to try out, you know, the rapid charging and seeing how all that works.

94
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,500
How was that? How was the charging? Because it was down, what, I-95?

95
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,200
Yes, pretty much 95 most of the way.

96
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,700
The first time I did it, by my way down, I was kind of ultra conservative and charged wherever I possibly could.

97
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,700
But on the way back, it was only about two charges.

98
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,400
A little bit more comfortable in what the car could do.

99
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,600
And I knew kind of what the range of the vehicle would be when it was saying, you know, you've got 30% left.

100
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,100
I knew I've got X number of miles.

101
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,700
You were feeling a little more adventurous at that point, I see.

102
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,500
Well, you know, whilst you were busy in that delicious old RV with Nixie Pixel, Chris,

103
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,900
I was given a little spin around the block in the Ionic and Fuzzy put his foot down a couple of times.

104
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,900
That was fun. I was pinned back in my seat for sure.

105
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,900
Yes, that is definitely, that still brings a smile to my face every time I drive it.

106
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,300
I throw it in sport mode for a couple of minutes just to accelerate and just like, pew!

107
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,100
That's like the boost noise.

108
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,900
Pew, pew!

109
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,500
Now I want to know, like, are you collecting or do you see any possibilities to collect metrics?

110
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,100
You know where I go with this kind of thing.

111
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,900
I start thinking like, let's collect some data.

112
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,100
There is a Home Assistant integration, but it's honestly not super great, but that's not a fault of the developers.

113
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,700
I mean, there's some stuff missing that I want to see added,

114
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,500
but the major issue just is that Hyundai limits you to about 30 API calls a day.

115
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,700
That's not very many.

116
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,300
No, so the developer actually has put in like there's blackout times at night where from like,

117
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,100
you know, you can customize it, but I think the default is like 10 p.m. to 6 or 7 a.m.

118
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,300
It doesn't make any calls whatsoever just to try and preserve them for you.

119
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,400
But yeah, it's kind of limited in what you can do.

120
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,600
So what I do use is I use a better route planner,

121
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,500
which is great for planning trips because it shows you, you know,

122
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,000
basically you type in, it's like Google Maps for electric vehicles.

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,400
And you, you know, say I'm coming from here and I'm going to here, going down to Raleigh,

124
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,400
and it'll say, okay, and you know, here's the car I have,

125
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,500
and it'll basically figure out, okay, you know, you're starting at this percentage battery,

126
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,800
you know, the weather's going to be this, you know, the wind's going to be this,

127
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,200
so therefore it can figure out, okay, you need to stop here, here, and here and charge this amount

128
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
to get where you're going.

129
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,600
And as part of the, part of the, one of the ways I improve that is you can get little

130
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,700
ODB2 Bluetooth low-energy devices and plug them into your ODB2 port in your car,

131
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,500
and a better route planner can integrate with that and pull the state of charge off the car.

132
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,000
So therefore it'll, it'll update in real time.

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,800
So for example, like when I left to get down to Raleigh the first time,

134
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I said I was going to arrive, you know, my first destination with like 10% charge.

135
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,000
I got there with like 30, and I could see it counting back up as it, you know,

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,400
based on the real-time telemetry it was getting.

137
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,700
That's a legit feature.

138
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
I didn't actually, I didn't even think about it.

139
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,300
I didn't even realize that electric cars had ODB2 ports.

140
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,300
I suppose they have to by law, but it just never even crossed my mind.

141
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,400
It just seems like such an old archaic, you know, the whole CAN bus thing just seems so old.

142
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,500
You and I got burned by that automatic thing, do you remember?

143
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,300
Oh, I loved automatic too, even though they were sloping up all my data,

144
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,200
but they tracked every drive that I did in the RV for the first few years.

145
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,100
So I had this brilliant heat map of everywhere we had been in the RV.

146
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,800
It was, it was great, and it got all my fuel mileage info for me.

147
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
I'd love to have that again.

148
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,600
We've talked about that a little bit on the show, trying to recreate that.

149
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,800
Yeah, there's an app called Torque that I've been trying to play with

150
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,400
that might let thing, let me kind of upload it into Home Assistant.

151
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,200
I couldn't quite get it to work and I haven't had a chance to go back to it,

152
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,800
but that would supposedly let me upload that information directly into Home Assistant

153
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,300
and have sensors and data that way.

154
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,600
But honestly, I charge the car once a week, you know, on Sunday night,

155
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,800
Sunday Home Assistant will ping me if the battery is below, you know,

156
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,100
I think 50% and you know, I can go and plug it in.

157
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,300
It'll charge up overnight in a couple hours.

158
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,800
And honestly, I basically, you're only supposed to charge about 80% at any given,

159
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,900
you know, you're only supposed to charge to 100 if you're actually going to be going somewhere long distance.

160
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,000
So usually 80% is enough to get me through the entire week.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,400
That's so cool.

162
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,000
So how about a seamless segue? Shall we switch gears?

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh!

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,300
That was questionable.

165
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,700
Top Gear?

166
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Oh, yes, Top Gear. Where's Jeremy?

167
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,600
I've been following your blog for a long time at blog.fuzzymissborn.com

168
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,800
and there's so many posts on there that we could talk about,

169
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,500
but there's one in particular which really has my interest peaked right now

170
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,900
and that is the Renovate Bot one.

171
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,700
I'm curious to ask you what you're using Renovate Bot for

172
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,000
and what your experience has been with it.

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,900
So Renovate Bot, I have run on my infrastructure Ansible GitHub repo.

174
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,400
And basically what it will do is it will go through,

175
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,500
I don't even, I don't even, honestly, you can self-host it, I don't.

176
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,400
So I don't know how often the publicly hosted one goes through,

177
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,200
but it's honestly pretty fast, like maybe in every hour or so it runs.

178
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,800
And it basically runs through whatever I tell it to run through

179
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,000
and will tell me, for example, for mine,

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,900
it'll tell me if there's new Docker images available.

181
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,300
You know, for all my Docker compose stuff,

182
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,900
I'll, you know, state, you know, home assistant slash,

183
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:05,300
you know, whatever slash, what does it say, 2022.05.01.

184
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,300
And it'll go through and say, oh, well, there's.02 available

185
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,100
and it'll create a pull request on the infrastructure repo

186
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,500
that I can then go in and say, yes, you know, merge this

187
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,600
or hang on, this is actually a beta or, oh no,

188
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm seeing there are some issues with it.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,400
So I don't actually have to merge it until I need to.

190
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,000
So what exactly does it do?

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,700
It's like a GitOps style way of working, right?

192
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,500
It looks at the upstream images and says, you know,

193
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,600
there's a new home assistant container

194
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,600
and it creates a pull request, right, against your repo

195
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,900
and then what?

196
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,700
Basically that's it, it creates a pull request.

197
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,900
I can see, you know, basically you can actually even,

198
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,400
you can customize, I don't even honestly scratch the surface

199
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,500
of what it can do.

200
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,600
You can, you know, go ahead and auto merge, you know,

201
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,000
minor updates, so if it's like, you know, a.01 release,

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,100
you can tell it just to automatically merge that for you,

203
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,000
you know, and save the major revisions for, you know,

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,800
manual review or, I mean, honestly,

205
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,900
I barely scratched the surface of what it can do.

206
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,100
I know a lot of people use it for maintaining their dependencies

207
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,500
for all the different, you know, projects.

208
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,100
They'll use it for, and they'll have just renovate bot,

209
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,200
go through and just automatically update

210
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,400
and merge a lot of the dependency upgrades.

211
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
Now, another post that you have on your blog

212
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,300
is your love-hate relationship with drone.io.

213
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,400
But before we get there,

214
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,900
and because you mentioned Top Gear a moment ago,

215
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,900
we do have the Top Gear style leaderboard storage question,

216
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,900
which one of our amazing listeners has added

217
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,700
to the self-hosted Wiki.

218
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,300
So what we're gonna do is set some rules, right?

219
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,100
It's raw storage.

220
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,600
How much raw storage do you have on your LAN?

221
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,700
Here's the, I'm gonna maybe cheat a little bit.

222
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,700
So I have about 10 terabytes that I store offsite

223
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,000
with the, you know, external hard drive

224
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,600
that I leave in the office, you know, at work,

225
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,700
so that way I have, you know, cold storage.

226
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,200
So if we include that, it's about 80 terabytes.

227
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,100
But we don't include that

228
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,400
because we literally just said on your LAN.

229
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,200
I know, but it's on my LAN for like, you know,

230
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,000
a couple hours a month.

231
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Unless we count tail scale as the LAN these days.

232
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,600
So who knows?

233
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,500
Oh boy.

234
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
What do we think, audience?

235
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,800
70 or 80 terabytes?

236
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,700
Let me know in the chat,

237
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,000
and we'll submit a pull request to the repo

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,700
before the end of the show, hopefully.

239
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,400
I need to do a calculation on my end

240
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,100
now that we have these new servers in-house, too.

241
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,900
There's two boxes, and each have 48 terabytes of storage,

242
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,900
and then we have 24 terabytes of storage in the old server.

243
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,700
Not to mention the Bitcoin node has, what, two?

244
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,800
Is it two we threw in there?

245
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,000
Eight terabytes, eight terabytes.

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,400
Yeah, in the Bitcoin node.

247
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,200
Yeah, that was an easy store that you shucked.

248
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,300
Yeah, and then hid in his drawer for a year or two.

249
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,400
Right.

250
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,700
So I should do the final calculation

251
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,000
just so we have it up to date.

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,900
All right, so we're going with 80 terabytes then, are we?

253
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,200
Eight, zero.

254
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,800
Oh, that's because everybody likes him in the Discord.

255
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,200
That's what's up.

256
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,000
Thank you, thank you, audience.

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,400
Jeff Gehling has 84 terabytes.

258
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,600
So that puts you in fourth spot, Fuzzy.

259
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,300
Good job.

260
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,100
Yeah, I've got some worsting in the back bin,

261
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,500
but I won't conclude that.

262
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,000
Well, what you do is when you get it online,

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,600
you come back on the show, and then you can beat him.

264
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,100
I actually have to get more room in my storage server.

265
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
I am maxed out.

266
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,200
That's just it.

267
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,800
Density is a thing, people.

268
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,100
Hey, man, it's not my problem.

269
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,600
If you want to be on the winner board or not,

270
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,000
I mean, it's just not my problem.

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
You just got to do what you got to do.

272
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,400
All right, so should we get back to the drone.io love-hate

273
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,200
relationship thing?

274
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,300
What's that all about?

275
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,300
I'm actually not an engineer or any kind of technical field.

276
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,400
I'm a lawyer by profession.

277
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,000
So I sort of dabbled in all this for fun.

278
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,500
And so I started looking at drone because there were some

279
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,800
things that I wanted to automate in terms of building Docker

280
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,500
images and some other stuff.

281
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,600
And I know GitHub Actions was out there,

282
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,800
but this is self-hosted.

283
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,900
I want to learn how to do this all myself.

284
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:07,200
So drone is a CI-CD system with continuous integration,

285
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,600
continuous deployment, where basically you can,

286
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,900
it's very similar to GitHub Actions or Jenkins or some of

287
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,100
the other ones that are, I think Circle CI is another one.

288
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,400
Basically, you can do anything you can do in a Bash script.

289
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,600
Like I basically use it to do a bunch of Bash commands

290
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,900
on some things.

291
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,000
It builds a bunch of my Docker images for me.

292
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,500
I built actually, one of the recent things I did was I

293
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,800
actually started building an Ubuntu server image every week

294
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,600
that gets deployed into a Nextcloud.

295
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,300
So that way I just have a constantly up-to-date cloud

296
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,200
and knitted ISO image.

297
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,400
I've had a few issues with drone myself, actually.

298
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,100
Like just for no apparent reason, a job that I've set up,

299
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,400
the build will stop running automatically

300
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,200
for no apparent reason.

301
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,600
Like I will push something to my GitT instance.

302
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,400
The build will detect that it's been pushed,

303
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,000
but nothing happens.

304
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,100
And I can't figure out exactly quite what's going on there.

305
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,600
So I delete the build in drone and then I recreate it

306
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,400
and it's fine for a couple of weeks.

307
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,100
And then the same thing happens

308
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,000
and it's infuriating, if I'm honest.

309
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,300
Drone, so the issues I had with it,

310
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,000
as I kind of laid out in the post, were, you know,

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,400
it's really good,

312
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,100
but the documentation was pretty poor in some ways.

313
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,400
Like the one thing I remember,

314
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,100
I was actually looking through the post again recently,

315
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,700
cron, cron jobs.

316
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,700
You couldn't tell it a time zone.

317
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,000
So therefore it defaulted to, you know, GMT, you know,

318
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,500
Greenwich Mean Time.

319
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,400
And I couldn't figure out how to get it on my time zone,

320
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,200
which was annoying.

321
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,700
So I had to always think five hours difference.

322
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,800
Hey man, I've made a career out of that.

323
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Ba-dum-bum.

324
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,100
Actually, I'm just kind of curious

325
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,800
because you did tease a little Home Assistant action there.

326
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,500
Can you give us just kind of a rough idea

327
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,300
of the Home Assistant setup, what it's running on

328
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,400
and sort of the key things you have it doing for you?

329
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,700
Just like a picture.

330
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,500
I run Home Assistant in Docker.

331
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,400
It's running on my Proxmox server downstairs

332
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,600
in the basement.

333
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,800
The main backbone of what I run here is Z-Wave.

334
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,500
All my switches are Z-Wave.

335
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,200
I have a bunch of sensors that are Z-Wave though.

336
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,900
I've started using a lot more ZigBee sensors

337
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,400
just because they're cheaper

338
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,300
and I found they work a little bit better than the Z-Wave.

339
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,800
Better in what way?

340
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,300
So I got these Z-Wave sensors

341
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,600
that were for a company called Dome.

342
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,300
I think it was the name, Dome.

343
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,700
And I think they've gone out of business

344
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
since they made these.

345
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,900
Uh-oh.

346
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,700
Yeah, so they work, oh, they work pretty well,

347
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,700
but they're also, I think they were about 35 or 40 bucks

348
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,200
versus the ZigBee Aquara buttons are like 20.

349
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,700
So I have them all over the house

350
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,200
because one of the big things I have here

351
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
is I have all the lights are on automation.

352
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,800
So every time motion's detected,

353
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,100
with certain current parameters are met,

354
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
the lights will turn on

355
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,400
and then after a set period of time, they'll turn off.

356
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,500
Sure, nice.

357
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,400
Did you then I assume go through the Z-Wave migration

358
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,100
that I have been putting off?

359
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Yes, I did.

360
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,300
I am on the Z-Wave JS.

361
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,400
I've been on it for probably over a year now.

362
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,600
Oh, rub it in.

363
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Originally, what I had done was I actually,

364
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,300
I got to the Z-Wave network rebooting

365
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,100
took like five, 10, 15, 20 minutes sometimes

366
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,600
for me to reboot Home Assistant

367
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,400
where it would just sit there spinning

368
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,400
and it would take forever for the network to come back up.

369
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,900
And so I actually got tired of that to the point

370
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,900
where I actually created a separate Home Assistant instance

371
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,200
that only ran Z-Wave.

372
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,400
Huh, interesting idea.

373
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,300
And I bridged it with MQTT to my main instance.

374
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,400
And you're still doing it that way now?

375
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,500
No, no, no, so I was doing that for a while

376
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,100
and then the Open Z-Wave came out

377
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,300
and I'm like, oh, let me give this a try

378
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,000
and see if this is better and it was,

379
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,200
but then obviously that got deprecated and moved on.

380
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,700
So I'm like, well, I'm kind of on a dead end here

381
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,100
and I've already done the pain once

382
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,600
I might as well change it all.

383
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,300
So I upgraded to the Z-Wave JS

384
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,400
and honestly it's worked brilliantly.

385
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,000
There's been a couple of things where like the lock I have,

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,400
the Schlage lock, I had to create a couple of sensors

387
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,900
to kind of get back some functionality

388
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,800
that was default on Open Z-Wave

389
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,500
for like what guest code and what door codes use.

390
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,900
Cause one of the things I have is if a door code is used,

391
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,100
like if I create a one-time guest code, if it's used,

392
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,400
it'll actually delete that code after it's used.

393
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,600
That's great.

394
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,700
That is cool.

395
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,100
So it recycles once a week.

396
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,700
I get a telegram ping saying, here's the new guest code.

397
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,400
I can give that out to people

398
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,000
if they need to get into my house for whatever reason,

399
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,400
then it'll delete itself.

400
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,500
I would imagine you're probably in pretty good shape too

401
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,600
because I thought I heard today on the live stream

402
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,000
that the Z-Wave JS maintainer now works full time

403
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,500
for Nebuchadnezzar.

404
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,200
So they're gonna be probably keeping that

405
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,600
in pretty good shape.

406
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,700
Yes, I had heard that.

407
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,400
I think I'd seen that as well.

408
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,100
And I'm actually in the process of building a new house.

409
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,500
And so I'm actually gonna keep using Z-Wave there

410
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,000
for the switches just because I hadn't been able to find

411
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,800
any kind of Zigbee equivalent that allows dimming

412
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,200
and switches for a reasonable price.

413
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,800
I know Inovelli just came out with their blue switches,

414
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,600
but they're like $45 a switch.

415
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,900
The brand I like is Zoos

416
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,600
or I guess it's sold by the smartest home

417
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,500
and they're about $25 a switch.

418
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,600
Yeah, Z-O-O-Z is the brand.

419
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,300
Now I know that you have some like whiz bang traffic

420
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,200
like system to tell your kids it's okay

421
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
to get up in the morning.

422
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,300
Like as a new parent, I need to absorb this.

423
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,600
Tell me, yeah, I wanna hear about this too.

424
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,900
One of the things that I did

425
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,400
that my wife absolutely loves

426
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,900
is I have a Raspberry Pi that I installed Volumio on

427
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,500
that acts as a sound machine.

428
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,700
So it just plays white noise for the kids

429
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,800
and there's a door sensor on the door

430
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
that when it's closed and the light turns off,

431
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,600
it turns on the sound machine.

432
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,000
Now I've gone through different variations

433
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,100
of how you turn the sound machine off in the morning,

434
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,300
but it'll also automatically turn off in the morning.

435
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,100
What I do is actually that's kind of in handy

436
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,300
for doing things like the okay to wake clock,

437
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,600
which are useful for toddlers

438
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,300
because they obviously can't read a clock yet.

439
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,900
But they can, they do know their colors.

440
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,000
So my three-year-old for a long time,

441
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,800
what I do is about, it used to be an hour,

442
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,000
but then he started getting up earlier.

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,400
So now I've pushed it to about a half hour

444
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,100
before he's supposed to wake up.

445
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,700
I have a Z-Wave bulb in his room that will turn on red

446
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,200
and that's kind of, he knows if he wakes up,

447
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,000
he's not allowed to get out of bed.

448
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
He still does sometimes,

449
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,700
but most of the time he knows if it's red,

450
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,400
he's not supposed to get out of bed.

451
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,900
Whenever the time actually strikes

452
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,100
that he's allowed to wake up,

453
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,500
it turns green.

454
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,100
The other thing I've done is I have an ESP board

455
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,400
running WLED under his bed

456
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,900
that also if he gets out of bed

457
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,600
in the middle of the night and the door opens,

458
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,200
the light turns on red, pretty dims,

459
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,500
that way he can see and not trip over his feet

460
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,600
or actually get into bed at night.

461
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
He finds that to be a lot of fun.

462
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,800
That's really cool.

463
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,400
I mean, it's pretty cruel of you to keep your kid

464
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,300
in their bedroom until midday, but hey.

465
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,500
I wish midday usually 5 a.m.

466
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
I know, yeah.

467
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,200
Speaking of quality of life improvements,

468
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,300
like I could see how that would make the entire household

469
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,300
just way better instead of this random time thing

470
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,200
that many of us have experienced.

471
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,100
It worked well for the first little bit.

472
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,700
He's gotten, he goes in phases of obeying it and not

473
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,000
because yet he's three.

474
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,900
So I can't exactly fault him.

475
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,100
Hey, maybe I need to get one of those from my wife.

476
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,700
Actually, one of my all-time favorite automations I have

477
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,000
is so I have it on my blog somewhere,

478
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,700
but you basically I have two pieces of aluminum foil

479
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,200
that's over a piece of cardboard

480
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,500
and I have it underneath the bed tied to an ESP 32.

481
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,900
And when I get into bed at night, the lights all turn off.

482
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,800
That's great.

483
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,500
That's hilarious.

484
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,000
And if one of us gets out of bed at night,

485
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,900
the light turns on, you know, again, reds,

486
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
that way you can see and not trip over all the stuff

487
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,000
that's on the floor.

488
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,900
Is this motion?

489
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Is it pressure sensing?

490
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,000
What's happening?

491
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,800
It's pressure sensitive.

492
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,100
So basically, it's when there's enough pressure

493
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,600
on the cardboard, it basically pushes through.

494
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,900
There's a capacitive, I don't know if it's capacitive

495
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,200
or whatever it is, but there's enough of a connection.

496
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,900
It changes the resistive load so that the ESP

497
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,100
can pick up that slight difference

498
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,400
and trigger based on that.

499
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,300
You nerds.

500
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Honestly, I was shocked how well it worked.

501
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,600
Again, there's like, you know, Sleep IQ sells

502
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,100
like a $200 version of this kind of a thing.

503
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,600
I think I put it together for like 50 bucks.

504
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,100
Well, Fuzzy, thank you very much for coming on.

505
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
I think you're going to stick around

506
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,600
for the second half of the show.

507
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,500
Is there anywhere that, whilst you've got the mic,

508
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,800
you'd like to send people?

509
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Blog.FuzzyMissBorn.com.

510
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,500
Very good.

511
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,300
And of course, on the Discord as well.

512
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,800
Yes, that's probably one of the best ways to get me

513
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,600
if you want to talk to me.

514
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Linode.com slash SSH.

515
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,900
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account

516
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,900
and you go there to support this year's show.

517
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,600
Linode is the tinker's cloud.

518
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,300
You know what I'm saying?

519
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,000
Like, you could just deploy everything with one click.

520
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,500
Like, I was just looking today and they have a one click

521
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,300
for PyHole on Linode.

522
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,900
And I started thinking like, that could be great

523
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,200
for my son's laptop.

524
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,100
That could be excellent for mobile devices.

525
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,600
So if you want to go that route, you can.

526
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,400
But if you want to tinker, like I'm saying,

527
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,000
like you want to go all the way down to the metal

528
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,200
and then like deploy your own custom system,

529
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Linode lets you do that.

530
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,700
They got guides, they got information on how to do that,

531
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
and they've got the best support in the business.

532
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,100
But if you like performance,

533
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,100
they've also got something for you there too.

534
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,200
NVME hard drives, AMD EPYC CPUs, dedicated GPU rigs

535
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,900
if you want 40 gigabit connection to the hypervisors,

536
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,300
11 data centers around the world in strategic places

537
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,800
where they are their own ISP.

538
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,600
You see what I'm saying?

539
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,100
Nobody does it like Linode.

540
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,500
And I love their object storage.

541
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,200
Their S3 compatible object storage is like my superpower.

542
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,500
I use it for all kinds of things.

543
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,800
I needed to just test a new RSS format

544
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,100
and I just needed to like have an XML file

545
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,900
that was publicly available for like 30 minutes.

546
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,600
Like, what was I going to do?

547
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,700
Put that on a web server like an animal?

548
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,300
No, I put it up on object storage like a gentleman.

549
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,200
And of course their API is great.

550
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,300
Their command line client is quick.

551
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,600
There's so many things I love about it,

552
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,300
but just go try it out for yourself.

553
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,200
Best customer support, super fast networking,

554
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,200
crazy fast rigs, and a Linux culture that runs deep.

555
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,100
That's Linode right there.

556
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,000
That's why I choose to use them for two and a half years now.

557
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,100
Everything we've built in the last two and a half years,

558
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,400
I put it up on Linode.

559
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,000
Go try it out and get $100 while you support the show.

560
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,300
Linode.com slash SSH.

561
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,200
Now today for the show,

562
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,800
I thought I'd spin up a Google Analytics alternative

563
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
called Plausible.

564
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,300
This is a lightweight open source web analytics engine.

565
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,800
Hold on, I've got a Google,

566
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,200
would you call it screen on my desk next to me?

567
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,500
Oh yeah, the assistant.

568
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,800
I think it's grumpy because it's literally just pulled up.

569
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,100
It's time to ditch Google Analytics on the screen.

570
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,000
It's listening.

571
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,100
It knows now, now they've logged that.

572
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,600
Absolutely, yeah, so I'm in trouble with the big G.

573
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,200
But anyway, this Plausible thing

574
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,200
doesn't require any user acceptable cookies.

575
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,600
You know that annoying GDPR pop-up thing?

576
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,900
It's fully compliant with that

577
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,500
as well as several other things.

578
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
It's made and hosted in the EU.

579
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,200
So let me clarify, there is a hosted version.

580
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,400
I'm talking about the self-hosted version,

581
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,700
which is just something you can run in a container.

582
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,600
I chose to put mine up on Linode,

583
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
but you could run it at home, any way you like.

584
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I found the setup process was kind of a pain in the bum.

585
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,140
Oh really?

586
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,900
Took me about two or three hours to get through in the end.

587
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,000
The reason for that is because to spin up this thing,

588
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,500
it's about, I think it's four containers as a database.

589
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,000
There is a, it's like a queuing engine,

590
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,200
like a Redis style thing called ClickHouse.

591
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,200
There's the app itself, and then there's an SMTP relay.

592
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,400
So those four containers come together

593
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,500
to form the app that is plausible.

594
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,700
But of course, their documentation

595
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,000
doesn't quite tell you all the little tricks you need to do

596
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,900
and all the environment variables you need to specify

597
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,200
to get it up and running properly,

598
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,900
which is super annoying.

599
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,700
The Docker compose script

600
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,100
that they have actually linked in their documentation

601
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,100
is about two years old.

602
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,900
And so I was going through following this thing

603
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,500
and looking at the version numbers, and then I thought,

604
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,700
right, I'll just go and check the latest tag in Docker Hub.

605
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,900
Yeah, two years old, completely out of date,

606
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,700
hasn't been touched.

607
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,200
So then I went to the real orange one's GitHub

608
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,040
and looked at what he's doing,

609
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,200
because I know he runs plausible too.

610
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,800
And his GitHub repo combined with their documentation,

611
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
I eventually got it up and running.

612
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,600
And once I did, I was super duper happy with this thing.

613
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,100
You know, I had to embed a little JavaScript header

614
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,100
in each webpage that I wanted to track.

615
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,200
And within a minute or two,

616
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,800
I could see people showing up straight away.

617
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,200
So my MKdocs website at perfectmediaserver.com,

618
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,200
my ghost blog at blog.ktz.me,

619
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,800
I even put selfhosted.show on there as well,

620
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,200
just as a test.

621
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,000
And I gotta say, it was pretty flawless.

622
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,600
Are you getting real time numbers?

623
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,440
Yep.

624
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,000
Ah, I love that.

625
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,200
Okay, so you took a couple hours to get up and running.

626
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,300
And now once it's up,

627
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,800
is it something that you're putting like on the public web?

628
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,640
How is that working?

629
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,500
Is it behind a firewall and can you give access to others?

630
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,900
So there's a few different things you can do.

631
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,900
By default, it's limited to authenticated users,

632
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,600
you know, to the admin user that you create

633
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,800
and any other users that you create in the app itself.

634
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,700
But when you and I were talking before the show,

635
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,900
I thought, oh, it'd be cool if I could just show Chris

636
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,100
what I'm doing here.

637
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,300
And so for the selfhosted.show thing,

638
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,600
I went into the site settings for that specific site.

639
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,200
And there's a whole list of things I can do.

640
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,900
So I can not only make this publicly available,

641
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,200
I've just switched this on.

642
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,400
So I'm actually gonna put this in the chat room

643
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,900
so the live stream can go and have a look

644
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,300
at the analytics that we pulled up today on selfhosted.show.

645
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,300
So that's a public version that we can do,

646
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,800
but I can also give specific users

647
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,500
like an obfuscated link.

648
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,800
So I can say, right, I want to share this specific thing

649
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,600
with this email address

650
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,900
and I'm gonna give them a password

651
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,600
and it expires after a certain length of time.

652
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,100
Can you imagine doing that for like a sponsor or something?

653
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,700
Right, that is a fantastic feature

654
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,200
just from like working with somebody for a short period of time.

655
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,600
The one thing that I found when you gave me the link

656
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,200
and I kind of looked around in there

657
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,600
is it doesn't seem like it goes as deep maybe

658
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,400
as Google Analytics does.

659
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,100
Like Google Analytics, you could just keep drilling down

660
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,400
and down and down and getting more specifics.

661
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,800
This is a little higher level.

662
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,400
Like it tells you everything you need to know.

663
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,800
Your unique visitors, your total page views,

664
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,000
your bounce rate, and the average visit duration.

665
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,800
And of course, your top sources and your top pages

666
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,600
and the locations in which they come from

667
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,100
and the types of devices they use.

668
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,100
So it's all, it's all what you need.

669
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,300
It's not, nothing's really missing

670
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,500
and it'd be fine for what we use,

671
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,400
but it did seem like maybe not quite as detailed

672
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
as the Google stuff might be.

673
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,600
Do you agree with that?

674
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,900
That's the price you pay

675
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,500
for not having surveillance capitalism

676
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,800
be the driver of everything.

677
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,300
Right.

678
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,500
I'm not trying to get political,

679
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,000
but I am gonna have a little bit of a rant

680
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,900
about the death of democracy and social media

681
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,300
and everything in the last six to ten years

682
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,200
and I could go off the rails, but I'm not going to here.

683
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,800
I'm gonna keep it on topic.

684
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,600
And you know, that's one of the things I like

685
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,900
about Plausible actually is that because it's so lightweight

686
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,600
and because it's so privacy friendly and privacy focused,

687
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,500
I turned off privacy badger to make it work

688
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,600
on my web browser, but I didn't, you know,

689
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,300
I had a look at the trackers and it was very minimal

690
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,600
what it was doing compared to what Google Analytics does.

691
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,500
I really liked that.

692
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,100
I mean, for me, that's a feature.

693
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,200
I completely agree.

694
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,700
We stopped using Google Analytics

695
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
just because I'm creeped out by Google, but you know,

696
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,700
I didn't really replace it with anything.

697
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,300
So something that we could run ourselves

698
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,200
on our own infrastructure and you know,

699
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,400
use that data just so we get an idea of maybe

700
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,000
how our website's performing because you know,

701
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,900
one of the things you can figure out is maybe

702
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,300
there's something wrong with the site.

703
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,400
Maybe there's a design issue.

704
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,800
There's insights that you miss and you know,

705
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,900
your web page for online businesses

706
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900
is the front of your store.

707
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,700
So that's pretty great.

708
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,200
And I guess they do have a pay version too as well, right?

709
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,900
So if you wanted to, you could go all in

710
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,100
on their hosted version.

711
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
It doesn't look like it's that expensive

712
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,500
unless you get like millions of views

713
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,900
and it gets up to like 90 bucks a month

714
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,400
if you get 2 million views.

715
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,300
Yeah, I suppose compared to Google's low, low price of free,

716
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,400
but you are the product, it's expensive,

717
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,400
but I'd rather support companies that are willing

718
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,500
to give their software away like this than Google sometimes.

719
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,400
Now Fuzzy, I know that you use a different one.

720
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,300
Was it called Umami or something?

721
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,200
Yeah, I think it's pronounced Umami.

722
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,400
I think the orange one on Discord was talking

723
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,500
about plausible at one point.

724
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,900
So I was like, oh, I kind of want to get away

725
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,100
from Google too, like everybody does who self hosts.

726
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,700
And so I went and tried to try to spin it up

727
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,800
and I ran into the same exact problem you did where I'm,

728
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,500
generally I try and avoid apps

729
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,600
that require more than like two containers.

730
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
I just don't like ones that are that complicated.

731
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,900
I just feel like it's defeats the purpose of Docker.

732
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,900
Like I remember one time I tried to spin up a Unify thing

733
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,500
and it was literally like 10 containers.

734
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,400
I'm like, no, no.

735
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,300
So Umami is only two containers.

736
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,600
There's the database portion of it

737
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,100
that I can run in MariaDB.

738
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,200
And then there's the actual Umami collection thing.

739
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,300
And from looking at what you posted on Discord

740
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,800
and the website, Umami looks pretty much exactly the same.

741
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,600
I don't know in terms of like features

742
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,500
and the dashboard and everything,

743
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
but like I can see the same exact things

744
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,600
where I can see what pages got hit,

745
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,700
where the source was from, the country,

746
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,500
you know, desktop versus laptop versus tablet, all that.

747
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
I can see the same thing.

748
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,600
So if you're looking for something a little bit simpler

749
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,800
to set up, it might be a decent option.

750
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
I'll put a link to Umami in the show notes.

751
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,500
Now, Alex, when you were showing me earlier today,

752
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,700
plausible in your excitedness,

753
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,500
you were describing the different containers

754
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,400
and how at first, maybe once you're getting into it,

755
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,200
it's a little bit more complex to get set up.

756
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,400
But you did say that that was actually

757
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,400
a really nice engineering decision for scalability.

758
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,600
Can you talk on that a little bit?

759
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,300
Yeah, absolutely.

760
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,300
So if you look at the way in which, say,

761
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
GitLab is architected, right?

762
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:51,300
They provide a big bastard container

763
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,200
that is like six gigs of RAM, does eight million processes,

764
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,200
and completely is antithetical to the entire purpose

765
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,000
of containers and microservices, right?

766
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,500
It's one big monolith that they deploy.

767
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,300
And if you want to spin up an extra worker

768
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,100
or anything like that, like, it's just a mess.

769
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,700
And I really hate that way of doing things.

770
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,200
And the Unify controller and Plex is kind of the same, right?

771
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,400
It has a database built into it.

772
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,900
And actually, if you're thinking about it,

773
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,600
it would be nice if Plex had a separate database container

774
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,100
that lives somewhere else that I could back up

775
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,300
and version independently of Plex itself.

776
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,000
And that's one of the things I liked about Plausible

777
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,100
is that because it has so many containers,

778
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,000
you've got that queuing engine,

779
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,200
the click house thing I talked about

780
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,400
that operates in a similar kind of space to Redis

781
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,800
that basically takes all the requests in in real time.

782
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,400
Its only job is to listen and receive stuff.

783
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,600
And then Plausible has workers that goes

784
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,900
and processes those requests in real time.

785
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,100
Now, a poorly architected application

786
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,200
would only have one container doing that.

787
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,400
And it would ingest all of that stuff

788
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,500
into the primary container.

789
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
And then when that queue or that buffer

790
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
or whatever it is gets full,

791
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,200
the container would start to slow down,

792
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,400
it might have a memory leak, it might crash,

793
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,500
all that kind of stuff.

794
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,400
But by having the queue somewhere else,

795
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,700
you leave Plausible itself as this controlled environment

796
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,800
and it's able to not fall into that same trap

797
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
as a lot of other applications do.

798
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,900
Also, the data store being an external Postgres database,

799
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,100
I have no problem with that.

800
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,100
Yeah, no, I don't have an issue

801
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,000
with databases being separate, I just, I don't know.

802
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,800
When I start seeing that many containers,

803
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,300
it just becomes frustrating for me to have to manage and...

804
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,600
No, I get it, it puts you off, doesn't it?

805
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,100
You sort of look at this thing and you go,

806
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,200
I can grok and understand this in three seconds

807
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,400
if it's one or two containers,

808
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,600
but if it starts to get to three or four or five or more,

809
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,600
you're like, eh, I'll do it next time.

810
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,500
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

811
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,900
That's sort of my line too.

812
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,500
My last question on it, Alex, really is,

813
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,900
did you notice much in terms of load time difference

814
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,600
on the sites after you put it on there?

815
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,000
Because you toss a little bit of JavaScript

816
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,100
in the header, essentially,

817
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,900
and then you're off to the races.

818
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,400
Did you try benchmarking or at least refresh

819
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,500
and see if it seemed any slower?

820
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Because I've also experienced that.

821
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,700
I used to use a locally hosted analytics software

822
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,100
that actually slowed the website down,

823
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,300
so we had to bail on it.

824
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,700
I personally didn't notice any difference

825
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,100
and that's totally anecdotal,

826
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,300
but I run Privacy Badger anyway,

827
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,400
so I don't have a lot of Google Analytics

828
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,700
and a lot of JavaScript running anyway.

829
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,000
What I will say is on the plausible website,

830
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,200
take this with a grain of salt,

831
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,700
they say that their script is 45 times smaller

832
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,700
than Google Analytics.

833
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,000
So... Smaller tends to be faster.

834
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Yeah, and they reckon that because it's so much smaller,

835
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,000
a site with 10,000 monthly visitors

836
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,400
will save four and a half kilos of CO2 emissions per year

837
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,900
simply by switching to plausible.

838
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,300
So, do your bit for the planet, people.

839
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,500
Right. Drop Google to save the planet.

840
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,900
Tailscale.com slash self-hosted.

841
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,400
Go there to get a free personal account

842
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,200
for up to 20 devices and you support the show.

843
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,700
Tailscale is a zero-config VPN.

844
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,800
It installs on any device, manages your firewall rules,

845
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,500
gets you going in just seconds from anywhere.

846
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,000
Devices connect directly to each other

847
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,300
using WireGuard's noise protocol.

848
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,400
So you build a mesh network

849
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,800
using the best VPN security in the business.

850
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,900
It really changes the game.

851
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,400
I have to say, too, I was really excited this morning

852
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,500
to see that they just raised $100 million

853
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,100
in Series B funding.

854
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,000
And here's what they said about it.

855
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,800
Why'd they do this?

856
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Because they're paranoid, they say.

857
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,900
This isn't their first rodeo

858
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,400
and we don't know where the economy or the market might go.

859
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
And we don't want to be pressured

860
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,800
into juicing our growth numbers beyond where they belong.

861
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,100
We don't want to put revenue ahead of quality.

862
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,600
Man, it really shows in their product, too.

863
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,100
You know, you have a flat network

864
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,400
where you get a static IP address

865
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,800
for every device you care about.

866
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,100
You can assign them a DNS name.

867
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,200
It's always connected. They're always encrypted.

868
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,800
It even works with double carrier NAT.

869
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,000
It is fantastic.

870
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,500
And I opened a support ticket with them recently.

871
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,800
I exceeded my number of subnet routers that I'm allowed.

872
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,200
They have a soft limit of one per free account.

873
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,800
I had three, so you know,

874
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,700
three times what the soft limit is.

875
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,800
And it says, you are encouraged to upgrade your account

876
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,500
if you exceed for, you know, a length of time.

877
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,000
These are only soft limits, don't worry.

878
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,100
We won't enforce them, but you're encouraged to upgrade.

879
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,800
So I sent in a support ticket saying,

880
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,200
hey, which tier should I be on?

881
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,400
You know, I kind of want to give you some money

882
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,200
because I think you're awesome.

883
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,800
And they wrote back and said, no, it's okay.

884
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,600
Just tell people about us. It's cool.

885
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,900
They've also written a blog post

886
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,700
about how they've built a sustainable infrastructure.

887
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,600
So listeners of our show might be really interested in that.

888
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,900
And it goes into their whole philosophy

889
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,100
about making this thing work for the long haul.

890
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,700
And I am so grateful because it's changed the way I work

891
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,300
and it changes the way I do tech support with my family.

892
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,100
It makes it when I'm remote.

893
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,300
It makes it so seamless now.

894
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,600
Go check it out and support the show

895
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,400
and get it for free for up to 20 devices.

896
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,700
It's tailscale.com slash self-hosted.

897
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,200
Alex, we've been having a few adventures.

898
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,000
Why don't you tell us a story?

899
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,600
Well, I took Brent down to my basement the other day.

900
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,300
He still has all those limbs. It's okay.

901
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,200
I think they're all still intact anyway,

902
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,100
because one of my hard drives

903
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,500
has been dropping off the SATA bus this week.

904
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,300
I didn't know why.

905
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,000
And so we went down and took a look at this thing.

906
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,700
And I think I did this maybe two or three months ago.

907
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,600
I took the cable out and then put the cable back in

908
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,500
and it worked perfectly for another two to three months.

909
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,300
Oh yeah, that's what I've been doing with my machine here.

910
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,600
You guys are awful.

911
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Right.

912
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,100
Well, hey, look, sometimes it ain't stupid if it works, Brent.

913
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,200
Yeah, but it is almost guaranteed

914
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,800
to only work for a short period of time.

915
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
No, not at all. Not with cables.

916
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,600
In my experience, cables can be finicky little buggers.

917
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,700
You need better ones.

918
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,200
Maybe there's a little vibration, something got loose.

919
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,100
Exactly.

920
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,900
I learned long ago to put SATA cables with a little clips on

921
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,900
because the ones without clips do vibrate out.

922
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,100
I think my issue is likely

923
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,800
I'm not running out of hard drives.

924
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,100
Yeah, yeah.

925
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,300
I think there's about 10 spinning drives in this server.

926
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,100
You know, it's quite a few. So there's a lot of vibration.

927
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,300
So realistically, it could be a cable.

928
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,800
It could be some crosstalk issue

929
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,000
with all those SATA cables running together.

930
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,700
They're plugged into an HBA card, which is a SAS cable.

931
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,900
So it's four SATA cables going into one SAS plug on an HBA card.

932
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,800
So I was thinking maybe it's a bad cable.

933
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,200
So I ordered a new cable off Amazon, put it in, and then...

934
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,300
You ordered the short one.

935
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,200
...realized it was too short and thought,

936
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,700
I'll just go and grab a SATA cable just to tie us over.

937
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,000
And then found in the drawer

938
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
that I actually already had the correct cable.

939
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,400
Oh, I've done that. Yep.

940
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,100
I've done that for sure.

941
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,200
So anyway, I connected up the drive

942
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,800
and it wouldn't mount.

943
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,900
Proxmox was going crazy with, you know, XFS errors.

944
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,800
And I was like, uh-oh, here we go.

945
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,600
Smart wasn't showing me anything, but I've seen this before.

946
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,200
It usually means the end of the drive in my experience.

947
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,800
So brought the drive upstairs, took it out of the server,

948
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,300
brought it upstairs, connected it to my little diagnostic station

949
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,200
I've got behind me over here, and ran...

950
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,100
Was it XFS repair?

951
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,100
Yes, it was. I think.

952
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,800
And that rebuilt the log or the...

953
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,200
I don't know, something like that.

954
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:24,900
The journal?

955
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,800
Yeah, that's it.

956
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,000
It took a good five, 10 minutes to do that,

957
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,200
which was a bit squeaky bum time.

958
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,100
And then it just mounted perfectly.

959
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,000
And, you know, I was listening to the drive the whole time

960
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,300
it was on the table next to me for any audible noises.

961
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,800
You know, I've heard a drive clicking before and it seemed fine.

962
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,600
It was running cool to the touch.

963
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,200
It was behaving properly with the testing that I was doing.

964
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,500
So I thought, okay, let's put it back in the basement server.

965
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,700
And so far, so good.

966
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,500
Oh, I thought this was going somewhere completely different.

967
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,300
I mean, it could.

968
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,000
That'll be the next episode.

969
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,200
RAID is not a backup, people.

970
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,500
This is true.

971
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,200
Alex, I'm curious what you think the issue was

972
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
and what you think the issue might be considering

973
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,900
it still seems a little kind of like it may happen again.

974
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,900
Seems fine now.

975
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,600
I actually ran a bajillion SnapRaid checks and fixes

976
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,900
and syncs and rebuilds and everything I could throw at this drive

977
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,000
to stress it without actually wiping it and doing like a bad blocks run

978
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
or something just to try and poke the bee's nest a little bit.

979
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And for me, I think it's going to be fine.

980
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,400
But originally I suspect there was either an issue with the power supply cable

981
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,700
and maybe it sort of the voltage dipped slightly and it dropped off the bus

982
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,400
a little bit in the middle of a write transaction or something

983
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,400
and that corrupted the log or the data cable was bad, which I have replaced now.

984
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,200
So, you know, in terms of variables and stuff like that,

985
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,500
if something goes wrong with it again, I will know it's not the cable.

986
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,000
I will know it's the drive.

987
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,500
Now, this is a shucked drive originally and it's still within warranty.

988
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,800
So actually part of me is kind of curious just to send it into Western Digital

989
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,500
and see what they say.

990
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,900
Did you keep the shucked bits?

991
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,100
No, there is some like forget the name of it.

992
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:12,400
It's like Magnuson Moss Act or something that you can you can quote to them

993
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,700
and they have to fix it either way.

994
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,000
Yeah, because they can't prove that my shucking broke the, you know,

995
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,200
the whatever it is inside the drive.

996
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,000
That is shockingly pro-consumer.

997
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,600
I know, right?

998
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,200
It's almost like we're in Europe.

999
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,500
Chris has a drive that he shucked,

1000
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,300
but he definitely modified the drive by breaking the pin off,

1001
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,500
which was quite clever.

1002
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,200
Well, now that is physical damage.

1003
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,900
I don't do that.

1004
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,600
I do the captain tape or I just snip the three-volt rail on the power supply cable.

1005
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,900
I wanted it fixed forever and let's be honest, I'm never sending it in.

1006
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,200
I'm never going to do that.

1007
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,600
We also didn't have any tape.

1008
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,800
Yeah, we did look for the tape and I'm like screw this break.

1009
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,000
Alex, I'm curious.

1010
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,800
What did you end up doing with the cable?

1011
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,500
Which one the faulty cable?

1012
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,300
Yes, the faulty one.

1013
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,600
Did you just put it back in your drawer with the others?

1014
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,700
I think I might have done.

1015
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,300
Alex.

1016
00:41:59,300 --> 00:41:59,900
Who knows?

1017
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,200
It's a mystery box of fun.

1018
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,800
Next time there's a drive problem.

1019
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,100
Yeah, right.

1020
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,600
So here's my solution to the 3.3.

1021
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,300
I'm showing the live stream on camera.

1022
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,800
I just cut the three-volt cable in my SATA.

1023
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:20,000
Like I have these like you plug one SATA cable in here, power cable in and then you get four like power plugs here.

1024
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And if you just cut the three-volt wire here, this one, then you don't have to worry about captain tape or you know,

1025
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,500
physically damaging your drives.

1026
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,900
You just run them all off these.

1027
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,300
There must be some voltage going through those.

1028
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,700
Could they like arc or something?

1029
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,700
Do you do anything to?

1030
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,500
There's some electrical tape on it, but I mean, it's three volts.

1031
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,300
Yeah, it's three volts.

1032
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1033
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,200
So it's at most it's going to be like a little tingle.

1034
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:41,800
I don't mean for you.

1035
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,100
I just wondered, you know, maybe I should try licking it next time.

1036
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,100
See what happened the old the old D cell test.

1037
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,500
Yeah.

1038
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,600
No, I think it's more fun.

1039
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,100
Just leave it uncapped and that way you next time you're rooting around in the case.

1040
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,300
Just a little a little, you know, like operation.

1041
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,000
I've got a question for you guys with wedding rings and stuff.

1042
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:09,500
Like when I run digging around in a PC that's on I will take my wedding ring off because there was one time at the Apple store where I didn't and I actually shorted out a customer's motherboard.

1043
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,200
It hurt quite a bit too.

1044
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,000
I have never taken my wedding ring off to do any hardware work the watch.

1045
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:23,500
Sometimes the watch sometimes I will if I'm like, you know rooting around deep inside the case and physically can't reach wherever I am, but I've never had to take that.

1046
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,400
I've never had an arcing from my ring.

1047
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,800
I have to take off the watch.

1048
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:38,600
I don't like the watch on the wrist when like, you know the edge of the case and I'm rooting around in there and I'm smacking the watch up against those sharp edges scratches it all up same when I'm like working on like a project in the RV.

1049
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,100
I have to take the watch off.

1050
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,800
I actually don't wear the ring though anymore.

1051
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,000
I just sort of gave up on that.

1052
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,200
My whole body size changes all the time.

1053
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,600
And so I'd go from like a ring that was too tight to a ring that was too loose.

1054
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,000
This is also why I became a suspenders guy.

1055
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,900
See, I learned my lesson.

1056
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:05,600
My parents used to have those old school Christmas lights and I was always one of putting up the Christmas lights and there were enough times I broke the bulb and was trying to get it out and I stupidly did not unplug the strand.

1057
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,500
And I shocked myself more times than I care to admit.

1058
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,700
Well, it's one of those things that once it happens you watch out for for the rest of your life.

1059
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,100
I imagine right?

1060
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,500
Yeah, it definitely is.

1061
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:26,100
I think the thing that zapped me was one of the MagSafe 19 volt things like a laptop and yeah, it's done quite a bit and actually there was a it took a little bit out of my wedding ring.

1062
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,600
Like it was there's a little notch in it.

1063
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,500
You can just see oh man.

1064
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah, that's here near miss.

1065
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,800
I had to fill out accident report forms and all they sent me home.

1066
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,400
And that's just like an awkward conversation when you come home to it's like a well kind of damaged my wedding ring, honey.

1067
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,000
Yeah.

1068
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,100
Oh, well, we got some boost into the show last week.

1069
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,900
We got some people boosting both good and bad things into the show.

1070
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,000
Rubik come in Ruby Ruby Kinman Ruby man, Rubik.

1071
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,100
All right, Rubik man.

1072
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,400
I think my wife and I are moving to a new apartment soon.

1073
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,300
We have permission from the landlord to install a camera pointed at the parking lot.

1074
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,200
Can you recommend one that works with home assistant for a decent price now?

1075
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,300
He doesn't tell us what his connectivity situation is.

1076
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,900
So what are your thoughts Alex?

1077
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,900
You could just get a dog and point that at the car park, you know, that would bark quite a bit.

1078
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:18,600
I mean the obvious choice despite all their flaws really the wisecams.

1079
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,400
Yeah, that's what I was probably going to say too.

1080
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:28,400
We're actually going to have our next boost here that kind of makes it that makes them even more appealing sexy pants boosted in for 210 sats.

1081
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,600
So this dropped on reddit yesterday.

1082
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,400
It supports USB Ethernet adapters tail scale and it runs an RTMP server.

1083
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,700
It'll even make you tacos.

1084
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:42,700
Well, maybe not that but it's essentially a series of wise hacks.

1085
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:47,700
That I think make these cameras even more compelling especially when you can when you combine it with something like wise bridge.

1086
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:54,000
So I have a link in the show notes to a github repo that lets you essentially root the devices and get more out of them.

1087
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,200
Can you imagine the possibilities of running tail scale on the camera itself?

1088
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,400
That's cool.

1089
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,400
That opens up a whole new kind of like, well, it's a whole new world as they say.

1090
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:14,400
The other cameras as far as like just connect them to Wi-Fi and they have decent apps that also work with home assistant is the logi circle.

1091
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,300
However, I've had mixed results with that, but that's also another option.

1092
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:25,500
If you have a recommendation for a cheap portable camera that's easy to power and easy to get connected, send us a boost and let us know.

1093
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,200
I actually have a good one.

1094
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,600
The eufy cams, I've actually been a huge fan of.

1095
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,700
They are basically the same price as the wise ones.

1096
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,100
They come built in with RTSP.

1097
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,300
They're running throughout my house.

1098
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,600
I have about six of them.

1099
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,300
I have the doorbell and they work just fine.

1100
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:45,500
And I also hear in the home kit community that they work really well with home kit setup as well.

1101
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,400
Haven't tried it, but that does sound good.

1102
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,500
Sir Lurks-a-Lot wrote in with two boosts.

1103
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,600
The first one reads, autonomous spinning blades?

1104
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,300
Oh, homeowner's liability insurance coverage or not.

1105
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:02,400
I would be uneasy about this Robomower running unsupervised, which is all too likely, I fear.

1106
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,700
PSA, lawnmowers are not toys and can cause serious harm to both critters and children.

1107
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,400
Nevermind stupid adults.

1108
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,000
This ain't a silly vacuum.

1109
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,500
Just think bloody toes and see how that sits before deploying.

1110
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:22,200
Situations vary, of course, just remain aware that unplanned lawn intrusions and obstacles do happen.

1111
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,400
I mean, it's actually a fair point.

1112
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,800
So last week we talked about a robot lawnmower and none of us actually mentioned the safety angle of it.

1113
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,000
However, I think it's just kind of an assumed that people would be careful with this kind of thing.

1114
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,400
But then Lurks-a-Lot had another boost for us too.

1115
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,500
They continue.

1116
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Oh, so I finally saw the video of this OpenMore project.

1117
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,200
I imagine something much larger and dangerous from a DIY project.

1118
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,900
Well, I still believe in safety first.

1119
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:51,000
This does not conjure quite the nightmare scenarios I imagined when I hadn't seen the thing yet.

1120
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,300
Yeah, it's more like the size of a vacuum.

1121
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:59,200
There was a, speaking of the little robot vacuums, a local town here in Washington, Bellevue.

1122
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,500
A homeowner called the cops because they thought somebody had broken into their house.

1123
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,900
A burglar was in the house with them and they were panicked.

1124
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,300
Turned out robot vacuum wasn't actually a burglar.

1125
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,400
Oh, gosh.

1126
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:14,400
I'm actually thinking, as I said, getting a new house and it's going to have almost an acre of land.

1127
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,600
I'm actually looking at some of these robo-mowers just because I don't want to have to mow that much land.

1128
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,300
Seriously.

1129
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,700
You're just going to have to get a lawn tractor, dude, and just be done with it.

1130
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,800
Just admit it.

1131
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,700
I don't want one because they basically cost the same.

1132
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:33,700
Like, they're like $2,500 and the robo-mowers are like $2,500 and they'll install it for me for free.

1133
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,400
Has anyone told you that you get to sit on top of a giant engine and go,

1134
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,900
vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, as you go along?

1135
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,600
They're so much fun.

1136
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,700
Says the guy who has an EV.

1137
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,700
Yeah, no.

1138
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,500
Oh, okay.

1139
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:45,900
All right.

1140
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,800
Well, you can get electric ones too.

1141
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,200
Yeah, those are even more expensive.

1142
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:56,300
But yeah, no, I actually have been looking at these robo-mowers and I actually want one because they actually do have a safety thing where if you pick them up, they actually shuts off.

1143
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,300
Oh, sure.

1144
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,100
Okay.

1145
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,400
That's good to know too.

1146
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,800
Yeah, I'd be looking at one too.

1147
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,000
Crashmaster18 wrote in, said he really liked the live format we did last week.

1148
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,600
Having multiple people on too, hopes it sticks.

1149
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,400
And he also likes the idea of the open mower.

1150
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,000
He hopes that we'll give him an update if one of us picks one up.

1151
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,800
It'll turn off if you do that.

1152
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,600
Right.

1153
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,100
Don't pick one up.

1154
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:25,300
And the final bit of feedback for this week, Kars Pieland writes in with 3,690 SATs.

1155
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,200
Thanks for the show.

1156
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,100
Nice and simple.

1157
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,200
Well, thank you, Kars.

1158
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,300
Thank you very much.

1159
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,800
You think 3,690 SATs mean something?

1160
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,400
Because sometimes they mean something.

1161
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,100
There's a 69 in there.

1162
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,700
I think it's like 3 plus 3, 6 plus 3, 9.

1163
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,900
Oh, could be a math thing.

1164
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,400
To me, I was thinking like the GTX graphics, like a video card kind of thing.

1165
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,600
But, oh, could be.

1166
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,600
I don't know.

1167
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,300
Alright, we did get an email in JVP.

1168
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,800
Just wanted to give us a review on his end of Frigate, the NVR created by Bearded Tech in our community.

1169
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
And he said, I did hear about it here on the show.

1170
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,800
I have to say the Docker Compose setup was super easy.

1171
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:04,000
I have five PoE 4K cameras that come with an advertised on-camera person detection.

1172
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm using this on an older laptop with a Core i7 and it actually runs quite well.

1173
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,200
Frigate not only outperforms the stupid phone home app that these cameras came with,

1174
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,700
but with the Home Assistant integration, it's really cool.

1175
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,200
And I'm looking forward to making some integrations with lights soon.

1176
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,600
Plus I can view my cameras through the HA app, Home Assistant app, outside my house

1177
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,100
without sharing another service or having to open another port.

1178
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,700
So there you go.

1179
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,500
He says I'm about to block these cameras from the internet.

1180
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,900
I'll just use it all with Frigate Plus.

1181
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:37,200
So Frigate NVR is a project our community member Bearded Tech is working on.

1182
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,200
And these cameras, well, JVP didn't give us the model.

1183
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,700
So JVP, you'll have to write back and tell us what the model is

1184
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,100
because maybe those are the ones Fuzzy is looking for.

1185
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:49,700
Now, as always, I want to give a big thanks to our site reliability engineers, our subscribers.

1186
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:54,000
You do make this show possible over at self-hosted.show slash SRE.

1187
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,400
We've also got a network-wide membership at Jupiter.party as well to support not only this show,

1188
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:04,500
but all the other JB fine shows like Linux Unplugged, Linux Action News, and Coder Radio.

1189
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,500
Absolutely.

1190
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,500
And of course, you can always send us a boost with a podcasting 2.0 app.

1191
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,400
Go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

1192
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:19,500
Go get more Brentley at linuxunplugged.com and catch Fuzzy on our Discord at self-hosted.show slash Discord.

1193
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,900
And I'm at chrislas on the Twitter.

1194
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,400
I'm over there at ironicbadger for the time being,

1195
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,200
but who knows what that crazy spaceman is going to do with it.

1196
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,400
We'll have to see on that one.

1197
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,900
Maybe we'll finally get a Mastodon user out of you yet.

1198
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,400
Maybe?

1199
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,000
No, maybe, maybe.

1200
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,800
Probably not.

1201
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,500
Maybe, baby.

1202
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,300
One other plug that I meant to do, I almost forgot,

1203
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,700
is we're actually going to be starting a new initiative on the off-weeks of Self-Hosted.

1204
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:48,900
So this show is coming out on the 6th of May, so it will be the, what, the...

1205
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,400
6th plus 7th.

1206
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,800
What's 6 plus 7?

1207
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,500
13.

1208
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,900
That's my birthday.

1209
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,600
I'm not doing it on my birthday.

1210
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Oh, damn it.

1211
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,400
Do it on the day before.

1212
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,300
Oh, well.

1213
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,300
Do it on the day we do it live.

1214
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,700
We do the show live on Wednesdays now every other week.

1215
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,200
Now, I wanted to talk about a new initiative that we're going to be doing

1216
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,600
in between the live shows that we've started doing now.

1217
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,900
So that is, we're going to take a look at the awesome Self-Hosted list as a community.

1218
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,800
I think we can help improve this thing, right?

1219
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
And we'll take a look at a specific category.

1220
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,100
We'll hang out on the live stream for an hour or two

1221
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,300
and just try out some of these apps as a group

1222
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,100
and figure out which ones work, which ones don't work,

1223
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,700
which links are dead, which applications aren't on that list that should be,

1224
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,700
that kind of stuff.

1225
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,900
And eventually try and make the awesome Self-Hosted list awesome again,

1226
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:37,400
you know?

1227
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,000
Awesome-er.

1228
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,400
Yeah, maybe we should get little hats with that on, little red hats with

1229
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,200
make Self-Hosted awesome list great again or something.

1230
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't know.

1231
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,800
I don't know. I have some notes on that idea.

1232
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,200
Maybe we'll refine that.

1233
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,300
There's probably some merchandise in that somewhere, but we'll see.

1234
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,900
I think that'll probably do us for the show today.

1235
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,300
So thanks for listening everybody.

1236
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,900
That was selfhosted.show slash 70.
