1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
We teased last week, Chris, that you've been doing some camera stuff, right?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,480
And I think I certainly because I'm just about to buy a house.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,240
I certainly want to know more about your cameras, the good and the bad.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,920
But let's just address the elephant in the room.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,480
You were pretty hard on Shinobi last week.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,680
First of all, congratulations on the news on the new house.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,920
That's going to be epic project material for the show.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,040
That's amazing.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,960
Yeah, so last week we talked a little bit about Shinobi.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,720
I'm a Raspberry Pi four.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,160
It was going bad.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,760
I don't know if you remember, but I was like pegging out the CPUs

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,960
and I hadn't even added all the cameras yet.

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,520
Three cameras is what you said.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,680
Yeah, well, I'm happy to say I've got five cameras now

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,920
and the CPU usage is high, but that's because I've also turned on motion

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,320
detection and recording, which saves some storage space.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,760
So you're able to get five cameras with all of those kind of

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,960
advanced features working through a Pi four.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,520
Yeah, I suppose for full disclosure, the fifth camera is more of an on or off.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,680
I actually set up my dash cam as a camera feed that feeds into the Shinobi DVR system.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,600
Of course you did.

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,640
So I just turned that one on or off.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,680
So that's not motion detection based because that's that's really where

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,800
a lot of the process here goes.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,400
Alex is the motion detection.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,840
Turns out last week I was trying this out on Ubuntu LTS and fine

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,440
distro Alex, but not quite there for the Raspberry Pi four yet.

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,000
And when I switched over to Raspbian, when I just nuked and paved

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,080
and rebuilt it on Raspbian, when I when I selected the hardware

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,960
acceleration options and I could just choose auto, but when I just

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,160
turned them on in Shinobi works with Raspbian and my CPU used

33
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
to just completely drop to the floor.

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,680
It was just it was gone.

35
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,680
So what is that then?

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,960
It must be some hardware acceleration at play here.

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,160
Yeah, I think so, because like every now and then the camera feeds

38
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,200
just kind of stop recording.

39
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,400
And I think it's like a GPU acceleration failure.

40
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,920
So about every couple of days I've rebooted the box.

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,960
Now that I've switched over to motion capture, that hasn't been an issue yet.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,320
But so maybe I should recap a little bit.

43
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,000
Just to remind you, I have those wise cameras, those little $25 wise cameras.

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,720
I've mounted them all around the inside of my RV.

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,640
Had to run like the USB cords and stuff, which is what it is.

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,200
But I popped on a new firmware onto those wise camps.

47
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,960
It's pretty simple.

48
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,560
You just download their official RTSP firmware file.

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,440
The downside is, is I don't think it's really quite feature complete compared

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,160
to the official official firmware.

51
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,760
What do you think?

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,680
As I understood it, it's like a fork in time.

53
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,920
So they, it's not a build that they keep up to date with the modern features.

54
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,360
I believe they fork every couple of months, although there's no

55
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,000
commitment to doing so that is so here's a snapshot in time with RTMP turned on.

56
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
We'll release another one when we feel like it.

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,000
It seems to be like a very highly demanded feature though.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,080
So it's unlikely they're going to abandon it, but quite frankly, my goal

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,160
here is to cut these things off from the internet anyways.

60
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,760
So I, I care less.

61
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,040
Why do you need a dash cam into Shinobi?

62
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,480
Like are you using one of those wise cams as a dash cam?

63
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,200
Yeah.

64
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,440
Yeah.

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,360
I haven't actually gone down the road yet, but I have one set up looking

66
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,080
out the windshield in your car.

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,080
Oh, on the RV.

68
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,880
Oh, okay.

69
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,480
Wow.

70
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,400
I mean, if you're driving a flipping bus down the road, I can see, I can see

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,440
that little camera not being a thing.

72
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,960
I was thinking in your golf, man, I was trying to figure where that

73
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,320
little thing fitted in your golf.

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,520
No, I put it up front there and, uh, we'll see.

75
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,800
I haven't actually been on a road trip with it yet to test it, but anyways,

76
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,120
I got this RTSP firmware, popped it on the file.

77
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,760
You just rename it to like demo dot bin, I think reboot the cameras

78
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,080
holding down the setup button.

79
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,040
They'll detect the file and just reflash themselves.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,120
And your real only immediate tell, unless you memorize the version numbers

81
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,800
is when you relaunch the wise app, they'll now be an advanced RTSP section.

82
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,000
You can turn that on.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,960
It'll give you the URL and you can plug that in anything.

84
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,960
Uh, VLC, Shinobi, there are a few things though to make it work, right?

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,280
So if you want to try this Alex, I put a link in the show notes, um, on an

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,520
article that tells you how to optimize Shinobi for RTSP capture, because there

87
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,800
are a couple of things that aren't necessarily obvious, especially if you

88
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,760
want to grab the audio and maybe the other disclaimer of using these wise

89
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,560
cams like this is they don't support that device standard that so many

90
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,880
security cameras support.

91
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,160
I think it's what, Oh, Oh, N VIF or whatever.

92
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,080
What's that for?

93
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,680
It's like a standard control and features baseline that all cameras, if

94
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,520
they're certified to support this, then, you know, you can plug them into

95
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,680
whatever security software and control it remotely, make it pan or tilt or

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,880
get certain time information off of it.

97
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
So what is it like?

98
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,320
Um, not E P N P what's the other one?

99
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,480
D D N L a or something.

100
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,400
Is it a similar kind of universal protocol like that?

101
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,160
Yeah, you could think of it, but in terms of like, this is how I control

102
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,280
certain aspects of the camera, um, so then vendors of software can just make

103
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,960
a general interface that works with any camera that meets the standard.

104
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,600
The wise don't have that, but they're $25.

105
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,280
So you can forgive a lot for that price.

106
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,680
Can't you, the $25 and the other thing that surprised me, and I haven't pushed

107
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,800
it beyond two, but I have a feed that's going into Shinobi on that Raspberry

108
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,760
PI 24 seven, but I also can pull them up in home assistant and I can pull them

109
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,440
up an MPV.

110
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,480
So I now have a tab and home assistant that's called my security tab.

111
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,360
And in there, I have a, a tile for each camera and a tile for each motion sensor.

112
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,520
And I've also integrated our ring camera.

113
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:42,720
Yes.

114
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,200
I got one of those a long time ago.

115
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,440
I no longer have an active subscription, but I do have an account still and I have

116
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,400
an API key so I can actually pull the ring feed into home assistant.

117
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,440
So that's kind of a neat real time snapshot.

118
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,600
That's really neat.

119
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:55,960
Yeah.

120
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,400
I wanted to ask you actually, so remember when you were doing the

121
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,440
security, so remote access for Shinobi and I guess home assistant as well.

122
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm going to add to my question trying to use the wise app is a bit rough remotely.

123
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,760
I found, um, I don't know if that's just the URLs I'm using or whatever, but I

124
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,840
haven't had great success.

125
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,880
Like my nest cam, which again, I bought a long time ago.

126
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,200
I can just pull that up wherever I am in the world and it just, just works.

127
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,480
And the wise cam doesn't do that for you.

128
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,320
The wise app for some reason, no reliably, I can't seem to use the

129
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,480
home I set in of that, I have not solved remote access yet.

130
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,360
Theoretically I would solve it with a wire guard VPN.

131
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,480
However, I am behind some enterprise grade double net systems here,

132
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,280
carrier grade as they like to call it.

133
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,600
So I have this super convoluted system that I'm working on where I wire

134
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,160
guide out to a remote system that establishes a two way tunnel.

135
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,120
And then I remote from my other systems into that.

136
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,520
I have IP table set up and some DNS and all of that.

137
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,080
And it routes everything for me, but I haven't gone that far yet.

138
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,320
So right now I use the wise app for remote access when I, when I need it,

139
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,800
but I don't generally.

140
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,000
So I'm really kind of using this to go back in time.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,560
If something were to happen, you know, maybe there was a mini fire or an

142
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,440
accident with the kids or a mini fire.

143
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
I still sound scary.

144
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,720
Like a fridge fire, no big deal.

145
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Just burn up the whole side of the rig or something, you know, maybe for

146
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,680
insurance purposes, I want that or burglars comes in or some crazy listener.

147
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,240
I don't know.

148
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
It's all on camera, crazy listeners.

149
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,480
I have had them show up at campgrounds.

150
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,400
I have had them knock on my door at rest stops.

151
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,920
I love it.

152
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,600
Actually, most of the time when we're on the road, I love it.

153
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,600
Um, one time and I bet he's listening, somebody showed up.

154
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,760
We were in Montana and we were in a gravel lot and somebody

155
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,480
came, pound, pound, pound, police, open up on my door.

156
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,880
My heart just dropped.

157
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,400
Like I just stopped breathing for a second.

158
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,600
I opened up the door and it was a listener is just screwing with me.

159
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,040
Good job.

160
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,760
You know, I felt if I ever get the chance to troll you like that,

161
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,080
I would definitely do that.

162
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,840
It's all right.

163
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,240
It's okay.

164
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,600
I'm good.

165
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,040
I'm good.

166
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,440
Just makes me jumpy.

167
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Luckily I live far enough away that it's unlikely.

168
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,720
I'm just going to turn up at a random parking lot with dupes.

169
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,360
Unless they come to you.

170
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,360
And we should clarify, by the way, we had a few people that didn't actually

171
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,240
know that Chris lives full-time in an RV.

172
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,680
Yeah.

173
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,040
Since, uh, what?

174
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,680
I mean, it's been about five years now I've upgraded once in there.

175
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,360
So I've been in this one for about four years.

176
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,720
Full-time yeah.

177
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,160
With the wife and the kids and a dog, we affectionately call it

178
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,520
lady dupes on the network.

179
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,880
So we have JB one, which is the studio that we record most of the podcasts

180
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,560
from in Seattle anyway, Chris and Wes.

181
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,320
And then, um, lady dupes is Chris's home on wheels, I guess.

182
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,160
Yeah, the remote studio set up with, uh, multiple cellular networks

183
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,920
and, um, a little recording spot.

184
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,160
So I can do shows from the road.

185
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,080
I can work from the road, but we also have offline media part of my, well,

186
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,520
this is all part of my project off-grid is to really, really make that thing

187
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,640
a fully workable machine, even without internet connection.

188
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,480
And that's why I wanted to get these cameras into Shinobi is I was slipping

189
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,480
into, uh, the Logitech circle cameras.

190
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,360
They're not great, but they're kind of the best cloud connected

191
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
priced camera in my opinion.

192
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,520
And then you have things coming along like the blink cameras that are really

193
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,080
cheap and then the wise cameras came out at $25.

194
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,200
Yeah, they cleaned up.

195
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,720
So the fact that I could get something at that cloud connected or cloud

196
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,080
subsidized price, but then I can use it for my, my own offline system.

197
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
It makes me comfortable putting these throughout my house.

198
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,480
Cause before that, if you wanted to have a camera that was cheap, you pretty

199
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,680
much, you know, at that $25 price point, it was, in fact, it was pretty impossible

200
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,400
to beat that price, to be honest.

201
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,200
Um, but you could put a, you know, a raspberry pie with a raspberry pie cam

202
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,200
somewhere and that would get you in the sort of $40, $50 price point.

203
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,640
But even so at that point, like the, the other ones you mentioned, like the

204
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,680
logi stuff, the blink, et cetera, like the nest stuff, I mean, the nest is

205
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,880
expensive, but it's a, it's nice physical hardware, like it's machined to

206
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,440
aluminium and all that kind of stuff.

207
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,240
It looks nice.

208
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,040
Um, so the cameras that I've been looking at for my new house, um, which hopefully

209
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,480
I'll move into in about six to eight weeks, um, I don't want wifi cameras.

210
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,600
So this is for me, the biggest downfall of the wise cameras.

211
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,360
I've got two or three here and they're perfectly fine, but frames drop on

212
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,640
occasion and some, you know, it's chewing up wifi bandwidth where if I'm buying a

213
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,440
house, I'm going to live there for the next 10, whatever years you're going to

214
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,200
wire them, I'm going to run a cable, you know, I'm not driving down the road like

215
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,920
you, I'm going to run a cable and kind of run POE.

216
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,240
It's going to be a POE camera.

217
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,280
Good for you.

218
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,160
So I'm looking heavily at the unified gear right now, but damn, it's expensive.

219
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,720
Yes.

220
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,200
I just, just one 1080p camera is about 130 bucks.

221
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,800
I know my entire setup is probably under $300, including the

222
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,360
raspberry PI to record it.

223
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,920
Now that does not include storage, which right now is still in flux.

224
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,560
I'm cheating and I'm using a big old thumb drive as I experiment, but I like

225
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,760
what you're doing because you're investing in something that could

226
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,720
last you a very long time.

227
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,480
I hope so.

228
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,640
I don't, I don't consider these wise cameras probably more than

229
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,560
like a three year setup.

230
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,720
They're disposable, right?

231
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,600
They're like the little windup cameras you used to have.

232
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,960
So you could do a full POE setup.

233
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,880
You could do high resolution that could be swapped out to even higher

234
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,200
resolution down the road.

235
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,360
What are your minimum requirements?

236
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,760
Do you think?

237
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,640
One for the driveway, one internally on the front and back doors and, uh, the

238
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,520
other, uh, in the garage too, cause that's another ingress point.

239
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,800
That's one of the last cameras I did here at the studio, because I did a trial run

240
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,160
of this camera set up here at the studio.

241
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,400
So I have a similar wise setup here at the studio.

242
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,360
In fact, even larger.

243
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,080
And my favorite camera is the one in the garage, surprisingly.

244
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,840
Yeah.

245
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,560
Yeah.

246
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,280
I like to just, like, if there's a noise or something, I like to check in and make

247
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,760
sure that everything's okay and the car is okay.

248
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,080
So where my desk is in this current house, I can't see the front door.

249
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,800
So I have, I have a monitor up top and I just throw my nest driveway feed

250
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,680
up there all the time.

251
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,200
So when I'm just sat here working from home, I can just, you know, glance up and

252
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,360
say, oh, that's what that noise was.

253
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,480
But in terms of my requirements, self-hosting obviously, uh, is important.

254
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,680
I don't want to have to pay a subscription, um, for two reasons.

255
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,760
One is it's a hidden cost effectively in the ticket price of the item.

256
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,200
You know, you, you spend, let's say for a nest cam.

257
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,600
I know I keep coming back to those, but that's cause that's the ones I have.

258
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,720
I have two of those right now.

259
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,960
You spend a hundred plus dollars, nearly 200, I think on the external one on a

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,640
camera, and then you've got to spend another 50, 60 bucks a year for

261
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,920
their cloud connected service.

262
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,760
Now I appreciate for most people, that's a great solution because for most people,

263
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,520
they don't want to have hard drives in their house.

264
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,600
They don't want to have to think about it.

265
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,000
It's just press a button done. Thank you for me.

266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,960
I've already got a hundred terabytes in my basement, so I may as well use that

267
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,160
with the unify, uh, NVR stuff that they, that they let you self-host.

268
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,880
Would you put a nest camera in your bedroom?

269
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,640
Well, I've already got a Google home in there.

270
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,600
So a camera though, that's doing person detection and object detection and sound.

271
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,960
I don't need a camera in the bedroom.

272
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,520
Nobody wants to see that.

273
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,960
The very powerful object detection and person detection that comes with the

274
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,640
nest cameras is also, I think what's gives me out and I'm not necessarily cloud

275
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,160
bad guy.

276
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,680
I do want to be comfortable walking around on camera, just being myself.

277
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,880
Maybe I'm in a robe or something like that, uh, in the RV because of such a

278
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,000
small space, I literally have nearly full camera coverage of everywhere in the

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,920
entire RV.

280
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,200
So there's really no way where you can be off camera unless you're in the

281
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,720
bathroom.

282
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,560
Yeah.

283
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,720
And so I really wanted to be comfortable when I looked up and looked at that

284
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,840
camera lens and saw that light was on, I didn't want to be thinking about where

285
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,680
that could get, could get processed or get stored.

286
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,680
Well, there was that whole thing, wasn't there with the, uh, was it Siri?

287
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,560
I think our Apple employees were listening into those recordings.

288
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,720
Actually, I guess nest also has had a significant rash of people compromising

289
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,560
accounts and then, um, like jumping on people's nest cams and talking through

290
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,080
the two way microphone system.

291
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,800
Have they, uh, didn't know that.

292
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,560
Yeah, I heard some tech journalists ranting about it on a podcast recently.

293
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,000
And then they looked into it and found that it's a fairly regular thing that

294
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
they go out of their way to kind of keep quiet.

295
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,000
Well, you would, if you were them, so, uh, you know, black Friday's coming up soon

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,120
in the States and, uh, Best Buy have started their shenanigans already.

297
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,080
Are you deal shopping already?

298
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,760
Well, I am.

299
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,120
Yes.

300
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Obviously I'm looking for appliances for the house, but couldn't help notice

301
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,520
going in there, looking at TVs and stuff like that.

302
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,120
I mean, what's a guy to do, right?

303
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,800
Oops.

304
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:08,440
I haven't bought anything yet, but they have a 75 inch, uh, LED LG TV for like $900.

305
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,400
Stop it.

306
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,120
Uh-huh.

307
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,440
You don't even want to know what I spent for my first 60 inch Pioneer plasma.

308
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,360
Well, I've got one of these TCL Roku jobs, uh, in my lounge right now, which

309
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,760
I bought last year, I think it's 55 inches and it was like 300.

310
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,360
I like it.

311
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,560
Yeah.

312
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,040
I remember.

313
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,880
For the price, it's great that the image quality, uh, like, you know,

314
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,440
dark scenes and stuff like that.

315
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,040
Like the episode of game of Thrones a few months ago, that was just dark.

316
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,520
Like all I saw was like compression artifacts.

317
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,000
I literally couldn't see anything.

318
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,320
That's my TV right now too.

319
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,480
And I really want to get an OLED, but damn, they're expensive.

320
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,920
Yeah.

321
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,400
I feel like I'm going to wait one more cycle of television so that the top of

322
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,600
the line bumps down one notch because one of, I think, I don't know, this could

323
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,160
be past Chris being an idiot, which happens a lot, so future Chris will

324
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,240
determine, but current Chris is thinking that home kit integration could be a

325
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,600
pretty big deal in the televisions because I have had tremendous success working

326
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,480
with home kit and home assistant, and there's no cloud connectivity required.

327
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,440
It's all over the land.

328
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,040
And so integrating input control and power control and things of that nature

329
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,360
into home assistant.

330
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,720
Well, did you know those TCL TVs, the Roku TVs have an API?

331
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,560
Oh, so I mean, if one was willing, you could probably do it yourself.

332
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,440
Well, I turn my TV on and off using curl effectively.

333
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,880
It's just a command from home assistant.

334
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,200
Oh, no kidding.

335
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Yeah.

336
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,800
I do it already and it works great.

337
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,440
Oh, that's wonderful.

338
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,640
You can set inputs.

339
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,000
You can turn the TV on and off.

340
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,920
You can turn it off.

341
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,480
You can turn the TV on and off.

342
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,400
You can set the volume, all that.

343
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,600
I'm legit jealous of that.

344
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,160
Like, I think I'll tackle a full solar install and be completely off-grid

345
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,080
before I get my TV fully automated.

346
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,680
Yeah, probably.

347
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,560
See, I had a Harmony hub before that.

348
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,880
And again, that was a cloud connected device, which Logitech decided to switch

349
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,680
the APIs off for in January or February this year.

350
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,320
Right around the time I was getting into home assistant and writing that talk for

351
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,840
LinuxFest Northwest that I was doing, you know, the DIY smart LEDs, which leads me

352
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,600
very, very nicely into a little plug I wanted to do on the show today, which is

353
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,240
that LinuxFest Northwest's 2020 is a call for papers is open.

354
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:25,960
Yes.

355
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,240
Are you going to submit?

356
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,560
I am going to submit something.

357
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,320
I don't know what yet.

358
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,920
We've got about 60 days at the time of recording.

359
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,120
So it closes like mid January, I think.

360
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,560
Um, so yeah, if you've been thinking, oh, I'd like to talk at a conference, but I

361
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,960
always miss the submission dates.

362
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,400
You've got a couple of months, give it some thought.

363
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,480
Don't rush into submitting upfront cause there's no benefit from doing that.

364
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,520
Take your time, put together a good proposal, try and think of something

365
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,840
that people want to listen to.

366
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,080
I just got a great idea.

367
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,200
I'd have to get clearance.

368
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:01,120
What if I did a talk about the lady jupes automation, but at the start of my talk,

369
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,160
everybody stands up and they follow me out to the RV and I just give

370
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,640
them a tour of it in person.

371
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,800
Does that scale?

372
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,400
Well, I'd have to do it in probably batches of like 10 people or something.

373
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:11,720
Yeah.

374
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,720
I mean, it's an RV, Chris, it's, it's small.

375
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,160
Did you use how many people were in there for the barbecue?

376
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,640
We probably had 15 people in there.

377
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,160
Yeah.

378
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,400
Yeah.

379
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,960
It was, it was a whole thing.

380
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,800
Um, I'd, I'd love that though.

381
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,600
Like if, if you've got some legit automations finished by then.

382
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,280
Yeah.

383
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,600
So far, this has been our most comfortable summer just due to the

384
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,920
automations that I have got.

385
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,600
When you can make your quality of life better.

386
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,080
Yeah.

387
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,800
You know, that's something I was thinking about talking to you about with these

388
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,160
cameras, one of the things I noticed when I was taking my time and kind of doing

389
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,720
it slowly and, and applying some craftsmanship to it, like we talked about

390
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,040
with Wendell, I got a much deeper sense of satisfaction when the work was over.

391
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,920
Like, and it struck me cause I'd had a day where like a lot of things were

392
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,560
thrown at me cause I'm doing some traveling and all this stuff had come up

393
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,480
and it was like this crazy weekday and I got home and I had a little bit of time

394
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,920
in the, in the, in the evening and I had the energy and so I banged out a few of

395
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,520
these things and got the, you know, the Shinobi system reloaded and got the, got

396
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,240
the, got the two additional cameras installed and I had did a really good

397
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,000
job with the wiring and I, I, like I showed you, I Velcroed the components

398
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,040
inside the dinette seat.

399
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,800
So everything looks and is routed really clean and nice.

400
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,240
And the power cables are all clean and it's really proud of myself.

401
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,200
And I had like this sense of accomplishment after having kind of a rough

402
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,320
day where I was kind of like, I got knocked down all day long.

403
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,800
I came home and, and like, I felt really good about what I had done.

404
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,120
And I realized that that's sort of like, my dad used to talk about, he'd come

405
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,960
home and he'd work on like part of the deck and fix that part of the deck in

406
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,160
the evening and feel he'd have a rough day at work, but at least he got that

407
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,720
damn deck fixed, you know?

408
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,480
And that's, that's how this, even like working with home assistant and

409
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,040
automating things has made me feel.

410
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,360
Making stuff, whether it's, uh, home automation or whether it's 3d printing

411
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,760
or building something out of wood, I, I just, I need to do something, uh, I

412
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,440
know home assistant isn't analog technically, but a lot of the stuff

413
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,240
it's controlling is so, for example, I had to, um, replace the, this is a

414
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,480
rental house I'm in right now.

415
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,440
And I replaced the, uh, thermostat controller board thing on the wall

416
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,080
that changes the, the AC and the furnace.

417
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,000
Uh, I replaced that with a nest thermostat that someone was selling

418
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,560
cheap locally on Craigslist.

419
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,080
They found it off the back of a car.

420
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,480
No, I don't think so.

421
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,480
In the boot, I should say.

422
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,320
Uh, in the trunk.

423
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,280
Yeah.

424
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,760
I had to learn all about, you know, HVAC wiring over here.

425
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,000
You know, there's five, like wires that do different things.

426
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,760
And like, you just trace one end to the control board down in the basement.

427
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,400
And then there's five wires at the top, the same color, and you just

428
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,800
figure out which one goes where.

429
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,720
Um, and for me, it was really interesting because the HVAC unit, like the wire that

430
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,360
had been run was a five core wire, but only four wires were in use with the old

431
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,720
one and someone has just stuffed the fifth one back in the wall.

432
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,840
And I, so I didn't know it was there.

433
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,040
So I went to Home Depot and I bought a five core thing and I was prepared

434
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,880
to pull it all through.

435
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,280
And then I went down to the basement to look at the other end of the wire.

436
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,280
And I was like, there's a loose wire here.

437
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,440
Oh, shit.

438
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,120
That's both great.

439
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,840
And also a bit of a pain in your back.

440
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,360
Yeah. So I've now got a five core wire sat here.

441
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,080
I've opened, but I don't know what to do with, um, but I learned a bunch

442
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,520
of stuff that, that weekend, uh, like you say, it's, it's that sense of

443
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,200
accomplishment that self hosting and self building and making and all that

444
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,680
kind of stuff is, is really, you know, not to be underestimated.

445
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,280
Yes.

446
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,560
And I, I just didn't expect that.

447
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,920
Um, I got into this for practical reasons.

448
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,240
I wanted to, to really just sort of declutify the RV and be able to go offline

449
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,680
completely so I could go like kind of on a tech diet over a weekend, somewhere

450
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,680
with no connectivity, because I just didn't really expect that applying a

451
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,720
little bit of craftsmanship to it and taking, making it take a little bit

452
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,920
longer, but doing it right.

453
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,160
We give me that much more sense of satisfaction.

454
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,600
Um, and I'm proud of that system.

455
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,800
And I'm really proud of the system we've built here at the studio as well.

456
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,720
Not quite as good as I thought it was going to be, but it's, it's, it's

457
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,440
quite as much craftsmanship, but it's running really well.

458
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,240
And yeah, we didn't expect like to get that sensation from this.

459
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,680
I just thought it'd be a practical thing.

460
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,440
It's it speaks to the, one of the key points of my, uh, Lennox fest Northwest

461
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,720
talk this year, which is solve a real problem because if you do that, you have

462
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,120
the motivation to see the project through to the end, and then once you've done

463
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,880
one, you're like, well, that actually wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.

464
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,880
What else can I do?

465
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,640
That has helped with Shinobi because to be honest, it's sometimes it's

466
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,760
felt a little rickety.

467
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,880
It feels sort of like it's tossed together.

468
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
It's kind of awkward.

469
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,160
It has, it has a bunch of different user levels and a super URL that's only used

470
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,960
for really managing users and restarting services, and it's kind of an odd duck.

471
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,080
And you need to really kind of follow docs and read community

472
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,880
threads to, to put it all together.

473
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,960
I'd ran the wires, I'd set up the cameras.

474
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,600
I invested all of that time and money.

475
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,240
And so I just sort of kept plucking at it until I, you know, had wittled

476
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,080
into a setup that's mostly good.

477
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,520
I'm, I'm now going down the route of experimenting with motion detection,

478
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,000
which is interesting because you take the camera shot that comes in the GPU

479
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,360
processes it, then it sends it off at a lower frame rate to FFmpeg, which then

480
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,760
analyzes it for motion using a series of MPM plugins.

481
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,200
And then if it detects motion above a threshold that you set.

482
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,480
So my case, I have them pretty low.

483
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,120
So if there's 2% motion in the frame, so that's like 2% of the area

484
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,920
changes, it triggers motion.

485
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,680
You can change that to whatever you'd like.

486
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,120
You can also say, if, if it exceeds a certain level of, of motion,

487
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,480
just don't bother, just drop it.

488
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,480
That can be useful with an RTSP feed that has frame drops or like bars

489
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,600
across the video feed that where you can see there's been some signal loss

490
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,560
that you could essentially say, ignore if it's just what, if it's essentially

491
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,040
the whole frame's changing, something's going on, drop that.

492
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,800
But if it's somewhere between 2% and 70%, record that.

493
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,440
So that's what I'm doing right now.

494
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,560
And that uses CPU, but I'm saving disc because I'm only recording

495
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,200
when there's motion.

496
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,080
And I have some cameras that see very little activity during the day.

497
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,360
And, um, getting that just right now is, is like a finessing process

498
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,040
because each camera has different contents with different lighting

499
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,600
and different areas.

500
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,600
And I can go in Shinobi and I can highlight with boxes exactly the spot

501
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,520
so I want motion.

502
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,760
So in some cameras I have just the windows selected and the couch is

503
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,720
completely out of the shot.

504
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,080
So we can sit there on the couch and not trigger recording.

505
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:46,720
Yeah.

506
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,320
Those zones make a big difference.

507
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,800
Yeah.

508
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,400
And saves a lot of disc.

509
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,280
Yeah.

510
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,400
Unless you get it too sensitive and then it's just recording all the time.

511
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,320
Like I did it first and it just blasted my desk.

512
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,640
I have a, in my Google photos, I have a period from about three years ago where

513
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,120
I started messing about with my own cameras for the first time where every

514
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,160
single time my dog walks past the camera, I've got a snapshot of my lounge.

515
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,120
There's thousands of them.

516
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,520
Okay.

517
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,440
So I just listened on my run this morning to last week's Linux action

518
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,720
news, where you and Joe talked about, uh, proton male and hoard male and

519
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,360
squirrel male and self-hosting all the males.

520
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,320
And to that end, uh, we have a relevant ask SSH.

521
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,360
Ah, great.

522
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,720
It comes from Tom Broughton.

523
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,560
Uh, one of the biggest questions I have is whether I should self host my

524
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,040
own email or use something like the mail in a box I've been trying to

525
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,080
get away from Google who hasn't, um, I write a lot of notes.

526
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,240
I'm not convinced by proton male or others that require you

527
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,720
to have their client installed.

528
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,760
It's quite a long one.

529
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,960
So I'll, uh, abbreviate, um, is self-hosting email robust and secure.

530
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,080
What do you use?

531
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,040
Is it worth the risk or would it be better to just pay or use a service

532
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,440
that gives away your privacy?

533
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,640
This is like, this is one that I debate in our Jupiter broadcasting

534
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,800
telegram group frequently, because I am of like a dozen mindsets on this

535
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,080
because part of me says, no, don't ever do it.

536
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,240
It's way too much hassle.

537
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,600
It's not so much the difficulty in setting up email.

538
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,440
That's that can be relatively easy.

539
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,960
It's that you get so frustrated when you get blacklisted and then your

540
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,800
family in front of you and you're like, okay, I don't want to do this.

541
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,840
I'm frustrated when you get blacklisted and then your family and friends

542
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,480
are affected that are using the service and you have to hunt this thing down.

543
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,040
And it's so insulting.

544
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,480
It's so it's so irritating.

545
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
Emails so basic.

546
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,560
It should just effing work.

547
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,040
Yeah.

548
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,680
And what happens, it'll smack you when you least expect it.

549
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,680
You'll be like seven months, a year into it.

550
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,520
You'll be busy.

551
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,240
You'll be traveling.

552
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,880
You'll be on vacation or whatever.

553
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,000
And it breaks eventually it will happen, but that's true of

554
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,720
self-hosting almost anything, you know, home assistant, trust me.

555
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,120
Break when you least want it to, when you're, you know, trying to do a

556
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,240
demo to your mother-in-law of the ramifications though, of not receiving

557
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,680
email can be pretty broad depending on the individual that's a fair point.

558
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,240
Now here's another take on it.

559
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,360
The federated by its basic nature aspect of email is vitally important.

560
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,680
And I think it's critical that hobbyists continue to self-host

561
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,400
email so that way it continues to be even a thing that's possible.

562
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,920
Cause you could see this get locked down so that a certain agreements

563
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,120
get set up by certain commercial carriers.

564
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,320
And then they have like protected email that passes between their

565
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,800
systems and people outside that might have to qualify.

566
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,600
So, I mean, you never know where this could go.

567
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,520
Don't we kind of have that with WhatsApp and telegram and like,

568
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,600
aren't they miniature emails in a way?

569
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Or are they miniature IRCs or are they all just miniature using it?

570
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,240
They're not decentralized at the core of, of email is it's a

571
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,440
decentralized, anybody can do it protocol.

572
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,840
Also, it's a handy to have a quick way to bounce out emails from

573
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,600
systems that do reporting, you know, like my Shinobi system would be nice

574
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,400
to just have a quick little easy way to send out some emails.

575
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,840
There are several ways to do that, but.

576
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,840
So I've never self-hosted my email.

577
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,960
It's something that's crossed my mind on more than one occasion, but I

578
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,080
just, whenever you tap that phrase into Google, should I self-host my email?

579
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,400
The almost unanimous answer is no.

580
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,440
Yeah.

581
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,240
Well, that's because folks like me that set it up for themselves and for

582
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,040
friends and for family and for companies over the years say, don't do it.

583
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,080
Yeah, don't do it Alex.

584
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,520
Cause there's the whole spam blacklisting thing.

585
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,720
If your server gets compromised, some ISPs don't open certain ports.

586
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,360
Although these days that's less of an issue.

587
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,120
Yeah, well, it's difficult to understand how valuable of a target

588
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,000
an email server is until you run one.

589
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,680
You don't even have to be a popular one.

590
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,480
You could have one with a dozen users.

591
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,480
One of those accounts gets compromised and that server

592
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,360
is immediately used for spam.

593
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,800
It's, it's amazing.

594
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,240
It's speed and efficiency at which these lists work just takes one weak point.

595
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,120
It could be in your software stack, could be in a user account.

596
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,920
So one of the listeners actually replied, Matty McGraw, who I think

597
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,320
was our ask SSH last time.

598
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,640
Oh yeah, he replied to the ask SSH, uh, as did you, cause this was a while

599
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,280
ago with a link from our self-hosted, the Reddit self-hosted Reddit.

600
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,880
And, um, the, uh, the title of the article is you should not run your

601
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,160
own mail server because mail is hard.

602
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,400
You know, lots of stuff is hard.

603
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,480
That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

604
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,480
I don't actually agree.

605
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,560
Mail's hard either, uh, setting up a basic IMAP server and an SMTP

606
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,800
server, that's not hard.

607
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,280
Think about the price of entry, right?

608
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,400
So th this article claims that he presupposes that you're a sys admin

609
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,040
with tech knowledge, who knows basic networking, basic protocol

610
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,960
knowledge, all that kind of stuff.

611
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,600
I agree.

612
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,480
You, you need to, so just to get to zero in this situation actually

613
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,520
assumes a lot of basic knowledge.

614
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,320
And you probably should be a fairly decent one at that.

615
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,520
So the answer to the question, Tom, is probably not for most people.

616
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,040
I would say it's, in my opinion, at least it's something I've never done.

617
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,600
I don't have any desire to do it. Oh, I kind of do.

618
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,160
Oh, but Gmail is so easy and I know that's a cop-out and they can mind

619
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,480
my data and all that kind of stuff.

620
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,600
But like you said, the ramifications of email not working, like I'm buying

621
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,040
and selling a house right now, if those contracts can't come through.

622
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,840
That's a problem for me.

623
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,240
Yeah.

624
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,760
Taxes.

625
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,080
And it's a problem if I need to get emailed from the school about the kids.

626
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,680
It's a problem.

627
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,320
I mean, there's a lot of ways it's a problem.

628
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,600
I would, if I was going to do it, look into what VPS people have had success

629
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,080
doing it on.

630
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,880
I don't think I would do it on my home connection unless I had a very kind of

631
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,800
special home connection or a business connection.

632
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
You raise a good point.

633
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,960
My Gmail goes back to when I was, I was in lower sixth in England.

634
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,200
So I guess I was 16, 17 when Gmail was brand new and invite only.

635
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,240
I think that's 2005.

636
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,160
So I've got emails in there going way, way back and I've quite often

637
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,400
reconstructed portions of my life using my Gmail inbox.

638
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,280
So has Google.

639
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,240
Well, there you go.

640
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,000
Every Amazon purchase, any receipt ever sent to your mailbox.

641
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,080
Think about that.

642
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,680
Saying that I got, I got a, an email or it was a targeted Facebook ad the other

643
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,480
day, actually saying, Alex, are you missing home British airways for Christmas?

644
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,360
Oh, wow.

645
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,760
I thought that was kind of interesting.

646
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,000
That's pretty clever.

647
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,680
Yeah.

648
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,160
I mean, would you have, maybe you were actually, I mean, if you weren't trying

649
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,280
to buy a house, you might be.

650
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,400
Right? Yeah, yeah.

651
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,160
Um, uh, yeah, to be honest with you, like targeted advertising is a bit

652
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,800
of a double-edged sword, right?

653
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,840
I mean, on the one side, I don't want to see any ads ever, but in reality,

654
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,040
that's not the world we live in, is it?

655
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,560
So I'd rather see an advert about something that's relevant to me

656
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,040
than, I don't know, shoe polish.

657
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,080
I don't mind if Amazon wants to review my purchase history with their own

658
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,880
servers and then figure out what I might be into that doesn't really

659
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,800
bother me that much.

660
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,840
It's more like the total surveillance to try to piece me up into many different

661
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,480
markets for many different ad purposes.

662
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,800
That's sort of what bothers me.

663
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,520
Yeah.

664
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,560
I, uh, I don't know.

665
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,720
I feel like we should set ourselves a challenge.

666
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,120
We're going to really regret something like this, but like some, something crazy,

667
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,480
like I don't like where this is going.

668
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:26,600
If we make it to 100 episodes to celebrate, we launch our own self-hosted

669
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,840
mail server for our, for our email.

670
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,720
We do some, you know, we get our email, we get our email, we get our email,

671
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,160
we do something, you know, we get our own, like, you know, we, we could just use

672
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,680
our self-hosted dot show domain and we could just have like show at, and we'll

673
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,320
throw it on the raspberry PI seven.

674
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,600
I just say, maybe we should, somebody should hold us accountable to that.

675
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,000
Cause we'll surely forget that.

676
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,400
I hope we do forget that one.

677
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,000
Me too.

678
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,680
But anyways, I'd say, I'd say consider all of, all of the things like do the

679
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,280
research about where you'll be sending the mail from if it's had issues, because

680
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,320
if you can just get on a list that an entire block of IPS, like an entire VPS

681
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,440
provider can be blocked and maybe you've been a good citizen, you've never had a

682
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,240
problem, but if anyone else in that IP block has, then you're pretty much

683
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,560
screwed.

684
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,840
So you really need to do some due diligence first.

685
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,320
Yep.

686
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,800
That's where email is hard now.

687
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,480
It's not actually setting up the software.

688
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,360
Totally agree.

689
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,600
So before we go, I just remember the reason I even went, went to that best

690
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,960
buy area of conversation was to bring up the 12 terabyte easy store hard drive

691
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,640
situation.

692
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,880
Oh, it wasn't a talk about beautiful 75 inch televisions.

693
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,400
Wasn't to talk about TVs.

694
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:39,200
It was to talk about hard drives, uh, $179, I think, um, right now for a 12

695
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,560
terabyte hard drive in the U S um, so yeah, if you're in the market for that

696
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,360
kind of thing, you can shut those drives, do the 3.3 volt mod that we talked about

697
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,760
last week and get yourselves a darn good hard drive for a pretty unbeatable price.

698
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,440
Yeah. Or grab some of those and just set your family up with

699
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,600
backups for the holidays.

700
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:57,920
Yeah.

701
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
USB hard drives with a raspberry PI.

702
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,600
Why not?

703
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,480
Why not?

704
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,320
Right.

705
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,640
I think it's probably about that time.

706
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:03,960
Don't you?

707
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,320
Oh, all right.

708
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,360
I really have had a lot of fun setting up these cameras and I can't wait to talk

709
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,960
about some of the other things we've been working on.

710
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,440
I know you've got some stuff coming up.

711
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:13,920
Oh my gosh.

712
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,880
Could you imagine the shows we're going to get out of you getting a new place?

713
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,120
No, it's going to be good.

714
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:23,560
I'm looking at running a cat six, a cable so I can do 10 gig ethernet and all this

715
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,000
stuff, you know, it's going to be great.

716
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,040
Oh, I, I think it might have to take multiple trips, just might have to come

717
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,880
down there and maybe the timing once everything is settled would be around

718
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,960
the spring by coincidence.

719
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,240
Gosh.

720
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,680
Well, I mean the things I'll have to do for this show next year.

721
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,960
All I can say is Riley and April is a, well actually that's Linux fest Northwest.

722
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,960
So March rally in March is lovely.

723
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,640
Surprise, surprise.

724
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,320
Surprise.

725
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,920
Thank you for listening everybody.

726
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,200
And you can find me on Twitter at ironic Badger.

727
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,720
I'm at Chris LAS.

728
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,320
The show is at self-hosted show along with the show notes at self-hosted dot show.

729
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:05,640
And you can find more of Jupiter broadcasting on Twitter at Jupiter signal.

730
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,240
Yes.

731
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,560
Maybe a quick plug for Jupiter extras.

732
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,560
We've done some recent extras with the merger FS developer, as well as some

733
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,040
basics on containers and reverse proxy.

734
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,840
So extras dot show for additional and supplemental content to this year's show.

735
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
So thanks for listening everyone.

736
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:50,480
That was self-hosted dot show slash six.
