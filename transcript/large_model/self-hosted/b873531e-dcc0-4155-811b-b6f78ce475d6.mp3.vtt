WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
well i've made it down to southern oregon to get lady jubes ready for a summer road trip and she

00:05.280 --> 00:09.440
had a little bit of work she still needed done from the last road trip so i'm down here i might

00:09.440 --> 00:13.360
sound a little different might sound a little off because i'm actually like just in a parking lot

00:13.360 --> 00:18.880
i'm just i'm not like in a studio i'm not in some nice place with good signal and quiet sounds nope

00:18.880 --> 00:24.160
i'm just in a parking lot while i get some work done but the show must go on alex and what could

00:24.160 --> 00:28.800
go wrong with that particularly with the starlink situation you've got right now yeah my starling's

00:28.800 --> 00:33.840
busted too the motor the dish works so i can rabbit ear it you know i can i i've done this

00:33.840 --> 00:36.880
i've gone out there and tried to point it at the northern sky and try to figure out where the

00:36.880 --> 00:42.160
satellites at and it'll work for a bit but finally after about like a week and change maybe a little

00:42.160 --> 00:45.360
almost two weeks they finally got back to me they're going to send me a replacement that's

00:45.360 --> 00:51.440
good good don't forget to buy an ethernet adapter if you're getting the square one now right i think

00:51.440 --> 00:56.240
i probably will i'm going to go from the round dishy to the square dishy i went shopping today

00:56.240 --> 01:01.120
while i was killing time while they were working on the rig i haven't gone to best buy since the

01:01.120 --> 01:05.040
pandemic started i just haven't had a chance to go in so i was curious what are they doing

01:05.680 --> 01:10.960
for their home automation gear now and they're they're really big of course on the amazon

01:10.960 --> 01:19.200
ecosystem and the google ecosystem huge on arlo and a lot of the video lights that you can attach

01:19.200 --> 01:23.920
to your house that have like motion detection they sell a whole bunch of those like i said i haven't

01:23.920 --> 01:29.440
been in a long time and i'm sure a lot of people listening know this but i didn't really realize

01:29.440 --> 01:34.480
or appreciate that they're doing e-ink displays for all the prices and stuff for most things

01:34.480 --> 01:37.040
have you seen this you've probably seen this because you've probably gone in more recently

01:37.040 --> 01:41.600
than i have it's pretty cool isn't it it works right some of them are a little hard to read

01:41.600 --> 01:48.080
but i like it i think it's a nice touch it's cool and then the one device that really impressed me

01:48.080 --> 01:54.080
out of all the stuff there that i saw i didn't pick it up but the pricing on the lenovo smart

01:54.080 --> 01:59.200
clock stands that have google assistant built in it looks like an alarm clock but it has google

01:59.200 --> 02:05.600
assistant 29.99 for this thing yeah that is nice open box 25 bucks and then they have one with a

02:05.600 --> 02:10.880
screen that has the google cards on it and stuff like that for 89.99 i was at best buy just this

02:10.880 --> 02:17.920
week buying a new hard drive but let's not let's not spoil the show oh yeah yeah yeah it was good

02:17.920 --> 02:22.400
to go in there you know do a little shopping get a sense of where the pricing's at and honestly

02:22.400 --> 02:27.280
doesn't seem like the the tech pricing's really changed much everything's going up in price except

02:27.280 --> 02:32.400
for a lot of the tech stuff still seems like it was priced it was a year or two ago i feel like

02:32.400 --> 02:38.400
walking into best buy is how like harry potter must feel walking out of diagon alley or something

02:38.400 --> 02:44.560
like this is this is how normal people live this is like how muggles live i would have loved to

02:44.560 --> 02:48.480
have seen the starlink kit at best buy i mean i knew it just wasn't going to happen but imagine

02:48.480 --> 02:52.640
if i could have walked in there and bought a new dish tonight with a working motor imagine this

02:52.640 --> 03:00.640
imagine if starlink made a dish that was repairable oh whoa like maybe i could open it up

03:00.640 --> 03:06.320
and replace the motor no and then i could just carry spare parts on board and then like install

03:06.320 --> 03:12.000
them when it goes wrong that's just that's crazy alex it's so frustrating you know it's going to

03:12.000 --> 03:16.720
be like a three dollar part that's broken yeah i'm actually a little concerned about how i'm

03:16.720 --> 03:20.480
going to transport it in the future because as far as i know it was just transporting it going

03:20.480 --> 03:26.080
down the road maybe the jar a jarring bump something broke the motor and uh so now i'm

03:26.080 --> 03:30.560
thinking about when i do get a replacement dish like do i need to get like a case for this thing

03:30.560 --> 03:34.880
like a pelican case like i don't know i'm curious what the audience might do if they have a starlink

03:34.880 --> 03:40.320
and they're transporting it are there starlink cases for safe transport is that a thing we'll

03:40.320 --> 03:44.880
build you a wooden crate between me and brent i think we can make that happen there you go that

03:44.880 --> 03:50.160
looked pretty nice what we're live tonight somehow i don't know how the cellular signal is mostly

03:50.160 --> 03:56.400
holding on i've dropped 6 000 packets so it's not perfect but it's holding good enough dude we've

03:56.400 --> 04:00.720
got folks in the discord the self-hosted discord is going like always at selfhosted.show slash

04:00.720 --> 04:08.800
discord hit a milestone recently we did we just passed 4500 members which is crazy that is so

04:08.800 --> 04:13.680
great you got to admit it was a little awkward when we decided to go with discord since it is

04:13.680 --> 04:19.200
not a self-hosted chat platform but you can't deny the networking aspect of it well i just

04:19.200 --> 04:25.200
look at the uh palava that you and wes have been through on linux unplugged with your matrix server

04:25.200 --> 04:30.800
and i just i feel completely vindicated in that decision yeah you might be right you might be

04:30.800 --> 04:36.960
right the matrix server has been a real learning process i like to think of it as a long-term

04:36.960 --> 04:43.440
investment right something like that something like that now speaking of long-term planning it's

04:43.440 --> 04:49.440
not that far away but i'm going to be in the uk in august early august so i'm kind of floating

04:49.440 --> 04:54.080
the idea of a uk meetup because several people messaged me when we were talking about the rally

04:54.080 --> 05:00.320
one saying that they were jealous the vague very vague plan at this point is uh the weekend of

05:00.320 --> 05:06.640
august the sixth somewhere in london so that people can fly in from ireland and europe more

05:06.640 --> 05:10.800
easily somewhere in london we'll have a meetup maybe a pub maybe a community center something

05:10.800 --> 05:16.240
like that i don't know we're going to figure it out but if you're interested send me a message

05:16.240 --> 05:23.200
on the discord or hit me up on twitter at ironic badger uh i want to go so bad i bet august is a

05:23.200 --> 05:28.160
great time to be in london too it could be it could be a good time or it could be snowing and

05:28.160 --> 05:36.000
raining sideways in august who knows i mean no maybe not snow but i mean honestly it could be 35

05:36.000 --> 05:42.080
celsius or it could be 10 who knows do you want people to send you uh suggestions via emails maybe

05:42.080 --> 05:47.200
the contact page contact page anything like that if you've got a venue in mind i was i was thinking

05:47.200 --> 05:52.640
we did a few events for redhat consulting when i was in london at brewdog those pubs are quite

05:52.640 --> 05:57.440
hip and trendy and modern they've got like a whole area upstairs that you can kind of rent out some

05:57.440 --> 06:01.680
some of them so maybe something like that would be nice because they're sort of half open half

06:01.680 --> 06:06.480
inside type thing so kind of hedge our bets on the weather that's probably a pretty good idea

06:06.480 --> 06:11.840
let's be honest man i'm so jealous please take pictures i want to i want to see it maybe one

06:11.840 --> 06:17.200
of these days we'll get you out there huh maybe uh fosdom i'd love to definitely on my list it

06:17.200 --> 06:22.080
kind of got set back the last couple of years but it's definitely on my list this is one of those

06:22.080 --> 06:26.960
episodes we have them i think about every other episode i'm gonna have a bunch of work after uh

06:26.960 --> 06:32.560
this this episode i just i just know it i know it and it's gonna be it's gonna be because my wife's

06:32.560 --> 06:38.720
gonna demand it you have come across something i i feel like either you talked to me about it before

06:38.720 --> 06:43.600
off air or someone did it just doesn't seem right that we haven't talked about this on air yet well

06:43.600 --> 06:49.280
a couple of weeks ago the tandoor project a self-hosted recipe manager released version

06:49.280 --> 06:54.960
1.4 so they've been in in development for a year plus at this point so it's very possible you've

06:54.960 --> 06:59.760
seen it on reddit at some point before yeah maybe but the 1.4 release has got some notable changes

06:59.760 --> 07:06.080
in it there's a whole new shopping list feature built in which is pretty darn cool and so just

07:06.080 --> 07:09.680
to be clear this is a recipe manager that you would run on your own system where they offer

07:09.680 --> 07:14.080
a self-hosted version and if we if we haven't talked about on the show before we should have

07:14.080 --> 07:19.120
well we've talked about chow down and i'm fairly sure we've talked about mealy before if we haven't

07:19.120 --> 07:26.880
i use both of those equally i still love chow down because it's a simple markdown based system

07:26.880 --> 07:33.600
there's no database there's no craziness it's just a stupid simple markdown plain text files

07:34.640 --> 07:39.200
but having a database gives you some nice features like in tandoor for example

07:39.840 --> 07:43.760
when you import a recipe you can then add it into a meal plan so you could have a

07:43.760 --> 07:51.040
family-facing meal plan dashboard take it one step further the app knows which ingredients go

07:51.040 --> 07:56.640
into those recipes so you can say excuse me tandoor could you please add that to my shopping list and

07:56.640 --> 08:02.000
then pull that shopping list up when you're at the grocery store and just buy everything you need for

08:02.000 --> 08:07.600
that specific thing now what i saw in reddit as a particularly interesting idea was some kind of

08:07.600 --> 08:13.120
like self-hosted hellofresh someone suggested to the developer that he integrates with instant

08:13.120 --> 08:21.120
carts api with those recipes to order three green peppers and some chicken and whatever else you

08:21.120 --> 08:26.560
need for that that recipe so you end up with this like self-hosted hellofresh type thing which i

08:26.560 --> 08:34.240
thought would be an amazing amazing thing no kidding brilliant idea this has another feature

08:34.240 --> 08:38.240
that you're probably about to touch on but i just have to talk about because this is what won me

08:38.240 --> 08:45.040
over and it is one of the newer features they just recently implemented and it's this really slick

08:45.040 --> 08:51.760
import feature where you can give it the url of a website that has a recipe i threw one of those

08:51.760 --> 08:55.840
one of those like essentially a blog post where they tell you their whole life story just to give

08:55.840 --> 09:01.760
you a recipe and they have pictures and oh i hate those so much i found like the worst one man where

09:01.760 --> 09:09.600
it has like slide over javascript and just all kinds of junk and i i i gave the url to tender

09:09.600 --> 09:15.920
and it actually processed the page it pulled out all the individual steps all of the individual

09:15.920 --> 09:21.600
ingredients and it itemized it all just perfectly i threw some simpler ones out it did great too but

09:21.600 --> 09:26.720
i was really impressed that it got that that really complicated one and so it's like you just

09:26.720 --> 09:32.240
take this really really long three-page post and condense it down into just a good block

09:32.240 --> 09:36.800
information you need and then you add it to your database and now you got that recipe it's amazing

09:36.800 --> 09:42.960
it will import the images from the website it will also pick out keywords yes yes yes it will

09:42.960 --> 09:48.720
figure out the steps you need the ingredients uh everything so the the import stuff is really slick

09:48.720 --> 09:53.280
and you can do one recipe at a time or you can just give it a list of urls with a line

09:53.280 --> 09:59.920
a new line per link and it just it just works i mean that's the best kind of works right i had

09:59.920 --> 10:06.880
the wife use it because she was just yesterday talking to me about how you know my grammy used

10:06.880 --> 10:11.840
index cards and when i when i first started cooking i created a binder she said and i had all

10:11.840 --> 10:17.360
my recipes in this binder that i'd printed out but that's gone now and she wanted to start collecting

10:17.360 --> 10:23.920
her recipes again and so i had her sit down and input a few of them into this and i'd say within

10:23.920 --> 10:29.520
15 minutes she probably had four recipes added and she was testing the shopping cart feature

10:29.520 --> 10:33.760
to see how that works and then she was visualizing okay well how would this work if i'm

10:33.760 --> 10:39.440
if i'm at if i'm at the grocery store and i have my phone with me how would the ui look so she like

10:39.440 --> 10:43.440
resizes the browser to see if it works okay on mobile it totally did it looks like it's going to

10:43.440 --> 10:48.080
render just fine and so she had herself a list that she could just go down the aisle and check off

10:48.080 --> 10:52.320
as she buys and she experimented with seeing what happens if multiple recipes call for the

10:52.320 --> 10:57.440
same ingredient and if it gets the right amounts correct in the shopping cart and it does it just

10:57.440 --> 11:02.080
does a really good job with all that and it supports markdown for your cooking notes that is

11:02.080 --> 11:06.560
cool yes i was going to touch on the comment feature at the bottom there's also another option

11:06.560 --> 11:13.440
to log a specific cook so i'm thinking for my barbecue grilling like if i put the brisket recipe

11:13.440 --> 11:18.560
that i use in there i can link things like the youtube video but then i can also give myself a

11:18.560 --> 11:23.920
rating out of five and a specific date and time that's in there and then tie that into a specific

11:23.920 --> 11:29.280
comment on a specific day to say i let's try say i tried a new technique that day with uh with

11:29.280 --> 11:32.720
grilling it's a serious business don't you know you got to make sure you get it right and if you

11:32.720 --> 11:39.040
got if you nailed it you got to note down what you did or if you mess it up exactly exactly now the

11:39.040 --> 11:43.920
the other thing that i really really like is it has a servings option at the top of the page with

11:43.920 --> 11:48.800
like a plus and a minus and in the ingredients thing here let's say you've got two pounds of

11:48.800 --> 11:54.400
chicken in your recipe and it's four servings i can just hit the plus button and double that to

11:54.400 --> 11:59.600
i don't know seven let's go with seven servings now i mean the mental maths isn't too difficult

11:59.600 --> 12:06.000
on that one but how many times have you had to do some weird fractional maths on a cup of flour or

12:06.000 --> 12:11.280
something weird like that and and the servings thing in here it works flawlessly yeah and it's

12:11.280 --> 12:15.520
again that's also nice when you're using it to generate the shopping list so you know how much

12:15.520 --> 12:20.720
you need of something in there the other thing that i didn't get a lot of time to use but i think

12:20.720 --> 12:26.960
was really interesting to my wife was it has a meal planner in there and uh you get a calendar

12:26.960 --> 12:30.880
and you can plan out your meals of course you can use you can select the recipes that you've

12:30.880 --> 12:36.480
already input to the system then if you would like it will actually export you out a calendar

12:36.480 --> 12:41.040
file an ics file or whatever they are and you can import that meal plan into your calendar

12:41.040 --> 12:44.560
app of choice so you have it somewhere outside tandoor as well which i thought that was a really

12:44.560 --> 12:50.960
nice touch now for hadia's thing there is a whole cookbooks feature so you could kind of group

12:50.960 --> 12:57.200
recipes you know like grandma mom wife whatever you know for me i could have a barbecue cookbook

12:57.200 --> 13:01.280
for example that would be pretty cool there's so many features in this thing i feel like we could

13:01.280 --> 13:06.880
spend an hour on it almost but if you're interested it's obviously free and open source software over

13:06.880 --> 13:13.360
on github there'll be a link in the show notes it's at tandoor recipes recipes in github yeah

13:13.360 --> 13:17.040
definitely worth checking out i mean when's the last time we get this excited about a recipe app

13:17.040 --> 13:21.840
i mean maybe we just like recipe apps but this is a whole management suite but what was the process

13:21.840 --> 13:26.320
like of getting it installed because i tried their online demo since i'm on the road i didn't want to

13:26.320 --> 13:29.920
get go through all the process of loading it up but i think i'm going to have to do that when

13:29.920 --> 13:35.600
i get home so give me an idea of what i'm looking at it's not too bad three containers there's a

13:35.600 --> 13:42.720
database so postgres there's the app itself which is a jango based application and then there's an

13:42.720 --> 13:47.760
nginx front end i mean you can switch out the nginx front end web server if you like with

13:47.760 --> 13:55.280
your web server of choice personally i would prefer if the developer shipped the tandoor

13:55.280 --> 14:01.600
application with a simple web server built in the g unicorn stuff that's built into the app that

14:01.600 --> 14:07.040
ships is not really fit for purpose in terms of public hosting and he mentions that in the

14:07.040 --> 14:11.920
documentation he's very clear about that and that's why he suggests people spin up nginx

14:11.920 --> 14:17.600
but i'm a fairly experienced docker administrator at this point a container guy and i got a couple

14:17.600 --> 14:21.520
of my file paths wrong so some of it's on me admittedly but it took me about an hour to get

14:21.520 --> 14:26.000
this going simply because i had to link three containers together and make sure everything was

14:26.000 --> 14:31.760
just so and there's an environment variables file and all that kind of stuff it's not too difficult

14:31.760 --> 14:37.600
honestly if you don't copy paste the wrong paths but it could be easier if it was just an all

14:37.600 --> 14:43.280
self-contained app like for example plexus i understand there's a bit of a debate there

14:43.840 --> 14:48.160
some people have the philosophy you just do the core application and then you do one instance of

14:48.160 --> 14:53.920
nginx and one instance of your database and maybe whatever else you might have and don't run multiple

14:53.920 --> 14:58.400
copies of that software in a container and i definitely think that's probably an appropriate

14:58.400 --> 15:02.400
setup for production you know anything that's in a business or enterprise or anything that's going

15:02.400 --> 15:07.920
to scale beyond a dozen users probably worth considering but for this sort of scenario the

15:07.920 --> 15:11.680
one that you're talking about now where you're going to run it on your home server it's going

15:11.680 --> 15:18.240
to be you and your wife and maybe me and maybe brent they're going to use it total right and so

15:18.240 --> 15:22.320
there it does make a lot of sense to just have something that is maybe just a single docker

15:22.320 --> 15:27.520
container you pop it on your machine and you go particularly it's not a super heavy application

15:27.520 --> 15:35.280
right it's a small dango app and an nginx web server like that's that's very tiny also i mean

15:35.280 --> 15:39.520
i know this is easy for me to say but wouldn't be impossible to have two types of containers one

15:39.520 --> 15:43.520
that's just the application core and one that includes maybe the full suite of everything you

15:43.520 --> 15:50.320
need yeah so mr developer man vabine 1111 if you're listening that's pretty much the only

15:50.320 --> 15:55.200
feedback i have for you really the application's great the stuff you've done over the last year plus

15:55.200 --> 16:01.680
improving this application is to be commended truly but the setup process i know i saw in reddit

16:01.680 --> 16:06.960
that you don't understand why people find it difficult i hope just what we've articulated

16:06.960 --> 16:12.000
there helps a little bit of me on that particular bone it's it's just linking different things

16:12.000 --> 16:16.320
together in people's different setups you know some people are running unraid some people are

16:16.320 --> 16:22.480
running true nas i'm running docker compose through an ansible templating thing that i created so you

16:22.480 --> 16:26.400
know there's lots of different strokes for different folks and anything you can do to reduce

16:26.400 --> 16:30.960
that deployment complexity is going to increase your adoption it's as simple as that definitely

16:30.960 --> 16:34.720
well said and i'm looking forward to getting this running this is going to be something you know the

16:34.720 --> 16:39.760
wife and i are really going to going to enjoy but i don't think i'll be setting it up on my proxmox

16:39.760 --> 16:44.720
system not yet but i am planning to build one soon and it sounds like we've got a brand new release

16:44.720 --> 16:50.720
that looks great we do 7.2 now the headline feature for me besides you know fun stuff like

16:50.720 --> 16:56.640
the linux kernel getting a bump and qemu and lxc and zfs and all those things getting bumps to the

16:56.640 --> 17:04.480
latest versions is support for the accelerated vert io gl display driver i know it sounds

17:04.480 --> 17:10.560
thrilling right but hear me out the this particular display driver is in software and i went from

17:10.560 --> 17:16.400
about 13 frames per second we all know what that feels like that's what the traditional vm in a

17:16.400 --> 17:23.600
browser has felt like for a decade i went from about 10 or 15 frames a second to over a hundred

17:23.600 --> 17:31.040
hey whoa really just changing that feature and there was no drivers required on the guest i had

17:31.040 --> 17:36.160
to install a couple of packages on proxmox itself but it tells you what they are in the documentation

17:36.160 --> 17:40.880
and it was that was it i was done and suddenly i've got 10 times performance improvement how

17:40.880 --> 17:47.120
often does that happen that's huge i can tell you i've experienced that on parallels on the m1 max

17:47.840 --> 17:53.280
when they added support for the m1 platform they added vert io and vert iogl for the graphics

17:53.280 --> 17:59.600
pass-through and it makes the desktop on linux responsive like it's on the metal it's really

17:59.600 --> 18:04.800
really great and so how are you accessing this it through proxmox is it is it through the web

18:04.800 --> 18:10.080
console through the web browser yeah nothing crazy at all so there's a spice client that connects

18:10.080 --> 18:15.920
to the vm's console in the browser there's no hardware pass-through going on here i want to be

18:15.920 --> 18:20.320
absolutely clear this is all in software you know traditionally we did a whole episode of linux

18:20.320 --> 18:26.400
unplugged a long time ago now on gpu pass-through and how much of a bitch it can be to get the right

18:26.400 --> 18:31.520
hardware and get the right software and everything all lined up just tickety-boo it's a lot easier

18:31.520 --> 18:37.840
these days now nvidia have kind of capitulated there but i digress this is all software and

18:37.840 --> 18:43.440
you know i can't overstate like just a 10x performance improvement right in front of my eyes

18:43.440 --> 18:50.000
and so now i've gone from needing a spare laptop to test linux desktop distros to get the feel

18:50.000 --> 18:54.960
right to get that high frame rate feel of what a new gnome release feels like what a new kde plasma

18:54.960 --> 19:02.480
release feels like i can do this now in the browser from proxmox and it's so great that's

19:02.480 --> 19:09.280
awesome i'm oh i've decided proxmox is going on the studio servers we put a pull out to the

19:09.280 --> 19:15.360
audience again and said what do you think of a proxmox with nick's combo probably some open

19:15.360 --> 19:20.720
suits in there too just to make the lizards happy and uh we're gonna have three systems and at least

19:20.720 --> 19:24.880
two of them are gonna be running proxmox gonna start with 7.2 out of the gate so we're gonna

19:24.880 --> 19:31.120
get this feature out of the gate proxmox is a great choice there's uh it's a debian user space

19:31.120 --> 19:36.960
with a modified ubuntu kernel which means that you get zfs support as well no dkms

19:36.960 --> 19:43.360
nonsense to mess around with it's just there and you get a nice little gooey on top to manage your

19:43.360 --> 19:49.200
vms i mean there's some other stuff too like they've got a pretty slick backup server and

19:49.200 --> 19:53.600
you know the community around proxmox is really starting to gather steam i've really noticed in

19:53.600 --> 19:59.360
the last i would say two to three years it's gone from being a kind of niche project it's

19:59.360 --> 20:04.640
it's really up and coming right now you know they've been consistent they've delivered over

20:04.640 --> 20:09.200
and over and over again with it and i think that makes a difference i've i've just seen their

20:09.200 --> 20:14.080
reputation get stronger and stronger you know if they're ever looking to sponsor hit us up

20:14.080 --> 20:19.120
we basically just gave them a pretty good plug right there for free huh i know they're good for

20:19.120 --> 20:22.400
a while aren't they one other thing i want to point out that i thought was pretty cool and this

20:22.400 --> 20:28.080
is a very minor annoyance but if you're a proxmox user you will appreciate it you can now send

20:28.080 --> 20:33.920
it you can now set your default vm id range so when you go and click the button that says create

20:33.920 --> 20:40.240
vm it normally assigns a three-digit number like 100 102 whatever and it'll just do it sequentially

20:40.240 --> 20:46.560
based on the next number that's available a bit like a dhcp reservation now i can select start

20:46.560 --> 20:53.840
that range and end that range of the auto kind of like vm id dhcp requests for one of a better idea

20:53.840 --> 20:59.440
i can select a range to put those numbers in and i can have my kind of normal vms sit at the top

20:59.440 --> 21:03.120
where i see them all the time and then my more ephemeral stuff sits at the bottom out of the way

21:03.120 --> 21:11.280
where i use it for testing linode.com slash ssh go there to get 100 and 60 day credit on a new account

21:11.280 --> 21:16.000
and you go there to support this here show that's right it's made possible by you taking advantage

21:16.000 --> 21:22.320
of our sponsor and of course linode is one that we enthusiastically endorse they started in 2003

21:22.320 --> 21:27.520
and they have been building the best service to run applications on linux since and you can also

21:27.520 --> 21:32.560
use as part of a multi-cloud strategy like i do this i have some servers on my lan and i have the

21:32.560 --> 21:37.680
bulk of all of our audience facing systems on linode and we also have some of our work systems

21:37.680 --> 21:41.440
on there too so i kind of pick and choose based on the workload and what i love about it is they've

21:41.440 --> 21:47.200
got pricing that makes that really accessible so some systems they start at just five dollars a

21:47.200 --> 21:52.800
month other systems they have a lot more options like amd epic processors we have one box that has

21:52.800 --> 21:59.520
96 gigs of ram right i mean you can really max this stuff out 48 cpu cores in that box mvme hard

21:59.520 --> 22:03.840
drives they're great and then of course they have 11 data centers for you to choose from so you're

22:03.840 --> 22:08.000
going to find something close to you or your customers don't know how you're doing it they've

22:08.000 --> 22:12.240
also got a great dashboard they got the best support in the business we hear that all the time

22:12.240 --> 22:15.680
the other thing that we hear from the audience all the time is that they'll deploy themselves

22:15.680 --> 22:21.200
a server for just like their family for like a gaming server or next cloud or photos or whatever

22:21.200 --> 22:25.520
it might be uh recently and i never really thought about doing this but recently i heard from an

22:25.520 --> 22:30.560
audience member he runs piehole up on linode and then he points all the systems to that even his

22:30.560 --> 22:35.280
laptop and stuff and his family member's laptop so when they're traveling they're always using his dns

22:35.280 --> 22:39.600
system and they're getting the filtering up on linode that's great and when you get a hundred

22:39.600 --> 22:44.320
dollars you can play around with stuff like that see what sticks see if the value is really there

22:44.320 --> 22:51.440
and it's a great way to support the show and learn something so go to linode.com slash ssh you go

22:51.440 --> 22:55.360
there you get that hundred dollars you go deploy something you go learn something you support the

22:55.360 --> 23:04.000
show it's a win-win linode.com slash ssh now after my buddy brent went home the other day

23:04.720 --> 23:11.280
i was sat in my basement by myself billy no mates we did a shot of my server just doing some

23:11.280 --> 23:15.360
tinkering around because we did some electrics down there and i wanted to automate uh something

23:15.360 --> 23:20.080
that we put in with one of the shellys in a light switch and i was sat next to my server

23:20.080 --> 23:29.840
and i could just hear oh no i was like oh no dead disk turns out it wasn't the cable people

23:30.640 --> 23:36.000
oh right last time you thought it was the cable oh no it really was going it really was the drive

23:36.000 --> 23:42.080
so quick trip to best buy the next morning bought a new 14 terabyte easy store ripped that bad boy

23:42.080 --> 23:48.960
out of the case and it's now in my backup server doing my whole like pre clear ritual testing

23:48.960 --> 23:55.200
burning thing no data loss no luckily i was able to just copy all the data from the failing drive

23:55.840 --> 24:01.920
onto the rest of my merger fs array i actually had more than 10 terabytes free so i was lucky

24:01.920 --> 24:06.160
there really i could do that i just removed it from the array and copied everything across with

24:06.160 --> 24:12.640
rsync what do you think it would take for a new file system to work its way into your life for you

24:12.640 --> 24:17.840
to find a new love for a file system um just say hypothetically like bcash fs comes out

24:17.840 --> 24:23.680
it's so great it's xfs meets butter fs meets cfs and it's just next level performance too

24:24.240 --> 24:28.000
what would it take for you to switch would it be would it be a matter of years would it be

24:28.000 --> 24:32.960
something you'd start experimenting with sooner than later i don't know as i have a need for

24:32.960 --> 24:39.600
anything new my needs through merger fs have been met so comprehensively back in the day that if you

24:39.600 --> 24:44.000
look at the perfect media server kind of blog post series you can kind of see my transition

24:44.000 --> 24:54.080
over the years from i think it was a ufs to mhd dfs to md raid through zfs even for actual media

24:54.080 --> 25:01.360
files and then i ended up with just ext4 and xfs on the drives themselves uh kind of bridged with

25:01.360 --> 25:07.200
merger fs on top it's just been so reliable for what six or seven years when i don't even know

25:07.200 --> 25:12.800
when i wrote that first post it was a long time ago i don't know like i felt the need to add zfs

25:12.800 --> 25:19.120
into the setup for data i truly care about mostly for replication ease and stuff like that but i've

25:19.120 --> 25:25.280
kind of solved that now with uh restic as well so i've got a couple of ways i back stuff up for the

25:25.280 --> 25:31.520
important data but for media files that are right once read a couple of times probably merger fs

25:31.520 --> 25:36.800
does everything i need what are you uh what are you hinting at there chris well so the word on

25:36.800 --> 25:40.880
the street although we'll see if this really pans out but the word on the street is that we're going

25:40.880 --> 25:46.160
to see bcash fs hit the linux kernel in about the next six months or so maybe a little bit longer

25:46.160 --> 25:52.720
but it's nigh and the developer kent overstreet recently said that his goal is to essentially

25:52.720 --> 25:59.200
make a file system that does just that it kind of replaces or it offers uh the advantages of xfs

25:59.200 --> 26:05.600
which xfs is a very solid very tried and true file system and with some of the benefits of butterfs

26:05.600 --> 26:11.120
like copy on write snapshots stuff like that that's pretty cool he was asked recently who's

26:11.120 --> 26:16.720
using bcash fs is anybody using it in production and he said well i do know that a lot of video

26:16.720 --> 26:23.280
shops that are dealing with multiple 4k streams are using bcash fs and it made me think like i

26:23.280 --> 26:29.360
think every time i've switched a major file system it's been to solve a performance problem or a

26:29.360 --> 26:36.240
scalability problem like i i really finally gave in and tried butterfs for real when i needed to

26:36.240 --> 26:41.840
solve storage issues on a raspberry pi and i just wasn't going to use the fs i had no choice so i

26:41.840 --> 26:46.640
had to learn butterfs and then i learned that i actually liked it quite a bit but i only did it

26:46.640 --> 26:52.240
when i was trying to solve like a new problem and i just wonder you know like bcash fs is going to

26:52.240 --> 26:58.400
come along one day it's going to be great no doubt about it but i i i'm kind of of the uh

26:59.040 --> 27:04.400
school of thought that when it comes to my data i like to give that stuff years you know years of

27:04.400 --> 27:08.320
cooking years of people other people using it in production that's just one area where i'll

27:08.320 --> 27:12.320
i'll kind of tap the brakes a little bit and that's why it took me a while to come around

27:12.320 --> 27:17.040
about our fest to be honest that's really what i love about the zfs i know it has a bit of a

27:17.040 --> 27:24.000
learning curve and a bit of an aura around it but are you laughing an aura i think a bit of an aura

27:24.000 --> 27:29.120
is a funny way to put it yeah it does i mean just listen to you and alan back in the day on text

27:29.120 --> 27:33.680
snap like you made it sound like this massive complex beast and actually it's not it's just

27:33.680 --> 27:40.080
two drives in a mirror right i mean it's that's it that's what i use anyway yeah it does it can

27:40.080 --> 27:46.400
be very complex but yeah um that's not so bad really so i'm glad that you got it found i'm

27:46.400 --> 27:50.480
sorry there was actually the drive and not the cable though that does stink well so this presents

27:50.480 --> 27:55.840
an interesting opportunity for content actually so this will be the first shut drive i've had fail

27:55.840 --> 28:00.960
on me i don't have the plastic casing anymore i chucked that out as a matter of principle

28:00.960 --> 28:05.760
so i'm really interested to see what happens when i send this 12 terabyte drive which is only about

28:05.760 --> 28:10.800
15 months old back to western digital it came with a two-year warranty and there's apparently

28:10.800 --> 28:15.600
something called the magnuson moss act i think that's what it is if they try and play funny

28:15.600 --> 28:20.000
buggers with it i can quote them and say that and apparently then they'll just capitulate and send

28:20.000 --> 28:25.600
me their replacement reconditioned drive because they can't prove that my shucking it broke it or

28:25.600 --> 28:31.600
something let's talk a little ansible one of our favorite topics here and i think maybe one we

28:31.600 --> 28:36.640
should should probably share a little more on the show as brent begins his journey down the ansible

28:36.640 --> 28:42.560
lane but in the meantime before we go down ansible lane maybe we should stop off uh on uh bit warden

28:42.560 --> 28:47.440
drive what do you got here what about if i put some peanut butter with the chocolate yeah that

28:47.440 --> 28:52.720
sounds perfect for me and bring ansible together with bit warden how about that right that sounds

28:52.720 --> 28:59.920
good actually there was a chat happening on discord i think it was this morning where orange uh jake

28:59.920 --> 29:05.840
who was on the show a little while ago was talking about how he uses ansible vault crossed with bit

29:05.840 --> 29:12.800
warden there is a reference to one of my favorite bash.org moments where the part his demo password

29:12.800 --> 29:19.600
is hunter 2 those that know know about that one and but essentially what this allows me to do

29:19.600 --> 29:27.520
is use bit warden as my credential store for my ansible vault encryption password so all of my

29:27.520 --> 29:34.160
secrets remain encrypted using ansible vault with 256 bit blah blah blah as a file that i store

29:34.160 --> 29:39.280
version controlled in git what i'm doing now is rather than having a clear text file sitting on

29:39.280 --> 29:47.200
disk to decrypt that file i am now using the bit warden cli to connect the vault password that i've

29:47.200 --> 29:54.480
now put in bit warden to unlock that uh encrypted file in ansible this feels like it could be pretty

29:54.480 --> 29:59.840
powerful i think i'm understanding but um so essentially as ansible is setting up a machine

29:59.840 --> 30:05.680
if it needs to deploy software that needs some sort of secret password or key instead of having

30:05.680 --> 30:11.680
to put that somewhere in the ansible config or whatever there's now an option to have as ansible

30:11.680 --> 30:17.840
is deploying use the bit warden cli to look that password up and sort of insert that password as

30:17.840 --> 30:23.040
it's being deployed is that right you could do that using the lookup plugin i think but the way

30:23.040 --> 30:28.240
that we're doing it right now at least is using a so you can actually this is a really neat trick

30:28.240 --> 30:36.320
that i didn't know until this morning you can put in your ansible config the vault file location as

30:36.320 --> 30:43.520
a script and in that script you can actually have it do the bit warden cli export lookup thing of

30:43.520 --> 30:50.000
the password and then it returns it as a string which then feeds into the the rest of the process

30:50.560 --> 30:55.200
so all i'm doing i haven't moved any of the secrets themselves out of ansible out of the

30:55.200 --> 31:01.520
vault in ansible but i've moved the vault password from a local text file on my laptop

31:01.520 --> 31:08.720
into bit warden and now i've connected the two together using oranges post very nice we'll have

31:08.720 --> 31:12.720
links to this so you can follow along we'll have links to this in the show notes of course at

31:12.720 --> 31:17.520
self-hosted dot show slash 71 i thought it'd be really difficult but it turned out to be about

31:17.520 --> 31:22.720
a five or ten line change there'll be a commit in the show notes if you're curious as just to

31:22.720 --> 31:31.680
how easy it is easier than getting the recipe app going much easier uh we love you tandoor we love

31:31.680 --> 31:35.760
you we've been having a lot of fun on the discord over the last couple of weeks with ansible and

31:35.760 --> 31:40.720
infrastructures code talk as you can probably tell from how much of it's in the show one of

31:40.720 --> 31:47.360
the things i decided to do when brent was here he just flippantly asked me can you do dns from your

31:47.360 --> 31:53.040
docker compose generator and i was like sure knowing full well i couldn't but how hard could

31:53.040 --> 31:59.520
it be right turned out to be quite the operation it took me about two or three days with the help

31:59.520 --> 32:06.080
of about four or five people on discord to write possibly one of the most i dare i say over

32:06.080 --> 32:12.640
engineered ansible tasks ever this thing essentially takes a traffic label strips out

32:12.640 --> 32:20.000
strips out with regex a bunch of stuff surrounding the bit of data i want which is you know the host

32:20.000 --> 32:26.080
name of like test.jupyterbroadcasting.com that's the bit i actually want but i had to find a way

32:26.080 --> 32:32.240
to iterate over all the labels in the nested list that i have in ansible and then extract them and

32:32.240 --> 32:40.000
do what i need to do and then only act on them when the item in the list was set to active equals

32:40.000 --> 32:47.120
true there's a lot of logic in there anyway the upshot is we can now specify for all of the

32:47.120 --> 32:55.680
self-hosted jb infrastructure simply by adding a container with a traffic label into our compose

32:55.680 --> 33:04.800
definition file we add the dns record automatically into cloudflare hmm that is pretty damn slick so

33:04.800 --> 33:10.000
just by having the label for traffic yeah it figures out from there what the what the host

33:10.000 --> 33:15.600
name should be and all of that absolutely yeah that's it and what's particularly fun is you know

33:15.600 --> 33:20.560
let's say i wanted to spin up an nginx just to test for example i just copy and paste that in there

33:20.560 --> 33:25.360
and if i put test. as long as the domain's in my cloudflare account or i have permissions like

33:25.360 --> 33:31.440
you've given me yeah delegated permissions on jb.com i can add something into that git repo

33:31.440 --> 33:36.560
and we could then theoretically have a continuous integration github action that would pick up that

33:36.560 --> 33:42.480
change and deploy that new container and also the dns records in cloudflare automatically for us

33:44.480 --> 33:48.960
that's what i'm talking about alex that is awesome it's really cool that is awesome and

33:48.960 --> 33:55.600
that is such a great example of we recently were talking about nix and nix packages and managing

33:55.600 --> 34:01.600
nix os and all of that being a deterministic system and how it compared to ansible and this

34:01.600 --> 34:05.200
is such a great example where you can go much further with ansible you can go much beyond just

34:05.920 --> 34:11.200
just what you can do with nix very exciting and it makes me pumped to kind of redo some of this

34:11.200 --> 34:17.440
infrastructure stuff and do it like this from the beginning because like down the road it's

34:17.440 --> 34:22.640
just going to make future deployments so much simpler right that's that's really when you spin

34:22.640 --> 34:28.400
up a new show or decide you're going to have a garage sale or whatever it is it's all automatic

34:28.400 --> 34:35.600
that's so great yeah and done once and now it's done one of my favorite tricks in this particular

34:35.600 --> 34:42.480
task and there are a couple one is to use json query to create a dictionary that i can then

34:43.200 --> 34:49.680
split and join and what have you within the task itself the other one is to use what's called a

34:49.680 --> 34:56.800
ternary operator now ginger which is the templating language that ansible has is is pretty amazing and

34:56.800 --> 35:02.720
you can do a lot of cool stuff but i was running into an issue where my item dot active contents

35:02.720 --> 35:09.440
was either true or false and the ansible module was expecting the phrase present or absent now

35:09.440 --> 35:15.120
you as a human can work out that true equals present and the absent equals false computer

35:15.120 --> 35:21.120
is stupid you have to tell computer this thing turns out with the ternary operator we can actually do

35:21.120 --> 35:27.280
that so if we pass in a true or false statement into the ternary operator and then specify just

35:27.280 --> 35:32.960
a couple of other values present and absent in this case we can have true or false actually be

35:32.960 --> 35:41.760
any other string that we require very simple very cool tailscale.com slash self hosted go there to

35:41.760 --> 35:48.160
get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and you support the show tailscale is a zero config

35:48.160 --> 35:53.200
vpn you get it on any device in minutes it'll manage your firewall rules it'll help with

35:53.200 --> 35:59.920
double carrier grade crazy nat all of that i'm using tailscale right now in fact alex and i

35:59.920 --> 36:04.320
were using tailscale earlier today as well in a way that i haven't really used it before tell

36:04.320 --> 36:07.840
me about the fanciness that we were doing share share it with the people actually well i span up

36:07.840 --> 36:12.640
tandoor on my lan and i thought it'd be pretty cool if i could just share this demo instance

36:12.640 --> 36:17.200
with chris because you're having some issues with their public demo so i went into my tailscale

36:17.200 --> 36:23.760
dashboard and i click sharing settings got a link to share one of my specific hosts my docker host

36:23.760 --> 36:29.200
with you you accept a couple of things in your tailscale dashboard on your end straight away

36:29.200 --> 36:34.880
you've got access just to that specific host but you could also use it as an exit node as well so

36:34.880 --> 36:41.760
let's say you have a friend geographically in a useful place for you you could ask that friend

36:41.760 --> 36:47.360
to share just that vm or whatever it is and you won't have access to the rest of that person's lan

36:47.920 --> 36:53.520
only to that specific host and only as an exit node if they permit it yep it is a superpower

36:53.520 --> 36:59.440
and it's something that just makes collaborating with people so great and the way tailscale works

36:59.440 --> 37:05.360
is it uses wire guard's noise protocol to create a flat mesh network between all of your machines

37:05.360 --> 37:10.320
and if you've got two machines on the same lan and you're talking to their tailscale ips

37:10.320 --> 37:14.000
it figures that out and it actually will just go over your lan it doesn't like need to go through

37:14.000 --> 37:19.440
some central proxy or anything like that they have a authorization backplane that they use to

37:19.440 --> 37:23.040
proxy the connection to set everybody up to get them established but then you're talking directly

37:23.040 --> 37:28.320
to each other after that they also work with your single sign-on provider which means they also

37:28.320 --> 37:32.320
support two-factor if you've got that going you got to go try tailscale because once you have it

37:32.320 --> 37:39.280
set up in a couple of minutes you've got an always on vpn protected by wire card it's so slick and

37:39.280 --> 37:44.800
i've got it running now on my family's machines as well as my raspberry pi's my servers my vms

37:44.800 --> 37:50.960
it brings it all together and you can try it for yourself for free for up to 20 machines at tailscale

37:50.960 --> 37:55.440
dot com slash self-hosted that's where you got to go to support the show and try it out for 20

37:55.440 --> 38:03.840
machines for totally free at tailscale dot com slash self-hosted scott writes in looking for

38:03.840 --> 38:09.760
chip shortage alternatives with this continuing on through the foreseeable future and raspberry

38:09.760 --> 38:15.440
pi's becoming the new unobtainium i would like to hear some ideas from you both as to what to look

38:15.440 --> 38:20.960
for in alternatives i'd also love to hear from other insiders what they're using through feedback

38:20.960 --> 38:25.760
of their own specifically this is a problem for me since i like having dedicated systems for

38:25.760 --> 38:33.360
certain tasks for example a pie hole is a dedicated appliance for me and i want my dns to be reliable

38:33.360 --> 38:37.120
i just want stuff to work with minimal administration i've got loads of other

38:37.120 --> 38:42.320
hobbies and i don't want to spend all my free time being my own it admin as they're always

38:42.320 --> 38:48.560
overworked underpaid and usually grumpy after business hours can relate scott can relate

38:48.560 --> 38:52.640
he may be right about that got to admit you know scott the first thing that came to mind for me

38:53.280 --> 38:59.440
and this is something that i've already done once is low power cheap used laptops on ebay

39:00.160 --> 39:06.000
often they have more horsepower than a raspberry pi some of them even have features like quicksync

39:06.000 --> 39:10.320
so they make it great for plex the only real challenges that i've run into and why i haven't

39:10.320 --> 39:17.280
really talked about it a lot on air is because i'm almost always hitting some kind of ios limited

39:17.280 --> 39:22.880
some kind of ios limitation that just drives me crazy maybe it's usb or ethernet or something

39:22.880 --> 39:28.080
like that but depending on what your needs are like if you get if you could find a laptop

39:28.080 --> 39:32.160
like some of these thinkpads that support two discs and maybe you're okay with just that amount

39:32.160 --> 39:36.800
of storage you can actually make a laptop work pretty well in place of a raspberry pi what do

39:36.800 --> 39:41.120
you think alex you got any ideas well something like an old thinkpad you can have pretty cheap

39:41.120 --> 39:49.600
like i've just had a quick look now t450 which is fifth gen intel 100 140 depending on the spec and

39:49.600 --> 39:53.760
how much ram and disk and have what have you that's in there but we've also been talking

39:53.760 --> 39:59.920
about this on the discord a fair bit recently with the uh like tiny mini micro stuff that kind

39:59.920 --> 40:04.720
of stuff like um serve the home i've been doing a whole series on this stuff now they typically

40:04.720 --> 40:10.320
buy the higher end stuff the newer stuff or they get sent it anyway we've been talking about the

40:10.320 --> 40:14.880
kind of the lower end of that market there are some old thin client boxes that have been knocking

40:14.880 --> 40:23.440
around for a long time i i think it's is it wise spelt w y s e these guys uh they do thin clients

40:23.440 --> 40:28.960
for enterprise so they they've got boxes knocking around by the thousand and you can get them super

40:28.960 --> 40:34.880
cheap on ebay and often they've got ethernet built in and usb depending on the model you go

40:34.880 --> 40:39.040
for you might be lucky to get one with some sata space in there you know maybe you could have a

40:39.040 --> 40:45.360
sata ssd in there or an m.2 if you get really lucky uh so that's the i'd probably go yeah we

40:45.360 --> 40:50.240
looked at a couple of those recently and um those could be really awesome too for low power i think

40:50.240 --> 40:54.960
like the biggest bottleneck there was memory on those units like they're usually pretty but

40:54.960 --> 40:58.800
depending again what you're doing that might not be that might not be an issue just kind of depends

40:58.800 --> 41:04.720
on your workload these wise boxes are about the size of two or three cd cases maybe so they're

41:04.720 --> 41:12.400
very very small and they're very very cheap they can be had for as low as 15 20 something like that

41:12.400 --> 41:17.280
some of them don't include memory at that kind of price but some of them do and they're x86 they're

41:17.280 --> 41:23.440
atoms right i mean they're you could just run anything some are atom some are amd all right

41:23.440 --> 41:27.760
well oliver writes in he says hi guys thanks for the show i've been listening from the beginning

41:27.760 --> 41:32.960
and i've learned a lot i've been struggling to find a great self-hosted podcast solution for a

41:32.960 --> 41:38.400
while now audiobook shelf has recently blown up and it's been really actively developed and the

41:38.400 --> 41:44.560
podcast feature is probably the most excited i've been for a self-host application for a long time

41:44.560 --> 41:48.240
but there's still some work to be done it's amazing what's been accomplished already though

41:48.240 --> 41:53.760
it's now my primary podcast listening app i wonder alex have you played it all with podcast and

41:53.760 --> 41:58.640
audiobook shelf i've still got it spun up from the episode we talked about it a couple of weeks ago

41:58.640 --> 42:05.200
did you try a podcast in there i haven't done any podcasts but we could do a live we could

42:05.200 --> 42:12.400
do a live test right now if you like oh all right let's oh that's exciting i know this is a common

42:12.400 --> 42:18.160
question that comes into the show is hey how can i can i self-host my own podcast and i never really

42:18.160 --> 42:24.080
feel like we have a super great answer because i think a great aspect of podcasts in my opinion

42:24.080 --> 42:29.760
is that now i know not everybody does it this way but for me is that the mp3 file is actually locally

42:29.760 --> 42:36.240
on the storage device of my phone and so i can listen to a podcast without using data or when i

42:36.240 --> 42:41.840
don't have signal or when i just don't want to use much battery life either and so i really like

42:41.840 --> 42:48.240
having podcasts locally on my phone so that's why i've ended up trying to use podcast apps at sync

42:48.240 --> 42:54.560
but i yeah i don't love any of it i found it so i have to create a new library so i've just added

42:54.560 --> 43:00.960
a new folder to my um audiobook shelf container so i'm going to have a dedicated podcasts folder

43:00.960 --> 43:07.280
okay that container is now spun up so i'm going to just load up audiobook shelf add a new library

43:08.320 --> 43:14.400
select podcasts from the list i've got to give it the correct icon that's very important now

43:14.400 --> 43:21.040
interestingly enough the metadata provider is itunes so even though it's a self-hosted podcast

43:21.040 --> 43:29.520
um server for want of a better word still using uh internet-based metadata that's a real shame

43:29.520 --> 43:33.760
you know they could be using the podcast index and they could also use pod ping and they wouldn't

43:33.760 --> 43:39.200
even need to use the index that's a bit of a shame oh i see so i can have a oh i can put an rss feed

43:39.200 --> 43:47.120
in there all right so where's the self-hosted rss feed self-hosted.show rss rss yep it's real simple

43:47.120 --> 43:51.840
all right let's put that in there let's see what happens when i click submit oh that's pretty cool

43:51.840 --> 43:57.040
it's found the album art it's got the genres correct it's got the description auto download

43:57.040 --> 44:04.880
episodes check add podcast all right hmm let's see what happens all right all right that doesn't

44:04.880 --> 44:10.400
seem too bad i gotta be honest okay this is pretty great yeah this is the this is the way you know

44:10.400 --> 44:15.360
you're just saying you don't have a great way this is it i think anyway okay all right all right

44:15.360 --> 44:20.160
maybe we got to give this more serious go then because this would be nice to just have a solution

44:20.160 --> 44:25.440
for people because they're writing all the time okay thanks oliver i'm gonna gonna try that out

44:25.440 --> 44:31.760
i think that'll be pretty great we got some boost into the show first one came from x thumb sx who

44:31.760 --> 44:38.320
sent us a boost using a new podcast app 5000 sats he mentions that there are silicon wedding bands

44:38.320 --> 44:42.640
that solve the issue of like uh i think we were talking about getting them in the cases or getting

44:42.640 --> 44:47.360
them uh you know problems with working with electricity he says this is also great when

44:47.360 --> 44:52.000
installing smart devices they don't dig into your finger when gripping tools or sports equipment

44:52.720 --> 44:59.680
that's pretty awesome i didn't realize they made silicone wedding rings i'm such an idiot

44:59.680 --> 45:04.480
i never even checked you know it's not something that occurred to me i just took mine off and

45:04.480 --> 45:12.000
didn't think about it yeah cosp land sent us a boost for 3690 sats he always comes he always

45:12.000 --> 45:17.600
sends us in like numbers that i think mean something and he says yes the numbers are tesla

45:17.600 --> 45:24.560
numbers and he also wants to know if we have any sue servers do you have any sue servers i do not

45:24.560 --> 45:31.360
hmm all right i didn't think so not surprising really uh i have uh one in production and i have

45:31.360 --> 45:39.760
one on a on a raspberry pi cm4 so not a lot but i have some for 500 sats gin for matique writes in

45:39.760 --> 45:45.280
hi chris i just stumbled upon a french blog discussing about podcasting 2.0 the article

45:45.280 --> 45:50.880
is translated to english and here's what they did as podcast lovers for over two decades we have

45:50.880 --> 46:02.640
founded ad auras a u r e s a ruse a ruse yeah my french pronunciation is uh poo poo shall we say

46:02.640 --> 46:06.960
anyway they're aiming to build a fair and sustainable ecosystem for everyone in the

46:06.960 --> 46:13.120
podcasting industry they've developed castopod a free and open source solution

46:13.120 --> 46:19.280
for hosting your podcasts in order to facilitate access to podcasting 2.0 for everybody yeah

46:19.280 --> 46:24.880
castapods actually pretty neat there's a there's another one out there too that's being created

46:24.880 --> 46:30.480
and they're supporting all of the podcasting 2.0 spec out of the gate which means things like the

46:30.480 --> 46:37.920
alternative enclosure tag transcripts uh clips and um things like that and the idea is is that

46:37.920 --> 46:41.600
you could just kind of use their out of the box solution i mean if you're looking to start a

46:41.600 --> 46:49.040
podcast right now and you want something that's kind of like an all-in-one back end package like

46:49.040 --> 46:57.280
a hosted fireside that's what castapod is and i've looked at it because it is enticing it'll

46:57.280 --> 47:01.680
support clips it'll generate video clips and it supports the podcasting 2.0 namespace stuff for

47:01.680 --> 47:06.720
that it does the value for value stuff so you can do boosts and it supports the transcript stuff

47:06.720 --> 47:12.240
there's a lot in that spec and they're one of the like premiere places that are supporting it so

47:12.240 --> 47:16.400
that's pretty cool i haven't tried it myself because we're already you know we already have

47:16.400 --> 47:21.200
a whole system built out but if i were starting today and i didn't have anything i'd be pretty

47:21.200 --> 47:29.120
tempted to try castapod i have to say toxic safety 89 wrote in two days ago with 3333 sats i feel

47:29.120 --> 47:33.920
like that's a lucky number all threes that's got to be a lucky number thing i swear to god

47:33.920 --> 47:39.600
my alexa and siri are getting worse and worse at understanding me i love the home pods like you

47:39.600 --> 47:45.040
chris but it's a 50 50 hit rate these days do you guys have these problems is there anything better

47:45.040 --> 47:51.680
out there well i can't tell you the number of times i have to put on a very bad american accent

47:51.680 --> 47:56.480
in order to make my google home understand me oh really it is have you tried changing the voice to

47:56.480 --> 48:01.120
the british voice i have in fact when brent was here we had a good giggle because we were doing

48:01.120 --> 48:06.400
some youtube searches and i searched for something like tool danny carey drumming videos or something

48:06.400 --> 48:12.880
and it came up with something completely random and i was like cool drumming danny carey videos

48:12.880 --> 48:18.720
and it just worked first time so that's your american that's so great yeah it is say what

48:18.720 --> 48:25.040
you will but that's my american accent what of it bro i have to be honest i feel like the echo the

48:25.040 --> 48:32.880
amazon devices their hit rate for me remains the same but their annoyance rate has skyrocketed so

48:32.880 --> 48:38.000
i don't have any echoes in the rv where i'm at now and i don't have any anywhere else except for in

48:38.000 --> 48:45.280
one spot and that is in the studio proper like the main studio the jb one studio where i'm

48:45.280 --> 48:50.480
live streaming anyways i don't care if there's an echo in there and that thing is inserting ads and

48:50.480 --> 48:56.400
by the ways and did you knows and would you like all the time now it's so frustrating that i've

48:56.400 --> 49:02.000
stopped using it by the way did you know you can ask for groceries in nine different languages

49:02.560 --> 49:07.120
yeah okay great cool it's not what i asked for and then on the flip side with the home pods

49:07.120 --> 49:12.640
which i too you know i like them i like them like you toxic but the thing is i swear to god

49:12.640 --> 49:17.280
they're getting stupider i agree with you like i i don't know what it is but the hit rate is so

49:17.280 --> 49:24.080
bad these days that i stop i enunciate really clearly i speak directly at it and it used to

49:24.080 --> 49:30.320
be one when i i swear when i got the home pods and set them up i could just bark into the air

49:30.320 --> 49:34.880
no matter what noise was going on and they would hear me and it was such a neat parlor trick i

49:34.880 --> 49:39.040
would show it to people like we could have it super loud in here and i would say something

49:39.040 --> 49:45.200
quietly to the home pod and it would still hear me and everybody was so impressed and now i would

49:45.200 --> 49:51.520
never dare doing that i i swear it's gotten worse so um i'm in the same boat as you toxic if anybody

49:51.520 --> 49:56.960
out there is using another system besides one of these commercial systems that are doing a cloud

49:56.960 --> 50:01.040
dictation and all of that please let me know how it's working for you and if the hit rates are any

50:01.040 --> 50:07.840
better real time feedback in the discord one of our australian buddies tells me that almond and

50:07.840 --> 50:13.360
ada powered by home assistant are some good alternatives so maybe we should give those a go

50:13.360 --> 50:17.760
but how how accurate like that i hear that i don't know but how are the hit rates compared to

50:17.760 --> 50:21.920
the commercial ones that's what is it is it a downgrade because when you're the dad and you've

50:21.920 --> 50:26.560
deployed all this stuff and then your family goes to use it and it fails them you always i take it

50:26.560 --> 50:31.440
