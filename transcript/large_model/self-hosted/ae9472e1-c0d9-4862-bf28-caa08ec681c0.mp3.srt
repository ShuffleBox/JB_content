1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Know this is gonna seem like a dumb question, but do you have rats in North Carolina?

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,200
Not that I've seen but I imagine so. I don't really know

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,980
I don't know what like the rat territory is, but I do know they are in the Pacific Northwest and some RVs fall victim

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,040
To rats. It's like disastrous. Are these the culprits for the footprints on your suspension?

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:29,160
No that I think was a raccoon, but I'm thinking like critters are a problem, you know here in the Pacific Northwest

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,480
Mm-hmm. So I I ordered a suite of

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,480
these really high-powered

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,000
outdoor

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,920
Noisemakers that just they're hypersonic frequencies

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,640
But I think they kind of sound like birds to the critters like Bert hungry birds and they flash lights and all this kind of stuff

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,700
But they're just so loud that they I think they also bothered Levi and so I thought here's what I'm gonna do

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
There's a home assistant solution for this. I

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,880
Got I got myself a series of outdoor z-wave smart plugs and a couple of indoor ones

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,280
I'll have links in the show notes

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,680
and I set these up so that when we leave the

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,960
Noisemakers automatically turn on and then when we arrive back they automatically turn off and that way we don't worry about bothering our dog Levi and

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,280
You know, I'm not getting blasted myself with ultrasonic noise, I guess

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,340
That's great. I mean, I remember as a teenager. They used to play in the shopping center near me

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,800
I suppose you call them a mall here. Don't you the shopping mall? They used to have these high-pitched kind of

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,400
Things used to go them back up and down and to this day

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,560
I think I can still hear quite a lot of high frequencies considering how old I am. They just drive me crazy

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,760
There's a house across the road that has one for the deer that run through our neighborhood. Oh, yeah

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,620
For deer, huh? Yeah, I mean I assume that's what it's for. Yeah, I've seen I've seen him for deer on the front of cars

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,800
yeah, I can feel like a

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,040
Like a real weird pressure on my ears, but I don't hear anything

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,000
But then it has like this test mode that puts it into human hearing and it is it's loud and you can hear it

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,960
Yeah, yeah, so I thought okay. Let's just turn those suckers off, but I don't want to remember

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,280
I don't want to have to you know, think about it

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,400
I want to just be sitting I would be home and have leave I get a headache all of a sudden

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,440
So I thought let's do it based on location. Why keep a dog and bark yourself. Yeah

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,160
So far so good

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,880
Absolutely. Now should we talk about the hoopla with Spotify this week and Neil Young? I think it is a fascinating topic

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,720
Well, there is a self-hosting angle. I think at least that's where my mind went immediately

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,640
Yes, if you have these tracks yourself, they can't pull them from your library

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,140
I mean, that's the first obvious statement, but I think it's bigger than that even that's just it

36
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,280
we're streaming in general and I suppose we'll get to the

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,400
specifics of

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,680
How we're handling this in a minute, but these my general issue is streaming services

39
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,040
is that you know, we've seen it with time and time again with

40
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,160
Netflix and now with Spotify and countless other services where there is a catalog of content, you know

41
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Whether it's friends whether it's Neil Young

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,160
That is there one day and gone the next in fact

43
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,320
There are entire websites dedicated to what's going off of Netflix this month

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,280
Now the story that we're talking about here is Neil Young obviously a very famous

45
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,020
Hugely famous artist in the music world issued Spotify an ultimatum over Joe Rogan

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Which always seemed like a risky move as soon as I saw that because you got to figure

47
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,120
Spotify gets a few thousand plays off of

48
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,800
Neil but gets

49
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,320
Millions and and Joe Rogan not only drives millions of listens

50
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,320
But Joe Rogan is like the linchpin of their entire podcast advertising business. He is their strategy now

51
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:47,440
Now I don't recall how much they paid for his show, but it was something stupid like a hundred million dollars or something ridiculous like that

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,280
and it's worse than that actually if we think about it and Neil Young a

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,520
Stream of music. It doesn't matter if it's Neil or the Foo Fighters or I don't know Lady Gaga

54
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,800
Whoever it is a stream of a song costs Spotify a fraction of a penny

55
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
per stream, right a

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,800
A stream or a listen of a podcast episode generates revenue

57
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
so who is Spotify

58
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,440
incentivized to a side with and

59
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,920
Be promote, you know, yeah, and it really underscores this issue of not your library

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,840
It's theirs and what you get access to is subject to change that drives me crazy

61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,580
But you're also just sort of a victim of these big corporate games that are getting played

62
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,100
Right. It's at the end of the day. They don't care about the customers at all. It's it's ego fighting ego

63
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:48,260
It's company fighting company and we're just kind of left in between or you like another example of this which just drives me crazy

64
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
you see something like

65
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,860
Paramount decides they want to launch their own streaming service. So now there's no longer gonna be Star Trek on Netflix even though

66
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:05,020
Having Star Trek on Netflix long term is better for the franchise because it means more people discover and binge Star Trek

67
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:12,340
But they want to have exclusives. They want to have stuff just on their platform. And so they're pulling it off of Netflix now

68
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:19,620
And I say this not even kidding. I signed up for Netflix for Star Trek back in the day when it was DVDs

69
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,180
You know, I mean I wasn't customer number one

70
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:28,340
but I may have been like customer number a hundred like I was really early in the Netflix as soon as they went public because I

71
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,520
Wanted to get Star Trek on DVD because I had this aging VHS collection

72
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,940
I mean I signed up for Spotify the very first time when I was doing my

73
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,820
Music undergraduate degree. So that would have been oh, yeah

74
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,620
2008 9 something like that

75
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:51,460
Because they had a fantastic classical music library as a music student. That was obviously very important to me at the chair. Sure

76
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,100
Music's been a huge part of my life. Anyway, for those that don't know I play several instruments drums guitar

77
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,860
Euphonium which is another one that I play which most people probably don't know what it is

78
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,740
But it's a brass instrument like a tuba. It sounds like we need to get some sound hits for the shows

79
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,900
Let's get going. There is actually a very embarrassing video on YouTube of me playing the euphonium from that time period

80
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,020
If you look hard enough, I'm sure you'll find

81
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,100
There will not be a link to it in the show notes because it's very embarrassing

82
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,360
But anyway, my point is is I've been a subscriber now Spotify for a decade plus, you know

83
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,840
So what is it 10 pounds a month 15 dollars a month? I don't know. I'm part of the family plan now

84
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,120
So, you know over 10 years I've spent a thousand ish

85
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,440
Maybe more maybe a bit less with Spotify and I think this has really got me

86
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,440
Questioning whether I continue to give Spotify specifically my money

87
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm a little annoyed that this is what's getting people to unsubscribe. I unsubscribed at the end of last year

88
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,920
because

89
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,720
What they're trying to do to podcasting would forever change this industry what they want to do is

90
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:08,180
They want to bring everyone onto their platform and kind of create exclusive content that they can insert

91
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,740
dynamic ads and

92
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,540
They're okay

93
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,240
if you distribute it on a feed to in some cases but a

94
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,420
Really super abbreviated version of this story because I've told it before on air is right after JB went independent again. I

95
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,920
Got an email from someone at anchor

96
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,760
Anchor is owned by Spotify. It's part of their podcasting arm

97
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,960
Offering me to bring the JB Network exclusively to Spotify. They would sell ads

98
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,800
They would take over all the ad deals and do digital inserts

99
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,140
They were saying it is essentially going to be a 70% pay cut in ads

100
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,440
but

101
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,080
Every show would be sold and they would insert them dynamically and to sweeten the deal if I went exclusive

102
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,360
They were going to let me play any any song in the Spotify library in the shows

103
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,520
So all of our shows would have access to the entire Spotify library, which was the one part of the email where I went

104
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,000
Whoa, like you could create entire new kinds of podcasts if you had access to that commercial library

105
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,160
That is a pretty cool hook and I'm not the only one they were sending that that too

106
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,480
I was one of I was part of a net that they were casting and

107
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,560
The whole thing was based around their whole well like you're we're just gonna take over your ad

108
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,560
It's gonna take over the ads and we just cut them in like they would just they have a little thing that just waits

109
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,960
For like, you know half a second of silence

110
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,700
Right in the middle of a sentence and then it just cuts in an ad and if it's on an open feed

111
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,840
Then you can't you don't get to access the Spotify music library

112
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,120
At least that was the terms that were given to me and that's their goal, right?

113
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,000
They want to they want to be the YouTube or Netflix of podcasting. And so that's why I ultimately

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,440
Unsubscribed and that's why I've begun promoting the podcast index at podcast index org and podcasting 2.0

115
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,400
and the new podcasts apps comm and value for value lightning payments to the to the shows via these apps because

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,800
We have to embrace decentralized solutions that you can host yourself

117
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,240
In the podcast industry like as podcasters that are technically capable of it

118
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,840
It's something I've had to double down on and that's why I cancelled Spotify because they're trying to wreck an industry

119
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,800
But I am glad to see more people realizing that they have issues

120
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,620
We didn't actually cover the reason why Neil issued an ultimatum, which was in his opinion

121
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,420
Joe Rogan was spreading the kovat misinformation

122
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,720
Anti-vax stuff, you know stuff like that

123
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,160
And so for me as a triple vaxed guy, I just think come on

124
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,700
How are we not past this kind of nonsense yet? Just yeah do the right thing for society, you know

125
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
I also

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,380
You know, I also can't imagine but maybe I imagine it does happen

127
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,360
People aren't seriously taking medical advice from Joe Rogan, but I imagine it does but you'd be surprised. Yeah

128
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,760
So that whole thing, you know in this it could be a Joe Rogan thing. I mean it really

129
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:05,560
Fast forward five years. There will be some other big thing. That's like this huge existential crisis that all of us are freaking out about and

130
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,520
You know Spotify again could make a decision where it's once again screwing the customers in some way

131
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,160
Like there wasn't really a great scenario for them. They couldn't get rid of Joe

132
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,400
You know, so there wasn't a great scenario

133
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,160
But it just highlights this core issue that I think this show can address so well

134
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,160
And I think the music one is one that we should probably readdress

135
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,120
Because we've each kind of changed earth or at least evolved our thoughts on it a little bit. Yeah, so I haven't pirated

136
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,520
In fact, I haven't mentioned piracy on this show at all

137
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,400
very very deliberately because I think it's an angle of self-hosting that is very well covered elsewhere and I

138
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,000
Really don't want to get into it on this show

139
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,480
But I think times like this kind of highlight the importance of owning or having your own stuff

140
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:51,680
Truly the importance of having a local copy that nobody can delete from your hard drive or whatever

141
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
It is if you actually care about it, I suppose

142
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,380
And so what I've done is I've been using a tool called lidar

143
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,780
Recently and I haven't been pirating music in the traditional sense. So I've still been paying some money

144
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,420
So I found a plug-in called automatic music downloader

145
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,460
There'll be a link in the show notes, which is a script which plugs into lidar

146
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,660
but it also plugs into something called Deezer which is a competitor to Apple music and

147
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,740
Spotify and Deezer Hi-Fi is a $15 a month

148
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:27,460
Subscription for lossless audio. And so for me as a music nerd audiophile self-confessed

149
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:33,220
You know, I have some lovely floor-standing speakers and expensive headphones all the rest of it. I like lossless audio

150
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,980
I can hear the difference. I've done a B testing. I just I like it. Okay, and so for me

151
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,420
I want to be able to have a local copy of

152
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:47,620
All that music that I listen to pretty much the same stuff over and over again on Spotify

153
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:55,260
Anyway, locally and so for me this walks this whole setup walks a fine line between piracy and kind of not

154
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,140
I mean, I'm sure it's against their terms of service to do this

155
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:04,060
But I'm still paying money to Deezer and therefore I assume that each download counts as a play

156
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,140
So the artist still gets some recognition as well

157
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,660
So what do you think on that?

158
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,160
Yeah, I think this I think you've really hit the sweet spot, you know because you want something

159
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,320
That's gonna tie in with whatever management system

160
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,340
You've chosen to use right like anything else you bought would be an app with a store that's integrated

161
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
you want something that's almost like

162
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,840
Music as a service via an API and that's kind of basically what you've built here. Oh

163
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,400
Man, this is great

164
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,660
I think if I could pay a dollar an album or maybe even maybe even a bit more to be honest with you and there

165
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,660
Was a service that integrated just as well with all of my automation for media collection

166
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,420
I'd probably pay it and so for me at the moment

167
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,900
Anyway, this that price is $15 a month to do it semi legally

168
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,500
So, you know the ethics of the whole situation are a little questionable

169
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,740
But for me, I'm comfortable with making that that kind of concession

170
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,820
what this doesn't solve though is the front end and

171
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,300
We talked a little bit a few episodes ago about plex amp when it came out

172
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,620
I think it was about a year ago and I have been using the crap out of plex amp for the last month or so

173
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,740
it is fantastic if they've done loads of little updates and

174
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,840
I've got to say, you know, I'm not really missing Spotify at all

175
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,260
Yeah, you gotta see this app. We'll have a link in the show notes. You got to see this

176
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,660
They've also released. I don't know if we've covered this on the show, but they've released a Linux

177
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,960
App image so you can actually use it on the Linux desktop Mac

178
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,580
Windows Android iOS

179
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:36,460
It's so great and I'm happy to report that I've tested the offline playback, which is huge feature for me. I love that

180
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:43,320
So yeah, okay. I'm seeing this. This is like a whole new world coming together for me. You're opening my eyes Alex

181
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,760
I'm seeing a new world

182
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,480
I mean it does rely on plex which I'm sure most people listening to this podcast have access to a plex server somewhere

183
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,520
But the thing I really like about plex amp is it has this whole kind of concept

184
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:02,040
I guess that they borrowed from the Spotify ethos of the related artists the recommended mixes recent playlists all that kind of stuff

185
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,720
So the more you use it the more tailored the recommendations get to what you're sort of in the mood for that week

186
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,800
And I really like that about it. I have tried the

187
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,640
Fin amp, which is a jellyfin music player kind of in the spirit of plex amp. Yeah, not as good

188
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,640
No, of course not, but it's open source. It is an F droid as well

189
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,760
You can just get the APK and it works, you know

190
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,360
So if you want to use jellyfin as your back-end server, you totally can it's just not quite the same experience

191
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,360
But I'll toss a link in the show notes

192
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,000
Linode.com slash SSH go there to get $100 in 60-day credit and you go there to support the show

193
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,260
Linode is how we host everything up in the cloud and some jobs just work better up in the cloud

194
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,120
And if you're thinking maybe it's time to try out next cloud, I highly recommend it

195
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,960
We've been using next cloud on Linode for over two years with their object storage as our back-end now Linode themselves

196
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,180
They started in 2003

197
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,820
One of the very first companies in cloud computing and now 18 years later

198
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,960
Linode is the largest independent open cloud provider in the world with 11 global data centers serving nearly a million customers and businesses

199
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,260
Around the globe the Linodes remain focused

200
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,900
They stayed competitive and they've made cloud computing simple affordable and accessible to all

201
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,240
It really is the best-in-class experience performance wise

202
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:26,760
Options wise and when it matters, you're really gonna appreciate the customer support Linodes rolled out Rocky and Alma Linux images

203
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,300
If you've been wanting to give those a go as well as CentOS stream

204
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,200
They have one click deployments of next cloud and things like that if you want to use that and of course

205
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,000
They have an S3 compatible object storage that I rave about all the time

206
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,480
So you could always deploy something on there and just let it grow and then you'll really appreciate things like their nice dashboard

207
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,140
That gives you a heads up on your systems performance. What's been going on?

208
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:52,460
Sensible alerting that's just set up and available by default a powerful DNS manager Kubernetes and Terraform support

209
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,060
I mean I can go on and on and on not to mention the MVME PCIe storage

210
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:02,440
They're rolling out right now and pricing 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers that have complicated platforms

211
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,620
And they just want to lock you in

212
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,940
But maybe the best part you can support the show

213
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,180
linode.com

214
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:16,420
SSH go there get $100 and 60 day credit on a new Linode account and you go there to support the show linode.com slash

215
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,980
SSH

216
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,740
All right

217
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,740
So some other hoo-ha this week is that Google have announced that they're gonna shut down free

218
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,260
G-suite accounts unless you start giving them some greenbacks

219
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,620
Boy, did it kind of like touch a nerve with our audience and I mean obviously not everybody

220
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,660
Well, we got a lot of upset people that wrote into the show people are hitting me up on telegram

221
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,020
angry

222
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,820
We got lots of email about this

223
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,460
So on Wednesday Google announced that it's getting rid of their G suite legacy free edition

224
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:51,380
Which allowed those that snuck in before 2012 to get free Google app services tied to a custom domain

225
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,820
Rather than a gmail address so that would mean that for a lot of our listeners who are

226
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:01,000
Generally more tech savvy early adopter type people who have a finger on the pulse

227
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:05,140
That could mean that they losing years worth of purchases tied to that Google Play account

228
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,580
potentially in the hundreds or thousands of dollar range

229
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:14,260
But also friends and family members who they've signed up for these services as well with their at custom domain.com

230
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,580
Email addresses are suddenly gonna have to start paying a minimum of I think six dollars a month for this thing

231
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:26,360
Yeah, and imagine you sign into your Android phone with that ID. It's your everything. It's your contacts your calendar. It's

232
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,700
everything and yeah

233
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:35,660
Those Play Store purchases as well and it almost seems like Google was unprepared for people to be upset by this

234
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,100
but that seems

235
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,820
scientifically impossible because you think Google as an organization would be aware when you give people something for free and then you take that free

236
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,140
Thing away people get upset that happens 100% of the time. That's math

237
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,560
So they had to know but their response after the fact

238
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:59,520
Which I think was just a couple hours ago as we're recording it would almost seem to imply like they were completely caught off guard

239
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,160
I mean if you're a PR person, that's the easy route to take isn't it?

240
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,800
There's a bit of a story to this this week

241
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,800
So they announced it a few days ago that they're going to do this shutdown

242
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,560
Then there were some news articles came out about how they might be facing a class-action lawsuit from several users

243
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,960
And then as Chris says, you know a few hours ago, they have relented to the pressure

244
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,360
There's an article on Ars Technica

245
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,600
Which there's a link to in the show notes where they say that Google is launching a survey of affected g-suite users

246
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,940
The company is surprised by how many people this change affected

247
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,840
What like they didn't have metrics Google's supposed to be the data company

248
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:42,140
I'm sorry, that's that's bullshit. You tell me they didn't check active users before they made this announcement. I'm not buying it

249
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,560
Yeah, I'm calling I'm calling BS on that

250
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,700
But they have announced a couple of extra nice things as a result of kind of capitulating to this

251
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:56,200
This upswell is uprising of nerd rage and they're promising a data migration option

252
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,160
Which will include your Google Play content purchases. That's really what they got to do

253
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:07,440
I mean you're gonna have an at gmail address now, so you're gonna have a dirty peasant email address, I suppose I

254
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,280
Think it's important for the longevity of people buying digital content

255
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,740
I think a lot of people kind of suck it and see with DRM without fully exploring the ramifications of

256
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,120
What would happen if Google did exactly this? Yeah, you're out of luck mate

257
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:32,640
You know, that's it the the money you spent on that thing was just a rental really a long-term rental sure

258
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,920
But you don't own it

259
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,700
That's true

260
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:41,920
Every time something like this happens a group of people kind of come to a new realization about the arrangement they find themselves in

261
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,880
Just like Spotify, you know

262
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
I've got access to every song in my pocket

263
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:53,180
For the duration that my dollar gives me access to that library or for the duration that that particular artist

264
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,360
Likes Spotify, you know, it's yeah, it's never been a better time to self host or something, right?

265
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:07,840
Reflecting on our summer de Google challenge. I just kind of have been coming to like maybe a new kind of arrangement

266
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:15,600
You take your your data valuable stuff like your email your contacts your photos you put those somewhere else

267
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:24,000
So perhaps you use something like proton mail or fastmail or you self host the email and you use prism for the for the pictures

268
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,440
but you still have a lot of Google services like YouTube and

269
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,860
Maps obviously in the Play Store. I think you still want a burner Gmail account, but why not a new one?

270
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,660
Why not a new Gmail account with very little details in it, right?

271
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:45,340
And then you self host with a combination of like things like next cloud you self host all the other stuff and kind of you

272
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,500
know, it's not it's not like a binary

273
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,580
No Google at all kind of it's like this

274
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:59,780
Limited risk exposure approach to Google. I mean f-droid is quite good. You can go quite deep with LinearJS and f-droid to replace

275
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:05,140
Android properly, you know without some of the the more sneaky Google Play services that are in there

276
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,380
In fact, I've got a friend who was looking to switch to iOS

277
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,700
But he's very happy with his Android hardware and doesn't want to actually throw the phone in the bin

278
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,700
But he doesn't want it to be tracking him quite so much either. And so he's actually going that route of

279
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,620
LinearJS and f-droid and going to see how long he can stick it just

280
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:29,540
D-d googled no micro G nothing good for him. It's it's I think it's a good thing to try and figure out if you can do it

281
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,100
Or where your line is I think more and more about

282
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,900
Gmail and just what a brilliant brilliant move that was

283
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,740
Because if you really use Gmail as your default inbox

284
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:46,740
which so many people did because it was just the most amount of storage you could get back in the day for free, but

285
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,460
as a result

286
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,740
Google knows

287
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,900
Everything I buy because all my receipts get sent to my inbox

288
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,660
So they literally even even things that are way outside the Google ecosystem

289
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,260
They know, you know, they know what I buy and that is

290
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,900
It's gross

291
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,420
And it makes me more and more think about maybe it is worth considering self-hosting email

292
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,980
It's just fraught with issues

293
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,340
but

294
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,860
Or something like proton mail

295
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,740
But yeah, anyways, that's just I find that to be really gross

296
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,980
And so if you can just maybe create a limited risk exposure to Google, that's the way to go. I feel like

297
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,620
Because they're just always going to be expanding their data mining

298
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:34,820
I'm just looking for the episode on two and a half admins. I think it's episode 72 email cartel

299
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,340
Joe Jim and Alan have a really great discussion about I think Jim's in the camp of

300
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,620
Microsoft and Google are the only options

301
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:50,980
Microsoft and Google are the only options because they're the big boys and if they don't work then it's not your problem

302
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,940
It's Google's problem or it's Microsoft's problem. Anyway, it's a fascinating discussion. I won't spoil it too much here

303
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,780
2.5admins.com episode 72. That's a great discussion

304
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:07,780
Public safety announcement time. Let's Encrypt are going to be revoking a ton of SSL certificates in the next few days

305
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,620
As we record, it should be probably over the weekend or by the end of this week

306
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,860
I think pretty much as this episode airs. So you haven't got long if you're listening to this

307
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:22,340
You should just be able to if you're using something like caddy or traffic or some automatic cert bot based

308
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:30,180
System to generate your TLS certificates just reboot that container and it should work out that those certificates are going to expire

309
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,700
Worst case is that you're going to log into your thing and see that this is unsafe message

310
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,460
And then you can restart your reverse proxy and it should just renew everything

311
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,740
For more details on that. We'll have a link in the show notes

312
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,380

314
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,220
Tailscale, which is our favorite zero config vpn solution it installs on any device in minutes

315
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:04,500
You can manage firewall rules. It works from anywhere you create a beautiful vpn flat network for yourself

316
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,740
Load it up on a smartphone or a tablet and get access to your devices while you're on the go even when separated by firewalls

317
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,980
Subnets and I can attest even the dreaded double net tailscale will prevail them all

318
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,420
I mean, I really am so excited about this technology

319
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,940
That i'm just elated to have the opportunity to actually have them as a sponsor. You got to try it out

320
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,220
It'll change your game. I've been running on everything from my arch86 servers

321
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,660
My new tumbleweed boxes. I have raspberry pies with raspbian and ubuntu

322
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,380
All of it it all works. They have an install for all of it. It's quick

323
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,600
It supports your single sign-on system and that includes two-factor authentication

324
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,600
Under the hood. They're using wire guards noise protocol for encryption

325
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:58,020
So you get the tech of wire guard that you love with the flat mesh vpn network that tailscale brings on top of that

326
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,380
My tailscale vpns are always on they interconnect my systems and every os I use

327
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:08,100
I even use it with my family like my kids their machines all have tailscale installed as well

328
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,100
So I can ssh into their boxes

329
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:16,100
It's solved so many problems for myself and it's just a unique opportunity to have them as a sponsor

330
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,980

336
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,440
Now long-time listeners of the show will know that i've been hosting a server at my dad's house for many years since I emigrated

337
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Three plus at this point

338
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,840
He's moving house. So I'm going to be hosting a server at my dad's house

339
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,440
He's moving house and that doesn't sound like a big deal people move house all the time except for the fact

340
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,360
He's moving from somewhere with cable internet 300 down 30 up style internet

341
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,280
To somewhere with two meg down dsl and barely half a meg up

342
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,080
Has he not thought about how this is going to affect you?

343
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,000
No, he hasn't oh my goodness

344
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,600
I'm gonna have to rethink my entire iPlayer strategy man. Not only that but your entire backup strategy like this is huge, man

345
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:29,960
Yeah, potentially. So we're looking at a few options for him ee who are a carrier in the uk, uh, cell phone

346
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,240
mobile phone provider in the uk they offer a home internet package, uh, which

347
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,200
Straddles the 5g 4g spectrums and I think it's about 50 pounds a month

348
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,520
So it's quite affordable for unlimited data unlimited in air quotes probably

349
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,520
She's that sounds pretty good though

350
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:52,440
Yeah, so my mother-in-law actually lives in rural norfolk and we recorded a podcast over a 4g

351
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,360
Um mobile broadband because she had a similar dsl situation where she was getting you know, a meg or two

352
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,000
Either way, which really you know in in this day and age is no good

353
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,400
So she's been using this service from ee for a few years and it works extremely well

354
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,840
They put an antenna on the roof. It points directly at the mast. It's a few miles away. It's a house. It doesn't move

355
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:20,120
Right, and it's fine. The downside is you have bandwidth quotas on the 4g plans. It's a few hundred gig

356
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,360
I think she has two hundred gig to go with but she's a single, you know widow

357
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:30,280
She doesn't use a huge amount of data, but the 5g plan has that unlimited tier, which I found really interesting

358
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,000
So the spectrum obviously of 5g either they want to get people hooked into 5g now

359
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,240
And they're offering that carrot to dangle people in

360
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:43,320
Or the spectrum just actually permits that kind of usage. I don't know. It'd be interesting to to find out now

361
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:50,040
What I wanted to ask you about is I know you've put an absolute metric ass ton of time into figuring out

362
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
multi-wan connections

363
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,280
And my dad's looking at starlink obviously, but there's a big wait time for that

364
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:02,360
And so in the meantime, what we're thinking of doing is getting a couple of different providers to kind of figure out

365
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:09,480
If that would improve his situation. Is there you know, what should he be looking at for these kind of mobile internet type?

366
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,040
On the on the server side anyway, not not necessarily the carrier stuff. Yeah

367
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,560
Yeah, I'll tell you I think probably the number one important thing is the antenna on the roof outside of the building

368
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:27,160
That makes such a huge difference. And then the other thing to kind of look for is you have different categories of

369
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:35,320
Categories of modems and antennas. So you have like a cat 12 modem and a cat 16 modem and essentially the

370
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,000
bigger the number

371
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,760
The faster it is the more connections it can do to the tower that kind of stuff

372
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,720
so that's what you want right is you want an antenna and you want a

373
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
lte device like a

374
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,280
Like a router or or a mi-fi device that can take advantage of that

375
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,160
And so that's what I had to end up do is I got um, I got I got something from a company called

376
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,120
Pep wave or it's a pep link. I'm sorry. I yeah, it's pep wave is the anyways

377
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,640
It and uh, this is built for for uh, you know a mobile setup

378
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,960
but they have setups for residents and buildings as well and

379
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
um, they have

380
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,800
with that a

381
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:22,760
Vpn service that does a bonded connection and you can do this on your own if you're really good. Um,

382
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,480
Wes and I did build one on a raspberry pi

383
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:32,840
And tested it for a bit and it worked and we did uh, we bonded two connections out to linode and it worked

384
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,840
but

385
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,440
The thing about uh, the vendor solution is it works in conjunction with software on the router

386
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,080
It's aware of packet loss. It is very intelligent about what it sends over which vpn and which connection and it

387
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Overall just does a better job managing it

388
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:55,000
Um, so you can kind of stack this stuff. So, you know tier one antenna and a modem

389
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
and then tier two is

390
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,320
What you bring that into?

391
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:05,080
Um, is it is it coming into just a little crappy mi-fi box that's been doing wi-fi right there off that box because

392
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,360
You're gonna have a really limited wi-fi setup. So that's something that can happen is

393
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,000
People can get a little mi-fi device and then they go to use that well those things suck when you get more than a couple

394
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,720
Of devices connected to them and their range is only a couple of hundred feet. So he's got this uh, speedify article

395
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,280
Which he found on tech radar uk. It sounds like it does a similar thing

396
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:30,280
it bonds a few connections together over a vpn and uh, my initial reaction when he suggested that was

397
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:37,240
I remember back in my college days. I had a few cable modems that had some questionable firmware on them

398
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
And I ran those things. Yeah

399
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,360
Into a pf sense set up to get free internet when I was a student

400
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,080
And I remember, you know back then the internet was obviously a lot less sophisticated

401
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,840
But I just remember bouncing from one modem to the next and being logged out of websites all the time

402
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,360
And it was just super annoying. Is that kind of stuff still a problem today?

403
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:04,280
Not with the right solution that is getting better and better because the endpoint that you bond into that's the connection that goes out

404
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,560
To the website so that ip doesn't change but like with this speedify setup, you know

405
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,120
what I don't like about it is

406
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,640
They'll give you a couple of gigs for free and then after that

407
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,160
You got to start paying, you know, you watch a netflix movie a single netflix movie

408
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,400
Maybe even half the netflix movie before you've used up what you which you get for free

409
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,200
Well, I mean the amount of videos I send him of his granddaughter

410
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,520
I mean right well and you're going to the trouble of paying for an unlimited lde connection and then

411
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,600
Getting all of this hardware and then you know this kind of stuff. It just doesn't to me

412
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,960
It doesn't make sense so much. I do. I do appreciate that. It's more approachable

413
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,720
In the us i'll link to some bundles people can get that just kind of bundles all the hardware and software together

414
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,400
It's a little trickier out there, but I think really what I i'd start small

415
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,760
And see what your dad's comfortable with like you can even get

416
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,440
Mi-fi devices that have small antennas that you can connect to them

417
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,600
And you can just mount the antenna to the window facing the cellular tower and the little antenna has a section cup

418
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,280
It's a flat little antenna and that can actually make a significant improvement because it's um

419
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:18,200
What is it called alex? It's like the richter scale where an improvement in db in cellular reception is like a significant improvement

420
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,080
So like a 1 db increase is is is a significant increase in signal. Yeah, the logarithmic

421
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,760
scale that

422
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:30,440
And so even just getting up a couple of dbs can make a huge performance difference and latency difference

423
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:37,720
And so just starting like with that if you just got a mi-fi and an antenna like netgear makes one that mounts to the window

424
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
Uh, he'd be all right, but even better

425
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,880
Obviously as you know would be an antenna on the roof maybe on a pole that's above the roof line

426
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Yeah, that is the way to go

427
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:55,880
Yeah, that is the way to go. Uh what i'm worried about with this ee solution in particular is they supply the modem

428
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,020
And isp provided modems are notoriously

429
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:06,120
Crappy. Yeah, and you can't run wire guard on them and you can't do a whole bunch of port forwarding stuff

430
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,520
Which I find very useful when we're doing remote management and if I have a backup server there

431
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,480
Yeah, i'm a little bit worried about uh

432
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,160
Will it be one of those things where you could take the sim card out and put it in a nicer piece of hardware? I

433
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,160
Need to do some more research now if you're in the uk and you know the answer to that question

434
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,240
I would love to hear from you

435
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,360
If you've replaced the ee router with something else as well

436
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,280
I would love to know what you've replaced it with and how it works because ultimately I would love to get to a situation where

437
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,480
The wan connection isn't really very important, you know

438
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,760
So that way when starlink does become available we can just plug. Yeah, my dad into the open sense

439
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,080
That's running in the house and it's just another one connection that we load balance or something like that

440
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:55,080
Um, so yeah, if you if you know the answer or if you've done anything similar, please get in touch at self-hosted dot show slash contact

441
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,960
Yeah, you have a little mini dv tape follow-up for people who don't recall alex ended up getting his hands on some dv

442
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,120
Tapes that he wanted to import and you put the call out there for some hardware

443
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:12,860
But I guess it was a little more complicated than we remembered things being it turns out 90s tech sucked worse than we remembered

444
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,540
I have in my hands a cannon vixia hv40

445
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
This thing one of those in the studio

446
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,320
If you don't want that send it to me because mine died and I got to replace it and then I could do video in

447
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,480
The studio. I think this thing was the rolls royce of camcorders back in the day. It has an hdmi out on it

448
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,000
Yeah, oh, I know. I used to have two of them, but now they've both slowly died on me

449
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,800
So I met up with a listener who actually lives 10 minutes from my house

450
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,760
He heard the episode last a couple of weeks ago

451
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,240
And messaged me and said hey alex. I've got a mini dv camcorder. It's got an hdmi out

452
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,680
Do you want to go for coffee and you can have it for a few weeks and I was like, yeah, that sounds amazing

453
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:58,040
Thank you so much. Uh, so, you know, I met up with him got coffee brought it home. What is it? Wait a minute

454
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,320
What is he doing with this thing? He needs to sell it to me. That's this is this is what needs to happen

455
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,000
This is what needs to happen. Oh wicked. I'm sure you'll i'm sure you'll hear this episode

456
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,600
So very excitedly I brought this thing home got it unpacked got it all set up

457
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,640
And put in one of the tapes and it just said unsupported format

458
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,120
And i'm like, huh?

459
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,280
Now I was thinking maybe it was something to do with the because on mini dv tapes

460
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,520
There's this long play and short play format

461
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,480
So you could take a 60 minute tape and make it into a 90 minute tape or something like that sp and lp

462
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,480
That's it. Yeah god

463
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Tech 15 years ago was just ridiculous. Wasn't it? It's so bad. How do we make it work?

464
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,520
And importing footage off those tapes meant you actually had to like play the tape back. You couldn't just copy the file time. Yeah

465
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,000
Now these days you just have an sd card you just copy it off it's fine, you know

466
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,160
Yeah, we complain about dongles these days. Give me a dongle any day. Yeah

467
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,320
Yeah, um, so yeah, I was you know, I had my hdmi capture device. I've got a usb

468
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,000
One of those just knocking around and I was like right? This is going to be perfect unsupported format. Womp. Womp

469
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,000
turns out

470
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,200
My tapes are in pal format and this camera is an ntsc camera now. I'm almost positive

471
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,280
You could switch it to pal though. Can't you?

472
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I don't think so. I've had a real good dig. Oh if you uh,

473
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,240
Hmm, i'd have to look again. Maybe we can walk through it on a facetime call or something

474
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,800
Because I couldn't find it. It says it on the box though. That's the trouble ntsc printed right on the box

475
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,120
Yeah, it might just be stuck. I can't remember

476
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:35,720
But the other thing too is the f the firewire port allows you to do a dv import and that might not be well

477
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,640
Either way, you're probably screwed but that is a thing you can import off the firewire port too

478
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,480
I'll play with mine after the show if I can get it to power up. I think it's totally dead though

479
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,640
It's been you know

480
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,320
It's been 100 years. So just one stupid little format issue

481
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,300
It's so dumb too that the u.s. Was ntsc

482
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,840
You guys across the pond

483
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:00,680
Were pal. I think pal was maybe the superior tech too, but I don't think it was 50 hertz versus 60 hertz

484
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,640
I think that was the entire reason it existed if I recall

485
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,640
And then they started using it to do region locking of like vhs tapes

486
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:13,080
And I remember xbox games back in the day. I think even 360 games were still region locked

487
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,440
It sounds so silly now, I mean we still have weird issues like that

488
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,600
But so now you've got to make it harder is not only is you really need

489
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:26,360
Something that is very rare a working mini dv player, but you need a pal

490
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,160
I need a european one in america

491
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,380
And the stupid thing is these tapes were in europe until my mom brought them for christmas

492
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,360
You know, I know that back in the day they used to have just little tapes

493
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,040
I know that back in the day they used to have just little mini dv

494
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,400
Players like a vcr that you'd put the little tape in and it would have a little hdmi out. They do exist

495
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,280
Uh, they're they're two three hundred dollars something like that on ebay

496
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,480
I think that's probably the route i'm going to have to end up going is buying one of these and then selling it on

497
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,040
So i'm effectively renting it for myself. You got to figure those tapes won't last much longer

498
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,840
Yeah, I mean there's only a dozen of them behind me. So it won't take too long. That's the annoying thing

499
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,640
It's not like i'm digitizing a hundred of the damn things like I need a three hundred dollar

500
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,160
Doohickey to do it. No, it's just a at this point. I'm kind of tempted to just pay the shop

501
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,320
Oh, you know

502
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,200
Now, uh, have you thought about what you're gonna do?

503
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,680
Encoding wise are you gonna bring these in as hd 64? Do you use something else now?

504
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
I'd like to try and use my

505
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,400
New m1 max and try and make the fans spin up and do some video encoding

506
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,920
Sure make that thing work earn its keep

507
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,880
I agree with you. I still haven't heard the fans on this thing

508
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,760
I've had this laptop for what three months two months now and it's a absolute beast

509
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,800
It's a monster and it it takes a stupid amount of workload

510
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,600
And it doesn't even say it doesn't even make a noise

511
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,240
and I I don't know like maybe istat menu needs to be updated because or it's

512
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,720
I I swear like it

513
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,280
It just doesn't seem like it matched what what shows in the load just it never seems right

514
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,440
It never seems like the system's ever maxed out

515
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,560
Yeah, I think there's a bunch of stuff with how they're doing

516
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:14,360
So we're used to computers that are general purpose and throw everything at the standard cpu cores just have main cores. Yeah, exactly

517
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:14,680
Yeah

518
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:22,120
I'm, not sure that istat is particularly good about how it visualizes like the neural cores and you got the efficiency cores versus the

519
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,160
Faster cores and all that kind of stuff, but that's going to become a thing

520
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,720
Throughout, you know intel cores too

521
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,000
And that's going to be pretty cool when it does hit systems you can build a home server around because I'm all about that

522
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,200
Why have like all those little background tasks that are always running on your box?

523
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,720
Hit those high power cores if they could run on the efficiency cores

524
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,120
We just need to make sure that like the linux kernel and all that supports that but that work is ongoing

525
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,120
I just wanted to mention super quick

526
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,720
I know this is really super really tight notice depending when you're listening to this

527
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,660
But if you're listening on january 28th 2022

528
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:59,360
Then just this sunday we have a hangout at the studio. It starts around 11 a.m. In the pacific northwest

529
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:07,260
We're uh up in the marysville area. So I'll give you an idea of where we're at and we're getting together on january 30th 2022

530
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,020
It's a sunday and um, alex will be flying in with his private jet

531
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
And hanging out. Oh, yeah, sure

532
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:18,220
Signing, uh postcards my reusable falcon 9 rocket boosters as well

533
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,180
It's really nice of them to let you

534
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,820
To play with that you guys have really become the best of buds. Yep, you know, yeah old elon

535
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,940
Me and elon best buds. Yeah

536
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:36,380
Yeah, you guys you guys really bonded over 3d printing when he came to that one meetup that we had and uh ever since

537
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,180
Talking of meetups. I'm actually considering hosting a small one in rally in the spring

538
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:45,100
We'll just uh, i'll take my my red egg somewhere ceramic egg

539
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,580
And we'll cook out some meats in a park somewhere and hang out for a few hours and meet some of you because it you

540
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,940
Know I found out you know this week through the mini dv feedback

541
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,620
There are tons of you on the east coast that are willing to to meet up

542
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,220
So yeah, we don't get to do many events out there. You know east coast is

543
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,980
It's a far far far drive from seattle

544
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,780
I would love to be able to get out there more often

545
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:13,100
Some daft stat like 80 of the us population lives within a two-hour flight of atlanta

546
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,620
Just to give you an idea of how populous the east coast is

547
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:20,540
Wow, I could see one day having like a I would love to just have a little

548
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,180
Operation running out of like colorado or something like that because it seems like a pretty good central place to visit

549
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:31,340
From as well. Hmm. If only we had some insiders in colorado already, huh? Hmm, maybe one day

550
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,600
Thank you to our insiders that support the show our sres

551
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:42,300
You guys make the show possible at self-hosted dot show slash sre that membership gives you an ad free version of the show

552
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,740
and

553
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:49,580

And don't forget about future meetups

556
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,620
You might not be able to make it to the pacific northwest but meetup.com slash jupiter broadcasting is where you go

557
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,660
And that's where we should do it. Alex if you eventually launch one

558
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,280
We'll put it on there so people can go to meetup.com slash jupiter broadcasting

559
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,780
For one on the east coast or the west coast and then when I travel

560
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,820
It's happening. It's happening. I want to go

561
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:21,580
I got fomo already and you haven't even made the event yet. So fire up the dupes, you know, let's go

562
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:28,700
Seriously, I think you probably got better weather than we do on average at least in the springtime. No kidding. Oh, yeah. Oh, oh

563
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:35,500
Oh, that sounds nice. That sounds really nice. Well, we'd love to get your feedback and links and all that kind of stuff
