00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Coming up on today's show, we discuss the Home Assistant Security Bulletin.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,840
I've got some pretty cool Bluetooth low-energy OLED temperature sensors for you from Xiaomi,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,880
and we get philosophical in the feedback section. I'm Alex.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,920
I'm Chris, and this is Self-Hosted 37.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,760
You know, it's only the last few weeks I realized that we just sort of

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,800
blew right past our one-year anniversary in September.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,080
We're one!

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,880
Yeah, I think it's just because we were doing the whole going independent thing again,

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,720
and so we just had a lot on our plate.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
What's your opinion on first birthdays?

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,240
I think the show's been really well received, and it seems like it's still growing,

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,160
but it's found its audience, and I think it's a good first year,

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,920
especially because, you know, we're not weekly,

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,600
and so for some podcasts that can be rough, but it doesn't really seem to have held us back.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,480
I wasn't talking about that. I was talking about, like, you know, kids,

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,040
first birthday, do you make a whole big deal about it?

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,880
Because obviously they're not going to remember it.

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,800
That's true, that's true. Yeah, I don't know, I feel like for podcasts,

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,760
it's a good sign that it's a stable podcast, but there's like kind of this,

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,160
the real, I think, real landmark for a podcast is five years.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,160
That feels like the one you celebrate to me.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,400
Yeah, you've done a few that have reached episode 300.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,000
I think for me that's a big number.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,080
Yeah, that's also a pretty big one.

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,040
Yeah, so congratulations though on the anniversary.

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,040
We thought this seems like the perfect episode to follow up on a lot of things because of that.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,360
You know, it's going to take us 11 and a half years at twice a month to reach episode 300.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Maybe we'll have to step it up at some point.

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,880
Maybe we'll go daily for the last little bit.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,440
We have flirted with the idea of weekly, but you know, with going indie,

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,880
you've had so much on your plate again.

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,720
It's not really been feasible for both of our schedules yet.

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,680
Yeah, life is busy, but you never know. Things change in the future,

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,760
but right now we don't have any plans to change it. We have discussed it from time to time.

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,040
The future is, well, it hasn't happened yet, but this episode has happened.

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,600
It's happening right now and it's brought to you by a cloud guru,

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,560
the leader in learning for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,280
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs.

39
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,200
Get certified, get hired, get learning, a cloud guru.com.

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,200
I got a rather alarming set of emails and Reddit posts from the Home Assistant project this week

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,960
about security bulletin and I wanted to get your take on how they're handling it because

42
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,080
to me, it seems like controlled, well, not even controlled.

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,760
It just seems like chaos over there.

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,800
Yeah, they're really trying to get the word out. That's one of the reasons I think by now,

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,960
when this episode comes out, people will know about it.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,520
But just because this seems to be really important,

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,560
I even got a notification again this morning via their Discord community.

48
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,160
So there was a security bulletin put out by the Home Assistant project.

49
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,960
We will have the blog post linked in our show notes, but there's not much to it other than it

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,200
just strongly encourages you to update as fast as possible and spread the word as far as possible.

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,880
There is a specific call out in the blog post to an issue with custom components,

52
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,320
which are not reviewed by the core Home Assistant team.

53
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,000
But otherwise, there's really zero information in the bulletin as we record.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,080
This is several days after the bulletin as well.

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,240
We were told there would be an update with more information,

56
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,880
but it so far hasn't shown up anywhere.

57
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,240
However, we do have several questions that we'd like to have answered,

58
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,000
like which integrations were leaking stuff,

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,560
under which circumstances were those integrations leaking stuff,

60
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,160
and does the update that's been released fully address those issues?

61
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,840
Or, as some are speculating right now, is it just merely mitigating them?

62
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,320
Will there still be some risk after updating if we use whatever integration this supposedly was?

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,600
So there's definitely questions that haven't been properly answered by the Home Assistant project right now.

64
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,920
I wonder if that's because they just don't have the answers yet. You speculate, really.

65
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,720
And at this point, I want to just let the audience know we are recording this a couple of weeks ahead of time.

66
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,680
I've got some personal stuff coming up, so it's unavoidable.

67
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,960
But, you know, from my perspective, I want to see like CVE-style clarity here.

68
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,520
I want to know what the problem is, I want to know what they've done to fix it, or that they haven't fixed it.

69
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,320
I actually don't necessarily mind if they haven't,

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,760
because at least I know what the problem is, so I could maybe go and try and contribute to creating a fix, perhaps.

71
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,280
Yeah, I'm sure they're very busy.

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,800
But there are basic questions like, if I didn't use any custom components, do I have any cause for concern?

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,360
Now, if you go by the code, because it's an open source project, it looks like maybe they caught that

74
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,440
some nasty things were happening via the HTTP API.

75
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,880
Seems like maybe they've added some basic filters to the code for some common web-based attacks.

76
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,560
But really, the context matters here, so that's only something the project can provide.

77
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,720
Yeah, I see some stuff in the code for one of the commits that's referenced in the forum post

78
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,840
about the security bulletin, about file injection attacks at certain web URLs,

79
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,200
as well as SQL injection protections and stuff like that, so who knows what's going on.

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,600
This is where it's a really tricky balance, especially for a overburdened project,

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,720
and especially a new one that hasn't really had to deal with a security issue quite like this yet.

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,040
There is a real high standard for a platform, a really high standard of clear communication.

83
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,040
And even if that communication is a status update, that they don't have the full report yet,

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,960
it needs to be communicated. It's a hard lesson to learn. You also have to create process.

85
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,880
It's a human problem as well as a process problem. But clear communication is critical

86
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,880
for any kind of popular platform. And I know that they're very busy, but that's always going to be the case.

87
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,320
And as more and more people integrate their homes and businesses around this,

88
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,680
it's pretty important that we know what's going on. That's where the communication is probably going to

89
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,680
be a bit of a learning opportunity in the future. But it also reminds me that they're still,

90
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,040
as far as a project goes of this scope, relatively young. And they still have things that they're

91
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,720
going to have to figure out. And it's not why it's a knock when I say this, but it sort of speaks to

92
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,160
why I'm not a huge fan of their entire integrated approach with the OS and Home Assistant and the

93
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:11,440
Supervisor. I'm not a huge fan of this project building an OS. With these types of security

94
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,360
things, with the underlying platform, that's just an area I'd like to outsource that work to the

95
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,240
folks at Canonical, Red Hat, or Debian. I just don't really prefer having the project control

96
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,760
the entire stack. I understand why they do it. And it's an entirely separate conversation. But

97
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,320
it's one of my arguments why I hope they keep making it possible for folks like me to deploy

98
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,520
the entire Home Assistant experience on the OS of my choice. Because just for my personal comfort,

99
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,520
and just the way I view the world, I like to know that a vendor like Red Hat or Canonical is behind

100
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,920
the server OS that I'm using. I mean, I see on a daily basis at work, a lot of the stuff that goes

101
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,760
on behind the curtain of maintaining a kernel, of maintaining a Kubernetes distribution and that

102
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,640
kind of stuff. And it's an astronomical amount of work. And I've got to agree with you. I think if

103
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:05,680
the project were to take the limited resources that they have and kind of share them out in their

104
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,200
area, well, not share them out, but like, delegate the responsibilities of the more complex tasks,

105
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:18,880
like building an OS to vendors whose day job it is, and who have 25 plus years, I'm looking at

106
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,320
Debian, experience in doing this kind of stuff. And then they can focus on what they're good at,

107
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,880
which is building a brilliant home automation platform. But to their credit, they caught this.

108
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,080
And the other thing I think they've done right in this process is they have communicated the need

109
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,760
to upgrade. They haven't been particularly great about communicating why, other than they've

110
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:47,040
been very good at getting the word out. And there is a pretty safe process to do that upgrade. So I

111
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:53,040
decided to do it over the weekend. So that way I could report back here on the show. And my setup

112
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:59,920
is it's Ubuntu 20.04 running on a Raspberry Pi four. I can't even remember how I set it up now,

113
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,400
but I have the full supervised home assistant setup so I can install the add-ons and take

114
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,760
snapshots. And I really love that setup, even though it's not technically a supported setup anymore.

115
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,960
But I went into my home assistant supervisor and I clicked update. Well, first I took a snapshot,

116
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,520
actually did the snapshot. And whenever I'm doing something that may introduce a breaking change,

117
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,040
because it wasn't clear here, if there was an issue with custom integrations, I thought it's possible

118
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,440
they just disabled custom integrations for temporary, you know, until they have this thing

119
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,360
fixed. And so I thought this could be a breaking update. I don't know. There's not really been any

120
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,920
information about that. So I took a snapshot and then I downloaded that snapshot to my local hard

121
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:44,880
drive, just in case. Then I head over to the update button, click the update. Nothing happens. Click it

122
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,600
again. Nothing happens. And it's not exceptionally good at communicating status. So I SSH into the

123
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,800
server. Again, I love that it's a server I can just get access to. And I have things like

124
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,160
bashtop installed and I run bashtop and htop and I get an idea is like, is there anything happening

125
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,480
in the background? And I pretty quickly determine nothing's happening. So I turned to an integration

126
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,120
that I have. And this is one of the reasons I wanted the full home assistant experience and not

127
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,640
just home assistant core, because there is there's integrations like the upgrade configuration

128
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,640
checker that will download the latest version of home assistant, do a fake container check,

129
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,840
install and then check it against your config yaml and tell you if there's anything that's going to

130
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,520
break in the upgrade. So I thought, I'll run that. Only it broke. And I had to go digging for the

131
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,480
logs on the file system to discover that there was some issue with, quote, custom integration quote,

132
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,920
but they didn't say which integration it was. So I didn't really know what was going to happen.

133
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,240
But I decided for the good of the show, I'd pull the trigger and I did the update. And I

134
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,360
pulled the trigger and I did the update and it still did nothing. Okay, what's going on?

135
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,320
So is the configuration check failed? The update has failed. There must be something wrong. So I

136
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,360
reboot the whole machine figure. Let's just get that out of the way. Home assistant loads back up

137
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,480
by verify functionality. I go in the supervisor, I hit the update button and I started to get the

138
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,400
circle of progress. It starts working all of a sudden, even though I hadn't changed anything.

139
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,600
I just did a reboot and the machine had only been rebooted about 24 hours ago,

140
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,400
too, which I thought was kind of funny about it. It pulls it down. It does the update. And so far,

141
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,800
I don't I don't see any issue. I have the now the latest version. Everything seems to be going just

142
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,800
smooth. And I'm not quite sure why I had the problems with that update. I'm not quite sure

143
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,720
why my config check had problems. But everything's tested and working. The only time I've had issues

144
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,360
with the config checker is when there's been an error in my config, actually. Yeah, I created an

145
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,440
include that was pointing at a missing file or something. And rather than telling me that the

146
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,720
config checker just sat there and span and span and span. It takes a while to on the Raspberry Pi

147
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,760
because you're doing it, you know, you're downloading it, which I don't have the fastest

148
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,960
connection in the RV. So I'm waiting for that. Oh, yeah, it can it can take a beat. That is true.

149
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:09,360
At least I would say set aside two or three minutes. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Or more. Maybe 15.

150
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,160
But you see the air. I put it there in the show notes for you. It just says invalid config for

151
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,360
script integration. And then it's just blank. And it says not found two quotes that are just empty.

152
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,880
Very helpful. Yeah. So I'm going to pull it up. It says it's online 21. So I know where to go look.

153
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,520
But I decided to run the update since I had a snapshot and everything went through. I have

154
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,520
the latest version and it's working perfectly fine. But I do kind of wonder what that custom

155
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,360
integration airs about and if it's related to some of the fixes they just did since their fixes are

156
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,400
related to custom integration. So I'll be diving deeper into that into the future. But have you

157
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,120
decided to pull the trigger on the upgrade for you? Well, I mean, I was I was quite busy the other

158
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,520
night and I just saw the notification come through and was like, oh, so I just hit upgrade. I didn't

159
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:02,240
have time to check. I subscribe through the Nabu Casa app. So technically, my install is internet

160
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,360
facing, even if you have to guess a very long obfuscated URL. When did you start doing that?

161
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,040
I didn't know that. Well, I started supporting the project. That was the reason I actually

162
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,440
started paying for it was really to support development, not necessarily because I wanted

163
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,560
the remote features. But it actually turned out to be pretty handy because, you know, with COVID,

164
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,360
I haven't really left the house that much. So I haven't had the need to SSH into my house remotely

165
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,280
very much. And I got to where I was going and found out I couldn't connect to my house to pass

166
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:37,920
the time or whatever. And so I opened up Home Assistant in the phone app, looked at the URL,

167
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,920
type that into on my on my laptop, and then use the VS code plugin with the built in shell

168
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,280
to create the SSH keys that I needed. And I was good to go.

169
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,240
That's a great little example of how all that stuff can really come together.

170
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,280
Yeah, so I got the update loaded. I haven't actually updated the version on my Home Assistant

171
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,760
blue hardware at the studio, but I'm you know, more a couple of weeks into using that. And I'm

172
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,840
still loving that as well. I'm grateful they're doing the update. What do you use for snapshots?

173
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,480
I use the built in supervisor tool that does the snapshots.

174
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,360
Have you come across the Google Drive backup plugin?

175
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,640
I don't think I have.

176
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,800
No, it's not in the main store. I'm pretty sure it's an external thing, but it is awesome. So I

177
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,360
think in the self hosted life hack that we did a few months ago, I showed it off there where I

178
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,680
basically took a completely fresh install of Home Assistant, applied the snapshot, which was taken

179
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,960
by this Google Drive plugin. So it automatically does stuff like snapshot rotation. So you can

180
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,600
have a daily, a weekly, a monthly, yearly snapshot, that kind of thing. Really? I can

181
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,760
have up to seven days and four months or whatever. You got to link this. You got to link this up. I

182
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,800
got to check this out. All right. Yeah, it's pretty slick. And it obviously integrates with

183
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,760
Google Drive. So, you know, each snapshots 200 megs or so in my setup. So it doesn't really take much

184
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:01,120
storage. Linode.com slash SSH. Go there to get a $100 60 day credit and support the self hosted

185
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,680
podcast. Linode is our server provider. Whenever we're building something for the show or my

186
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,520
personal infrastructure and now JB 3.0's infrastructure. Yeah, it's all up on Linode

187
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:18,080
and gamers. Linode is your DIY of choice. They make it really easy. And there are plenty of

188
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,080
simple one click deployments for things like Minecraft and CSGO servers. That's a really

189
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,800
simple way and a really nice and fast way to get a nice private gaming space. And they will

190
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,120
have you fill out like just some of the basics you need to get some of the fundamental server

191
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,600
options set and they'll deploy it pre configured for you. So make sure you check that out. Every

192
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,840
plan comes with Linode's amazing human powered customer support. We've had story after story

193
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,040
from our audience of great experience with Linode's customer support. You can email,

194
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,440
you can hit them up on social media, you can pick up a phone and talk to an actual human.

195
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,760
How about that? I mean, Linode gets it. They've been around for a long time.

196
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,600
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing, three years before AWS and

197
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,040
other enterprise providers. And they're independently owned and they're founded

198
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,120
on a love for Linux and open source technologies. And they really support the community that

199
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,400
surrounds them. Like this show, like the Kubuntu project, like Linux Fest Northwest,

200
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:23,600
which you know is very special to us. Linode's a supporter of them. But you get a $100 credit

201
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,800
when you go to linode.com slash SSH. So you can play around with their really powerful

202
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,920
systems if you want. Try out building some tools around object storage. It's a great opportunity

203
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,160
to experiment with different stacks. That's one of the things I've done on Linode is I tried

204
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,960
several different WordPress stacks to see which one I like, you know, with nginx or I even try to

205
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,280
web browser where everything runs out of RAM and they have all of this stuff that is just ready to

206
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:53,840
go as configuration scripts that you can just kick off and get going. It's really simple. And they

207
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,680
also offer a lot of powerful tools. They don't hide that stuff from you either. So try it out.

208
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:05,440
Linode.com slash SSH. How often do you ask yourself the question, when does it make sense

209
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,440
to build versus buy a solution? A lot of times that's one of the first or second questions I

210
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,240
ask myself. I very frequently do that math. You must as well. Yeah, what's particularly annoying

211
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,760
is that I actually built a solution last year and there's a solution I can now buy that is so much

212
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:29,680
better for half the price that I'm kind of sat here going, I wish I hadn't built one now. Yeah,

213
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,440
it's tricky, right? Because things like temperature sensors and humidity sensors,

214
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,480
you might end up wanting a lot of them. You do. Yeah. So I mean, probably every single room is a

215
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,680
bit of overkill, but certainly at the other end of the spectrum, just a single thermostat as a

216
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:51,120
single point of measurement in a house is, it's always struck me as weird. It's absolutely nutty.

217
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,760
It's even nutty in a tiny space, like a tiny home or an RV. Yeah, because one room, if you shut the

218
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,200
door can get to several degrees higher than the hallway. Yeah. So I'm holding in my hand up to

219
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,240
the camera so you can see it. This is the little temperature sensor I've bought. It's from Xiaomi.

220
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,360
So it's a Bluetooth low energy temperature sensor with an OLED screen. There'll be a picture of it

221
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,840
in the show notes. It's about the size of three or four keys on my keyboard square. So it's pretty

222
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,160
small, fits in the palm of my hand very comfortably. And they supply these things with a small little

223
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,240
piece of adhesive tape that you can use to just stick it on the wall anywhere. They're fully

224
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:36,640
battery powered. They connect to an ESP32, which you flash with ESP Home. You give it the Bluetooth

225
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,120
Mac address of this device, and then ESP Home will connect to these sensors. There is a catch.

226
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,720
You need to flash a custom firmware on the sensors as well. So expect to set aside an evening to do

227
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:56,000
this if you're flashing half a dozen sensors or so. But the best part is that it's $9 for a four

228
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,920
pack of these sensors. No. With the screen on there? I mean, that's what I love about them.

229
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,880
I know. It's crazy, isn't it? I have very expensive temperature sensors that will do all kinds of

230
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,200
fancy things. But you know what they don't do is they don't actually just display the temperature

231
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,840
on them. And in a way, that's that's a killer feature because you get the context right there

232
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,360
for the room you're in. And it's also being fed to home a system, the temperature and the humidity

233
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,120
on the screen, which in the south east of the US humidity is my is the bane of my life. So

234
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,200
yeah, so you want to you want to keep an eye on that damn thing. Yeah. How long would you say for

235
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,480
four of them to get that flashing process done? Well, it's actually a really slick sort of web

236
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,200
configurator thing built into the GitHub repo that's linked in the show notes. So what you do

237
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,920
is you fire up your phone, you connect your phone's Bluetooth to this thing, flash the firmware through

238
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,960
a web browser, and then listen for the MAC address in the logs that way and then paste that into the

239
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,320
ESP home configuration and flash that to your ESP 32. It sounds like a lot of steps, but it really

240
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,640
isn't that bad. If you're familiar with the SP home doesn't sound bad at all, actually. Sounds

241
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,480
quite doable. Yeah, very slick. I've been very impressed with it. I think I came across this

242
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,960
first on the intimate tech YouTube channel. We had him on a few episodes ago. The Quinn led guy,

243
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,400
they just seem to work really well. I had a couple of Bluetooth dropouts with the ESP 32 is being on

244
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,880
a different end of the house. So I've ended up buying for ESP 32, which is the most expensive

245
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,560
part of the setup, one on each floor at each end of each floor. And they're basically stacked on

246
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:37,840
top of each other at each end of the house. So I mean, even at $11 each on Amazon for an ESP 32,

247
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,840
we're not talking crazy amounts of money. And you can definitely order them a lot cheaper than on

248
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,000
AliExpress if you're willing to wait for the slow boat. So now that you're getting the temperature

249
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,360
data, what are you going to do with it? Are you going to do any automations? Because that's,

250
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,000
I mean, that's really where it gets next level. Yeah, I want to. I haven't quite figured it out

251
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,440
yet. So I, we're going to talk more about this in the post-show. I think we've got something in

252
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,320
there about thermostats and the vent style unit that I use, but what I want to do is take the

253
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,320
average. And this is something Dr. Z's does a lot of. He takes the average of several sensors and

254
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,240
then uses that as his thermostat input number. What I would like to see is, is I take the average

255
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,840
across the entire top floor of my house, for example, and then use that as the input to the

256
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,000
thermostat. I haven't figured out how to use a custom input with a thermostat that has an

257
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,160
integration. You can do that with the generic thermostat module of Home Assistant, but I haven't

258
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,400
quite joined all the dots up to make it work with a pre-configured one. Justin wrote into the show.

259
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,000
He said he was, he was actually writing it because on Coder Radio, which by the way,

260
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,960
not this podcast. Where's my robe? Yeah, I'm working on it. I am wearing the minimum viable

261
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,200
robe at the moment. I was talking to Mike about his problems with, he moved into a new place and

262
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,960
it comes with a smart thermostat and it's been freezing him out at night. And mine has my system

263
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,320
every now and then something happens and the automation triggers don't fire and I cook out.

264
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,920
I get like too hot, like a heater doesn't get turned off. And I generally, this fix has always

265
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,280
just been, I reboot my Home Assistant host and then it doesn't happen for another couple of weeks.

266
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,080
But Justin wrote into the show and he said, you'd mentioned that failed automation. Home Assistant,

267
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,960
like you were just talking about, Alex, he says, has a generic thermostat component and it is

268
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,560
fantastic. I use it in several rooms of our house. You provided a temperature sensor and a switch

269
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:39,680
and the component handles all of the rest. It looks like there's some affordance for it

270
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,000
understanding if you want something in a target temperature that it might need to kick in a little

271
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,120
bit at a different time in order to actually get that temperature just right. It seems clever and

272
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,240
like a way better idea than me completely building this automation from scratch like I have been. So

273
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,960
when you do go down that route, I agree with listener Justin, check out the generic thermostat.

274
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Yeah, I need to connect those dots for sure. I mean, in my specific situation,

275
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,720
the room above my garage happens to be where we spend most of our time. And if I close the door

276
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,720
to the hallway on this room and the heat is running, it can easily get four or five Celsius

277
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,680
higher in this room than the hallway. When the forced air is blowing, it gets very dry, the air

278
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,160
and the static electricity becomes a bit of a problem and stuff like that. So what I really

279
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,240
want is just a way to use that sensor that I'm looking at right now in this room as the dedicated

280
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,280
input to the thermostat. If I can use an average, then well, even better. But what I absolutely want

281
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,400
is an automation that fires when that particular sensor gets above a certain threshold that it just

282
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,800
doesn't turn off the heating because that's not what I want. I just want it to stop heating me

283
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,880
for a bit right now and then evaluate things in 10 minutes and figure out whether it needs to still

284
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,680
keep blasting us with the heat or not. And to add an extra layer of complication,

285
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:04,080
if it could also be somehow energy efficient aware. So if you were running off grid or maybe

286
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,560
in your case you have like a Tesla Powerwall and the grid was down and you were running off battery,

287
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,360
if the system could adjust to use less power but still maintain a minimum comfort,

288
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,040
that'd be the next level. That's what I really want now for dupes.

289
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,080
That's our next business idea. We had cloudfree.shop. The next one is this

290
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,040
sort of mega thermostat that beats the pants off the nest.

291
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,960
Right. So Jim wrote into the show and he wants just our thoughts on going solar. He says,

292
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,120
I'm looking for solar for my home and I'm not really sure where to start looking. Everywhere

293
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,080
I go I get bombarded with ads and people who seem like salesmen. I've looked at businesses like

294
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,240
Tractor Supply and other sources but I worry about what they're selling and if they're actually the

295
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,440
best tech. And he wonders what we did to look into this because I know you've considered solar for

296
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,800
the home. You've considered Powerwalls for the home. I'm curious what your route and trajectory

297
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,880
is when you go off on a research binge for this. It's amazing how quickly you end up with the

298
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,320
Tesla stuff when you start googling this stuff. They must spend a lot on marketing or SEO or

299
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:13,040
something. I ended up looking at getting, I think it was like 12 panels put on my roof. Ultimately

300
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,840
it ended up being too expensive to consider right now and they weren't in North Carolina yet and

301
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,640
stuff like that. So I haven't done it yet. It's definitely on my list because I do feel guilty

302
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,600
about burning several hundred watts a day of permanent server electricity and stuff like

303
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:36,640
that that could very easily be supplied through solar. Part of it is I want to try and do my bit

304
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,360
for the environment but the other part is it'd be nice to save some money too. The research of it

305
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,320
for me has always kind of been I try to find communities that are discussing the type of

306
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,960
builds that I'm doing. So in my case they're more mobile builds but we just shift communities

307
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,120
depending on the build. And then also YouTube tends to play a pretty significant role and

308
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,000
it's really a process of finding and refining the selection of YouTubers you find and getting

309
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,840
their advice. I went to a company called AM Solar to have my mobile install done and I did that

310
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:15,280
through a process of reading lots of reviews about people's solar installs and finding forums

311
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,480
where people were discussing getting solar installed and kind of narrowed it down to a few

312
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,520
companies and then you know had my geographic location and they were kind of within my

313
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,320
striking distance and then I went and looked up pictures of their work which I think is another

314
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,240
really good tip if you can find any on their website or on Google Images I went and found

315
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,720
pictures of their work and thought that you know everything looked really good and tidy and

316
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,400
that was something that was important to me in this installs. I didn't want it to be just a ball

317
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,320
of wires I wanted it to look like it was maybe built from the factory that way and they did

318
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,040
absolutely that. So that was sort of my process. I don't know about you but the more salesier

319
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,040
company is the less interested I am. Yeah and when it comes to that kind of stuff too it's easy

320
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,560
to get scammed so just take your time you know get get multiple opinions on stuff. And the other

321
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,280
thing is and this is a very US-centric comment but there are some federal tax incentives that

322
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:13,360
tend to expire at the end of each calendar year so I noticed the number of texts I was receiving

323
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,400
about sign up for solar now in December was a lot higher than it has been in January so

324
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,200
just factor that in as well. So Phil wrote in he's a fan of your perfect media guide I think

325
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,480
it's really helped him a lot and he had questions about your VDEV configurations that you're using

326
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,600
for the perfect media server. From what I understand if you use one disk per VDEV there is

327
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,920
no protection benefit for ZFS. I'm researching options for setting up a DIY NAS and need to have

328
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:46,240
a cost to bring to the wife to get the spousal approval. Yeah we've been there you know my

329
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,080
biggest fear in life is that my wife sells my servers for what I told her they cost.

330
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,360
Yes and I know she's listening to this so hello wife. I run in a mirror VDEV very very simple

331
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,480
I just mirror two drives and that gives me 50% you know space efficiency and stuff like that

332
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,400
so I can I can sustain one drive failing locally before I need to start resorting to backups.

333
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,800
Standard moment where I say RAID is not a backup and you should never rely on it as such I very

334
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,720
much look at it as that's my primary like source of truth but if anything was to go wrong with

335
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,560
that server or both of those drives were to fail at once I actually have just you know been using

336
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:35,600
the Helios 64 since the review for this but I'm just putting together a new system to act as a

337
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:43,680
local ZFS mirror of the mirror VDEV in my house so that will live at the other end of the building

338
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,880
in case one end I don't know catches fire or something god forbid. So the short answer is

339
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,000
mirrored VDEV and if you can swing it as well a second copy of the data somewhere else and

340
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,360
preferably another copy off site. Well this is right on topic because listener Phil wrote in he

341
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,600
said you guys often talk about syncing files off site for backup but I'd like to hear a little bit

342
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,320
more detail how are you guys protecting your backups from things like ransomware or accidental

343
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,640
mass deletion in those cases maybe you're not even aware that something is wrong for months

344
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,120
I know we do it in the enterprise level but I'd love your thoughts on using tools for yourself

345
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,440
for folks at home thanks and keep up the good work Phil. How do you protect your backups and I

346
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,360
think you might mean encryption and other things like you know the whole gamut. Well ZFS recently

347
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:34,320
added data set encryption so the remote system in my setup isn't encrypted it's at my dad's

348
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,000
house so I do trust that as an end point but I think that is a valid thing that I want to try and

349
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,280
implement moving forward but this is one of the primary reasons I run ZFS is snapshot support so

350
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:53,600
I can roll back to a specific snapshot you know much like the Home Assistant Google Drive plugin

351
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,480
that lets me do hourly, daily, weekly, monthly backups. ZFS lets me do that as well and I use

352
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,680
Jim Salter's Sanoid tool to configure I think I've got like 24 hours worth of hourly backups and then

353
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,760
I've got a week's worth of daily backups and then I've got four weeks worth of backups going back a

354
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,960
month and then I've got one month backup going back six months I think and then I've got an

355
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:26,320
annual thing as well so pretty well covered I think but I don't know how I would spot ransomware

356
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,440
other than just going to access a file and being like oh crap. Ransomware I'm not particularly

357
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,120
concerned about because it would have to get executed and you know the server environment's

358
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,960
my data city none that's not that's not particularly likely. Kind of like yourself I have the NAS here

359
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,880
at the studio is kind of like a central repository of truth and then JB as a business has several

360
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,880
cloud instances of different data sets I have my data set personally in lady jupes I think all of

361
00:29:52,880 --> 00:30:01,440
that back to the NAS here at the studio I don't have a great backup solution for that NAS now most

362
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,400
of the data on it is actually reproducible by all the other locations if I just brought them all

363
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,640
back again but now I have a little bit more historical information on there that isn't

364
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,280
necessarily duplicated anywhere else and I'm starting to change my opinion on backing up my

365
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:23,520
media stuff in the past I always thought well I have the source material and what I can't find

366
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,880
on disk I could probably find on the internet and I'm okay with that because I've likely paid for

367
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,480
it at some point so I think I'm okay but now I actually have found that that's not necessarily

368
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,600
the case I've had trouble getting DVDs and Blu-rays and I've had trouble finding things online of

369
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,440
some series so now I'm actually thinking maybe I need to back up absolutely everything but that

370
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,080
becomes like you know a 15 terabyte problem I have to solve becomes a race to the bottom yeah

371
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,800
very quickly yeah and then there's just I mean I think the only way would be I need to create like

372
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,680
a box that maybe I mean maybe it's possible if USB storage if I had the money if I wanted to

373
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,280
invest that kind of money into it and sync it here locally and then take it off site via my

374
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:15,840
cell set it up somewhere off site and sync it up that is the solution you know is to build a server

375
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,080
and stick a hundred terabytes in it and and just forget about it at your well in my case my parents

376
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,640
house I could do my dad's I could probably even do it at Angela's house you know she has fiber at

377
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,560
her at her place she's a pretty good connection I know I know I would love that as far as protecting

378
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:39,680
my backups that I send to Google Drive which are things like my Docker config directories my Docker

379
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:45,440
compose files that kind of stuff I still am very happily using duplicati which I think I've been

380
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,480
using for the entire run of the show and that will do encryption for me and it handles the

381
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,600
both sides encrypting and decrypting side of it and I just love it and I have I've experimented

382
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,680
with using duplicati to save to multiple different cloud providers which is kind of what I would do

383
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,400
in the case of say mass deletion on Google Drive or some sort of issue but I haven't pulled the

384
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,840
trigger yet just because of the bandwidth requirements every single night to do that

385
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,880
it's not like Google ever killed a product either is it so it seems like drives pretty core but you

386
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,200
never know right they could also start doing you know stupid things like revoking API access for

387
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,720
third-party applications Google Drive itself as a core product is probably safe yeah although

388
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,680
nothing truly is with Google but the workarounds that I've been using for the last several years of

389
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,120
buying one seat of G Suite or whatever it's called this week and then just uploading three

390
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,920
or four terabytes I think those days are numbered so yeah I don't know if you saw but they're also

391
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:49,360
revoking sync access to the Chromium upstream you know open source browser they change the

392
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,520
terms all the time and I could see them revoking they've also revoked like the sign-on for Geary

393
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,880
the email client on Linux that's just hostile isn't it I thought their slogan was don't be evil

394
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,800
well I think their slogan now has become ginormous I'm not sure they've done a lot of stuff with

395
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:12,800
turning the screws on storage particularly in the last six months yeah so I really don't think that

396
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,480
relying on Google anymore as your off-site backup is going to be a viable strategy beyond

397
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,000
I think it's June this year the Google photos unlimited storage for pixel owners deal that was

398
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,320
that ended is now officially done too as this episode is out so that's all over yeah you're

399
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,000
right there hasn't been a lot of changes there that's why you mentioned it earlier

400
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,320
I think things like cloudfree.shop are the way to go because they're devices that have just been

401
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:45,120
they're pre-divorced from the cloud when you get them they've been pre-flashed with OS's that are

402
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,560
open source that just use your local network that don't need any cloud connection and like Alex said

403
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,520
it's somebody in the community that built this and I just think it's so cool they're like our

404
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,640
official unofficial sponsor we do have a promo right do we have a promo code we do yeah self-hosted

405
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,520
is the coupon code I think you get 10% off a light bulb and we get a little kickback from anything

406
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,720
else that you buy oh you know what I need light bulbs at the studio I was going to mention they

407
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,800
have that outdoor smart plug too which is slick but I actually am in the market for light bulbs

408
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,480
correction I think it's smart plugs not smart bulbs my bad sorry you know what man you got

409
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,640
me so excited I thought he's got like some sort of light bulb it's all built in over there no

410
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,600
that's cool that's cool the smart plugs smart plugs will do I thought of a slogan for them

411
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:39,040
though cloudfree.shop your cloud prenup that's pretty good I like that I like that yeah you

412
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,760
welcome that that's free what do you say we do a couple of NFC automation tricks that the audience

413
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,360
wrote in about because you know we've talked about these NFC tags a couple of times I have one right

414
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,480
here on the mixer that I've set up to do like D&D and stuff like that and turn on lights this is

415
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,440
particularly relevant for me right now because I've just switched to iOS I wanted to take my

416
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,520
camera game to the next level and boy is the camera on this thing good but moving some of the

417
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,920
NFC stuff across and just some of the you know more esoteric Android stuff that I like has been

418
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,480
tricky so with with iOS what happens is when I tap my NFC tag I then have to tap on a notification

419
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,600
that comes in on the phone which is just it's just one extra step right but someone wrote in with a

420
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,880
workaround oh yeah and this we got two workarounds and I was wondering about these so that's why I

421
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,200
love these emails because I had seen these as possibilities in the in the back of my mind I

422
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,720
was chewing on it as maybe something to try but these this confirms my suspicions Billy wrote in

423
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,080
with the first one on episode 35 you guys talked about NFC tags in the car I also use an NFC tag

424
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,400
to open my garage door just like the badger I switched recently from Android to an iPhone and

425
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,480
figured out a way to run the NFC automation without having to click the notification

426
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:56,240
it does require that you have your garage door brought into home kit which I am using via home

427
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,040
assistant he says then you just create an automation in the home app when a specific

428
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,320
tag is tapped like toggle the garage door it kind of sucks that you have to do it that way

429
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,880
but it is triggering a home assistant action if you're already using the app this is very easy

430
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,960
and it's simple to make it work you could just create a boolean that acts as a virtual switch

431
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,560
in the home app and then triggers a home assistant automation or action that's great that is a great

432
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,960
idea and I actually I have encouraged you off air but I'm encouraging you on air at some point in

433
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,760
the future to play around with the home kit integration with home assistant I don't know

434
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,280
if this gets talked about enough because I think maybe we have a lot of Android users out there

435
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,720
that are home assistant users but it brings all of the functionality and home assistant

436
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,280
into home kit and that makes it work with your watch with the home pods with Siri it's it's

437
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,200
pretty great I am glad that Billy wrote in with that one I'm also even more gladder that's not

438
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,040
a word but you know what I mean that he called me the badger that's fun that is fun Quinton Ronin

439
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,880
with maybe even a better one though uh he's also uh he says he's a site reliability engineer I think

440
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,520
one of you commented about using NFC tags I found a way around this you create a web hook in home

441
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,880
assistant and then use an automation on the phone which is created with the shortcuts app to call

442
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,320
that web hook you're allowed to trigger these from an NFC scan without having to confirm the action

443
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,160
manually and he has linked us to a post where he explains it more on his blog so I will include

444
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,560
that in the show notes but this isn't this if you look in the home assistant app you'll see this

445
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,920
web hooks action you combine that with a shortcuts app and you've essentially solved the problem so

446
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,520
you got two options and one of them doesn't require you mess around with home kit at all

447
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,040
that's neat I mean I I've only ever really used web hooks when it comes to Jenkins

448
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:49,280
so the fact that we can use them for something actually fun and useful cool hey just a thank

449
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,680
you to our members I've noticed some of these emails are from SREs and we really appreciate

450
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,480
everyone who becomes a site reliability engineer helps the show stay independent and as a thank you

451
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,280
you get a little extra content a limited ad feed with a little extra content at the end if you'd

452
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,880
like to help the show and become a member it's self-hosted.show slash sre and so Linus writes in

453
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,280
I don't know if it's that Linus although I doubt it let's just pretend okay Mr Torvalds I'm going

454
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,080
to give you advice on something yeah right okay Linus writes in could you give your opinions on

455
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,960
how your setup will survive you what will happen to your awesome setup if you aren't around anymore

456
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,840
will your spouse just pick up everything and it just work how can I strive towards such a situation

457
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:35,200
if worse comes to the worst thanks for a great podcast Linus. Deep question one that's a little

458
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,920
uncomfortable to think about sometimes I do think this played a little role in my recent

459
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:48,800
renewed push to document as much as my setup as possible in markdown but I know that no my my

460
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:56,080
family wouldn't wouldn't really use these systems I have documented the passwords in a password vault

461
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,320
that they have the password to so they if they needed to could get access to that and then they

462
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,200
could share that with somebody like Alex who could help spin stuff up or down for them and

463
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,160
you know transition them I think that's a great point plain text all the things as much as possible

464
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,160
and have a bit warden or a last pass or something like that yeah so right now it's in last pass

465
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,680
however I have been thinking about transitioning to something else like bit warden or or something

466
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,720
that is I mean it's something I want to have a conversation with them because I need to have

467
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,040
their buy off as well but I want to share you know primarily with my wife but there's some

468
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,400
things that I would leave for Angela too and so I kind of wanted something that could accommodate

469
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,800
different logins with different different credentials so if anybody has any suggestions

470
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,520
I'd love to know but what do you think about what would you think your wife would keep it going for

471
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,320
a bit do you think she'd ask just for somebody to help or do you think she'd just shut it down and

472
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,800
get a cable subscription and start reading books I mean what do you think she would do

473
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,160
well at the end of the day this stuff is my hobby right right and it just so happens I've been lucky

474
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,400
enough to turn it into a podcast and linux as a job but I also enjoy doing this stuff in my spare

475
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:10,080
time as well yeah I just don't see how she or anyone else in my family would have that level

476
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:16,960
of interest to keep things on the road beyond you know the initial six twelve months you know

477
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,240
that these things would probably continue running for untouched there are some things I think that

478
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,080
would be missed in terms of quality and life like plex like booksonic like home assistant

479
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,840
but are they sufficiently useful that it's not worth just buying a netflix membership or

480
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:43,520
or buying some proprietary smart home automation stuff like a lot of what we've done is ultimately

481
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:50,160
boils down to being nice to have versus absolutely critical I view it as critical because of my value

482
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,720
set and who I am but there's a huge swathe of people in my immediate circle in my family that

483
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:03,120
wouldn't care if that stuff went away tomorrow really so I think it would continue to work for

484
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,000
some time but ultimately it would sort of decay and die with me which is a bit sad to think about

485
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,120
yeah I think the things that they would care more about would be things like documents and photos

486
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,960
I think that is something that would be a little more significant and so that's something I try to

487
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,320
give thought to a little bit long term is just tripped in that maybe I haven't done a good enough

488
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,560
job with that currently but it wouldn't take a lot of work to make that pretty accessible

489
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,040
to my wife without my without my help maybe the way to think about this is try to think of things

490
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,640
that they would want access to and then make it as easy as possible for them but it's it's always

491
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,800
worth thinking and trying to build your systems that way if nothing else because even though it's

492
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,840
a little bit of a of a morbid thought I think it actually leads to building better systems

493
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,560
totally does I mean just just stop and ask yourself the question now if if something did happen to

494
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,760
you tomorrow or well even if it doesn't right if you just had to give your partner or your brother

495
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:07,600
or sister or parent or something your laptop and say go and do something you know download a photo

496
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:13,680
or find this this tax return or whatever it is do you think they'd be able to do it without you

497
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,920
going oh you just do this oh you just do that you know and if the answer is no then like Chris says

498
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,880
maybe maybe you need to write some better documentation and print it out or something

499
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,640
and put it in a safe or something and say go to this web URL and you will find the answers to the

500
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,920
kingdom you know it kind of goes back to a topic that comes up on our show well several times over

501
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,840
the you know the year plus run now because it's over a year now craftsmanship absolutely you know

502
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,600
and that can be another aspect of craftsmanship about your setup and why not because nobody else

503
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,920
is going to do it and it's your setup it's your opportunity to show a little craftsmanship and

504
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,240
also it's another it's another nice way for people to remember you guys look at the time and effort

505
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,000
he took to make this accessible for us so it's a win-win it's it's just a matter of time and I kind

506
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,480
of pulled back on it a little bit but you know what Mr Torvald's writing in here it's got me

507
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,600
feeling like I'm going to keep up with it again it's like inheriting uh someone else's workshop

508
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:14,400
tools you know yeah when my wife's dad passed away we inherited a bunch of his workshop stuff

509
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:21,520
and it was I don't know just just odd to be in someone else's cave you know and I guess it's a

510
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:28,480
similar situation with these types of systems so I'm all sad now thinking about this I feel like

511
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,080
if I logged into your box though I'd feel pretty comfortable I'd have a pretty quick yeah but

512
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:37,120
you're a massive nerd mate you know I know I know but that's what's I mean there's something about

513
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,280
that that's like kind of weird like server swapping we should try that sometime and then

514
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:49,760
record a reaction yeah like wife swap but shitter yeah just like almost like that but just a little

515
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,520
bit different just see what it's like where would it air would it air on tlc would that be the place

516
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,480
no I don't think they'd want it but you know it's funny is if you look at some of my servers

517
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,640
you can really see transitions and how I organize stuff or just legacy stuff like the way we have

518
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,720
the nas setup here is really really far removed on how I build a system now and the way I lay out

519
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,800
the disks and all of it and actually the the zfs array that we're using was originally set up and

520
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,520
partitioned and managed by alan jude so it's like extensively complex the man the mr legend yeah he

521
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,160
set it up while he was out here and we it's worked with us I mean it's clearly scaled for years

522
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,920
because we've changed out operating systems we've moved hardware but that zfs pool is still

523
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:42,640
there and that zfs pool just continues to grow and and survive but if you look at it now it's

524
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,240
a total total misrepresentation of how I would build a system not to mention just because it's

525
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,240
an arch server didn't it start life on bsd and now yeah like you say it's running arch yeah bsd

526
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,360
for a while I think it lived on fedor for a bit and now it's on arch and it's it's so far it

527
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:04,800
stayed there because it's a minimum viable arch so it's just the absolute bare minimum of a system

528
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,480
that was it coda where you're talking about minimum viable server and uh I was I was resonating so

529
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,960
hard with that because I've just switched over to proxmox and all of its weird abstractions and

530
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,640
stuff and I was thinking oh I was just on arch this would have been so easy I'd have been done

531
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:24,160
10 minutes ago you know but yep yep yep yeah there is something to that I also want to mention our

532
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,520
sponsor cloud guru is on social media so if you are learning this stuff right now and you want to

533
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,040
engage with them on social media they're just slash a cloud guru on youtube twitter and facebook

534
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:39,680
alex you're probably on twitter too I bet I sure am I'm there at let's stop that let's stop that

535
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:45,200
right now I am there at ironic badger yep and you can contact the show self-hosted show slash

536
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,880
contact that's the place to get in touch and get your email on the show I'm at Chris LAS and the

537
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,920
show itself is at self-hosted show on the twitter okay I almost started doing it again I'm sorry I'm

538
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,280
telling what came over me it was weird it got weird oh I shouldn't do accents that's what we've

539
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:09,040
learned you can find the network at Jupiter signal and that was self-hosted dot show slash 37.
