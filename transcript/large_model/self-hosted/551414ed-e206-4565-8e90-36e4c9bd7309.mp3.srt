1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
I have an idea for a charging station in the home that I think would be a brilliant way

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,040
to save battery life.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,880
I think I'm onto something here.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,080
So if you need to save battery life, why do you need a charging station?

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,080
Here's the thing.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,080
So you got your devices, right?

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,440
Like your laptops and your iPads.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,040
And the actual truth is you shouldn't keep these things at 100% charge state all the

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,040
time, right?

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,040
Whoa.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,040
No, no, no.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,880
Somewhere between 40 and 60% is probably ideal for the type of lithium ion batteries that

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,880
are in our devices.

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
Do you agree?

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,880
Yeah.

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,220
When I worked in the Genius Bar, I can't tell you the number of MacBooks I saw with batteries

17
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,840
that were exploding through the keyboard or stopping the trackpad from working.

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,540
I wish there was a way to just set in any OS, I want my battery level to be at this

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,800
unless I press I'm going traveling button.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,040
Here's what I'm thinking.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,720
So there's a couple of ways I think I could solve this, but I've got a really old MacBook

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,380
from like 2013 and the battery is still kind of working and I want to keep it alive.

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,160
And it dawned on me that they have that Home Assistant app for Mac OS that tracks your

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
battery life.

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
Oh my God, you're a genius.

26
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
Right?

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,440
So you just put the adapter, you plug that into a smart plug and you have Home Assistant

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,760
automatically turn off the smart plug when the Mac gets to 60%.

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,720
And I think you could probably do it with Linux.

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm wondering maybe somebody in the audience knows how you could report back a battery

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,820
status to Home Assistant, but...

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,680
That's a great idea, Brent.

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,280
So I want to expand the idea for other devices as well.

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,260
So I want input from people on how to do this, but essentially my goal would be to use a

35
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,600
couple of smart plugs that are managed by Home Assistant to charge things for a while

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,240
and then turn the charge off.

37
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,780
And if there was a way to do it intelligently, maybe I don't even need the sensor data.

38
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,040
Maybe I could just do it by like some math.

39
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,480
I don't know.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,000
That's my current goal at home right now.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,840
So if anybody has some suggestions, I'd like them.

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,000
In the meantime, if you just have a Mac that you want to limit the maximum charging for,

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,740
you should look into Aldente.

44
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,400
It works with Intel or M1 Macs and it's just letting you set a hard limit on the charge

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,180
before the system continues to charge, I suppose.

46
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,180
You could look into that.

47
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,180
We'll have a link in the show notes.

48
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,180
This is fantastic.

49
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:19,680
I gave my wife my old laptop last year sometime and I know for a fact, even though I've told

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,040
her you need to unplug it at least once a month and cycle the battery.

51
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,160
I know it's been sat there since my daughter was born and hasn't moved.

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
Right.

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,200
Well, we have like one Mac here in the studio that's for effects processing and it just

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,920
sits there always plugged in.

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,240
So I put this Aldente on there and capped it at 60%.

56
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,920
And then I started thinking, how could I do this where it's not Mac OS specific or maybe

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,760
it could be for multiple devices.

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,000
So I'm going to expand the idea.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,480
In the meantime, you could expand your mind at a cloud guru.

60
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,240
They are the leading in learning for the cloud Linux and other modern tech skills, hundreds

61
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,080
of courses, thousands of hands on labs.

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,220
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru.com.

63
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,240
I think we've talked about this before.

64
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,440
I'm talking of course about health checks to IO, but I've had a little epiphany with

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,800
health checks recently and I've started using it quite heavily for my own purposes.

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,840
I wonder if you used it for anything.

67
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,700
You have talked about it before and I've considered it, but I haven't been able to grok if it's

68
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,960
worth the setup time yet.

69
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,320
It was actually one of the things I've been meaning to talk to you about.

70
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:29,920
I did go last time we talked about it with the hosted service and one of the struggles

71
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,320
of being a self-hoster is do I self-host, do I use the hosted version?

72
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,580
With different services, I fall on different sides of that line and Bitward and I use the

73
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,460
hosted service and I pay, I think it's $10 or $12 a year for that.

74
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,680
With health checks, their hosted version is actually free for up to 10 health checks.

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,320
Beyond that, they have a pricing page.

76
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,640
The hobbyist is actually free for up to 20 jobs, not 10, my mistake.

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,720
Beyond that, you can pay $5 a month and you'll get some phone support and some email support

78
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:08,460
and then they have business plans at $20 and up for 100 jobs and stuff like that.

79
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:15,660
I was doing a bunch of different ZFS replication tasks and what I wanted to happen was I've

80
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,780
just done a whole bunch of hardware shuffles in my house.

81
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,780
You?

82
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,780
Never.

83
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,880
Well, this all stems from January when I was basing everything around GVTG and wanting

84
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,840
to do everything with that single Intel box and it didn't work out.

85
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,600
I've had to kind of rewind and kind of reconfigure a few things.

86
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,200
My old dual Xeon box is now purely Homelab that is running ESXi and it's just going to

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,960
sit in a corner turned off for 95% of its life now, just such an overkill for that box

88
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,440
because it's so powerful, but it consumes a lot of power in the process.

89
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,200
The Intel i5 system in the basement is the full-time one, but what I figured I could

90
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,880
do is take a couple of these slightly older 10 terabyte hard drives I have that are two

91
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,280
or three years old at this point, put those into the Homelab box and then schedule that

92
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,600
to turn on at least once a week.

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,320
I'll probably turn it on more whilst I'm working during the week and doing OpenShift stuff,

94
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,480
but what I wanted to happen was to have a local backup.

95
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:27,760
So I wanted my ZFS in the basement to replicate to the ZFS in my Homelab box upstairs and

96
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,240
to keep track of when the last backup was, I needed some kind of a tool to do that because

97
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,240
I've got a lot going on as we all do and I'm going to forget stuff.

98
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,640
The last thing I want is to come to need that backup and go, oh yes, the last time it ran

99
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
was 2019.

100
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Oh dear.

101
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Right.

102
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,080
Well, you recall that did happen to me where I had a Google account outage and so the backup

103
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,320
hadn't run for a little bit and I didn't realize it.

104
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Absolutely.

105
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,680
So I finally got round to setting up the self-hosted version of the health checks.

106
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,280
Now I'm running this on Linode because I actually foresaw a situation where all the servers

107
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,520
in my house are off for a couple of weeks, let's say I'm taking a vacation or something

108
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,880
or traveling to England to see grandparents or whatever.

109
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,680
Or maybe your power is turned off because you're getting solar installed.

110
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,480
Yes, that is happening soon actually.

111
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,780
And so I thought, right, where can I run this that is reliable and is going to be more reliable

112
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,780
than my house?

113
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,520
And I thought Linode was a perfect fit for that.

114
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,480
So this is running on one of their $5 a month Linodes, it's the same one that's doing perfect

115
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,740
media server.com and my personal blog and all the rest of it.

116
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,240
So this box is serving like quintuple duty at this point.

117
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,520
It's doing a lot of stuff for me and it's only a five, it's only a five or a month.

118
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,120
The self-hosted version of health checks, I'm running the Linux server Docker, which

119
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,600
was written by one of my friends also called Alex.

120
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,000
He has done a bunch of work with making sure that it pulls in the latest code from the

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
health checks repo.

122
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,900
So there is as always with containers, it seems a choice to be made about which container

123
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,900
do I run?

124
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:16,020
Do I run the official one or do I run the Linux server one or some other random one?

125
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,520
I try and run the Linux server ones for obvious reasons whenever I can, if for no other reason

126
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,400
than they auto update, which is kind of nice when you restart the app.

127
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,840
So you get all the features with this self-hosted version that you don't get on the hosted version.

128
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,600
So actually in this case, self-hosting gives you more functionality than the hosted version,

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
which is always nice.

130
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,160
And there are a bunch of integrations.

131
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,920
I'm just using one with pushover, which is a push notification service, which you configure

132
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,980
through environment variables for the container.

133
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:54,200
You generate a token with pushover and pass that through an environment variable in your

134
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,720
Docker compose file or however you like to do that.

135
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,420
It also supports a bunch of other interesting stuff like Prometheus, Ops Genie, if you're

136
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,100
doing something for work, this can be useful.

137
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,760
You can have it ping Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Mattermost, it does webhooks.

138
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,440
There really are a lot of integrations for alerting.

139
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,420
I'm just using pushover, as I said.

140
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,960
It's really nice because I don't really see it if it's in the log file.

141
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,760
But if I got a message in the same communications tool I'm using to chat with you and Wes or

142
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,580
something like that, then I'm definitely going to see it.

143
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,300
And then I'm going to be able to take action on it.

144
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,120
And so just those small things like being able to send a message to Slack, it makes

145
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,640
a huge difference for me, Alex.

146
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,120
It supports Telegram as well.

147
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,240
So if you have a group of people, you can actually have it interact with bots as well,

148
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,680
I think, and do a bunch of stuff with that.

149
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,700
So you could make this really quite deeply integrated into some kind of an incident response

150
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,640
solution type thing.

151
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I don't really need that.

152
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,400
I just need to be reminded that, hey, dummy, you haven't run your backups for two weeks.

153
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,720
Did I track that in that description of yours, you transitioned from the hosted solution

154
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,200
to the self-hosted version?

155
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Yeah.

156
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
And why was that?

157
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,560
Well, number one, I was running up against the 20 job limit, which I thought was 10.

158
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,180
So maybe I wasn't running up against it.

159
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,400
But I knew I was going to be running into that limit soon anyway.

160
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,800
And I also, as part of being the host of this show, feel a responsibility to try these things

161
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,480
out on occasion.

162
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,520
That's how I felt.

163
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,240
Not just because of that, but because I could host it, say, on a VPS, and then I could check

164
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,880
even the systems here on the LAN at the studio, it might be worth doing.

165
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
What kind of setup am I looking at, though?

166
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,040
Because things I'd like to monitor is like, is Nextcloud running?

167
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
So what does that mean?

168
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,160
It means, is the web port available, is the database server online?

169
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
I guess is the web page loading?

170
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
I'd like to know that kind of stuff.

171
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,400
But there's all kinds of other things.

172
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,720
Like I'd like to know, we have our Matrix server that we run.

173
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,680
That isn't on the LAN, but it's a server we manage.

174
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
And Matrix eats a crap ton of RAM right now.

175
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,120
The Synapse server is definitely a work in progress.

176
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,280
And it's something that we have to log in and manage from time to time, and even restart

177
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,040
sometimes or go through some sort of cleanup.

178
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,480
And I'm wondering, what about those kind of scenarios where the system's running out of

179
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,080
memory?

180
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,640
Does it do that kind of monitoring, that kind of reporting?

181
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,280
Or is it more failed yes or working, that kind of stuff?

182
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,400
It's a great question, because it's a bit of a confusing area, all this monitoring and

183
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,000
alerting type stuff.

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,800
So Health Checks is primarily designed to be run as part of a script or a cron job or

185
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,180
something like that.

186
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,940
And the way it works is you curl a URL, you hit a URL.

187
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,200
The Health Checks API on the other end receives that request and goes, hey, I've just been

188
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,120
pinged on this random string of URL UUID type stuff.

189
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,720
That's a phoning home.

190
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,140
That is that job completing.

191
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:03,720
So if you put it at the end of a backup script, say the very last line is curl https healthchecks.com

192
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,360
your slash UUID, then the software knows that you've successfully got to the end of that

193
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,880
script and it assumes that everything's gone well.

194
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,360
What you're looking for, I suspect, is something more along the lines of Prometheus, which

195
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,420
is designed to monitor disk space and memory usage and CPU temperatures and percentage

196
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,200
and all that kind of crap.

197
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,080
And Prometheus will then output to something called Alert Manager, and you can write what's

198
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,440
called PromQL, Prometheus Query Language queries.

199
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Sounds complicated.

200
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,400
It's much easier than SQL to get started with.

201
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:43,240
So if you've ever had to write an SQL query, you can probably write a PromQL one.

202
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,200
And that's probably more what you're after in terms of monitoring, you know, is matrix,

203
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,680
is the API still available?

204
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,240
For example, can I still hit a certain URL?

205
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,120
Is that website still available?

206
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,440
In the meantime, I've been keeping an eye on it with NetData, which feels like a cheat.

207
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,040
I feel like I almost am ashamed to admit it, but it's been handy and I've used that to

208
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
kind of keep an eye on the system, but I know I need to take it to the next step.

209
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,960
Maybe a topic for a future episode.

210
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,560
Who doesn't love a pretty graph, eh?

211
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,800
Speaking of which, did you know about this command I found out quite recently about this

212
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
one?

213
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,840
Docker stats.

214
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,940
Just go to a box where you've got a few containers running and take a look at this.

215
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,940
This is pretty great.

216
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:27,240
In fact, this is one of the ways I realized how much memory and CPU matrix actually takes.

217
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,760
All the snaps, at least.

218
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,560
This is kind of like top for your Docker containers.

219
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,640
It gives you CPU usage, memory, IO, and all that kind of stuff, and you can also just

220
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,160
get a list for a singled container if you specify that container, if that's what your

221
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,480
permissions only allow for.

222
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,520
But if you can see all of the containers, then you can just run Docker stats on its

223
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,080
own and get a list of everything on the box, and I was surprised because I run ping stat

224
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,400
here at the studio, so I just thought, well, I'll check it right before the show.

225
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,560
And I ran that, and it comes up, and ping stat, which is just ping and stuff and graphing

226
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
it, right?

227
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,820
300% of my CPU when I ran this command, and I'm like, what is it doing?

228
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,600
But then I sat there and watched it for probably five minutes, and it never once again really

229
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
did anything.

230
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,580
But that brief moment when I brought it up, Alex, is 300% of my CPU on my server for ping

231
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,580
stat.

232
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,520
Yeah, it's pretty interesting, isn't it?

233
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:28,680
If I go into my cloud VPS where the Unify controller is running, that damn thing has

234
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,920
117 processes under one container.

235
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
Yeah, yeah, that's...

236
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Eesh.

237
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,380
I don't know how that makes me feel.

238
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,120
It doesn't make me feel good, I'll be honest.

239
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,980
Linode.com slash SSH.

240
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:48,240
Go there to get a $100 credit on a new account for 60 days, and of course, you support the

241
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
show.

242
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,760
Linode is the largest independent cloud computing provider out there.

243
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,320
No matter what technology stack you're familiar with, you're gonna find Linode easy to use.

244
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,600
And if you're an expert under the hood, there's a little thing here or there, little hints

245
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,200
that you'll see for us longtime Linux users that will make things even quicker and more

246
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,880
efficient and things you'll really appreciate.

247
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,840
And if you ever run into any trouble, Linode has fantastic, amazing, great customer service

248
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,400
24-7 by phone or by ticket, whatever you prefer, and they have hundreds of guides and tutorials

249
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,200
to help you get started.

250
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,520
And we often will link to some in the notes.

251
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,520
There's one that I recommend anybody that wants to run phpMyAdmin, give that one a read.

252
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,640
That's just a few steps you can go through to make that a much more secure installation.

253
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,720
Linode is easy to use and they have a powerful cloud dashboard, and they also have S3 compatible

254
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,100
object storage.

255
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,820
This could be something that works great for your backup strategy.

256
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,960
A lot of applications and tools can integrate and backup to S3 compatible storage.

257
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,880
And Linode has fantastic pricing, and you could build that right into your backup or

258
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,320
recovery strategy.

259
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,620
But additionally, you could also just use it for a static website, for hosting any kind

260
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,960
of files you need out in the cloud where you don't wanna have to run a server in front

261
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
of it.

262
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,040
And they have simple one-click application deployments, if that's more of your jive,

263
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,360
which I totally respect because Linode is a fantastic learning platform as well.

264
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,040
Deploy an application, learn how it works.

265
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Linode's great for that.

266
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,320
They're a $100 credit.

267
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,360
There's all kinds of things you can try, and learning something, trying it out is a great

268
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
use of that too.

269
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,780
I mean, absolutely, you can put it in production, but why not use that credit to learn something

270
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
new as well?

271
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,800
So go to linode.com slash SSH, get that $100 60-day credit and support the show.

272
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,320
That's linode.com slash SSH.

273
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,920
Now you know how I love me some Blue Iris stuff.

274
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,520
Some pretty exciting news in the last couple of weeks about deep stack integration with

275
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,000
Blue Iris.

276
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,600
Traditionally, what you had to do to get object detection, you know, bird, car, plane, bear,

277
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,140
I think was one of the options.

278
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,920
You want bear detection for sure.

279
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Yeah, probably.

280
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,840
Yeah, if a bear is in the woods, does it, how does the saying go?

281
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,660
Actually, I don't care where you are.

282
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,120
If there's a bear in your backyard, even where you live, Alex, I think you'd wanna know about

283
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
it.

284
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,560
What's particularly exciting about this latest Blue Iris update is that built right in now

285
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:20,480
to the Blue Iris software, you can launch DeepStack natively on the Windows system that

286
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,580
it's running on.

287
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:28,760
So you don't need a helper program or any kind of a JPEG kind of detection intermediary

288
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
software anymore.

289
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,680
It's just all done within Blue Iris.

290
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,840
So I've put a link to a YouTube video in the description, which talks you through how to

291
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
set that up.

292
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,240
DeepStack gets even better, tempting me to come over to the Windows side, but it's not

293
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,960
gonna happen just yet.

294
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,880
You know, I actually find a lot of utility in just bringing the video feeds into Home

295
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,200
Assistant and having a dashboard in Home Assistant I can go to and just get live camera feeds.

296
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,640
So that, you know, that would just be a great integration one day, is something that manages

297
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
all of that.

298
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Absolutely.

299
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,480
Alex, I know you're a big ZFS guy, so have you seen zfs.rent?

300
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
I have, yes.

301
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,080
Oh my goodness, this thing looks really, really cool.

302
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,880
I can't remember where I discovered it.

303
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,280
I think it was on the self-hosted Discord.

304
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,760
Somebody just said to me, have you, why don't you use zfs.rent and I'm like, because I didn't

305
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,280
know about it.

306
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,600
The whole premise behind zfs.rent is that it's a simple cloud service to store ZFS snapshots.

307
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,140
Effectively, it's like having a ZFS send, but in a co-located data center, but their

308
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,540
business model is really pretty interesting.

309
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:38,440
So these guys rent out KVM virtual machines and they have dedicated hard drives to each

310
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
VM.

311
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,320
So I guess they're using pass-through or something.

312
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,920
There is no sharing and no over-committing on these VMs.

313
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,600
And when you sign up to their service, you receive a root password, a dedicated IBV4

314
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
address.

315
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,080
So you could, you know, alias that to a sub-domain of your choosing.

316
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,960
And then you get a pre-formatted and mounted ZFS pool.

317
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,320
Here's where it gets really, really interesting.

318
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,840
You can send them hard drives with data already on them to their data center.

319
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,620
I love that.

320
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,620
That's great.

321
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,400
You know, you were just talking about how you had those 10 terabyte drives that you

322
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,040
were kind of using as just scratch drives for backup.

323
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
That's a great example.

324
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,200
You could load those suckers up and send them off.

325
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Absolutely.

326
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Yeah.

327
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Now pricing is pretty straightforward.

328
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
It's 10 bucks a month per drive.

329
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,800
So if you can go on Best Buy and find one of their easy stores on a cheap deal, you could

330
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:35,840
have, you know, a 14 terabyte drive for $200, load that sucker up with all of your data,

331
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,820
send it off to this data center, and for 10 bucks a month, you've got 14 terabytes of

332
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
cloud storage.

333
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,640
You know, that is doable for what I do here, right?

334
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
It's one of those things.

335
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,600
You sort of read the website and you're like, where's the catch?

336
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
There's got to be a catch.

337
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,240
I was actually speaking with Ryan, who's the guy behind ZFS.Rent, and I'm hoping to get

338
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,760
him on the show to do an interview shortly, but he seems like a really great guy.

339
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,360
And honestly, I have no qualms about recommending this service, even just as a, hey guys, you

340
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,040
know, audience, did you know this cool thing existed?

341
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Yeah.

342
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Nope.

343
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
No sponsor, no relationship of any kind.

344
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,160
It's just something we came across.

345
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,560
Each plan includes one terabyte of base bandwidth data movement per month.

346
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,800
They don't distinguish between upload or download.

347
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,640
A terabyte is a terabyte.

348
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,960
They have a rate of an additional $5 per terabyte after that, which is actually pretty reasonable.

349
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,400
If I'm uploading more than a terabyte in a month, my ISP is probably knocking on my door.

350
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,840
I would imagine the time where you would actually need to exceed a terabyte is the initial seeding.

351
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,720
Well, we can get round that by sending them the drive preceded or in a disaster recovery

352
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
scenario.

353
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,560
And if I'm at the point where I need to download 14 terabytes of data from my backup, I think

354
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,840
I can probably swing, you know, the hundred bucks or whatever it is to get that.

355
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,480
That's just what I was thinking is that's really the only time it would be costly is

356
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,400
when you're actually pulling it all back down.

357
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,680
I wonder if they would do that, although you wouldn't really want to wait.

358
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,960
But I guess they could maybe reload a disk.

359
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,440
You could send them the disk and they could reload it up.

360
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,480
Now, did you see this on their home page?

361
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,720
Users have a choice of from OS's, CentOS with maintenance support until 2029 crossed out

362
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
to 2021.

363
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,280
Oh, too soon.

364
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:27,200
So Ubuntu and Debian, but here's where I thought it got super interesting is as an arch guy,

365
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,540
no pre-installed OS.

366
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:35,800
You can attach your own Linux ISO to the KVM virtual machine and install via a tunneled

367
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,720
VNC client any OS that you want.

368
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,760
That's adorable.

369
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,960
That's a really great setup.

370
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,680
They also do support Debian 10.7 out of the box and Ubuntu 20.04 until 2025, which is

371
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,560
honestly what I would just do.

372
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,000
I think it's too it's so great that they left the 2029 on there and crossed it out.

373
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,040
Like that's such a statement.

374
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,080
I've actually just deployed my first CentOS 8 stream box in production.

375
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,400
We're doing a small, limited Jupiter colony mail server for like a handful of people right

376
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,160
now, and it's all running on CentOS 8 stream.

377
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Look at you, you hipster.

378
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
Yeah, I'm going to.

379
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,960
So I'm going to give it a go and see how it is to to run a mail server.

380
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,240
I'll report back.

381
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,520
I suspect there's going to be crappy aspects to it.

382
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,400
This episode is brought to you by Synology, makers of network attached storage devices,

383
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
networking and surveillance equipment.

384
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:42,320
In late 2020, they released the DS1621+, a six bay NAS unit with a four core, eight thread

385
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,300
Ryzen CPU.

386
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:49,280
As a result, this system runs cool and quiet whilst being a powerhouse under the hood.

387
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,800
And if you need it, there's a PCIe slot for adding cards such as 10 gigabit networking

388
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,260
as well.

389
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,520
What really sets Synology units apart from their competition for me though, is their

390
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,180
level of fit and finish.

391
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,520
Their enclosures are beautiful and their software is really great as well.

392
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,720
I'm talking about their disk station management software.

393
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,400
DSM is like using a desktop session inside a browser.

394
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,800
It's really cool if you haven't seen it.

395
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,480
And we've got a link for a live demo for you at selfhosted.show slash Synology.

396
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,480
This simple and intuitive UI is perfect for those just getting started on their self hosting

397
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
journey.

398
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,240
I've used Synology's now for many years and I still can't quite believe how they pulled

399
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,420
this off in a browser.

400
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,860
You can also find tons of apps available in their built-in store, as well as community

401
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,880
provided repos and more recently, Docker support.

402
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,320
With this Docker support, you can run darn near anything you like on these boxes.

403
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,660
And remember that with that Ryzen chip, you've got full x86 compatibility, so there's no

404
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,520
arm weirdness going on here.

405
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,600
To find out more about Synology and their other NAS products, visit selfhosted.show

406
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,280
slash Synology so that they know we sent you and to support the show.

407
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,040
A big thanks to Synology for sponsoring our show.

408
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,880
Synology wanted us to actually have a chance to try out some of their hardware, and so

409
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,560
we thought we'd share our thoughts with you and they sent a DS1621 plus to Alex to kick

410
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
the tires.

411
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
They did indeed.

412
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
Yes.

413
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,960
So I am the proud recipient of a Ryzen powered NAS.

414
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
That's pretty neat.

415
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,000
That left me thinking, how do I go about reviewing a NAS?

416
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,640
Because it's, you know, it's something you just throw files on and forget about for the

417
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
next few years.

418
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,600
And when I hear Ryzen, I think it probably has a fair amount of CPU power in that thing.

419
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,940
This is one of their embedded chips.

420
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,920
This is the Ryzen V1500B.

421
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:45,480
It's a four core, 2.2 gigahertz, eight thread CPU, and it supports up to 32 gigabytes of

422
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,440
ECC memory, which is pretty nice.

423
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,580
The motherboard built into the Synology also has a couple of NVME slots, which I thought

424
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,760
was particularly interesting.

425
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,080
And one of the things actually that I was most disappointed about with the COBOL, you

426
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,640
know, the Helios 64, was that it was a five bay NAS.

427
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,400
But if you use the NVME slot that came with it, you turned it into a four bay NAS.

428
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,920
Well, there's none of that going on here.

429
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:16,360
This remains to be a six bay NAS with two extra PCIe NVME slots as well.

430
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,680
So you can fit effectively eight drives in this thing, which is great.

431
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
That's great.

432
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Yeah, that is.

433
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,400
Now the fit and finish really is next level on this thing.

434
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:31,840
In five minutes of taking it out of the box, I had the drive cages removed with the tool-less

435
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,200
hot swappable drive cages they have.

436
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,600
I had the drives installed, put them into the enclosure.

437
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,140
One important thing to note is that you must populate the first drive slot with a drive.

438
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,200
And if you don't, the Synology will fail to boot.

439
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,120
And I assume this is because they're installing the DSM OS onto that first drive.

440
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,920
Now, I don't know what that means for the long-term reliability of a spinning drive

441
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,360
in that first slot, but it's something I can report back on in a few months' time.

442
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,360
Yeah.

443
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,600
And it could just be that maybe it just doesn't proceed because what's the point of a NAS

444
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
with no disk?

445
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,160
Well, you say that, but these things have full-on app stores these days, and they can

446
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,220
run Docker as well.

447
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:20,000
So you could conceivably buy a Synology unit and not put any drives in it and still run

448
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,320
some services if you liked.

449
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,880
I don't know why you would, but you could.

450
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,500
It is easy to deploy applications on, I suppose.

451
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
That's a good point.

452
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,320
I'm curious about just physical size and noise and those kinds of things.

453
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
How was all that?

454
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,280
And give me an idea of how much space this thing takes up.

455
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,600
Noise is great.

456
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,520
The fans that are included in the unit are very, very quiet.

457
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,500
I've actually had it in a closet right just off my office a few feet from where we're

458
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
sat right now.

459
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,600
And I closed that door, and I can't hear it.

460
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,440
It's just, oh, it's pretty quiet.

461
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,200
You'll hear it if it's on the desk next to you, but that's more a result of the fact

462
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,120
of having mechanical hard drives than it is fan noise right next to you.

463
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:07,080
In terms of the size of the thing, I think it's about five kilos, give or take.

464
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,080
I don't know.

465
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,280
The footprint's about the size of a 16-inch laptop, maybe a little bit less.

466
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,320
And then, I don't know, nine inches tall or so.

467
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,680
Basically think of six hard drives lying on their side with a couple of inches either

468
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
side.

469
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
That absolutely makes sense.

470
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,760
And now, also, I think that means you're a ButterFS user, which I think is fantastic.

471
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,040
Well, it would if I had chosen ButterFS.

472
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
Which I did.

473
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
I did.

474
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Oh, OK.

475
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Hello.

476
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Welcome to the club.

477
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,160
You and I are now running ButterFS at home.

478
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,320
The reason I picked ButterFS is because it enables compression and snapshots.

479
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,200
And that's an option that's exposed to the users at the time of creating the array or

480
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,920
the volume of storage in the DSM software.

481
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,680
So let's talk about software for a little bit.

482
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:56,000
So this thing does run the DSM, which is their OS, and it has a nice interface on it, which

483
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,960
has an app store.

484
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,660
But you're a long-termer.

485
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,600
You don't necessarily always like the graphical environments on top of stuff in the management

486
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
tool.

487
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
So how did you handle all of that?

488
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
How did you react to it?

489
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
What were your thoughts?

490
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,400
So I'll tell you who I think this system is actually perfect for.

491
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,680
It's those people just getting started in self-hosting who want their hand holding a

492
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,880
little bit, but are also comfortable with the idea that they have to learn some stuff

493
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,400
to run these services.

494
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,560
And through the UI, you are guided through the process of setting up Docker containers,

495
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:36,720
of sharing folders, of doing file service sharing like Samba, and all the rest of it,

496
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,400
you know, like time machine backups and all that kind of stuff.

497
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,520
Creating users.

498
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,360
A lot of times people ask me when they read the perfect media server, what's the best

499
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
GUI?

500
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,840
And I'm like, well, it's the command line, silly.

501
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,720
But actually, I think it's something like this.

502
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,720
I don't think a really good GUI for server management on Linux truly exists.

503
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,840
I know you like cockpit, but I don't think there's anything quite on this scale for vanilla

504
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
Linux.

505
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Right.

506
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Nothing this straightforward.

507
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,800
Nothing this straightforward and nothing this comprehensive.

508
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Yeah.

509
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
This does a lot more than cockpit.

510
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,760
Yeah, absolutely does.

511
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,400
And sometimes that can be to its detriment because you think, right, I just want to have

512
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,240
a composed file and paste it in and create these five containers like this, please.

513
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Right.

514
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,800
Whereas with the UI that Synology has, you have to click through a few things and create

515
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,360
volumes and all the knobs and switches are labeled all the same as they would be in a

516
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,360
composed file.

517
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,600
But you just have to go through and click them, which, you know, if I'm trying to explain

518
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,040
this to my mother over the phone, for example, and she's actually had a Synology unit in

519
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:47,320
her house now for, I want to say five years, and I've not really had to touch it or think

520
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
about it.

521
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,040
I mean, it just keeps on working this thing.

522
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,640
And I think the long-term outlook for the Synology unit for me is going to be, it's

523
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,000
going to end up at a parent's house, which is no bad thing in my opinion.

524
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,320
I think it's a sign of, you know, I said this a few episodes ago.

525
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,960
I bought a Raspberry Pi for eight gig and an external USB hard drive, and I've been

526
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,800
having the most difficult time trying to get that thing to USB boot with my sister's fiance

527
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,580
trying to talk him through how to set the Raspberry Pi up with USB boot and then flash

528
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,580
it remotely.

529
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,960
And oh, what a pain.

530
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,920
And I'm thinking to myself, well, if I just had this Synology, I could just send it to

531
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,880
them and it looks nice.

532
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,020
It's nice and quiet.

533
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,400
There's no cables to be unplugged by the cat, you know?

534
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:43,400
I think Angela's been running one at her house for probably seven to eight years.

535
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,240
I don't even know.

536
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,920
It's crazy how long that thing has been running.

537
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,200
So it seems like it's been pretty solid.

538
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,200
I think for the people who like to deploy something and then begin to figure it out

539
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,280
and learn how it works, it fits that so well.

540
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,980
I worked with Synology to get one of these for Wes for Christmas because it's not that

541
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:09,500
Wes doesn't know how to manage a server, obviously, but he just doesn't really have the time.

542
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,000
He's got other stuff to do, right?

543
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,700
He still wants to be able to run Jellyfin in his case and manage his media and save

544
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:22,080
files to a centralized location on his network, but he doesn't have the time to build a box

545
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,160
and set up all of the services, even though he knows how.

546
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,180
And so I thought a Synology would be perfect for him, too.

547
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:33,740
And so we say it's for beginners, but it's also just for people who got a lot going on,

548
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,220
like people just kind of like in your situation that just maybe have a little less time or

549
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,620
interest in building it completely from scratch.

550
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,700
I think I agree totally.

551
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:50,100
Now one thing I would like to discuss is the version of Docker that's running on the NAS

552
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:57,300
and it's running 18.09, which as the name suggests, comes from 2018.

553
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,640
So what this means is if you SSH into the Synology, you can get in behind the scenes

554
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,440
and go and tinker with what's going on and you think to yourself, great, I'm just going

555
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,880
to use Docker compose and I will circumvent the UI and just do it that way.

556
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,400
But unfortunately, because that version of Docker is so old, it means a lot of the newer

557
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,620
features in Docker compose aren't supported.

558
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,180
So you then think to yourself, hmm, I could upgrade the version of Docker, couldn't I?

559
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,320
And yes, you can.

560
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,400
There is a GitHub repo to do that in an unsupported fashion.

561
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,940
And then you quickly run into all sorts of problems trying to figure out how networking

562
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,520
bridging works and all that kind of stuff and wish you'd never bothered.

563
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,660
So my recommendation with Docker would be to just stick to the UI on the Synology and

564
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,780
it will just work brilliantly.

565
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:49,140
And then if you're a crazy kid like Alex, you could just end up using your Synology

566
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,740
as an iSCSI endpoint and point your VMware infrastructure at it.

567
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,740
That's true.

568
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,740
Actually, yeah.

569
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:00,940
You see Synology in the backgrounds of so many tech YouTuber videos, Network Chuck,

570
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:06,020
Lawrence Systems, Tom from Lawrence Systems, they've all got Synology blinking away in

571
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
the background.

572
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,980
And I've often wondered, what are these guys that surely know better, right?

573
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,860
In air quotes, what are they all doing with their Synologies?

574
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,340
And it turns out, actually, if you fill this sucker up with SSDs and put a 10 gig networking

575
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,860
card in there, you can get some seriously good performance over iSCSI with VMware, which

576
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,780
Synology have worked very hard to get the official certification for.

577
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
Yeah.

578
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,780
I remember we were talking to Wendell and he even thought that was pretty remarkable

579
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:37,660
back in the day, but it is pretty good to see it and a nice little home lab addition.

580
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,300
So if you have something like an Intel NUC that doesn't have much storage and you want

581
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:47,180
a cheap way to add six, eight, or more drives, because Synology offer a lot of different

582
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:55,420
products, buy Synology, use iSCSI, and then your NUC suddenly has 20 terabytes to go out.

583
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,460
I can see it too.

584
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,540
Maybe one day I'll have all these Raspberry Pis and then they'll just be one centralized

585
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,260
storage to be able to support VMware is pretty great.

586
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,780
But when you were messing around with this, one thing I didn't hear you talk about was

587
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:14,020
if you dug into what your backup options would be, if you felt like you were limited, maybe

588
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,460
by the DSM, by what your backup backup options could be, what was that experience like?

589
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,140
Well, it's not running ZFS.

590
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:27,000
So I needed a way in which to do versioned snapshots and incremental backups.

591
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,280
Incremental backups are really important because rather than sending the entire file system

592
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,420
every single time, it only sends the bits and bytes that have changed.

593
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:42,180
Now ZFS does this at the block level, but because I'm going from ZFS to ButterFS, there's

594
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,940
no mechanism in place to do that.

595
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,300
Now I could use rsync, but then it's going through and it's checking MD5 hashes every

596
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,420
time and it can be a bit slow and a bit clunky.

597
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,220
And I tripped over something called Minio.

598
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,180
I actually mentioned this, I think with the orange one last week.

599
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,080
I tripped over Minio, which is a S3 front end.

600
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,620
Now this provides the S3 object storage API on your LAN effectively backed by your own

601
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,620
storage.

602
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:16,220
Now the advantage that that gives you is that you can use a tool such as RESTIC to do incremental

603
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:21,620
versioned snapshot backups to this S3 endpoint backed by the Synology.

604
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,080
All right, so pause because this is a big deal and this is probably something we should

605
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:31,340
dedicate an entire episode to, but this lets you build your own S3 object storage on your

606
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,700
LAN or maybe up in the cloud.

607
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,380
There's a lot of ways you could use this if you think about it.

608
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,460
Yeah, we should come back to this as a separate topic, but okay.

609
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,460
So let me unpack this.

610
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,720
So you have something like this set up on your LAN running, exposing some storage that

611
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,700
you're then making available to the DSM software, or how does this work?

612
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:55,620
Minio is running as a container that's then backed by a volume mount to one of the volumes

613
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,220
on the Synology itself.

614
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:03,060
Lots of volumes terms going on here, but that's where it gets a little confusing.

615
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,420
So essentially what happens is Minio is running as a container.

616
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:13,940
It presents itself as an API that I can then call from RESTIC, and RESTIC will then just

617
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,180
store the data on those S3 buckets as objects.

618
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,300
That's worth doing too, Alex, because it seems like you could use that for other stuff in

619
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,300
the future as well, because there's a lot of things that will just plug right into that.

620
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,000
It does free you up from the ZFS kind of train, if you like.

621
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,100
So if something like zfs.rent isn't up your street and you want to host just a few hundred

622
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,700
megabytes of files, then something like RESTIC is going to do you really well.

623
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,240
One of the most difficult parts of using RESTIC is configuring it.

624
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,140
Now I came across a project this week which solves that problem in a really beautiful

625
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,860
way called auto RESTIC.

626
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,500
Now there's a link to this thing in the show notes, but essentially what happens is you

627
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:59,140
define the locations and the backends in a YAML file, and you're done.

628
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,500
That's not so bad to manage, I mean that sounds like something that I could probably wrap

629
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
my head around.

630
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,700
What's really nice as well is if you just have a local backend, which is just some dumb

631
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:16,220
USB hard drive, you can actually have as one of your backends just HDD type local path

632
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,340
my external storage, and it's as simple as that.

633
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,820
Oh, although my backend is never dumb, but that does seem really nice.

634
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:27,060
I didn't mean as an insult darling.

635
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,820
There's a bunch of other cool stuff that auto RESTIC supports as well, like hooks.

636
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,820
So if you want to perform some commands before or after a specific backup, let's say you

637
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,980
want to delete some files after a backup's happened, for example, you can do that using

638
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,600
the hooks that are built into auto RESTIC.

639
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,420
You can also exclude files as well, and there is a forget policy.

640
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:53,500
So one of the favorite things about ZFS send for me is when I use Jim Salters Sanoid tool,

641
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:59,820
it has a policy driven snapshot engine, which will automatically keep the last hour or the

642
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,900
last six hours and then the last six days and then the last six weeks and then the last

643
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,820
six months, it'll keep one snapshot from each of those different timestamps.

644
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,980
Auto RESTIC also has a forget and prune policy engine built right into it, which you configure

645
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,500
again in the YAML right next to the location that you're defining.

646
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,180
It's the way RESTIC should work.

647
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,700
Yeah, that does sound nice.

648
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,700
Well, very good.

649
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,420
We will have a link to that at selfhosted.show slash 43.

650
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,700
Now before we go, Alex, Jase Novell wrote in on the Discord, so I guess that's more

651
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,260
like sent a message on Discord and then we thought that's a good question to read on

652
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,260
the show.

653
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,140
But he says, I'm working through the planning stages of building a new home.

654
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,700
Oh, I love that.

655
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,700
Really?

656
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,700
Oh, I'm envious.

657
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,700
Yeah.

658
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,700
He writes, if you are all starting from scratch, how would you design a smart home that would

659
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,700
get the wife approval factor, but at the same time, not be too much overkill?

660
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,940
Well, that actually feels like that's how you achieve the wife approval factor is not

661
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,280
going overkill.

662
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,940
But I get the spirit of his question, like what's a reasonable kind of build it in while

663
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,260
I have the opportunity, but not go excessive.

664
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,340
Automated flame throwers on the driveway should do the trick.

665
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,340
Right.

666
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,660
And laser pointers on articulating arms so that way you can, you know, you could just

667
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,220
put that out there and that way the pets stay entertained.

668
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,860
No, but really thinking about it, it comes down in my mind, like the first place I go

669
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,220
to is just solid networking.

670
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:32,420
Whilst you've got those walls open, run as many high quality cables as you can.

671
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,420
Yeah.

672
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,620
I would suggest starting with Cat 6a as a minimum.

673
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,820
Yes, it could be considered a little bit overkill, you know, 5e will do quite comfortably gigabit

674
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:46,780
ethernet and even you'll even do 10 gig over a very short distance, but Cat 6a will give

675
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,100
you 10 gig guaranteed.

676
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,900
I think it's like three or 500 feet, something like that.

677
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,500
And if you're thinking about the lifetime of a house, which could be 50 plus years,

678
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,700
you really want to put in there as good as you can afford to at the time you're building

679
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,500
it because having retrofitted a couple of houses with ethernet cable, let me tell you,

680
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,180
pulling cable is no fun.

681
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:15,140
It's how you'll do everything from cameras to smoke detectors to sensors to Wi-Fi endpoints.

682
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:20,620
Everything's better with ethernet or just workstations, televisions, media set top boxes.

683
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,540
You'll never beat wired.

684
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,940
As good as wireless gets, it cannot just beat a physical copper connection.

685
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,520
It's just the reality of physics right now.

686
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,620
And I just so completely agree with Alex.

687
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:36,480
I have a buddy right now who is building a tiny home and it's a really cool place.

688
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,520
And in this tiny home, which is probably 250 square feet, I don't actually know, he has

689
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,860
18 ethernet jacks in different places.

690
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,860
Some of them are multiple panels and stuff, but you think about it, that's how he's going

691
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,900
to do his phone.

692
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,280
That's how he's going to do all of his TV, HDMI is going to be over ethernet in the wall.

693
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,700
That's how he's going to do all of his cameras.

694
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,460
That's how he's going to do his desk.

695
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,060
That's how he's going to bring his internet connection in.

696
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,380
I really just completely totally agree with you, Alex.

697
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,540
And it would be nice as well not to have to daisy chain switches.

698
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:14,420
One of the ways in which I extend the ethernet around some of the larger rooms in this house,

699
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,440
in walls that are more difficult to pull cable through, like external walls or stuff with

700
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:24,340
insulation in, I actually just run an ethernet cable along the skirting board, the baseboard,

701
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,700
and then have a switch and then just carry on.

702
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:32,660
So actually, if I think about it, between the switch that's carrying my voice to you,

703
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,380
there's probably four switches.

704
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,440
It's a horrible network design, but it works.

705
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,420
I wish I could shake up so many industries to like the hotel industries should all be

706
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,900
putting ethernet in the rooms for me to use RVs.

707
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:49,700
Oh my gosh, Alex, I wish the RV manufacturers would build an ethernet to every RV.

708
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,500
All home manufacturers, you shouldn't build a home today without ethernet and it's happening

709
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,420
still Alex in 2021.

710
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,540
Without ethernet, but also without a proper server covered.

711
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,140
And I think, you know, having some kind of a central place where all that ethernet comes

712
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:09,660
into with a patch panel and space for all the different bridges that you need these

713
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,660
days.

714
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:15,500
Your Zigbee bridge, your Z-Wave bridge, your Philips Hue light bulb bridge, all this kind

715
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
of stuff.

716
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,820
Like the solar installer came and did a survey on my roof last week and he said, can I take

717
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,140
a look at your internet router?

718
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:28,940
And I'm like, okay, this is going to be complicated unless you tell me why you need to see that.

719
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:34,380
And he said, well, we have this monitoring thing that connects via Zigbee to the solar

720
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,380
on the roof and does a bunch of, you know, consumption monitoring stuff.

721
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,420
And I said, okay, so tell me what you need.

722
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,420
Is it just an ethernet Jack?

723
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,420
And he went, yes.

724
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,620
I'm like, I've got you covered.

725
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,460
Yeah, that's a great example.

726
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:53,020
But just so many other things like you'll have like your ISPs box you need to put somewhere

727
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:57,900
and like a phone or a cable television thing if you go that route.

728
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,380
So absolutely think of that and think of noise because some of these things that you're going

729
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,940
to have in that space, like a switch have very loud fans.

730
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:11,300
Also just before we completely go away from ethernet, label, man, the first, a couple

731
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:16,080
of times, the first, the first time and then a second time, but no, no nonsense.

732
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,940
But a couple of times, twice in a row, unfortunately, I got screwed and the guys that did my ethernet

733
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:26,300
didn't properly label stuff and it is such a pain in the arse, let me tell you.

734
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,660
So label everything you're doing, consider fan noise, consider heat because that could

735
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:36,060
also be a problem because if it was me, I would like to have my switch and my server

736
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,660
and all of that in the same space.

737
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,060
So if I were really designing everything from scratch, I may actually consider putting all

738
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,260
of that in my garage where I have a little room built off.

739
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,820
Anything you can do now is an investment that will save you problems later because you're

740
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,060
going to have heat issues.

741
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,200
You're going to have power issues.

742
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,120
You're going to have noise problems.

743
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,460
You're going to have growth and sprawl problems.

744
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:01,700
So if you can give consideration to that in some way, I absolutely would think of that.

745
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,620
And then also maybe if you're going to do cameras, consider doing something like POE

746
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,260
from the start and how you might build for that.

747
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,260
Absolutely.

748
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,780
And one of the other things I would consider in that server cupboard is you mentioned heating

749
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:18,340
and cooling, but I would suggest if you can get a dedicated electrical circuit just for

750
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:24,580
that equipment, it would make things much easier to troubleshoot if that room with thousands

751
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,140
probably thousands of dollars worth of equipment in it has its own electrical supply.

752
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:35,340
You could build a UPS type system in around it as well, but it's possible that that thing

753
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,060
is going to be drawing quite a few amps.

754
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:41,540
So it's worth having that separate circuit.

755
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,060
And if you did later want to have like a backup power supply for that, or maybe you wanted

756
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:50,340
even solar power or something like that, if you have that gear already isolated on its

757
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,780
own circuit, that just got way simpler down the road.

758
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,660
So that's something to think of too.

759
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,500
And you really, I don't think you can overdo it with Ethernet and I don't think you can

760
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,740
overdo it with circuits for independent stuff.

761
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:08,460
When I had my place built years and years ago, which I don't live in anymore, but I

762
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,780
had a circuit for my home office.

763
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,940
Oh, actually, and here I did it in the studio too now that I think about it.

764
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:17,580
The studio has three separate power circuits just in the studio.

765
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:23,420
Now the reason for that is really overkill because of ground loops and noise like that.

766
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:28,800
And then our offices upstairs, each room upstairs is on its own circuit because we run so much

767
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,140
computer gear, we didn't want to be popping each other's breakers.

768
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,420
I never used to really worry about that when I lived in England because obviously everything's

769
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,060
at 220 volts over there, so half the amps.

770
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,740
But over here at 110 volts, it really makes a difference.

771
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,020
Yeah, so those are, I don't think they're overkill.

772
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:52,360
The way you sell them is in long-term reliability and a reducement in replacements and hacky

773
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,780
solutions and in stress.

774
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:00,100
And just learning from people who've tried this the cheaper way and have had to make

775
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,100
adjustments since.

776
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,580
And if it's your only route, you'll make it work, man, no problem.

777
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:08,380
But if you do have the ability to do some of this stuff ahead of time, man, future you

778
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,060
is going to be so thankful.

779
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,660
Yes, absolutely they will.

780
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:16,460
Being retrofitted a few houses myself, I can tell you there's nothing worse than going

781
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,140
through a crawl space with cockroaches trying to pull ethernet.

782
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,620
So save yourself some headaches.

783
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:25,740
Now if you'd like to get your question answered or discussed on the show, you can go to selfhosted.show

784
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,740
slash contact.

785
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,220
There you go.

786
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:32,580
And also selfhosted.show slash SRE if you'd like to become a member.

787
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,580
You support the show, you get a limited ad feed and you get extra content, a post show.

788
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,980
And I think it's like five dollars a month, which is like our best deal on the network

789
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,540
right now.

790
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:47,660
Selfhosted.show slash SRE and get additional content.

791
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,660
Best deal for the best show.

792
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,660
Dang right.

793
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:54,300
Now you just launched Jupiter Garage dot com, didn't you?

794
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,380
Man, you and I, I know you have the same problem.

795
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,780
Way too much gear, stuff's all over the place.

796
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,860
So Jupiter Garage dot com, we've been selling off some things that we have in the studio.

797
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:08,500
Plus I've kind of mixed it with some original stuff in there and you and I were talking

798
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:14,000
about it and we were thinking now that you've got a different NAS situation, maybe we ought

799
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,380
to put the Helio 64 in the garage sale.

800
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,380
Yeah.

801
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,740
Well, I'm not really using it for anything.

802
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,420
So I figured I'll save someone else having to wait for it to be delivered.

803
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,820
So we'll put it on there for a good price and it'll go live on Monday, which will be

804
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,180
April the 26th.

805
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,180
Yeah.

806
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,180
Jupiter Garage dot com.

807
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,540
I just sold the free NAS that I used to have here in the studio.

808
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,540
I sold it for $200.

809
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,540
Man, that is a steal.

810
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,540
Yeah, it is.

811
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,180
You know, in some part it's just because I don't, this gear has just been sitting around

812
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,180
anyways.

813
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,980
So it's not like I'm doing anything with it and might as well go to a home with somebody

814
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:46,980
in the audience.

815
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,300
That just seems like kind of awesome, you know?

816
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,240
So yeah, the Helio 64, it will probably go pretty fast.

817
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:59,940
So maybe we should say Monday, Monday a.m. Seattle time just to kind of give people an

818
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,940
expectation.

819
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:01,940
Absolutely.

820
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,940
All right.

821
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,940
All right.

822
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,540
Also, you can find our sponsor, Cloud Guru, on social media.

823
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,540
It's simple.

824
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,820
They're just slash a Cloud Guru everywhere.

825
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,420
And if you're looking for all the different ways to subscribe to the show, you can go

826
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,820
to self-hosted dot show slash subscribe.

827
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,780
I'm on Twitter at ironic badger.

828
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:22,700
Yeah, I'm there too at Chris LAS and the whole show right here, this show, this one at self-hosted

829
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,700
show.

830
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,700
This show?

831
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,700
Which show?

832
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,700
This show.

833
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,700
The whole show.

834
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,700
This one.

835
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,700
Yeah.

836
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,700
No, the whole thing.

837
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,700
It's all there in just the hundred and whatever it is characters now.

838
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,700
200 and whatever.

839
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,660
It's really just a good resource to get show announcements and news and maybe send us questions,

840
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,660
I suppose.

841
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,180
And if all that isn't too much for you, I'd like to thank you for listening.

842
00:47:40,180 --> 00:48:03,260
That was self-hosted dot show slash 43.
