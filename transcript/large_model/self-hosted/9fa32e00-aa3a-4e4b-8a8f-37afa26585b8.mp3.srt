1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
Coming up on self-hosted 12. I'm back from the forest and Oregon was solar on board

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,760
Alex has gone nuts and installed wikis for two weeks and then he'll tell us about his robot vacuum

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,120
That runs a bantu. I'm Chris and I'm Alex and this is self-hosted

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,680
So you're back from Oregon now. How was the the epic road trip? It was a bit epic. It was pretty great

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,920
it was it was a lot of everything including some dad kid time and

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,160
Some husband-wife time because it was two different trips

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,840
And of course getting the solar system and the electrical system installed in the RV

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,400
Went pretty good. Actually, I'd say best-case scenario. The audience was right. They were riding in they said Chris

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,160
That's not enough solar

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,940
If you're gonna do it

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,360
You got to do it right and go for more solar and I got down there and I was looking at the draw of my

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,640
Refrigerator and all that kind of stuff and they were right

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,680
So we went with a total of six panels on lady jubes because you've got this big-ass

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,160
Normal house refrigerator in your car on wheels

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,720
It does pull a lot it's I didn't really appreciate that when I bought it, but yet it's so much space

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,760
So we have we have somewhere in the range of one point two kilowatts of solar

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,720
Potential power now on the roof that goes into six six hundred amp hours of lithium-ion

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,880
Battery storage from battle born and then we got a victor on 3000 watt inverter all installed rocking

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,760
We spent the night there at in their parking lot

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,400
They let us stay in their lot, which I thought was pretty great because if anything were to blow up

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
I wanted to be right there. Yeah

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,060
Because it's a big job, but I went pretty good. It's thrilled really with the results thrilled

23
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,200
So has it been everything that you dreamed of I assume from your thrilled word that it is

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,800
It was a little bit more. I mean honestly all said and done. I didn't quite

25
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,800
fully

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:52,080
Realize all of the changes it was gonna mean for us. I'm really kind of still in the fate than the testing and learning stages

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,920
It's a really complicated system, but I am documenting it

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,520
I launched a podcast that just sort of dedicate all that stuff around the RV at work life and RV podcast work life and RV

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,440
comm and I'm

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,960
right now in the learning phase then I'm gonna go into the testing phase and

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,960
Try to just get my head wrapped around it because it's pretty complex

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,080
but it's also

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,520
Super great for future work like projects where we go somewhere to a lot and we're working at a place like we did at

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,880
Dell or like we've done at Intel or like we do at Linux fest every year Linux Academy

35
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,920
We can go in the parking lot and we'll be able to hook up and or just run off solar or it's good

36
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,080
It's gonna extend our project time immensely

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,520
It's really I'm really excited from how much it's gonna kind of give us flexibility in that regard to

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,360
Say you originally spec'd out. What was it 500 watts of solar? Yeah. Yeah, you've gone to every doubled that

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,280
Yeah, yeah, we did and what's pretty nice about that is

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,600
When you have I mean, this is so obvious, but when you add more solar panels, even on a darker day

41
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,600
You're you're collectively drawing in a little bit more power. And so even on kind of a overcast Pacific Northwest

42
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,560
raining

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,320
Snowy kind of day. Seattle's not known for being gray. Is it? No, never never never

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,280
I'm still pulling in enough power to cover all of my home automation system

45
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,720
all of my home servers like the all the Raspberry Pi's my storage and

46
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:20,360
All of the smart lights are all running off the solar because a kilowatt doesn't really sound like an awful lot

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,920
You know, how much is a microwave a thousand watts, right?

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,200
When you're running a microwave, it's drawing a thousand watts. I guess so

49
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,880
Yeah, or a hairdryer is around 900 watts a heaters around a thousand watts

50
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,760
So that kind of gives you an idea of it's not like it's um

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,560
Unlimited you're gonna leave something in the efficiency though, right? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, you lose like 40%

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,080
I think it's in some cases. It's it's pretty abysmal. Okay, so if I have a kilowatt array on my roof

53
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,080
I want to budget I'm gonna get no more than five or six hundred

54
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,520
Actual usable watts out of that then do I depending I mean, it's pretty great

55
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,080
If what you're drawing from it is DC

56
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,440
So if you can move some of your load over to DC and there's a lot of things that are DC

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,200
In fact almost everything we have that's electronic is DC

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,440
We just convert it to AC either in a wall wart or in a box inside the computer

59
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,840
Speaking of AC the other kind the the one that keeps you cool in the summer that must draw a lot of power, right?

60
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,120
Yeah, and one of the things this is an area where you asked if it was what I expect and I said it exceeded it

61
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,000
This is an area just because so much was going on including the trip down there that I forgot to properly

62
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,160
investigate how to run the air conditioners and the big issue with an air conditioner is

63
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,560
And this is true for a home air conditioner or a mobile one or a one that goes in your window

64
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,760
Its biggest draw is when it's first powering up and that compressor is going and that fans spinning up

65
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,800
it really spikes to its maximum load and

66
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,120
Then it kind of drops down and it settles and it just has a running load

67
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:55,000
which is still a lot but it's not an unbelievable amount a bit like a jet engine where they have the maximum like takeoff thrust and

68
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,680
Then just just cruising is is easy almost. Yeah, once it's in its groove

69
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,400
So they have these things called easy starts or soft starts that help. I don't know shave that load down

70
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,720
So it it will start the fan up and then it'll wait a bit and we'll start the compressor up and it'll do it in

71
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,400
A stage start process and so with those installed which they caught even though I neglected to catch it

72
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,800
The installers caught it. We can indeed run the air conditioners off the battery bank quite quite. Well, it works quite well

73
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,120
Do you have any idea what sort of runtime you'll get from that on battery?

74
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,480
I'm not yet. My my first pass at it is somewhere around six to fourteen hours

75
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,880
Depending on how hard they're working. That's not bad though. That's pretty good

76
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,320
it's not bad and really probably running for 15 20 minutes just to get the temperature down when you just get home and then

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,940
Switch to fans and whatnot pretty exciting pretty exciting, especially if you consider in Seattle

78
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,440
You're only gonna need it for two or three hours a day. Anyway, realistically guy confess something to you

79
00:05:52,440 --> 00:06:00,200
Mm-hmm, something I did not expect to be as hard as it was for me was shutting down the whole home system all my

80
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,360
Servers my remote login. Okay. I have I have one SSH tunnel that I have set up that I can bounce into something goes down

81
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,720
It's my only remote connectivity that goes down. Of course. I can't get to home assistant

82
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,660
I can't check the camera and everything's offline and it was like that for a week and I have built up just habits

83
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,880
During my day if I get a minute, I'll just go check on how the hell are the temperatures doing?

84
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,800
How's this or that doing it? What's the draws, you know?

85
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,640
I'll just check on that kind of stuff throughout the day and it was like it was missing

86
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,880
It's hard having my servers down home automation addiction calm

87
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,560
No kidding. No, it's for sure

88
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,960
It's the thing that was I was surprised by by Friday when we were going down there

89
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,800
Hadeah had to step out to take care of some business work

90
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,280
And so while she was out of the RV job one was I got all the raspberry pies booted back up got the Wi-Fi network going

91
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,680
Got the net you got the internet connection back up

92
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,960
You sound like me when I moved into this place the first job that I did was ran ethernet

93
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,920
Well, everything needs it everything needs it even the clocks. I swear the internet and can I just register a complaint Alex?

94
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,240
Can I register this?

95
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,860
Can can think just stop assuming they know my location because of my Wi-Fi network and then just not check again

96
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm trying to get traffic on Google Maps and it's like oh, you're on your Wi-Fi network at home

97
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,780
So you're you're at your home base

98
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,360
I don't need to look up your location and I'm driving down the freeway

99
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,400
And I couldn't get my dumb iPhone to just redouble check my location. I toggled airplane mode

100
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,800
I closed at Google Maps reopened it it just

101
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,520
Insisted I just had to set it down with Wi-Fi turned off for like an hour

102
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,460
And then I picked it back up and it had sorted itself. I think you might be what they call an edge case there Chris

103
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
I know I know

104
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,720
Did you see it was on Hacker News?

105
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,720
I think this week a guy has a little you know children's toy trolley and he filled it up with 99 Android phones

106
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
And he created a traffic jam in Google Maps

107
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,020
I did see that I you know

108
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,360
What's cool about that is I'd always wondered had that ever crossed your mind

109
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,880
Like if you just got a whole bunch of Google Maps devices and yeah

110
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,500
How many people does it take to make the road turn yellow or red or whatever?

111
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,480
You know what impressed me about that is that the phones could get the signals in and out in that pile. That's

112
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,440
That is really impressive from my radio engineering standpoint

113
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,160
I mean if you think about a double decker bus or something like that

114
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,200
You could have 50 to 100 people on that pretty easily true

115
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:27,040
It's a bit bigger than a little children's toy trolley admittedly, but yeah, these are all stacked on top of each other. Hmm

116
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:34,560
Yeah, that's pretty nuts. It's been a huge transition for us. It feels like in a weird way coming home. Very very thrilled

117
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,200
I I'm so excited about it that my wife and I wrote two blog posts about it and we recorded a podcast about it

118
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,060
It's like I said, that's it work life and RV comm the podcast though is good

119
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,600
I mean, I'm proud of it, but the blog posts have the pictures

120
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,280
So if you want to see the gear, that's where you go is the blog post. There's some good stuff in there

121
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,720
Well, thank you. So you have a little note here that we should talk about

122
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,120
SSH remote file edit for Visual Studio code. This is one of my favorite plugins. Oh, yeah

123
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,840
I don't know why it didn't occur to me sooner that VS code might have this functionality

124
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:16,360
I wanted to edit one of my home assistant configuration files and for some reason the web UI wasn't working but SSH was

125
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,560
So I just looked in VS code on a bit of a hunch and there it is

126
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,080
So remote SSH file editing plugin you can essentially load any

127
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,600
Directory on a remote system as if it was on your local system via SSH and you know what the chocolate to this peanut butter is

128
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,480
the Docker compose plug-in for VS code that

129
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,840
Visualizes the the yaml layout so if you like me make one space mistakes and screws up your entire yaml config

130
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,080
It catches that which is nice when you're saving directly back to the server

131
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,520
I love this plug-in because it's it's

132
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,000
Functionality that I had on a really old Mac app called BB edit a hundred years ago

133
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,900
That I had a hard time ever finding replicated functionality for it. This is it

134
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:10,540
Did you note though that it only works on Linux this remote file edit plug-in only works on Linux you have to be

135
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,900
On oh, oh, I'm sorry Windows 10 if you're using the official open SSH server now

136
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,820
You can you can use it on that now. That's a surprise

137
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,940
It doesn't work on Mac OS because they use a very similar SSH type setup to what we do on Linux

138
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,860
That's what I thought and now I'm not positive

139
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,500
I suppose it could work on any client, but it's the server that it's expecting certain SFTP features

140
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:42,260
There is a lot going on with this plug-in and it's just a real signal to me

141
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,060
That VS code is just going to be the editor that sticks around for the next 10 years

142
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,260
Atom was good

143
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,860
Sublime was good

144
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,620
You know, you can argue that VM or Emacs or whatever are good in their own ways

145
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:00,620
But for me the thing that makes VS code so so good is I can run it on any platform

146
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,460
You know electron. Thank you for that and I can even run it in the browser

147
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,500
You know home assistant has a one-click plug-in to deploy it as part of home assistant

148
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,700
You can run a container that runs it, you know in an isolated space on any system

149
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,100
It's just great

150
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,740
I realized that I was really liking VS code when I had a realization that if I had ever switched away from the Linux desktop

151
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,340
I would still use VS code on whatever platform I ended up on it

152
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,140
But let's move quickly beyond that and talk about wikis

153
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:35,060
You dropped the wiki bomb in the last episode and you didn't sit around and do nothing about it

154
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:42,060
You went off and installed a whole bunch of wikis and I'm really interested to see what you learned because if I remember Alex your requirements

155
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,920
Were a fuzzy search and I added on to that something that might even be spousal

156
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,600
Approvable. Have you ever had that worry about what would happen to all your systems after you pass on?

157
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
I have and I've seen it come up in the community a little bit too

158
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,480
Like what do you do you write a wiki? I think just just some basics, you know a wiki

159
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay, not a will no no no the self-hosted podcast recommends you write a wiki folks

160
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,200
Okay, I'm with you. I'm with you though. I follow you

161
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,960
Maybe my wiki could constitute my last will and testament, right?

162
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,100
I mean you could be it could be in there right written in markdown. No doubt. Yeah in markdown. Yep

163
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,960
Well, there is that saying that goes around that my biggest fear in life is that my wife will sell my computers for what?

164
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
I told her they cost

165
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:42,960
I have not heard that but yeah, that's good. You can apply it to anything so guitars cars

166
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,980
Okay, but so the reason I wanted a wiki was not to document my last will and testament believe it or not

167
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,120
the reason that I wanted a wiki was to just try and

168
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,560
Descatter my documentation. I have some stuff in a git repo from when I tried to do it that way

169
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:09,840
And I think it's on my github called today. I learned to till TIL. I've got some stuff in Evernote

170
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,080
I've got some plain text notes in a folder on my server that aren't in git that are in next cloud

171
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,200
I think

172
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,120
I've got maybe five or six different random

173
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,720
Things that have tried and failed over the years and I wanted to try and fix that problem

174
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm just sitting here nodding my head. I'm thinking yeah add Dropbox to that list

175
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
iOS notes to that list

176
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:37,440
Qo notes on that list of Google Keep. Mmm. Yes got a key things in Google Keep too

177
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,680
This needs to stop here. The line must be drawn here. And so when you look on

178
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,520
Reddit and you know, it's generally my source of inspiration for self-hosted stuff actually

179
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:54,320
There's a few different options and loads of people espouse bookstack as being the gold standard

180
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
it has this concept of

181
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,040
shelves and books and that and chapters and that kind of thing and

182
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,280
It kind of tries to divide up your notes into this kind of logical structure

183
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
Which not every single note kind of follows

184
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,040
but you can kind of make it work for what you need so you could say have a book for

185
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,760
Computer hardware and then a shelf for servers and then a chapter about each of your different servers

186
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,560
For example, sounds like you're spending a lot of time though figuring out how to get your information to fit into its structure

187
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:30,360
Yeah, that's kind of what I found and also another pain point that I really couldn't get past and I admittedly probably spent

188
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,120
20 minutes trying to figure this out. So if you know the answer, please let us know self hosted dot show slash contact

189
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,200
I found that image uploads were a real pain in the butt

190
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,360
I couldn't upload any images that were over a certain size and I think that size was like

191
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,360
900 by 600 pixels or something

192
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,560
Oh, you mean image size not necessarily file size and do you know where you're using the s3 back end or I think both

193
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,680
And bookstack wasn't using s3 to my knowledge

194
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,560
It was just spun up as a you know using a volume on my server with a container

195
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,560
Yes, right then you can use an s3 back end with it, which might change that aspect of it

196
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,760
Well, maybe maybe but in general, I just wasn't quite feeling it

197
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,440
You know

198
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,720
You can spend half an hour with with a tool and just generally get a feel for whether it's going to work for you or

199
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,480
Not and I think a wiki is going to be a highly personal thing

200
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,240
So I know there's gonna be some people listening to this going. Oh, I love bookstack. Why doesn't he like it?

201
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,840
It looks really nice. I mean the UI looks pretty great. It's not bad. You know, it's a solid option

202
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:38,200
It just didn't quite work for me because I want this to be an Evernote grade kind of experience

203
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,440
I want it to look as nice as feel as nice and just not have to

204
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:48,000
Manually convert images to the right size to fit into that thing and it images is a real pain actually in this

205
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,440
In this whole sphere, what kind of images are you doing screenshots? Are you taking pictures of stuff?

206
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,320
Like for me, it's business cards notes that kind of thing

207
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,960
Yeah, both like instead of writing down the specs of a system

208
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll just do a neo fetch to get the specs of a specific box and then just put that screenshot into the system page

209
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,480
As well as you know photos I've taken on my phone of serial numbers of things and all sorts of crap. Yeah

210
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,720
Yep, same over here. Now. The next one that I tried was wiki.js. Now this thing is

211
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,620
Gorgeous. Yeah, this is even better looking than bookstack

212
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:30,600
It has a really nice easy to follow and understand layout and looking at this it it appears. It's it's a node.js app

213
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,680
So it must set up its own web server than you pointed out a database. I

214
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,200
Started out with my sequel. I say I started out

215
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,200
I continued until the end with my sequel, but you I used my sequel to start with and

216
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,780
It also supports obviously Maria DB

217
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:52,120
Postgres as well as MS SQL or SQLite 3 as well. It's a node.js application and

218
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,680
Version 2 is build a stable. There is a legacy version 1 which I didn't try

219
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:06,200
I tried the new version 2 and in general, I really really like this application except for one really fundamental thing

220
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,080
It didn't feel finished every time I went to click on something. It had this little coming soon banner

221
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Partner dust which is fine

222
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:22,400
I guess I wish I could turn that off in settings like I don't want to see coming soon all over the UI every time

223
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,240
I'm using something and

224
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:31,360
One of the things that really got me was sitemap is coming soon. And that's one of the key things that I wanted to have

225
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,920
I love looking through a git repository that has a folder structure that makes sense for me

226
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
I need my notes to kind of fit into that

227
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,960
hierarchical structure

228
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,760
Almost like files and folders do and if possible

229
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,560
I'd like to be able to tag something with multiple tags and have it show up in multiple places potentially because it's

230
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,860
So often the case that you end up with I don't know

231
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,300
Let's let's use a bash script as an example, but that bash script is about Docker

232
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,100
So you might want it to show up in your Docker?

233
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:11,540
Note section as well as your bash scripts note section. I couldn't find a way to make wiki.js quite mold into my

234
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,100
Situation. However, I will say it is stunningly beautiful

235
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,860
The search worked pretty darn well

236
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:26,380
And I think it is definitely one to watch serious contender. Yeah. Yeah, it definitely will be it's gpl3, too

237
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,740
As well, I believe which is pretty nice. That's nice. Yeah, I like the fact that on their website

238
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,940
You know, there's three ways to host this thing your AWS digital ocean or self hosted and I love the fact that

239
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:43,180
These guys are putting that front and center. I think it's I think it's perfect, you know

240
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:50,540
So give it time. I think it will be the wiki gold standard moving forward and and certainly the screenshots

241
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,300
You can see on their website, which is wiki.js.org

242
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,860
You can get a good sense for just how beautiful this thing is and it's it's so close to what I want

243
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,300
Now an honorable mention for another tool that is not self hostable and is not open source

244
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,980
Unfortunately, because if it was it would be a slam dunk is gitbook

245
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,700
Now we actually use that over at Linux server to host all the documentation over there

246
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:22,940
And it's it's got that beautiful fuzzy search that I was after it will show you words within the documents as well

247
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,820
Mmm, that is nice

248
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,340
You can not only just search the titles

249
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,940
Because I don't about you my brain files stuff based on the odd

250
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,560
Keyword or stuff like that with with which I know is in an email or is in a note somewhere

251
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,720
And I can spend hours looking for that one keyword, which I know is in there

252
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,980
But the search algorithm isn't looking deep enough. And so all that led me finally towards tiddly wiki

253
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,320
One other one. I should actually just mention briefly is mkdocs

254
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Now I really did like this one as well

255
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,280
It's git based and that wasn't quite what I was looking for in this situation

256
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,600
But it was really close between mkdocs and tiddly wiki in the end by this point

257
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,080
I tried out half a dozen wikis and I just wanted to start actually documenting stuff

258
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:16,740
So I just went with tiddly wiki and it's version 5 and I must say I've been super duper impressed with it

259
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,120
It's not the prettiest. I mean, it's not ugly by any stretch. It's just

260
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,840
functional just gets the job done gets out of your way shows you the information that you want and

261
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,000
Each note that you create is called a tiddler

262
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,040
I'm loving the names and each tiddler can have a tag it can have multiple tags and guess what?

263
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,180
When you tag something with multiple tags, it can show up under multiple categories

264
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,040
Which means that I can have that

265
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,320
Wonderful esoteric system that molds with the weird-ass way in which my brain works

266
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,200
Oh that is perfect for you and have stuff stored in three different categories all at once

267
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,920
It sounds like maybe you did find your perfect wiki then. Yeah, maybe so I'm curious about the setup side of it

268
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,320
What's it like as a server piece of software to get going? Well much like all the other wikis

269
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,400
I ran it out of a container. So it was up and running in a couple of minutes flat and

270
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,120
If I look at my stats on my server at the moment, it's currently using 90 megabytes of RAM

271
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,160
So we're talking about a very lightweight application here

272
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,760
If we look at smoke ping, for example that uses 40

273
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Plex is using

274
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
2.5 gigabytes. Oof

275
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,360
Nom nom nom. I think cheese might be watching a video right now

276
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,200
But well, I mean it's it's doing a very different job than your wiki is so that's understandable

277
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,120
So tiddly wiki the name didn't put you off. It actually has made me wince once or twice

278
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah, yeah, it could have a better name

279
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,960
And now image uploads again were a bit of a pain point

280
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,840
you have to upload the assets as a separate tiddler and then sort of link that in to tiddly wiki and

281
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,000
Creating a table of contents is a bit of a thing and you have to follow documentation

282
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,880
I mean it it takes 10 minutes

283
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,000
But I don't know why they don't just have it like that out the box

284
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,280
Or a checkmark box that I can click and have it do do it that way

285
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,560
I mean, there's lots of stuff that makes it great

286
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,580
But equally I think there's definitely a lot that could be done in the user interface side of things to improve it

287
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,440
But I'm really happy I found it

288
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,760
I think I'm gonna stick with it for a little while and hopefully it doesn't end up like the XKCD comic of

289
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:34,120
We've got 13 standards. We need one standard to rule them all and now we have 14 standards. Mm-hmm

290
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,200
I'm sure it will but I hope not. Let me ask you a question

291
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,520
Would you deploy this for a community or would you choose a different one for a group of people to work with?

292
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,740
Because this sounds like it very much works with your kind of mind and thought process and way of retrieving information

293
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,820
But what about a group of people? Well, the search is great for a start

294
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,020
And I think for a community search is the number one thing that you need to work. Well

295
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,860
The next thing you need to work well is kind of moderation and users and that kind of thing for a community

296
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:08,620
Which leads me on to something I wanted to talk to you about really we can do this meeting live on air if you like

297
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,260
It's a little production meeting right now. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Come on in here in my office. I

298
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:19,700
Get maybe half a dozen messages a day from people saying how do I do this or did you hear about this or where did?

299
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,980
I find that link or yes, and I love it. I don't I don't mind. This is not a negative

300
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,060
This is not a negative thing whatsoever

301
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,620
but I think it would be good if we as a community could come together and

302
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,060
Start building a central repository of where to find all of this information

303
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,700
Because it is scattered across the web and there's a lot of smart people listening to this podcast

304
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,500
I know because you email me and you tell me lots of amazing stuff

305
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,700
So if we can all get together and try and build a wiki of some sort

306
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,580
To be the ultimate self hostable

307
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,620
Self hosted wiki on the internet and we can self-host it ourselves

308
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:01,900
Then I think we're eating our own dog food number one, but number two when people are

309
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,020
Trying to get into self hosting stuff

310
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:12,140
They will discover this wiki and they'll discover the show and they'll start falling hopefully down the rabbit hole and we can just bring a whole

311
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,940
bunch more people into the fold and

312
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,700
Hopefully end up being the one-stop shop for this kind of stuff on the internet. You never know

313
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,020
I tell you what. It's a big vision Alex. It's a big vision, but I actually think it's

314
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,700
Pretty great. I'd get down on that. I'd probably even look at seeing what some of my personal documentation

315
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,780
I could convert to a wiki to help other people. I probably have some stuff. I could contribute right away

316
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,820
So how would you run something like this? I think you need some community help with that as well

317
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,900
Well, I've had a couple of people on telegram already tell me that they're up for it in terms of

318
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,460
Moderation and helping me build the thing out

319
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,180
I think we'll probably be looking for three or four volunteers just to spend some time with

320
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,740
Me and Chris on on telegram in a private group just to go through some stuff

321
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,860
Figure out how to actually set this thing up and uh and get started. So if you're interested send me an email

322
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:08,860
At self hosted dot show slash contact or you can tweet me on twitter at ironic badger and uh, we'll get that ball rolling

323
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,420
I like it. We'll do a update in a future episode. That could be a nice resource

324
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,940
I remember back in the day for last we thought about doing something similar

325
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,220
But there were so many other resources that came along. It wasn't really necessary

326
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,980
unfortunately

327
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:29,100
the resources I use are pretty much project github pages and reddit and neither one of those are great because reddit is

328
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,380
It's like a river. It's changing constantly and you lose stuff and github pages can just sort of be

329
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,200
Really hit and miss in terms of details and documentation

330
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,460
So I would love to see something like this

331
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:46,140
Out of all the wikis that I tried the one that I think's most likely to fit our needs is that mkdocs one?

332
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,540
Oh, really not tiddly wiki, huh? Because it's been a long time since I've seen anything like this

333
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:56,460
Tiddly wiki, huh? Because it's based around git and we can then use github's pull request model to accept

334
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,220
Stuff coming in and kind of filter it and curate it that way going back to the community slash team thing

335
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
That makes a lot of sense

336
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,900
Yeah, it's very easy to do git blame and figure out who modified chris fisher's wiki page

337
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,580
I love that you're already planning trolling

338
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,380
You've got to it's the internet

339
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:22,220
You just exposed it though right here right here on the pod. I'm calling it a pod now the self-hosted pod

340
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,660
It's so horrible. I mean if you want to sound like a douche be my guest. Uh-huh. Okay. All right

341
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,740
Meanwhile, you're the guy with a robot vacuum. So let's talk about that for a little bit

342
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,820
I'm the guy with a robot vacuum running a buntu darling what? Yeah

343
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,940
What next you're gonna tell me you have a working with home assistant then i'm just gonna quit life. Oh, yeah, no

344
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:46,940
I bought a robot vacuum and it's a it's a roborock s5 now roborock are owned by

345
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,860
xiaomi the chinese company, so i'm well aware that

346
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,860
You know, my data will be going off to a data center that contains coronavirus. Oh, geez too soon

347
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,420
Is it still connected to their cloud service running ubuntu does it come running ubuntu no

348
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,060
So it comes out the box with um a me home app that you pair it with

349
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:12,460
like much of their other stuff and like light bulbs and and what have you

350
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,700
And out of the box, it works just fine

351
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:21,020
It has a little lidar thing on it that maps the room out and you know, it's it's pretty cool to humans detected

352
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,140
Yeah, assimilate

353
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,660
The robot vacuum is just the the room mapping is particularly creepy to me

354
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,460
But I I do kind of also appreciate the utility of it

355
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,140
Well, it's nice if you think about it because you can say to the robot

356
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,740
Go clean the kitchen or go clean the toilet or whatever not the inside of the toilet

357
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,380
Obviously, but you can say like different zones. I would buy that robot though

358
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,180
Yeah, I would too

359
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,060
And so naturally if i'm going to buy a gadget

360
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,220
I want to make the most out of it and I want to try and integrate it with home assistant so that when I

361
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:59,420
Leave the house I can have my robot vacuum start cleaning and when I come home it can go back to its dock

362
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,420
So it's never running when I'm at home

363
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,540
When I come home, it can go back to its dock. So it's never running when i'm here

364
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:09,340
um, that's the simple use case or it could be like, uh, you know

365
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,100
It's cleaning time where i'm doing some hoovering of the stairs for example

366
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,900
And then the vacuum is doing its thing as well

367
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,940
And if we're having a cleaning mode, it doesn't matter if it's churning away. So do you have a cleaning mode?

368
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:28,620
Is that something you've done? Yeah, it plays blink 182 full volume through my stereos because that's peppy enough that it gets my energy going

369
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:36,300
And then uh, yeah, we start doing some washing up or and then the robot vacuum deploys all the lights turn on the humans deploy

370
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,660
and

371
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,860
Yeah, and it it turns the lights on for 45 minutes and we have to keep going for that 45 minutes

372
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,100
That's a neat idea. And then at the end of that 45 minute period the lights

373
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,180
Dim or turn off on blink 182 stops playing and we know we're good

374
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:56,060
You need to have some wine deploy somehow that would be the next level at the at the end. Oh

375
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,940
Yeah, that would be good I guess you could always automate yourself to do that

376
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,340
Yeah, I wouldn't have any issues with that

377
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:09,660
That would be pretty easy and I and you automatically get the benefits of the location awareness when it's communicating with home assistance

378
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,780
So that's nice as well and you can integrate with all the other automation. So there's obviously advantages to doing that

379
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,060
So is there some sort of project out there designed to flash robot vacuums? Are they that popular?

380
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,060
Yeah, believe it or not. I love the community. It's so amazing

381
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:30,620
So to start with I discovered that I needed to obtain something called a xiaomi home access token

382
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,100
And the documentation on the home assistant website was a little bit out of date

383
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,420
So I submitted my first ever home assistant pull request. Yay

384
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,900
And so if you use a specific version of the me home app an old one by the way

385
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,100
You can actually go into the file system of your android device and retrieve the access token that way

386
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:58,620
It's not too difficult, but it took me probably an entire weekend to figure it out because the documentation wasn't up to date. So

387
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,260
There you go. I saved you some time

388
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:08,220
And then so once you have your token you can enter that into home assistant and use the xiaomi home assistant integration and it just

389
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,900
Just works

390
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:16,460
But I wanted to go a step further than that. I wanted to root my vacuum. I wanted to put ubuntu linux on my vacuum

391
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,240
And to do that you use something called a valetudo

392
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:29,340
Now valetudo is an open source firmware that you flash onto your robot vacuum and this thing uses the robot's wi-fi access point

393
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,020
to

394
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,020
Basically pretend to be the xiaomi servers

395
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:37,580
You then flash the valetudo firmware onto it. This is all done over the air

396
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,460
You don't have to plug any cables in you don't have to do any soldering

397
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,400
All the documentation is on their website and it it's actually really straightforward

398
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:51,120
And within a few minutes you'll have ubuntu on your network. You can ssh into your vacuum if you want to that's great

399
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
I love that so much

400
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:59,920
But one of the really super cool things that it enables as if a robot vacuum running ubuntu isn't cool enough already

401
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,080
is you can

402
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,080
now use mqtt

403
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,800
So you can bring the map into home assistant using mqtt

404
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:15,040
So you can have a card on your home assistant dashboard which uses the lidar sensor on top of the vacuum

405
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:20,320
To actually map out your house in home assistant it updates in real time and tells you whereabouts in the house

406
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,920
It physically is which is so cool. That's super high tech

407
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,640
All right, okay, you're selling me on this now now

408
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,360
You just got to build one of these and pre-flash it and ship it to me. That's all

409
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
I got it on black friday. It was

410
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,620
$160 this vacuum. Well, i've seen some of the I can't I can't remember the exact price

411
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:45,220
But the one I saw was near 800 for a different name brand. Yeah, they get pretty pricey

412
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,380
Well, you know what's next for you man is solar

413
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,020
Power all this stuff with solar i'm telling you it's next level. There's so much to learn

414
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:58,980
I I really am enjoying it if you and I know you do if you enjoy digging and researching and discovering new things and new tech

415
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,900
It's right up your alley a little solar panel on the roof telling you

416
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:09,140
I just need a bucket full of money to do it. That's true. Yeah, but then you could charge your robot vacuum from solar

417
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,780
Oh my god

418
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:17,380
I think if I buy an electric car, which will almost certainly be my next car purchase

419
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,300
then uh

420
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,780
Solar on the roof because I saw the uk is actually banning

421
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,480
gasoline and diesel car sales from 2035

422
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,660
That's pretty soon. I think it would be

423
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,380
next level awesome

424
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,420
To drive around a car that was charged by solar from at home. I mean that just

425
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,780
I'm feeling pretty good having my whole home server systems running on solar right now. I'm feeling like hey, look at me

426
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,180
But yeah, that's next level

427
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,380
Tell people about the blog give give a plug for the old blog because you got some good stuff on there

428
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,660
We don't mention it too often

429
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:55,060
I have a personal blog over at blog.ktz.me where I try and document as much of my personal

430
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,460
Shenanigans as I can. Yeah, and you also often take really great pictures over there

431
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,580
So that's something that I appreciate about you and something i'm trying to knock off from you is i'm trying to try to

432
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,140
do that same thing is put some good pictures on ours because it

433
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,820
Not something we get to play with a lot in the audio medium

434
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,900
So that's why I like to mention the blogs because it's like every now and there's a little extra stuff there

435
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:20,340
You've documented a lot of these projects over there fair warning. My latest post was about brexit, but uh,

436
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Now we mention it

437
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,020
my latest post

438
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,980
Aside I quite often talk about all the projects i'm up to and you know how I do 3d printing and

439
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:37,300
When I switch to ios for a week and you know, just that kind of stuff really. Yeah, that was an interesting week

440
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:44,180
I just launched a blog chrislast.com and I did an episode little audio episode about the max vista moment

441
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,460
So you should check that out. I know you're not a big catalina guy over there

442
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:53,140
But you should give it a listen. My macbook is still on the one before catalina. You seem like a big mac guy

443
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:58,740
Yeah, like you're really into it. Am I no i'm giving you a hard time

444
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:00,740
All right

445
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:05,780
And of course the show is at self hosted dot show and we'd love to hear from you self hosted dot show slash contact

446
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:23,240
And links for the wikis or the blogs or all the stuff we talked about today are at self hosted dot show slash 12
