1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Today's episode is a really exciting one for me.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,760
It's the culmination of five years work.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,160
The perfect media server is now,

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,840
well, I'll save it for the show.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,760
We also respond to a ton of your feedback.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,760
This is Self-Hosted 35.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,440
Well, Alex, I'll admit it right here on the show.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,800
I set up yet another sync thing server this weekend.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,520
You thought you'd leave 2020 behind in style, hey?

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,840
I wanted more speed, Alex.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,800
Actually, it really came down to me doing the math

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,080
and realizing, hey, you know, when I switch networks,

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,080
it kind of slows the syncing down.

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,440
But if I can pull from multiple sync servers,

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,560
it kind of makes up for it

16
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,640
and goes even faster in ideal situations.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,560
So I thought, why not set up a sync thing server on Linode

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,400
and just sync a small select stuff

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,680
that I really wanna move fast?

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,160
And it legit works.

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,960
It's really nice.

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,120
It's like doubles the amount of files

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,880
that can be transferred at once too,

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,040
from what I can tell in my brief testing.

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,520
I'll be honest, I haven't continued with sync thing

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,760
after we talked about it a couple of episodes ago.

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,640
Just doesn't work for me.

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Just doesn't do it, I'm afraid.

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,000
But I'm glad it's working for you.

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,160
You're a hater, I understand.

31
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,440
I understand, I understand.

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,040
I love it.

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,680
I think 2020 is the year that I stepped into

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,240
a long-term relationship with sync thing.

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,080
And it's not like I'm working on files super quick

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,440
and I wanna move it between machines

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,120
and I wanna edit a file upstairs

38
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,720
and then walk down into the studio

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,160
and have that file on my desktop.

40
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,720
It may be able to serve that function,

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,400
but I've learned not to expect that.

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,600
The one caveat I do have with sync thing

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,080
is you gotta let it go at its own pace.

44
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,840
Gotta let it go at its own pace.

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,440
And that's why I love online learning too.

46
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,640
And this episode is brought to you

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
by the all new A Cloud Guru,

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,000
the leader in learning for cloud Linux

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and other modern tech skills.

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,560
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs.

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,400
Get certified, get hired, get learning

52
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
at acloudguru.com.

53
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,360
Well, Alex, I think we should start the show today by,

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
well, maybe we started by talking about sync thing,

55
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,000
but now we should start talking about a project

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
in various forms at least you've been working on

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,000
for about five years.

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,400
And I think if I'm not wrong,

59
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,200
it's like about to reach its ultimate form.

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,160
Perhaps, yeah.

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,800
Well, I mean, as we record, it's still 2020,

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,600
but I think this is gonna come out on new year's morning.

63
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
So happy new year, everybody.

64
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,040
Welcome to 2021.

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,080
Hopefully it's more prosperous than the last one was.

66
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,040
We're talking about my perfect media server project.

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,440
So this was something that when I was involved

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,440
with linuxserver.io that actually helped me

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,040
kind of form the direction for that site

70
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,560
and the blog and stuff like that.

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,760
So on the 2nd of February, 2016,

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,920
I wrote a post about what I called

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,400
the perfect media server for once for better name.

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,760
And it's kind of stuck now.

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,360
It's bold, but now you've kind of become

76
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,880
the perfect media server guy.

77
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,920
Yeah, I guess so.

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
I've toyed with changing the name a few times,

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,200
but enough people have seen it.

80
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,640
And I've looked at the analytics

81
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,840
and a lot of people have read that post over the years

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,040
that in fact, funnily enough, when I moved to Raleigh,

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,520
one of my closest friends now who's also called Alex,

84
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,960
he joined Linux server originally.

85
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,800
He's now one of the Linux server devs.

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,840
He joined that website

87
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,640
because he read my perfect media server post.

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,520
And so when I came to town, he met up with me

89
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,840
and we had a few beers and stuff like that.

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,520
And he was so excited to tell me

91
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,000
that he'd built one as well around Docker

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,680
and SnapRaid and MergerFS and all this kind of stuff.

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,000
So it's been a really cool thing to share with the world.

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
Well, you also got a great domain name for it,

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
perfectmediaserver.com.

96
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,960
Is that new?

97
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,840
Brand new, yes.

98
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,840
I, well, when I say brand new, I mean, I bought it in June.

99
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,280
I've been promising a 2020 version of this article

100
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,800
for rather longer than I would like.

101
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,320
So I released one in 2016, another one in 17

102
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,840
and another one in 19.

103
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,200
And, you know, when you start thinking

104
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,560
about what can I write about

105
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,160
with these perfect media servers

106
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,560
when everything is just so reliable and just works,

107
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,400
there comes a limit when you think,

108
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,080
well, I can't really rehash the same thing again and again.

109
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,800
And so this time I was looking at the three posts

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,840
and since I'm no longer involved with Linux server,

111
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,040
I don't have access to edit those blog posts easily anymore.

112
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,520
I mean, I can ask the team to fix things and stuff,

113
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,480
but invariably information goes out of date

114
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,560
and I am a huge advocate of open source

115
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,520
and community contributions and Wikis

116
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,480
and all that kind of stuff.

117
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,320
And so I just thought that this would make much more sense

118
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,880
as a kind of a Wiki type website

119
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,600
with first-class search categories,

120
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,080
walking people through how to do things,

121
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
you know, in a step-by-step kind of fashion

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
and then leave the blog posts

123
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
as kind of like an annual opinion piece

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,600
alongside this more kind of dry technical Wiki style website

125
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,200
at perfectmediaserver.com.

126
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,560
Okay, that makes a lot of sense.

127
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,960
And I think probably the real value for people to understand

128
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,920
is you're telling people there's a lot of options out there,

129
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,080
but maybe this is a great stack to use.

130
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,840
You can use this stack, I've tested this,

131
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
I've refined it over the years

132
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,800
to do really a beyond just okay media setup,

133
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,480
but a great whole media setup.

134
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,280
And instead of saying, oh, there's so many use cases

135
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,480
or the answer which is frequently it depends,

136
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,240
you make some opinionated decisions

137
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,640
and kind of point people in a direction

138
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,080
and then lay out how to do it.

139
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,680
And I think that's maybe for me the real value of the site.

140
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,480
I think as well, a lot of people come to Linux

141
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,320
and I've said this before on the show,

142
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,520
a lot of people come to Linux not through the desktop

143
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,680
but through Plex, through running headless apps

144
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,520
on a Synology or a Raspberry Pi

145
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,880
or something like that.

146
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,080
And once you start having a box in your house

147
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,120
that does everything 24 hours a day,

148
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,040
that is on 24 hours a day,

149
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,720
you think what else could I do with it?

150
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,680
And that single spark is a huge rabbit hole.

151
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,640
And I think one of my primary goals with the site

152
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,440
is to equip those newer people

153
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,440
with the skills that they need to install Ubuntu,

154
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,480
set up merger FS, figure out what an FS tab is

155
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,640
and not be intimidated by wading through

156
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,840
lots of different disparate documentation

157
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,520
across different places on the internet.

158
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,440
It's just all in one place.

159
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,400
And if you wanna have multiple hard drives

160
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,040
in a single box that are of mismatched sizes

161
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,800
with different file systems,

162
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,640
well, here's a solution for you.

163
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,320
You've already got data on these drives,

164
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,640
you don't wanna do RAID, great, cool,

165
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
come along and join the party.

166
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,520
Yeah, and honestly, it's a lot of the stack

167
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,800
that we talk about frequently.

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,520
You talk about Docker, kind of some of the background

169
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,960
in there, how to get it going,

170
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,880
and you work your way up through

171
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,040
how to manage multiple disks of different sizes,

172
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,160
like you say, but then also, if you wanna go ZFS

173
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,240
and here's also a Proxmox layer you should consider,

174
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,000
any one of those could be broken out

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,480
and really have nothing to do

176
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,240
with building a media server.

177
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,920
So it's kind of valuable in that way too, I suppose.

178
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,600
So I mentioned that just for the audience

179
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,840
who's not interested in building a media server,

180
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,400
but does wanna learn more about Docker or MergerFS

181
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,840
or SnapRate or ZFS or Proxmox or hardware,

182
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,320
any of that kind of stack, stuff we talk about on this show

183
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,720
and you wanna read something from Alex on it,

184
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,320
you can find it there too.

185
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,280
I could totally have seen a guy like me,

186
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,200
maybe if I was building my media server setup

187
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,280
for the first time, I'd be thinking, okay,

188
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,160
I know I wanna use containers, but I don't quite know how

189
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,280
and in what way to use them to do this right.

190
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,680
I know about MergerFS, but I don't know

191
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,520
how to deploy it and so having you write something,

192
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,720
having used this stuff in production for five years now,

193
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,400
there's value to that.

194
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,480
So you should be the perfect media server guy.

195
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,480
I think I said good on you.

196
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,000
You be the perfect media server guy

197
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,880
because I endorse this media server build here.

198
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,040
You are Chris and you support this message.

199
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,600
Wonder what the cost is, have you thought about that?

200
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,440
Have you thought about like what the cost would be

201
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,560
for a minimal build of something from this guide?

202
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,840
Well, in terms of hardware.

203
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,960
Yeah, in terms of hardware.

204
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,640
I think QuickSync now for me is a minimum price of entry

205
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,200
after everything we talked about in the last episode.

206
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,640
So a hundred bucks for a CPU,

207
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,480
you can probably find a used motherboard

208
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,080
that will do the trick for a hundred dollars.

209
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,480
Again, RAM is a bit about a hundred

210
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,880
and then hard drives for an eight terabyte hard drive.

211
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,480
Now you can go to Best Buy and pick one up

212
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,680
for around 130, 140.

213
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,520
So I don't know, let's say 140.

214
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,360
140, what's that?

215
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,040
It's like $1,100 or so for hard drives.

216
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,520
I don't know, 1,500.

217
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,520
I think all in would get you five, eight terabyte drives

218
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,080
of 40 terabytes of storage for $1,500 all in

219
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,880
and you own it forever.

220
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
I mean, Synology make a great product.

221
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,600
So do QNAP and Unraid's also great,

222
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,720
but it's not open source.

223
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,320
FreeNAS requires learning ZFS,

224
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,040
which I know I talk about in Perfect Media Server,

225
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,280
but it's kind of orthogonal to the main content.

226
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,120
It's not required learning,

227
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,960
whereas with a TrueNAS or a FreeNAS product, it is.

228
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,760
It's just the most flexible thing for most people.

229
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,520
And I think when you start looking at putting together

230
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,400
one of these servers,

231
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,200
$1,500 isn't a small upfront investment.

232
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,120
And you think, right, well, where can I cut some cost?

233
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,240
And the obvious answer is the hard drives.

234
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,000
Rather than buying five, let's only buy a couple, right?

235
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,240
And then I'll add the other three

236
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,080
over the next year or two.

237
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,520
MergerFS lets me do that.

238
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,720
It lets me add drives as my collection grows

239
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,040
without having to re-silver a ZFS array

240
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,800
or rebuild a RAID setup or anything like that.

241
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,240
It just grows as I do and it changes and matures.

242
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,160
And because it's just Linux,

243
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,520
it's open and I can go and tinker as deep

244
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,880
as I want under the hood.

245
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,840
Or again, because it's Linux, it will just work.

246
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,720
It's just reliable.

247
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
It's battle tested and hardened everywhere.

248
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,520
So I really do think that if you're willing

249
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,680
to put the time in and learn a little bit of this stuff

250
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,840
with the information that's provided here for you,

251
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,960
for free, I might add,

252
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,040
I don't make a penny off of this stuff.

253
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,400
Anyway, I never have.

254
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,840
I just wanted to give this information

255
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,200
back to the community.

256
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,280
I don't think there's a better solution really

257
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,960
if you're willing to put the effort in.

258
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,280
And I'll just give one more mention

259
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,560
because as you were talking there,

260
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,800
I was just also reviewing your QuickSync

261
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,800
and Proxmox page and damn, you put some work into this.

262
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,880
But I also, I think it's pretty clever

263
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,760
that you embedded the relevant JB content

264
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,240
where we've talked about a lot of this stuff in depth

265
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,360
when it still holds up.

266
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,240
So not only do you get a lot of the written stuff

267
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,200
and the visual examples,

268
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,840
but you've got like a video from Wendell in here too.

269
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,520
And so you add the supplemental media content.

270
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,360
I could see us linking this to a lot of people

271
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,240
that write into the show

272
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,400
and ask questions about this stuff.

273
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,240
If I were gonna contribute one area,

274
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,120
I just thought to troll you,

275
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,520
I'd probably contribute using ButterFS

276
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,680
because literally everything you just said about MergerFS

277
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,040
is why I use ButterFS.

278
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
Seriously, like word for word.

279
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,120
So on the ZFS page,

280
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,160
there's a whole section about what about ButterFS.

281
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,000
So-

282
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,320
Okay, good, you've addressed it, I can see.

283
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,600
Well, a little bit.

284
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,440
And my conclusion was that using ButterFS

285
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,320
would probably be easier than ZFS

286
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,720
simply because it shipped as part of the Linux kernel.

287
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,720
But I've invested in ZFS mentally,

288
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,360
but also I've synced six, seven terabytes worth of data

289
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,920
across the ocean to the UK.

290
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,520
And I don't wanna have to spend another six or seven weeks

291
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,120
doing that again if I switch.

292
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,440
Well, ironically, it's more about how you use MergerFS.

293
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,280
However, I think both are great.

294
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,680
And if MergerFS is working for you,

295
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm really not, I'm just more of teasing.

296
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,560
But it did strike me that being able to join mismatched disks

297
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,000
and add them as it grows

298
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,920
and be able to remove them easily

299
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,240
is why I switched to using ButterFS

300
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,520
on my Raspberry Pi media servers

301
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,120
because I needed some extra data

302
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
in my media servers because I needed something

303
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
that essentially was no cost.

304
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,760
Since ButterFS is built into the kernel

305
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,840
and it also doesn't have a high,

306
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,440
it's a very efficient file system.

307
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,720
There's not a big performance penalty.

308
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,480
I don't need a lot of RAM.

309
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,760
It meant that I didn't have to install

310
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,080
any additional software at all.

311
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,280
And actually no additional config files or anything.

312
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,960
There's no config, it's just,

313
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,280
it's all just with volume management on the command line.

314
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,240
And it's very simple.

315
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,360
It's like ButterFS add volume and you give it the path

316
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,640
and you tell it what volume to add to

317
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,760
you're done and then remove.

318
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,880
And as long as you have enough space,

319
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,560
it sinks everything off and you can remove it.

320
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,880
And I actually have not tested that.

321
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,560
I could imagine it being tricky.

322
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,640
But I think there's different ways to solve all of these.

323
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,720
And what you've done here with this is said,

324
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,960
well, these are ways that not only

325
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,800
are very sensible solutions, but ones that I've tested.

326
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,000
And that's the value again.

327
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,080
Like, yeah, I could add something about ButterFS,

328
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,520
but there's limited value in it.

329
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,480
It's my experience.

330
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,560
And this is something that you've worked at for a long time.

331
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,240
So I think it's, yeah,

332
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,600
I think MergerFS is a great solution

333
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,400
for that kind of stuff.

334
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,800
And, you know, things like ZFS and SnapRaid,

335
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,400
depending on what your needs are,

336
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,640
also can be appropriate solutions.

337
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,040
So I've built this site around MKDocs,

338
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,680
which happens to be the same project

339
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,520
that we're using for the self-hosted Wiki,

340
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,760
which I've also put some work into this week

341
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,920
over the Christmas break.

342
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,800
So please go ahead and contribute to the self-hosted Wiki

343
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,480
at wiki.selfhosted.show.

344
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,640
Cause we're crying out for content over there.

345
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,000
But MKDocs, I'll tell you what, Chris,

346
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,320
has become a hell of a Wiki software, you know?

347
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,760
So I don't know when you're browsing this,

348
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,160
but I don't know if you noticed it has a keyboard shortcut

349
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,360
and they don't tell you this obviously,

350
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,280
but it's the same as Vim.

351
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,760
So you can press the forward slash key,

352
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,280
which brings up search,

353
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,000
and then you can search for any string in any page.

354
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,040
And it will just in real time and then use the arrow keys.

355
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,080
Oh yes.

356
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,240
And it will just take you straight to the page.

357
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,080
Straight to the section of that page.

358
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,560
Just that feature alone had me sold.

359
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,080
That's great.

360
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,160
But they've added dozens of other features,

361
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,400
you know, like they've got little tool tips,

362
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,920
little info boxes and stuff that breaks up the content.

363
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,080
The code formatting highlighting is just brilliant.

364
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,480
It's fully customizable.

365
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,240
So, you know, it was using the COBOL Wiki

366
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,760
for the Helios 64 review,

367
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,400
which finally got me to really take MKDocs seriously

368
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,480
and really went through the documentation

369
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,680
with a fine tooth comb.

370
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,000
And I've enabled all the features that I want.

371
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,320
And the only thing I haven't done yet is comments,

372
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,920
which I might do, I might not, I haven't decided yet.

373
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,960
But the material theme for MKDocs really is stunning.

374
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,280
And I don't think at the moment

375
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,200
there's a better open source documentation platform.

376
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,440
Yeah, I will say that just the presentation.

377
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,960
So not even commenting on what it's like

378
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,480
to actually write on it,

379
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,440
but the presentation is extremely readable.

380
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,960
You know, documentation,

381
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,840
especially something as extensive as a topic like this

382
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,680
can be just a chore to get through.

383
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,760
But the way it lays out, like you said,

384
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,880
the way it does some of the different quoting and code blocks

385
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,000
and all of it, just all of it is really,

386
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
it's just, it makes me want to use it for my stuff.

387
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,880
So I was going to ask you,

388
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,160
I was going to talk to you about MKDocs

389
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,800
and see what you thought,

390
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,760
because yeah, it's really seems impressive.

391
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,880
And probably the perfect solution

392
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,680
for just JB internal documentation.

393
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,240
Yeah, I mean, it's all, everything's written in Markdown.

394
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,160
So if in the future you decided to use a different solution

395
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,720
for some reason, it's just plain text.

396
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,400
It's not in a CMS somewhere, lives in a Git repo

397
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,560
and just copy and paste and job done.

398
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,360
That's pretty nice.

399
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,360
Well, so as we record right now, this isn't live.

400
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,720
So what's your plan?

401
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,000
I assume you're gonna try to get it out

402
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,840
when the show goes live.

403
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,320
If you look at my GitHub commit history this week,

404
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,760
it's gonna be bright green.

405
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
I'm working away feverishly on this

406
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,720
to get it done by the end of 2020.

407
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,360
So I'm aiming for a New Year's Eve launch.

408
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,960
So by the time you listen to this episode,

409
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,360
it should be live, perfectmediaserver.com.

410
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,160
Let me know what you think at ironicbadger on Twitter.

411
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,240
I would love to hear what you think

412
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,840
because I've put a lot of time,

413
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,480
probably several hundred hours into this site

414
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,080
by the end of it, all told.

415
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,320
I'd also accept PRs on the GitHub repo.

416
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,280
So if you want to open an issue,

417
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
if you find a mistake or something,

418
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,760
which is highly likely at the pace I'm working right now,

419
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,840
let me know through a GitHub issue

420
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,120
or open a pull request or something.

421
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,160
I would love to hear from you.

422
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,240
Okay, needsmorebutterfs documentation.

423
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,120
Serious, seriously, geez.

424
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,560
You sir are a grade A troll, thank you.

425
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,760
linode.com slash SSH.

426
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,080
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account

427
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,760
and go there to support the show.

428
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,000
Linode is our cloud hosting provider.

429
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,280
And because the price is so great,

430
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,480
they can make it possible for you to use Linode

431
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,520
even for a small deployment or for a large deployment.

432
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,200
Jeff used Linode to test migrate

433
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,040
his important Nextcloud setup.

434
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,280
He just took things one step at a time

435
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,720
using different guides on Linode

436
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
to make sure everything was right.

437
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,600
And he says, eventually after about three pages of notes,

438
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,720
he did a completed successful migration.

439
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,800
And then he was able to take that knowledge,

440
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,200
take that hands-on experience

441
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,280
and go actually implement it on his production Nextcloud instance.

442
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,320
He said, but in the testing,

443
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,240
he noticed that even their smaller Linodes

444
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,280
were still faster than his local quad-core

445
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,800
16 gigabyte local machine.

446
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,320
So he's looking at maybe just hosting it on linode.com.

447
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,640
And Alex, I know that you're using Linode

448
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,320
for the perfect mediaserver.com.

449
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,120
I sure am.

450
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,840
Yeah, same node as is doing the Wiki

451
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,880
and gallery.selfhosted.show is doing perfect mediaserver.com.

452
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,040
So you can really squeeze quite a lot

453
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,320
out of these little things.

454
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,880
I love hearing how people are using Linode.

455
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,440
So do let me know either at the contact form

456
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,200
or at Chris Lass on Twitter.

457
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,000
Because with $5 a month worth of data,

458
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,920
$5 a month rigs, you can do a lot.

459
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,600
But they also have dedicated CPU systems

460
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,880
or machines with tons of RAM or lots of GPU.

461
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,760
So go experiment with that $100 60 day credit.

462
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,320
They also offer S3 object storage.

463
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,200
This is a great way to store things in the cloud

464
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,600
that don't need a Linode or a server sitting in front of them.

465
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,160
You can just generate a public URL for that asset.

466
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,000
I do this for soundboard clips.

467
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,360
You can do this for websites.

468
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,760
It's a great way to get a super fast portfolio

469
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,400
where everything's stored statically in object storage.

470
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,600
And their prices are great.

471
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,840
They also have load balancers and they have data centers

472
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,680
in 11 locations around the world.

473
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,840
So you're going to find something close to you

474
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,680
or close to your client.

475
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,560
So go to linode.com slash SSH.

476
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,120
Go there, get that $100 60 day credit,

477
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,400
apply that towards a new account

478
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,240
and go there to support the show.

479
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,080
You help make independent content like this free

480
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,720
when you go to linode.com slash SSH.

481
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,520
I can't quite believe just how many Powerline emails

482
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,200
we had this week though, can you?

483
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,680
Alex, it was wild.

484
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,240
So I responded to several of them directly.

485
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,160
I figured we respond to a couple here in the show

486
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,560
when we had a few people write in about this stuff.

487
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,520
I kind of suspected that Powerline networking

488
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,960
was probably something that got more use and deployments

489
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,560
than kind of gets representation

490
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,240
because there's so many scenarios

491
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,560
where Wi-Fi just doesn't work, especially older style Wi-Fi,

492
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,880
non mesh Wi-Fi, where like either a house construction materials

493
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,040
involved or distance or all kinds of weird things.

494
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,720
Like I have a family member who's next to an airport

495
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,080
and their radio signal situation is just crazy.

496
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
It's just, it's just unusable.

497
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,320
So I suspected we would hear a lot about this,

498
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,840
but JT wrote in to say that he's been using Powerline adapters

499
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,200
for a couple of years.

500
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,240
He currently has three of the TP-Link AV1000s,

501
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,040
which is the kit I bought, with two different kits

502
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,400
and he's using them without any issues.

503
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,720
So he bought two of the kits, two of what I have,

504
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,240
and they all link together.

505
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,400
He says, I do have a problem with one of the rooms though,

506
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
where one adapter normally gets about 120 megabits

507
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,040
and then it gets out of sync

508
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,520
and it starts dropping packets like mad,

509
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,600
dropping the bandwidth next to nothing.

510
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,400
Sometimes even less than a megabit, but if I unplug

511
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
and re-plug them back in, it seems to fix it.

512
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,000
It happens from time to time, but also I wanted to give

513
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
just a quick shout out to cloudfree.shop,

514
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,320
one of our official unofficial sponsors here

515
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,520
of the self-hosted podcast, coupon code self-hosted.

516
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,360
He said cloudfree.shop finally gave him the kick in the butt

517
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,440
he needed to begin automating his home.

518
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,520
He says, I never want anything really connected to the cloud

519
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,240
and with smart plugs from Cloudfree and Home Assistant,

520
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,920
it felt like I had to do something about it.

521
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,880
And Home Assistant, it felt like I could finally get started.

522
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
The first thing that I automated

523
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,280
was my bearded dragon's cage lights.

524
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
Yep, one of the first things I automated here in the studio

525
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,400
was my fish tank lights.

526
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,480
So totally, totally with you, JT.

527
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,880
He says, which got rid of a terrible

528
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,680
constantly clicking analog timer that I used to use.

529
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,760
I also bought a D1 mini ESP8266 Wi-Fi board

530
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,600
and a BME280 temperature pressure and humidity sensor

531
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,320
and combine them into an MQTT based sensor

532
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,640
that Home Assistant uses to control the heat lamp

533
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,440
in the cage.

534
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,480
Heck yeah, he did.

535
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,560
That's great.

536
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,840
That's the next level.

537
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,000
Talk about like you want a backup,

538
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,720
no fail state for that thing.

539
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,000
He says the spousal approval factor was very high

540
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,240
on these purchases and the time I spent learning to solder.

541
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,520
That's great.

542
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,760
Says thanks for the shows, looking forward to the next one.

543
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,960
Good to hear that JT.

544
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,920
I love it when it works out.

545
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,480
And yeah, for those of you who are new to the show,

546
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,120
cloudfree.shop is a community built store

547
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,880
and we're official, unofficial, official sponsors,

548
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,440
or they are.

549
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,640
We just love them and we worked out a deal.

550
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,040
We use the promo code and you get devices

551
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,400
that don't have like the cloud connected stuff on there.

552
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,920
You know, sometimes I like a little cloud,

553
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,000
like I put a sync thing server up in the cloud,

554
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,360
made stuff faster.

555
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,000
But the smart plug that controls the old fish tank,

556
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,600
I don't want any cloud involved with that.

557
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
You know, it's just how it goes.

558
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,600
And you also don't have to wait

559
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,440
necessarily on the slow boat from China

560
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,040
sometimes for these things to arrive.

561
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,560
So true, true.

562
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,720
It is nice that they are state side as well.

563
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,760
Yeah, that's good.

564
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,400
That's a good point.

565
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,240
Ro wrote in about Powerline Finicky.

566
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,160
And I think the reason I included his email

567
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,120
is because he referred to us as Chris and the Badger,

568
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:20,000
which gave me like this morning AM or FM radio vibe.

569
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,880
And I just pictured you and I doing a morning KWRAX.

570
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,760
Chris and the Badger.

571
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,120
Yeah, I can hear it now.

572
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,080
It's Chris and the Badger.

573
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,040
Welcome to Chris and the Badger.

574
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,600
Chris and the Badger.

575
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,080
Chris and the Badger.

576
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,880
It's the Badger.

577
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,280
Yeah, I could see that.

578
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,960
Oh, I want a listener now to try and make us a jingle.

579
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,160
Chris and the Badger, please.

580
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,720
That would be fun.

581
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,680
Chris and the Badger in the morning.

582
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,080
He says, Chris, I was surprised to hear about

583
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,200
your experiences with Powerline.

584
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,960
I've been using the TP-Link Powerline products

585
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,440
for several years now, and I've had mixed results.

586
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,800
In my experience, it works.

587
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,480
But sometimes it has some problems

588
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,280
that make it hard to really recommend.

589
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,520
And he tells me about different products

590
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,960
that he's tried and troubleshooting.

591
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,000
And he has a pretty solid looking house layout.

592
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,480
There's nothing too crazy about his electrical.

593
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,360
It's a modern house, and it's shorter than 300 meters

594
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,440
and all of that kind of stuff that you'd look at.

595
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,760
But he says Powerline works, but it's definitely

596
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,320
nowhere as fast as wired ethernet.

597
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,000
In fact, it isn't even as fast as some of the mesh Wi-Fi

598
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,800
that he's tested.

599
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
So he did several different kind of speed tests for us

600
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,800
and said in all, he is able to get better performance

601
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,840
on mesh Wi-Fi.

602
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,440
But in some situations where Wi-Fi didn't reach

603
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,560
or there was other issues, he was still able to get

604
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,840
around 100, 150 megabits with his Powerline adapters.

605
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,240
In one case, depending on a product he tried,

606
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,920
he was able to get 300 megabits,

607
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
which that's pretty respectable.

608
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,680
That's really all I'd want over Powerline.

609
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,280
I'm not expecting gigabit.

610
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,280
I mean, if all you're doing is streaming on Kodi

611
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,440
or something like that, that's all you need.

612
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
He points out, and it's a great thing to consider,

613
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,720
is a little play of words that these manufacturers use.

614
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,200
Yes.

615
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,960
And I haven't verified this, but according to him,

616
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,280
he says, when they say it's a gigabit,

617
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,840
they mean it's a gigabit when you combine

618
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,440
the send and the receive.

619
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,360
It's actually half a gigabit in both directions.

620
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,400
In a perfect world when there is no wind outside,

621
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,800
they're about one centimeter apart, probably, yes.

622
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,040
So if you get a two gigabit model,

623
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,480
which there are two gigabit units,

624
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,960
then it's one gigabit send, one gigabit receive.

625
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,240
It's actually a one gigabit unit the way we think of it

626
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,760
in terms of like Ethernet adapters.

627
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,120
So that's a little trick or ruskies that they like to pull,

628
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,240
that when they're quoting speeds,

629
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,640
they're quoting just a send or receive.

630
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,040
But we got lots of other feedback.

631
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,400
Some people thought that it was,

632
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,760
that maybe I'd have better performance

633
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,440
if I didn't have solar panels on the RV,

634
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,200
that they thought maybe that was causing

635
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,880
some high degree of interference

636
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,640
just because of the intensity of that.

637
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,120
But those systems are totally separate.

638
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,760
The house power doesn't connect

639
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,200
to like the charge controller or the batteries directly.

640
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,440
Yeah, because a lot of folks wrote in and said

641
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,600
that if you have coax in your walls,

642
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,400
you can actually get power line over coax adapters.

643
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,800
And because they're not carrying any signal

644
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,360
in modern houses, generally speaking anymore,

645
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,640
you can actually get away with running Ethernet over those

646
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,720
and they're a very clean signal.

647
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,480
So you get better performance that way.

648
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,080
That could be worth looking into.

649
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, I got a couple of spots that have coax pre-run.

650
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,760
That's interesting.

651
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,400
I don't know, Alex, maybe one day in the future.

652
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,880
Brad wrote in about a killer mobo with a QuickSync.

653
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,440
Yeah, he's found the ASRock J5040 ITX board.

654
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,600
It's a mini ITX form factor with a quad core Pentium chip

655
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,680
and it has QuickSync version 6.0.5.

656
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Now he wrote in about this one because of energy usage.

657
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,000
This one idles, he says, between 10 and 15 watts only.

658
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,120
But it also has four SATA ports,

659
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,040
which I thought, hmm, this would make a really nice

660
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,200
sort of NAS motherboard potentially

661
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,640
because four hard drives, a small enclosure,

662
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,880
low power draw, QuickSync.

663
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,600
You're pushing my buttons here, Brad.

664
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,440
Yeah, really, me too.

665
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,960
It looks like a really nice motherboard.

666
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,000
Yeah, this ASRock J5040 ITX.

667
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,880
We'll put a link in the show notes.

668
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,560
But that hardware acceleration, that QuickSync,

669
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,720
that QuickSync, boy, that is looking really good.

670
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
And this you could totally bill,

671
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,200
I bet you for, if you had the storage,

672
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,520
I bet two, $300 to build a nice system

673
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,800
with a decent little case with some memory around this thing.

674
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,880
It's a passive CPU as well.

675
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,240
So it takes, it doesn't need a fan on the CPU.

676
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,560
Also, it takes sort of laptop style SO-DIMM memory.

677
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,160
So this thing is tiny.

678
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,280
It's got a couple of M2 slots on there for Wi-Fi if you want.

679
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,680
So yeah, yeah, go ahead and check that one out.

680
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,000
That looks like a really, really useful little build.

681
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,800
Stefan wrote in to tell us about some benchmarks in German

682
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,200
that show that the latest AMD desktop APUs

683
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,280
are getting idle power well below 10 watts.

684
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,640
And depending on the motherboard, as low as six or seven watts.

685
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,040
So it seems like there's something to watch there too.

686
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,480
Oh, I'm trying to avoid buying a Ryzen 5000.

687
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,840
I'm really trying to avoid it,

688
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,440
but stuff like that makes me want to buy one.

689
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,400
Hey, while we're doing feedback,

690
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,080
I want to take a moment and mention

691
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,360
that a Cloud Guru has a Python 3 scripting course

692
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,960
for system administrators,

693
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,120
where you can develop the skills you need to write effective

694
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,920
and powerful scripts and create command line tools using Python 3.

695
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,200
So in the course, you're going to develop skills

696
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,840
you need to write effective and powerful Python scripts.

697
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,280
And it's a big one.

698
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,320
So beyond the language itself,

699
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,920
you'll go through the full development process,

700
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,960
including project setup, planning, automated testing

701
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,040
to build two different command line tools and more.

702
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,120
So check out the link we'll have in the show notes

703
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,520
for the Python 3 scripting for system administrators

704
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,880
at a cloudguru.com.

705
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,240
Hey, so I'm sat here whilst we were recording

706
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,840
and thought my feet are cold.

707
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,920
So whilst you were reading that ad spot,

708
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,360
I logged into my home assistant

709
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,200
and just bumped up the thermostat a little bit.

710
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,240
That's nice, isn't it?

711
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,920
Yeah, yeah.

712
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,680
I think my favorite still is because of the home assistant

713
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,600
and the home kit integration.

714
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,040
When I'm driving home,

715
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,800
I just push a button on the steering wheel

716
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,160
and I tell the computer just to turn on,

717
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,520
you know, the heaters to extra heat.

718
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,120
We have an extra heat mode that kind of brings up

719
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,280
the temperature more, a little quicker.

720
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,520
And so when I buy the, and turn on the lights.

721
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,680
So when I get home, all the lights are on.

722
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,880
Place is nice and toasty.

723
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,400
Oh, I've been thinking about like an NFC tag

724
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,440
on the dashboard or something

725
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,840
that I could just tap with my phone maybe.

726
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,320
I haven't done it, but I've been thinking about it.

727
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,360
I've been thinking about that too.

728
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,640
I actually have an NFC tag at the door out the studio.

729
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,560
So on my way out the studio, I can tap it.

730
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,400
And right now it just kind of sends like an alert

731
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,920
to the wife with an ETA and all of that kind of stuff,

732
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,320
you know, based on my location and her location.

733
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
But I have been thinking, man, it'd be pretty great

734
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,880
to tie that in with the heating and the lighting,

735
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,640
check to see if it's on or not.

736
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,280
NFC tags and all of that is probably still

737
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,800
the most underutilized area because on iOS,

738
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,760
it kind of sucks.

739
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,960
And I think it's similar on Android,

740
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,640
but not quite the same where on iOS,

741
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,480
it just brings up, as far as I understand it,

742
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,600
a notification prompt that you then have to tap

743
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,480
to execute the NFC automation.

744
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,080
And that just sounds like garbage.

745
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,040
Not true on Android.

746
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,200
I just tap the tag and my garage door opens.

747
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,400
It's amazing.

748
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,520
That's what I want.

749
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,080
I can kind of see maybe why Apple did it this way

750
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,000
for novices who, you know, they don't want to execute stuff

751
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,360
randomly on their phone.

752
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,800
But man, I totally appreciate that,

753
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,480
but I just would love a setting to say,

754
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,160
don't require user interaction.

755
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,760
It just totally kills the usefulness.

756
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,160
I have also here on the studio mixer,

757
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,640
I have an NFC tag because for some reason,

758
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,080
Behringer thought it'd be a great idea

759
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,480
to put like a phone holder on the mixer

760
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,520
because the idea is you're going to use

761
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,040
like their touchscreen app on your phone.

762
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,240
And so I have a spot where my phone sits

763
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,040
and I just put an NFC tag in that spot,

764
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,320
just set my phone to D and D

765
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,840
and turn on the studio lights,

766
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,600
which are on Home Assistant and all that.

767
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,240
Oli wrote into the holiday mailbag

768
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,520
and said, I'm a longtime listener,

769
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,280
occasional disc order from Norway.

770
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,680
And we talk about storage setups on the show a little bit,

771
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,480
but I'd love you to go into some details with setups

772
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,040
ranging from smaller setups to bigger setups.

773
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,080
Do you have any strategies deciding on what you invest in?

774
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,480
My backups are going to Backblaze,

775
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,000
but I'm rethinking things a little bit

776
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,760
and I think I want more same local storage,

777
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,680
but I'm a little put off at the price.

778
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,200
What would be a sweet spot in terms of discs and storage

779
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,680
for about an eight terabyte media collection

780
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,320
as well as some more personal media like photos

781
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,840
that I just don't want to lose?

782
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,040
Any links would be great too.

783
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,360
Man, this question was made for me, wasn't it?

784
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,640
It really was.

785
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,000
So, perfectmediaserver.com, first of all,

786
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,240
I think is where I will send you in the first instance

787
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,680
to look at the software side of things.

788
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,960
I will be building up the hardware recommendation section

789
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,560
of that site over the next few months.

790
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,800
But really, I would just take a look at serverbuilds.net.

791
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,160
They have some amazing used enterprise gear

792
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,560
and I know it's quite a US centric website,

793
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,480
but you can still get a lot of good ideas

794
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
about what to use, like QuickSync, for example,

795
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,680
that came from JDM, the guy behind that site

796
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,800
who we've had on the show before.

797
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,360
And just take a look at what they're doing

798
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,000
and the trends and the way the industry's going

799
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,400
with what those guys are doing over there at Server Builds.

800
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,800
And I think you can probably get away

801
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,280
with a fairly minimal kind of setup.

802
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,040
So you've got eight terabytes worth of stuff

803
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,760
you want to store.

804
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,400
So I would buy a hard drive that is at least eight,

805
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,200
probably 10 or 12 terabytes, so you've got a bit of headroom,

806
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,120
and buy a pair of them so that you can have full redundancy.

807
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,840
You're already using Backblaze, so RAID is not backup.

808
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,480
It's a very common phrase that you'll hear people say.

809
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,560
Make sure that you have everything duplicated

810
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,160
in at least two different physical locations.

811
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,640
So even if that just takes the form of a USB hard drive

812
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,280
that you leave at your parents' house, when you go and see them

813
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,320
one day in the future, who knows?

814
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,840
The world is so different right now.

815
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,440
But if it's just a USB hard drive in a drawer

816
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,240
at a parent's house, then that will do the trick as well

817
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,840
in a lot of situations, unless you have lots of media

818
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,800
being added all the time.

819
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,880
But I don't think that's the use case for a lot of people.

820
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,160
I think most people, those kind of periodical backups

821
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,840
every three to six months is probably sufficient

822
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:55,840
so build yourself a small mini ITX, couple of bay box

823
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,680
and stick the perfect media server stack on there

824
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,720
and you'll be good to go.

825
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,840
Yeah, thankfully, eight terabytes is a really

826
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,400
pretty doable problem to solve.

827
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,240
So of course, you want more than that.

828
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,240
At least I'd say go 12 terabytes, if not more,

829
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,480
if you already are using eight terabytes.

830
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,080
And you could probably even justify

831
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,000
a bit more than that.

832
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But that's some great strategy advice right there

833
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,440
and perfect timing for the show too, so best of luck.

834
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,800
I would take a look at Amazon.de,

835
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,000
quite often have the Western Digital,

836
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,440
what are they called over there?

837
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,280
They're not easy stores because they're Best Buy

838
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,240
like US centric ones.

839
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,840
They're called My Books, I think, in Europe.

840
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,080
You can quite often get those for a 10, 12, 14 terabyte

841
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,080
hard drive in the 200, 250 euro range.

842
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
So that would be a good place to start.

843
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,840
It's not gonna be super cheap.

844
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,840
My philosophy with regards to how much local storage

845
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,840
do I need versus cloud is it's up to you, right?

846
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,840
It's your personal risk profile.

847
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,200
And how important is this data to you?

848
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,280
Are you gonna be upset if Backblaze,

849
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,640
I don't know if they're going to,

850
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,520
but if they turn around next week and trick you

851
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,040
triple their prices, what are you gonna do if that happens?

852
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,840
If you have a hard drive in your closet,

853
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,560
you know upfront what that cost is gonna be,

854
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,360
what the total cost of ownership for that storage

855
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,440
is gonna be, and there'd be no surprises

856
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,240
or anything like that.

857
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,000
So, I mean, you're talking to a guy

858
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,680
that's got 100 terabytes in his basement,

859
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,080
so maybe I'm not the right guy to speak to.

860
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,160
And the other guy who's like,

861
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,760
I need to get more disks as fast as possible.

862
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
I've only got 12 terabytes free right now.

863
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,480
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

864
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,720
But really there's so many ways to solve it,

865
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,640
but I'd love to hear what you do.

866
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,840
So go to selfhosted.show slash contact to update us.

867
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,080
And then Scott wrote in with another question

868
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,680
that I have a sense the audience

869
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,040
may have a few answers for us.

870
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
So keep that contact link in mind.

871
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,960
He says, I was hoping you could make a recommendation

872
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,080
for self-hosted online cookbook.

873
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,840
My mother has a huge cookbook

874
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,920
full of old family recipes,

875
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,840
which I would like to digitalize ideally with OCR

876
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,000
and the ability to take and search the recipes

877
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,680
as well as preserving original image

878
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,080
of the old handwritten family recipe.

879
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,000
Scott, I love this idea.

880
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,440
What do you think, Alex?

881
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,680
Has anything come to mind for you?

882
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,320
Well, we covered Chowdown a little while ago

883
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,560
as a self-hosted recipes app.

884
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,520
There is another one,

885
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,440
which whilst we're doing this segment,

886
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,200
I will try and find,

887
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,640
which I can't remember right now,

888
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,480
but there is also an old JB project, isn't it?

889
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,520
Yeah, that's true.

890
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,240
That is true.

891
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,840
There is the open your mouth recipes,

892
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,880
which we actually used GitHub and Markdown for those.

893
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
I was thinking Scott could get started

894
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,080
without any software selected yet

895
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,240
by just getting good quality captures of those cards.

896
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,000
And he's gonna want probably something

897
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,800
he can take over to grandma's house or mom's house

898
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
or whoever, the aunt or uncle,

899
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,200
whoever the family members you wanna capture these from

900
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,320
because why not get them all, right?

901
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,000
You could probably get away with something like ScanBot

902
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,360
or the other available scanning apps on your phone,

903
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,880
but you might look into scanner options too

904
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,000
and just start there.

905
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,560
Start getting the high quality images from there

906
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,800
and then the software will come.

907
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,520
I found it.

908
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,400
Okay, it's called Vabine 1111 slash recipes.

909
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,640
What a catchy name, huh?

910
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,920
It's a Django application designed for managing recipes

911
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,200
and it's a web app.

912
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,240
So I would imagine it runs out of a container,

913
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,160
but it's got a search built

914
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,560
on top of Django's trigram similarity search engine

915
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,120
and it allows you to create and search for tags

916
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,920
and assign them in batches to certain files

917
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,680
matching certain criteria.

918
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,720
It will sync with both Dropbox and Nextcloud

919
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,840
with more support being added every week.

920
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,760
And you can import lots of recipes from different websites

921
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,560
with JSON objects and stuff like that.

922
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,720
And there are also apps for mobile devices

923
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,000
like phones and tablets.

924
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,960
So yeah, lots and lots of stuff in there,

925
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,240
runs in a Docker.

926
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,680
This is what the Reddit collective thought recommends

927
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,240
at the moment.

928
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,160
So I haven't tried this one.

929
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,080
I just haven't got to it, but it's on my short list.

930
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,560
So go and take a look at that link in the show notes.

931
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,880
I also recall that groceries had a bit of a recipe manager.

932
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,760
I don't recall how extensive it was,

933
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,600
but that's a past pick too.

934
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,040
So we'll put links to all of these.

935
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,640
The one that Alex just talked about,

936
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,120
you could see the example of how we used Open Your Mouth

937
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,440
on GitHub and just made it a community project.

938
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,880
So you could have multiple family members

939
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,920
that contribute that way.

940
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,240
Or perhaps somebody out there will know

941
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,960
a great software project that we haven't mentioned

942
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,120
and inform us all at selfhosted.show.com.

943
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,040
The last one in our holiday extravaganza mailbag here

944
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,400
is a Joshua writes in regarding thoughts

945
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,880
that were inspired by self-hosted episode 33

946
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,280
triggered by the Helios 64 discussion.

947
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
He says, hey guys, I was listening to your review

948
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,040
of the Helios 64 with some interest

949
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,440
since I am the owner of their previous product,

950
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,560
the Helios 4. I believe the points you make

951
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,160
about software are quite valid.

952
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,200
Yet I'd like to point out

953
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,600
that there's a really hard problem to solve.

954
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,920
I work personally with a company in Israel

955
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
that makes SBCs and SOMs,

956
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,280
mostly with ARM-based system on chips.

957
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,600
It's my job to make Debian available

958
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,280
for each product to their customers.

959
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,440
Long ago, when I started,

960
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,120
I really wanted to do this the right way.

961
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,880
I submitted bug reports and patches

962
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,320
to the Debian project for enabling

963
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,760
all kinds of small things.

964
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,600
A kernel.config for a driver here,

965
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,200
a customized boot script there,

966
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,840
enabling OpenGL ES backends and shared libraries,

967
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,720
and continuously watching and testing

968
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,800
the distributions for things that break.

969
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,200
Turns out I never got to the point

970
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,920
where I could give customers a pure Debian system.

971
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,120
There's always another tweak

972
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,200
that I had to carry out of tree.

973
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,680
So to this day, I'm creating block device images

974
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,360
with custom kernel packages,

975
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,200
integrated binary blobs,

976
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,480
and maybe a system D service

977
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,080
for loading Bluetooth firmware

978
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,400
and even patched parts of X or Wayland.

979
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,720
So why do I tell you all of this?

980
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,560
Well, the reason being for a new product,

981
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,960
it takes time and continued effort

982
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,720
for mainlining all the things.

983
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,480
And the experience can differ largely

984
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,640
by a particular SOC in your hands.

985
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,640
And you'll find that despite even when

986
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,760
the vendor does everything right,

987
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,720
it's still not perfect.

988
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,400
To really solve this problem,

989
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,080
there has to be a way for hardware makers

990
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,160
who are both capable and willing to do the work

991
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,280
to achieve something greater

992
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,120
than what I was able to do in my job.

993
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,680
In his opinion, it's just not there yet,

994
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,360
he says, Alex, that the ecosystem

995
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,400
just can't support the kind of rapid support

996
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,080
that the hardware needs at this stage.

997
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,440
And you know, after reading this,

998
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,160
I was thinking, look at the Raspberry Pi.

999
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,160
It's been around forever.

1000
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,360
And of course, they've had iterations

1001
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,160
that have changed things,

1002
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,640
but you really still even there,

1003
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,400
you kind of have to get an image

1004
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,640
that's at least been tested for the Raspberry Pi.

1005
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,720
You can now get the Ubuntu ARM image

1006
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,640
and it will boot on the Raspberry Pi.

1007
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,400
But that's only just recently.

1008
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,560
And it's really not there with all distros.

1009
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,840
Yeah, you make a good point.

1010
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,480
I mean, the Ubuntu image for the Pi 4

1011
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,760
has made a big difference for me

1012
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,080
to the overall kind of feel of it

1013
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,040
being a real, air quotes, a real device.

1014
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,800
And it's now in production for me.

1015
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,320
I'm using it as Pi KVM,

1016
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,920
which ironically runs on Arch.

1017
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,640
But anyway, yeah, I agree with you.

1018
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,160
I mean, I ended up getting ZFS

1019
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,560
working on the Helios 64 after the review.

1020
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,800
In the end, it was a few days,

1021
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,760
there was a kernel update

1022
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,360
and DKMS started working again.

1023
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,200
But yeah, I just don't know how

1024
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,200
without an Apple level of control

1025
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,720
over both the hardware and software,

1026
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,480
you could ever hope to solve this problem fully.

1027
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,520
Slow but steady.

1028
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,600
There are standards like server ready

1029
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,040
that try to solve this more for the data center.

1030
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,880
But those lessons could be learned

1031
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,840
in the consumer devices.

1032
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,120
But there's just not necessarily the vendor buy-in.

1033
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,280
And there's not necessarily the vendor buy-in

1034
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,640
to support the development, right?

1035
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,080
That's an area where they could apply

1036
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,440
a little bit of leverage.

1037
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,520
They could hire people to just write the code

1038
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,400
and contribute it more

1039
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,000
and participate in these projects.

1040
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,040
But it's only so scalable.

1041
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,440
And it's really not a problem

1042
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,240
we have on the x86 side of things.

1043
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,240
We're so kind of swept up by the power usage of ARM

1044
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,760
or the small size form factor or the price point.

1045
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,640
I think we forget some of the luxuries

1046
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,440
that we've gained over the years with the x86 platform.

1047
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,080
It just works.

1048
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,040
You don't have to think about it.

1049
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,400
You don't have to grab a special version

1050
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,280
of a Linux distro or Windows

1051
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,280
or whatever it is to run on it.

1052
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,720
And with Apple changing to ARM based CPUs,

1053
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,400
that's the first real departure

1054
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
that mainstream computing has seen

1055
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,800
from x86 instruction sets for 15 years.

1056
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
And I think that's gonna influence,

1057
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,640
hopefully in five years time or so,

1058
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,960
the rest of the industry will run on it.

1059
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,280
We'll be in a similar position to where Apple are now

1060
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,880
with that kind of level of integration.

1061
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,960
Of course, Apple will be five years

1062
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,160
further down the road by then.

1063
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,400
So who knows, maybe they'll never catch up.

1064
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,600
But it's a really interesting time for sure.

1065
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,320
And I really wanna support these guys

1066
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,600
doing these projects like COBOL.

1067
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,280
They're a small team.

1068
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,640
They're not doing this to become millionaires overnight.

1069
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,440
They're doing it for the love, I'm sure.

1070
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,600
And they made a really great product.

1071
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,120
It just missed in a few key areas.

1072
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,840
So I wanted to let some of the listeners know

1073
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,520
that I will be selling my Helios 64.

1074
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,280
So if you're interested in the market,

1075
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,600
just let me know via Twitter.

1076
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,480
You don't have to wait for it to ship

1077
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,080
or anything for the next batch.

1078
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,040
We'll sort something out.

1079
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,960
Just leave a little stink on it when you ship it out.

1080
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,480
Let's make it real special, okay?

1081
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,560
Get a little bit your stink on there.

1082
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,800
I'll sign the inside in Tipex or something.

1083
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,360
How about that?

1084
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,120
I wanna say also a special thank you

1085
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,920
to our members at selfhosted.show slash SRE.

1086
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,880

You get a post show.

1089
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,440
I think it's gonna be a doozy today.

1090
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,840
So thank you to our SRE team.

1091
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,080

1097
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,720

1098
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,120
with the gargantuan amounts of feedback we've had.

1099
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,360
I mean, we really only got to a small portion of it

1100
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,240
this episode, but please do keep sending it in

1101
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,960
because it keeps us vitalized and connected with you guys.

1102

And particularly in these present times,

1103
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,040
hearing from you helps us keep the show focused

1104
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,400
on what you guys wanna hear about.
