WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
I said I wouldn't do it until it was at least 10,000 miles old, but here I am at seven and a

00:05.120 --> 00:12.000
half thousand miles. I just tuned my Golf R. Okay, now when you say tune, there's like a couple of

00:12.000 --> 00:15.280
different ways to interpret that when you're talking about the Golf, because they have several

00:15.280 --> 00:20.240
levels of tuning, there's software tuning. You got to break it down for me. It's weird, right? So

00:20.240 --> 00:25.200
people say, oh, I've gone stage one, I've gone stage two, all this kind of stuff. So I've gone

00:25.200 --> 00:32.960
stage one with an equilibrium tune. I was at a car show at the weekend at the local tuning house

00:32.960 --> 00:38.560
in Raleigh, Black Forest Industries. I took the R32 down there and exhibited that off in their kind

00:38.560 --> 00:44.160
of main like exhibitor area. And I took the R down there as well. And nobody was interested in that

00:44.160 --> 00:49.600
one because it's too new and too common. But I got talking to a few guys about tuning options and

00:49.600 --> 00:54.320
stuff like that. And someone was selling what's called a cob access port. This is a tiny little

00:54.320 --> 01:03.280
cell phone sized computer that you plug into the OBD2 port of your car. I then paid $175 to a

01:03.280 --> 01:10.800
company called Equilibrium Tuning to purchase a staged tune map. So what they do is they go into

01:10.800 --> 01:15.920
the ECU and they remap all the valve timings and injections and all that kind of stuff. And so it

01:15.920 --> 01:24.800
takes the car from being a 280 horsepower car to being a 370 horsepower car with no hardware mods

01:24.800 --> 01:32.000
required. No way. It's insane. That's remarkable. I did something similar to my RV and I think I

01:32.000 --> 01:39.120
got like a 10 horsepower improvement. 10. These four cylinder, two liter turbo engines that are

01:39.120 --> 01:44.800
in the Golf, it's the same engine as is in your GTI. The only difference with the R is there's

01:44.800 --> 01:49.520
an uprated turbo. It's a bit of a bigger turbo. And the R is all wheel drive versus your front

01:49.520 --> 01:54.720
wheel drive. I tell you, if you've never got into tuning and you want to talk to someone about it

01:54.720 --> 01:58.720
and you've been thinking about it, I would love to talk to you on Discord. I won't take up too much

01:58.720 --> 02:04.000
more of the show about it. But just to say I'm giddy with excitement with the possibilities that

02:04.000 --> 02:09.520
this has unlocked for me. Yeah, that's amazing. And so can I flash my GTI with a software update

02:09.520 --> 02:15.520
in theory and see some sort of improvement too? Yeah. Oh, man. Oh, boy, it's getting dangerous.

02:15.520 --> 02:19.680
I think it's just about as much horsepower as you'd want with a two wheel drive car. But of

02:19.680 --> 02:24.400
course, what do I know? But to me, it seems like it seems like if you get much more, I'd want to

02:24.400 --> 02:32.320
go all wheel drive. That's so awesome. I remember when I flashed my RV's ECU, it was a drive that

02:32.320 --> 02:38.880
you were driving a bus. It felt like I was driving more of a truck. That was a nice improvement just

02:38.880 --> 02:43.760
because the biggest change for me was it meant I could get on the on ramp. That's just it. Yeah.

02:43.760 --> 02:49.200
Yeah. At speed. And you know, I just had her checked. It's been flashed for probably three

02:49.200 --> 02:53.520
years now. And I just had her checked yesterday and she just passed all her checks. She's a

02:53.520 --> 02:59.280
excellent, healthy as can be. Yeah. Made it back from California in one piece. Yeah, we did. And

02:59.280 --> 03:05.920
now it's weird because we basically moved out to get some work done and I had to rip out the Wi-Fi

03:05.920 --> 03:10.640
network. And of course, my, you know, my Raspberry Pi server died. So all of my services were down

03:10.640 --> 03:16.800
and I had to shut down my Pi hole. And it's just strange. It doesn't quite feel like home anymore

03:16.800 --> 03:22.080
because I don't have control over everything that I want. Home is where the Wi-Fi is, right?

03:22.080 --> 03:27.200
Yeah. I don't have Wi-Fi. I don't have internet. It's so strange. So after tonight's episode,

03:27.200 --> 03:31.200
after we're done recording tonight, I'm going to go home, I hope, and get like the Pi hole

03:31.200 --> 03:35.280
and get the Wi-Fi back online. Well, I couldn't quite believe it when you messaged me this week

03:35.280 --> 03:41.760
and said that your home assistant Yella has finally shown up. It's ridiculous. It's here

03:41.760 --> 03:48.560
at perfect timing. It's perfect timing, right? Because the Raspberry Pi died on the road trip.

03:48.560 --> 03:53.040
I get home from the road trip and the yellow's there on the porch waiting for me. I saw the

03:53.040 --> 03:59.120
shipping notification. So I also ordered a one terabyte MVME stick. So I've already opened up

03:59.120 --> 04:04.560
the yellow once and I've installed an MVME drive. I have a quick pile of hardware here, Alex. Before

04:04.560 --> 04:10.560
I get to the yellow, I want to mention what I was going to use. This is a really cool piece of

04:10.560 --> 04:15.280
hardware that's been ruggedized, industrialized, can get into super hot conditions. And it's an

04:15.280 --> 04:21.520
Intel Atom system with QuickSync that's out of a Tesla solar wall that I picked up on the road

04:21.520 --> 04:26.720
trip from a listener. It's decent. You could even run a full Linux desktop on it and it only takes

04:26.720 --> 04:31.200
about five watts idle. So this is where I was considering going. The only problem with this

04:31.200 --> 04:36.000
box, and I'm probably still going to use it. I love that it's DC too. And it's got two COM ports,

04:36.000 --> 04:43.280
which is amazing. Is that an XT60 connector I see on the power cable? Yeah. Now I know who gave it

04:43.280 --> 04:49.360
to you. Yeah. And I'm probably going to use this for something else, but it's such a cool little

04:49.360 --> 04:53.920
box. I thought, okay, I've got an option now, right? So this was one of my options and it's

04:53.920 --> 05:01.200
an X86 box. Good power draw. Then the yellow arrived. Now I have to say I'm very impressed.

05:01.200 --> 05:05.120
I think the Home Assistant team did a good job with the case. I've taken it apart a couple of

05:05.120 --> 05:09.760
times. It goes right back together. I can get access to it really quick. They have the logo

05:09.760 --> 05:14.240
for Home Assistant ingrained in the casing. Laser etched up there. Yeah, it's nice. Yeah.

05:14.240 --> 05:19.200
And all the ports are on the back. The compute modules just popped right in. My MVME popped

05:19.200 --> 05:24.640
right in. I think this is going to be how I will do Home Assistant in the RV is on a dedicated

05:24.640 --> 05:29.680
machine. I'm going to have a dedicated machine for Home Assistant and I'm going to have an

05:29.680 --> 05:34.080
application server for all my other stuff. So Home Assistant yellow will run all of the

05:34.080 --> 05:39.760
automations and jupes. And you know, she's got this yellow has got EMMC for storage for the

05:39.760 --> 05:44.960
primary OS and they've got MVME expansion. I don't really know how you use that, but it's in there.

05:44.960 --> 05:49.920
So it's going to give me, I think I expect at least five years of runway with that device.

05:50.560 --> 05:57.200
But then on your encouragement, and I didn't expect this for like a month. I also picked up

05:58.000 --> 06:05.200
the Odroid H3 Plus that they announced shortly after our last episode. It arrived today

06:06.000 --> 06:10.160
just a little bit before the show. It's still in the packaging. You went for the plus, huh?

06:10.160 --> 06:15.120
Of course. Of course. Who am I talking to? Sorry, I forgot myself for a second.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.680
Now I'm showing Alex on the camera, but I'll describe it to you. But check this out,

06:19.680 --> 06:30.800
Alex. Here it is. It's got two Ethernets. It's got four USB-A. It's got USB-C, DC barrel power

06:30.800 --> 06:37.440
connector. It has audio out ports, including optical audio out, and it has HDMI and Display

06:37.440 --> 06:43.520
port. Plus it has an Intel chip on here. It's got a pretty meaty heat sink on it. And on the bottom,

06:44.240 --> 06:50.480
it's got two slots for RAM and a slot for an MVME disk. And the killer feature for me,

06:51.280 --> 06:56.080
two SATA ports on the board. That's massive. That's a game changer for me because I've been

06:56.080 --> 07:01.680
using USB storage forever. Welcome to the world of real hardware, dude.

07:01.680 --> 07:07.280
I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so pleased. I think it's going to be perfect.

07:07.280 --> 07:13.440
So this is what will replace my Raspberry Pi 4. And I'm going to run all my applications and more,

07:13.440 --> 07:16.480
right? Because I've got more horsepower here and it's got quick sync as well.

07:16.480 --> 07:20.400
I got to get some RAM ordered for it. I didn't expect it to arrive this soon. So I haven't

07:20.400 --> 07:24.320
ordered anything for it. What type of RAM is it? Laptop style, the smaller stuff?

07:24.320 --> 07:27.280
Yes. Yeah, it's the small stuff. I think it's DDR4.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.720
Do I recall reading that thing will take up to 64 gigs of RAM?

07:30.720 --> 07:34.560
Yes, I believe that is the case. I should have grabbed the specs before the show.

07:34.560 --> 07:38.640
I'm so excited. It's funny, right? Because when the Pi 4 died, I was like,

07:38.640 --> 07:42.880
crap, I don't know what I'm going to do. I have nothing I want to replace this with. I'm like,

07:42.880 --> 07:48.400
I guess I could build it around another Pi 4 again, but then I'm going through all this work

07:48.400 --> 07:52.320
and I'm not getting a performance upgrade. And then this thing shows up just a little

07:52.320 --> 07:54.880
bit after last episode. Yeah, it's perfect timing.

07:54.880 --> 07:59.600
They actually shipped it. I got it. I can't believe it. I can't believe it.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.440
I think what I want to do is first is I want to load desktop Linux on here just to see

08:03.440 --> 08:06.160
what it's like. And then I'll wipe it off immediately and start building,

08:06.880 --> 08:10.640
I think, a NixOS server. I mean, it looks amazing. And I shared it

08:10.640 --> 08:14.400
with you for this exact reason. It's got a passive heat sink on it. So, you know,

08:14.400 --> 08:20.080
it can run completely, completely silently, which is perfect for a small space like the RV.

08:20.080 --> 08:25.280
Yes, totally. The only thing I would change about it, and I don't have one,

08:25.280 --> 08:30.400
but the only thing I would change about it is the fact that both of those Nix are

08:30.400 --> 08:38.720
Realtek 2.5 gig Nix. I would have preferred two Intel Nix, just simply for better hardware

08:38.720 --> 08:44.640
compatibility reasons. In a real text, probably fine. But if ever I've had a Nick issue in the

08:44.640 --> 08:50.960
past, it's been not an Intel, Nick and a quantia or real tech or something like that. Whereas Intel

08:50.960 --> 08:57.120
Nix just work and it takes all the problems away. But anyway, I'm nitpicking. Otherwise,

08:57.120 --> 09:02.160
it's a fantastic looking board. I imagine they'll be fine, but I also 100% agree with you.

09:02.160 --> 09:07.840
I would also prefer that, though I'm just excited to have a Nick that isn't on the USB bus. So,

09:08.640 --> 09:12.400
that's good, too. I don't think it was for the Pi 4, but it is for most of the Pis. And

09:12.960 --> 09:16.720
if you wanted to ever add a secondary Nick to the Raspberry Pi to like use it for a firewall

09:16.720 --> 09:20.880
or something like that, you would be doing that over USB. So for me, it's like, okay, at least

09:20.880 --> 09:26.000
they're on the PCI bus. And then it would be nice if they were Intel, but I'll take on the PCI bus.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.840
So what are you going to run on it? Proxmox and then virtualize like Home Assistant that way?

09:29.840 --> 09:36.080
Oh, I should consider Proxmox, huh? Well, you know, I'm still kind of subscribed to the no

09:36.080 --> 09:41.120
container theory for a lot of this stuff. And NixOS would be really good for that. But it does

09:41.120 --> 09:44.880
make a lot of sense to have Proxmox sitting on there. And I shouldn't have any problem passing

09:44.880 --> 09:49.040
quicksync through, right? That should be fine. So what would you need to pass it through for?

09:49.040 --> 09:52.240
Plex. Yeah, I mean, we'll come on to this topic later in the show because it's actually been

09:52.240 --> 09:58.720
coming up quite a lot in Discord lately about LXC versus Docker versus VMs, all that kind of stuff.

09:58.720 --> 10:03.920
We'll come to that later. Please remind me if I forget. But in the meantime, I also saw another

10:03.920 --> 10:09.360
update in the news feed this week that I thought would make you a happy little bunny. Apple with,

10:09.360 --> 10:15.040
I think iOS 16.1 are actually shipping. It's real. It's really happening, people.

10:15.680 --> 10:22.480
They're shipping matter. This is my week, man. This is my week. It's all coming together, buddy.

10:22.480 --> 10:26.480
And the thing is, they're shipping it on the HomePod. They're updating the HomePod to support

10:26.480 --> 10:31.760
matter. And they just announced today as we record a new Apple TV and the fancier version

10:31.760 --> 10:38.000
that has Ethernet also supports thread and matter. So they're, I mean, surprisingly going all in

10:38.000 --> 10:42.560
for Apple, at least. I don't really know if this changes what I'm going to do hardware wise in

10:42.560 --> 10:49.520
terms of sensors and devices yet, but I am curious what it means for accessibility of Apple's remote

10:49.520 --> 10:54.960
control features to Home Assistant. When Home Assistant gets their hands on this, maybe I'll

10:54.960 --> 10:59.040
have remote integrated control even better than I did before without even having to use HomeKit

10:59.040 --> 11:03.520
at all or something. That would be nice, wouldn't it? Yeah. Yeah, maybe not. What's important about

11:03.520 --> 11:09.040
this update coming out now, Apple being the first mover, I think, in actually shipping,

11:09.600 --> 11:13.760
you know, provider level support for this stuff. It's a very strange place for Apple to be.

11:14.400 --> 11:19.120
But anyway, you've already got HomePods. You've already got Apple TVs. So for you, you could just

11:19.120 --> 11:24.320
purchase one or two matter devices and kind of dip your toe in nice and early and get a feeling

11:24.320 --> 11:29.280
for it without having to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on all new sensors and all

11:29.280 --> 11:34.320
new whatever. And you can just do a couple of things and kind of drip feed this stuff in as

11:34.320 --> 11:38.240
support lands in Home Assistant and that kind of stuff. Which is probably the best way to go,

11:38.240 --> 11:44.320
right? Because I guess if history is to be our teacher, it's very possible that the Rev1 devices

11:44.320 --> 11:50.960
could be kind of so-so and this thing takes a couple of revisions and... No. The first iPhone

11:50.960 --> 11:55.280
was perfect. Yeah, right. Right, of course. And the first wireless communications protocols are

11:55.280 --> 12:01.280
always perfect, too. Yeah. I'm seeing the reaction to the H3, the Odroid H3 that we just talked about

12:01.280 --> 12:05.520
in the Discord chat. It's probably a good job you got one because I think half our audience are

12:05.520 --> 12:10.720
about to buy one. I've got to imagine they would be because it seems like the perfect device for

12:10.720 --> 12:15.840
what we do. I mean, low power but performance where it counts, MVME storage instead of an

12:15.840 --> 12:22.000
EMMC or SSD, and of course, having those two SATA ports. I have a request for you. Could you

12:22.000 --> 12:28.400
do some energy monitoring for us and compare what a Pi draws versus this thing? Because my argument

12:28.400 --> 12:33.360
to you for all these years has been, look how much more powerful x86 is for the same power budget.

12:33.360 --> 12:38.000
So I'm curious as to what that in reality is. Is that true or not? Yeah, that's a great thing

12:38.000 --> 12:44.560
to check. I will. I'm also wondering, should I figure out what my power budget is? I've always

12:44.560 --> 12:51.280
just kind of played fast and loose. Three, four Pis down to two Pis. So if I look at that, what

12:51.280 --> 12:56.880
would four Pis have taken versus having everything on just two devices? The yellow, which I expect is

12:56.880 --> 13:02.880
going to be, you know, what a CM4 takes plus a little bit more. And then now this H-Droid or

13:02.880 --> 13:10.000
O-Droid, H3. I'm expecting somewhere around five to six watts idle and then who knows when it's

13:10.000 --> 13:17.680
ramped up. We'll find out. You just got to figure it out, eh? Figure it out. lino.com slash ssh.

13:17.680 --> 13:21.680
That's where you go to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account. And it's a great way to support

13:21.680 --> 13:25.360
the show while you're checking out a service. It's frankly awesome. We run everything we've

13:25.360 --> 13:31.600
built for the last few years on Linode, including our brand new shiny website, jupitabroadcasting.com,

13:31.600 --> 13:36.080
which is kicked off and rebuilt on the regular on Linode. And we are super impressed with the

13:36.080 --> 13:39.920
speed. We've integrated it overall with our infrastructure management tools. And you can

13:39.920 --> 13:44.720
too. Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes. It works with all of that. But maybe you're brand new. Maybe

13:44.720 --> 13:49.280
you've never done any of this stuff. Linode has what they call an app marketplace. It's basically

13:49.280 --> 13:53.360
like one click deployment for a lot of really great open source applications. And they just

13:53.360 --> 13:58.720
recently refreshed their whole approach to Nextcloud. It's got a new feature in the marketplace.

13:58.720 --> 14:02.720
They're working with the project. You hit that deploy button, you get a properly set up Nextcloud

14:02.720 --> 14:08.320
instance on Linode right away. This week, I'm also just playing around with their GPU instances

14:08.320 --> 14:13.360
with a little bit of AI image generation because they got GPU machines. And I'm not going to go

14:13.360 --> 14:19.120
build a crazy huge Nvidia box just to play around with a project, right? But I'll go deploy a Linode

14:19.120 --> 14:23.280
for a couple of days. And you can too. With that $100, you can really kick the tires and try just

14:23.280 --> 14:29.280
about everything out. From their backups, their S3 object storage, to those powerful CPU or GPU

14:29.280 --> 14:34.560
rigs. Or maybe you just want a gaming server, a blog server, or a Nextcloud instance up in the

14:34.560 --> 14:39.280
cloud. Well, you'll have full control with Linode and you'll be super appreciative of their support

14:39.280 --> 14:43.680
if you ever run into any problems. I'll guarantee you that. So go try them out and get $100 while

14:43.680 --> 14:55.760
you support the show. linode.com. That's linode.com. I thought I'd continue my journey down the whole

14:55.760 --> 15:01.440
home audio rabbit hole exploration, spelunking exercise that I've been doing recently.

15:02.160 --> 15:06.000
Lots of people write in, give me lots of excellent recommendations of different things to try.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
Volumio is still on my list of things to try. However, I thought I would try out the big dog

15:12.000 --> 15:19.200
in the room in the Rune. The big dog in the Rune. I see what you did there. Terrible. I tried out

15:19.200 --> 15:26.160
Rune this week for all of you lovely people. I love it. I didn't want to because it's so damn

15:26.160 --> 15:33.760
expensive. Yeah, but Rune bills itself as the audio file player for music fanatics.

15:33.760 --> 15:41.680
So essentially you run a piece of software on a NAS or a computer or a server like I have,

15:42.560 --> 15:48.880
and it goes through and it catalogs all of your FLAC files, all of your audio. So it can be lossy

15:48.880 --> 15:54.080
stuff. It can be lossless, whatever. All right. That sounds great. I've got about a quarter of

15:54.080 --> 15:59.680
a million files I've acquired over the years. A lot of them have ripped actually of CD rips. I did

15:59.680 --> 16:06.080
a decade plus ago. I went before I donated all my CDs to the charity shop. The performance has been

16:06.080 --> 16:13.120
fine. It indexed that quarter of a million files in, I don't know, six hours or so, maybe three,

16:13.120 --> 16:17.200
four, five, six hours, something like that. Is this running on a Windows machine, Linux machine,

16:17.200 --> 16:21.760
Mac? I'm running it in a Docker container on my Linux server, but you can run it on a Windows

16:21.760 --> 16:26.240
machine too. So they do offer it as a Docker container. Yeah. Well, I don't know if they

16:26.240 --> 16:33.040
officially do, but it's certainly possible because it's just a Linux app. The real issue with it

16:33.040 --> 16:42.080
though, is that to run this server, they charge, I can't believe I'm going to say this, they charge

16:42.080 --> 16:50.640
me $10 a month for access to my own files. Yeah. Okay. It's bring your own streaming service,

16:50.640 --> 16:54.800
bring your own music streaming service, essentially. It does have a couple of nice

16:54.800 --> 17:01.520
features like it integrates with Tidal and Cobuz for high res gap filling in your library. So let's

17:01.520 --> 17:05.200
say you're missing an album or a new album came out that you haven't bought yet or something like

17:05.200 --> 17:10.560
that. It will automatically go to Tidal and Cobuz if you have an active subscription with those two

17:10.560 --> 17:15.440
services and pull it in and fill in the gaps for you, which is just really nice. And it tries to

17:15.440 --> 17:20.000
automatically prioritize the highest quality version of a track available. So let's say I had

17:20.000 --> 17:27.280
an MP3 in my local library, but Cobuz has a high res, you know, high res mastered version of it.

17:27.280 --> 17:31.840
It will play the Cobuz version, which I really liked. Yeah. That does seem like the way you'd

17:31.840 --> 17:36.640
want it. And I guess that $10 is going towards the access to the licenses to stream that stuff

17:36.640 --> 17:44.240
automatically. I guess so. But Roon's killer feature, and I say this genuinely out of love,

17:44.240 --> 17:49.200
is the way it presents metadata. So you end up with this kind of like magazine view

17:49.200 --> 17:56.080
of an album. So let's say I'm listening to some Led Zeppelin or something and it shows me Led

17:56.080 --> 18:01.040
Zepp 4. That's the best Led Zepp album in my opinion. And so I go in there and I look at it

18:01.040 --> 18:04.640
and I click on one of the tracks and I can see on the credits, you know, all the different people

18:04.640 --> 18:10.080
associated with a specific album and you know, who produced it, who did the mixing for it. And

18:10.080 --> 18:18.080
if you're a proper audio nerd, you can go down the rabbit hole really deep, really fast, because

18:18.080 --> 18:24.000
each of the names and each of the albums mentioned in the description about this thing is a link.

18:24.720 --> 18:29.600
And that's powered on their server side. You know, for example, Stephen Wilson is one of my

18:29.600 --> 18:34.960
personal musical heroes. He's in a band called Porcupine Trees and a bunch of solo stuff as well.

18:35.920 --> 18:43.280
And he is probably the most famous musician you've never heard of. Like he works with all,

18:43.280 --> 18:47.840
he does mixes film soundtracks and all kinds of stuff. And so when I dig into Stephen Wilson's

18:47.840 --> 18:52.240
Stephen's profile, I get to see everything he's associated with and everything he's worked as an

18:52.240 --> 18:57.040
engineer on and worked as an editor on. And before you know it, you found 10 new bands you didn't

18:57.040 --> 19:01.360
know you liked because it's got some of your favorite influences in. So that's amazing. The

19:01.360 --> 19:08.320
way it presents metadata is genuinely Rune's killer, killer feature. The other thing that

19:08.320 --> 19:12.880
I like about it is the fact it does multi room audio much in the same way as like a Sonos does.

19:12.880 --> 19:18.240
You have a little icon in your playback client, and then you can just check a box and suddenly

19:18.240 --> 19:24.400
you've got two devices playing in sync. That doesn't sound too incredible until I explain

19:24.400 --> 19:31.760
the scenario that really blew my mind. So Rune has this thing called Rune Advanced Audio Transport

19:31.760 --> 19:40.400
RAT that runs on anything that runs a Rune ready or a Rune native client. So certain amplifiers

19:40.400 --> 19:46.640
and amplifiers have been certified by Rune and by Marantz and Denon and all these big guys.

19:47.440 --> 19:54.160
They pay Rune a small fee and they embed the Rune ready receiver software into their

19:54.160 --> 20:03.840
network streamers. You can also run a RAT ready device on a Windows PC, a Mac computer, an iOS

20:03.840 --> 20:11.280
device, a Raspberry Pi. And so you can cast effectively, it's not quite casting, but you

20:11.280 --> 20:17.360
can stream music to any RAT ready device in sync, no matter what iOS it's running. So

20:18.000 --> 20:21.360
just paint this, I've got my iPad out on the deck where I'm grilling some meats.

20:22.640 --> 20:28.080
In the lounge next door, I've got a Raspberry Pi plugged into a HiFi running Linux. In the room

20:28.080 --> 20:34.000
next door, I've got my laptop running Mac OS and all three of those devices are playing audio

20:34.000 --> 20:38.320
perfectly in sync that I'm controlling from my iPhone with a single checkbox.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.160
That is pretty glorious.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.680
That's the dream, isn't it?

20:43.680 --> 20:47.520
Yeah. All the machines, all the speakers, all the OSs.

20:48.480 --> 20:54.160
The catch, and unfortunately I think there's probably some technical limitations here at play,

20:54.160 --> 21:00.560
is that you can only stream like that to devices that are part of the same kind of ecosystem.

21:00.560 --> 21:07.520
So I can only group devices that are RAT devices. I can only group Chromecast devices together. I

21:07.520 --> 21:13.200
can only group AirPlay devices together. I can't stream to an AirPlay and a Chromecast

21:13.200 --> 21:14.480
device at the same time.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.880
Do you have any idea why? That's a pretty interesting limitation.

21:16.880 --> 21:21.600
Well, I mean, AirPlay, the way it buffers the stream is quite different to how Chromecast

21:21.600 --> 21:22.400
buffers the stream.

21:22.400 --> 21:27.600
So it's using their native protocols. It's not using like a client on that. Oh, yeah. Okay.

21:27.600 --> 21:28.320
That makes sense.

21:28.320 --> 21:32.560
Well, that's what the RAT stuff is doing. So the RAT stuff is running a native client on the

21:32.560 --> 21:38.080
specific device, iOS or whatever. And that's why you can't group them together. And I was a little

21:38.080 --> 21:42.480
bit deflated to start with when I found that out because I had this magical vision of all the

21:42.480 --> 21:49.440
Google Home Nest mini hub things I have around the house and all my computers and everything

21:49.440 --> 21:54.240
all working perfectly in sync. And unfortunately, that isn't the case.

21:56.960 --> 22:03.120
What if you bought the Nucleus Plus, which is their $2,600 server that you can buy from them?

22:03.120 --> 22:05.520
How do you know this service is aimed at audio files, huh?

22:06.160 --> 22:10.320
How to tell, right? I mean, it's a cool looking case. I'll give them that.

22:10.320 --> 22:15.760
It's a beautiful ecosystem. Yeah, they've got, so you can run this rune core,

22:15.760 --> 22:20.480
this server software. You can run it in a Docker container like I am. You can run it on a Synology

22:20.480 --> 22:25.840
on a computer. But rune also sell this thing called the Nucleus. And Chris is showing on the

22:25.840 --> 22:29.840
stream now something called the Whirlwind, which is a rack mount version of the same thing.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.040
It's so great. That one's $4,500.

22:33.040 --> 22:38.880
Yeah. And you know, what's funny is if you actually dig into the specs page on these pages,

22:39.680 --> 22:43.120
there is zero information about what CPU is in there.

22:43.120 --> 22:47.040
There is a page where they just say they have on their partners page,

22:47.040 --> 22:51.520
they say they have partnered with Intel. Yeah, that's it. I mean, who's to say whether

22:51.520 --> 23:00.480
it's a Celeron from 2003 or whether it's an i7 12th Gen. I mean, I imagine it's neither,

23:00.480 --> 23:04.800
but we don't know. And that's the point, right? It's a black box, literally.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.000
Yeah. And when you're dropping that kind of cash, I guess, you know, and of course,

23:08.000 --> 23:12.480
the answer is they're selling this to a market who couldn't care less. We realize that.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.520
But it's still it wouldn't kill them to put the specs on there.

23:15.520 --> 23:19.200
If you go by the ports, it looks like it's a knock in there. I have to say.

23:19.200 --> 23:23.840
Yeah, I agree. So, I mean, if we can get over the price of this thing,

23:23.840 --> 23:30.400
because I mentioned the monthly price. I didn't mention they also offer a lifetime pass for $700.

23:31.040 --> 23:36.800
I mean, if you really stuck with it and they stuck around, you know, you got somewhere between

23:36.800 --> 23:44.400
five to 10 years out of this and it had high spousal approval. Maybe. I mean, I could see that.

23:44.400 --> 23:52.960
So Rune as a company was founded, I think, in 2015. And so if you bought into Rune in 2015

23:52.960 --> 23:58.160
and paid $700, you would only just be breaking even on your monthly subscription.

23:59.040 --> 24:04.320
Just put that into perspective. Seven years is a long time for an ROI on that kind of thing.

24:04.320 --> 24:08.080
Yeah. And I wrestled with this pretty hard before I actually tried Rune out. You know,

24:08.080 --> 24:12.560
I wanted to hate it because it was expensive. I wanted to hate it because it was closed source.

24:12.560 --> 24:19.360
But then I thought, well, so is Plex, isn't it? And you like Plex just fine. And so I kind of

24:19.360 --> 24:23.040
came to terms with it and got over myself and thought, yeah, you know, it's fine. You can try

24:23.040 --> 24:32.240
it out and you'll hate it anyway. I don't. I love it. The trouble is just as I've been doing this,

24:32.240 --> 24:39.120
they've made a big release. They've just released the 2.0, the version two, which if you're a Rune

24:39.120 --> 24:47.920
aficionado is a huge deal. But to me as a newbie, it's just unstable, right? So you're familiar

24:47.920 --> 24:53.040
with Plexamp, right? The app that lets you play your Plex music remotely. Love it. Rune have just

24:53.040 --> 25:00.880
released an equivalent app called Rune Arc, A-R-C. And this lets you access all of your Rune music

25:00.880 --> 25:07.600
outside the house. As it stands, the Rune desktop and mobile clients that already existed only worked

25:07.600 --> 25:13.120
if you were on your LAN and directly connected to your Rune core. I couldn't get it to work over

25:13.120 --> 25:20.720
tail scale remotely. So Rune Arc kind of bridges that gap for a lot of people. However, this brings

25:20.720 --> 25:29.440
us to the cons section of my document. I don't really know how else to say this, but Rune with

25:29.440 --> 25:39.280
2.0 have shot their, they're kind of eating their own face. Okay. And the reason I say that is

25:39.280 --> 25:46.640
because firstly, they're charging me $10 a month for access to my own files, plus the metadata,

25:46.640 --> 25:55.200
plus the integrations with Tidal and Kobuz. Okay. However, it gets worse. They guarantee with the 2.0

25:55.200 --> 26:03.360
update zero minutes of offline playback. If the Rune core cannot connect to the internet,

26:04.320 --> 26:11.280
Rune's position is that they guarantee zero minutes of playback. Because they don't want to

26:11.280 --> 26:16.160
have to pay out when somebody's wifi goes down or their router takes a crap, something like that,

26:16.160 --> 26:22.320
you think? Well, according to Johnny Darko, who is the source of this information, he spoke to,

26:22.320 --> 26:26.960
I think his name is Danny over at Rune about this. There's a link in the show notes to this video

26:26.960 --> 26:34.160
because I couldn't quite believe what I was watching. And Johnny Darko is a proper audiophile

26:34.160 --> 26:40.000
and I trust his opinion almost implicitly on an awful lot of audio gear. And I like the way his

26:40.000 --> 26:46.160
videos feel. I like the way he presents information. He's a British guy living in, I think, Berlin.

26:46.160 --> 26:54.400
We've got to stick together, you know? But what's interesting is Johnny is clearly not a techno guy

26:54.400 --> 27:00.000
like us, right? And listening to someone who's operating on the edge of their understanding

27:00.000 --> 27:04.720
about how some of these technologies on the server side of things work, it's really interesting

27:04.720 --> 27:09.040
because it shows you actually that I think Rune are just trying to pull the wool over people's

27:09.040 --> 27:15.440
eyes. And I don't say that lightly. And the reason I do say it is because the Rune projects say

27:15.440 --> 27:21.760
they're doing this always online connectivity thing for the server because they want to move

27:21.760 --> 27:27.120
a lot of the processing to the cloud and to move the product forward and all that kind of stuff.

27:27.120 --> 27:33.120
So a lot of the local processing that currently happens on the Nucleus, on the Rune core, on my

27:33.120 --> 27:38.400
local network is moving into the cloud. And they say that they'll be able to batch stuff up and

27:38.400 --> 27:43.600
make it more efficient and kind of, you know, de-duplicate a lot of, you know, template matching

27:43.600 --> 27:50.640
and all that kind of stuff, which I get, which I understand and does actually make some semblance

27:50.640 --> 27:56.880
of sense. However, we're talking about this through a lens of self-hosting, right? That's

27:56.880 --> 28:02.960
the name of the podcast, right? Just imagine a situation where your internet goes out for half

28:02.960 --> 28:09.200
an hour every day and you suddenly can't play back the files on your NAS under your desk in

28:09.200 --> 28:15.360
your basement. You know, it's just unacceptable on a huge number of levels for me personally.

28:15.360 --> 28:21.840
And I think despite how much I love Rune so far and, you know, the 2.0 release has been a little

28:21.840 --> 28:28.160
buggy and, you know, not perfect, a little rough around the edges, I just can't adopt a product

28:28.160 --> 28:36.720
that costs this much money and compromises on such a fundamental capability like that of an

28:36.720 --> 28:43.680
offline self-hosted type product. It's just, I just can't. Yeah, that's a fair point,

28:43.680 --> 28:47.120
especially when you consider there's people out there that maybe they're on Starlink and they're

28:47.120 --> 28:52.160
having a bad day or they're on LTE and they're having a bad day. Or they live in the third world

28:52.160 --> 28:58.480
and the entire island is connected through a single satellite type people. That surely is

28:58.480 --> 29:03.920
not a big part of Rune's core audience. Starlink customers, I could see the Starlink customers.

29:03.920 --> 29:07.840
Starlink people are out there, you know. You know, the thing is, it's sort of taking away

29:07.840 --> 29:11.920
one of the biggest advantages of you collecting all that stuff locally for so many years and it's

29:11.920 --> 29:17.200
just... At that point, why not just have a Cobuz subscription or a Tidal subscription? What value

29:17.200 --> 29:23.680
is Rune adding if I can't even, let's say, you know, one of my friend's dads was out of power

29:23.680 --> 29:30.480
for like 8 to 10 days with Hurricane Ian a couple of weeks ago, you know? Yikes. It's just no good.

29:30.480 --> 29:34.320
It's no good. You know, for the pricing, especially if you were looking at server hardware,

29:34.320 --> 29:38.080
you could almost just afford to just buy sets of speakers for every single room and just

29:38.080 --> 29:44.480
put a dedicated hardware device on them and just call it good. Yeah. It does sound like it was

29:44.480 --> 29:49.680
really nice for a moment though. The alternative is Sonos, really, that's got this level of fit

29:49.680 --> 29:55.360
and finish and polish and all the rest of it. But Sonos is just hardware and as we talked about

29:55.360 --> 30:01.200
several episodes ago, when Sonos decided that a device is no longer supported, suddenly that

30:01.200 --> 30:07.440
perfectly good speaker cone and that perfectly good amplifier unit become a brick, thanks to

30:07.440 --> 30:14.480
their business model, you know? And that's a thing. It's frustrating. So I think that the next one to

30:14.480 --> 30:18.320
look at is probably Volumio, although I've heard mixed reports about that and I certainly don't

30:18.320 --> 30:22.800
expect the level of fit and finish I've seen from Rune. The other one to keep an eye on is Plexamp

30:22.800 --> 30:27.760
Headless. There's been some pretty good movement over there lately. I think they're working on

30:27.760 --> 30:34.000
multi-room audio stuff, but it won't have the Rune audio transport stuff, so I doubt it will

30:34.000 --> 30:40.080
be quite as polished again, but who knows? Who knows where this will go? But that's my review

30:40.080 --> 30:44.640
of Rune, people. Fascinating. Thank you for updating us on that. We've been getting a good

30:44.640 --> 30:48.800
series of feedback on multi-room audio. It's something people are trying to solve and I know

30:48.800 --> 30:52.880
there's got to be somebody out there that's like, just get a Pi Zero, you know, or something like that,

30:52.880 --> 30:59.680
but who do you really have time? Well, Rune, sorry to come back to Rune again, but I'm running one of

30:59.680 --> 31:06.880
the playback devices is a RU-P, a Raspberry Pi running the Rune server. Right, okay. So I am

31:06.880 --> 31:13.200
using Raspberry Pi as part of this as well. So, you know, maybe one day I'll find the perfect

31:13.200 --> 31:20.240
solution, but I think until Rune guarantee, I don't know, seven days before the server,

31:20.240 --> 31:24.160
the core has to phone home again, it used to be 30 days. The grace period, by the way,

31:24.160 --> 31:29.280
with 1.8, which was the previous release, used to be 30 days and now it's zero minutes.

31:31.040 --> 31:34.320
It's just a hard sell. Yeah, especially when you're paying 10 bucks a month.

31:35.120 --> 31:38.960
Feels like you, you know, when you're paying for something like that that's using your own media,

31:38.960 --> 31:43.440
they should give you grace periods like that. 30 days sounds about right. That's about it.

31:43.440 --> 31:47.440
You know, I'm going to be buying new gear soon. Cloudfree.shop is where I'll go to check it out.

31:47.440 --> 31:51.920
And you can too if you use the promo code SSH. I think you get like a buck off. Light switches

31:51.920 --> 31:56.400
coming soon. Cloudfree light switches. Light switches is definitely the way I want to go.

31:56.400 --> 32:01.520
And after we get to the feedback today, I think I'm going to be doubling down on ZigBee. I'll

32:01.520 --> 32:06.240
tell you more about that later, though. Cloudfree.shop. Promo code self-posted.

32:06.240 --> 32:12.160
Yeah, one of my Shelleys just failed actually in the, in the garage. The actual switch,

32:12.160 --> 32:16.640
the relay part still works. But when I flick the physical switch in the wall,

32:16.640 --> 32:21.680
which in the garage you do all the time, nothing happens. So I've no idea what's happened with that

32:21.680 --> 32:26.560
one. Bummer. It's kind of apparent they're about to take it out. Yeah. Well, I'm looking,

32:26.560 --> 32:30.320
I was thinking about getting one of those zoo switches that we talked about last episode,

32:30.320 --> 32:33.760
but I don't want to go just Seawave just for a few light switches. I'd like to stay

32:33.760 --> 32:39.280
within the ZigBee universe. So if you have a good ZigBee switch recommendation, please let us know

32:39.280 --> 32:42.480
at self-posted.show slash contact. Speaking of feedback,

32:43.120 --> 32:48.320
Docker versus LXC versus a VM. You teased it earlier in the show and it's been a point of

32:48.320 --> 32:53.920
conversation recently. Yeah. Monkey Angst and I were talking on Discord and he wrote in saying,

32:53.920 --> 32:58.880
I'm trying to decide between using an LXC or another containerization technology.

32:58.880 --> 33:05.440
What are you using these days, Alex? And why? Well, the short answer is

33:05.440 --> 33:13.040
Docker and Docker and more Docker plus some virtualization. And I think that's a, oh,

33:13.040 --> 33:16.800
and I suppose in the cloud too, there's a couple of things up there. Most of that stuff's running

33:16.800 --> 33:21.600
in Docker too. And I'm just going to preface everything I'm about to say by saying that it's

33:21.600 --> 33:28.880
a personal choice. And there's more than one way to skin a particular cat in this arena.

33:29.440 --> 33:34.640
The way I do it is I run everything in Docker because Docker Compose is awesome.

33:35.200 --> 33:39.840
It's a great way to manage your personal systems. It's a great way to separate without really having

33:39.840 --> 33:44.720
to do much anything, separate out the application and the data. And just from a system building

33:44.720 --> 33:49.600
standpoint, that is a great design practice and Docker just gives it to you as a general practice.

33:49.600 --> 33:55.600
And the other thing about LXCs to consider is that the benefits of them is that it gives you

33:55.600 --> 33:59.600
an init system. So for those that aren't familiar, an init system is something like system D

34:00.400 --> 34:06.000
with a typical Docker container or some kind of other Linux container. What happens is the main

34:06.000 --> 34:12.880
process inside that container gets given PID one, process ID one. And when that PID dies,

34:13.520 --> 34:17.680
the container dies with it. The same, by the way, is true of your Linux server or your Linux desktop

34:17.680 --> 34:23.440
or whatever you're running Linux on. When PID one dies, the system dies. And typically that PID

34:23.440 --> 34:31.440
one is system D these days. In an LXC, what happens is you get an init system like system D.

34:32.400 --> 34:39.040
My biggest gripe with LXC generally, and there's two really, one is that it's an extra layer of

34:39.040 --> 34:43.840
complexity that not that many people are using. Some people in our self-hosted community are

34:43.840 --> 34:48.240
using it, but generally it's on the fringes compared to the number of people that are using

34:48.240 --> 34:54.240
Docker containers. The second thing is that running more than one process in an isolated

34:54.240 --> 35:00.320
environment like that is a bit of an anti-pattern. And the reason I say that is because containers

35:00.320 --> 35:06.560
are designed to be this black box almost of just a single block with a single purpose.

35:07.280 --> 35:11.440
And if you start trying to run more than one service inside that container, so let's say

35:11.440 --> 35:17.520
system D plus a web server, on the face of it, you're only running one service, right? A web

35:17.520 --> 35:22.080
server, but actually you're running two, you're running an init system plus a web server, which

35:22.080 --> 35:27.280
is a whole bunch of overhead that you A, don't need and B, technically speaking is like I said,

35:27.280 --> 35:32.640
a bit of an anti-pattern. And so the other thing it gives you is some issues, well not issues,

35:32.640 --> 35:38.320
it's not the right word, but added complexity around passing hardware through. So like QuickSync,

35:38.320 --> 35:43.120
for example, which I think is what we talked about earlier in the show. If you're running

35:43.120 --> 35:48.560
QuickSync in a Docker container, it's a couple of lines to pass through the render device.

35:49.440 --> 35:55.280
To QuickSync running in Plex or whatever, it's no big deal. With LXC, there can be some

35:55.280 --> 36:01.440
compatibility issues. It's a similar thing, you've got to pass it through, but I can never remember

36:01.440 --> 36:07.200
if it has a distinct lock on the GPU once you pass it through to an LXC or not. So somebody

36:07.200 --> 36:11.120
in the chat could update in real time, I'd appreciate it. But then the other thing you've

36:11.120 --> 36:17.120
got to consider is if you want to run multiple services in one isolated environment, that's

36:17.120 --> 36:23.120
exactly what a VM has been designed to do. The tooling around VMs is extremely mature at this

36:23.120 --> 36:32.400
point. They're very, very well understood. And I don't know, LXC for me fall into this awkward

36:32.400 --> 36:38.240
middle ground of not quite knowing who they're for. It's not to say they're a bad technology

36:38.240 --> 36:46.160
because I think LXCs do have their place. They just don't in my world personally.

36:47.520 --> 36:52.480
Yeah. Well, and I think they're also a little more popular in the Ubuntu ecosystem as well,

36:52.480 --> 36:57.440
which is probably just not as prevalent in the North America area. So I think there's that

36:57.440 --> 37:02.560
element as well. I like what you're saying about VMs, just to step back a little bit there. Your

37:02.560 --> 37:07.600
point about the VM sometimes the right tooling, people shouldn't feel bad about it, I think is

37:07.600 --> 37:14.880
underscored by the fact that VM performance, it's like it's not your grandpa's VM anymore.

37:14.880 --> 37:20.160
On modern hardware with modern virtualization software, VMs can be extremely performant,

37:20.160 --> 37:24.960
way better than they were when we were emulating the entire hardware stack. Because these days,

37:24.960 --> 37:29.520
not only do we have pair of virtualized devices, but there's also just been a lot of plumbing in

37:29.520 --> 37:35.600
the kernel to get virtual driver requests to the physical hardware so much faster than they were

37:35.600 --> 37:39.600
even four or five years ago. Exactly. I mean, you think about all those cloud servers that are

37:39.600 --> 37:46.400
running virtualized stacks, a lot of that investment trickles down to us mere mortals.

37:46.400 --> 37:51.040
A lot of those improvements end up in the kernel one way or another. So yeah, the other thing we

37:51.040 --> 37:57.200
didn't talk about at all yet is Podman. I know being a Red Hatter, I should probably be a bit

37:57.200 --> 38:04.560
more pro Podman, but for me, the tooling's just still not quite there yet. I rely on Compose all

38:04.560 --> 38:10.720
the time for interacting with all of my services. I know Podman Compose exists and I've tried it

38:10.720 --> 38:13.920
several times, but it's still just- It's not 100%.

38:13.920 --> 38:20.400
It's not quite there. Yeah. It's like 90% or so, but it's not 100%. I have the same opinion.

38:20.400 --> 38:26.000
I feel like Podman is a better design system architecturally. It feels cleaner. It feels

38:26.000 --> 38:29.920
more native as well. But then again, you have like monsters in our chat room that are running

38:29.920 --> 38:34.880
Docker in LXC. Oh my goodness. Well, you can run Docker in Docker in Docker in VN.

38:34.880 --> 38:38.480
Right. These are the people that show up to our live streams.

38:38.480 --> 38:42.000
Yeah, right. Say the tip of the iceberg.

38:43.920 --> 38:47.600
Yeah, there you go. Very interesting. I'd love also to hear other people's opinions on it too.

38:47.600 --> 38:51.600
So do feel free to go to the contact page or send us a boost. There was discussion going on

38:51.600 --> 38:55.440
on Reddit that I wanted to just kind of touch on because I have a lot of thoughts on this,

38:55.440 --> 39:00.880
but I had something I think is actionable. And the question is, and Alex, I liked this question a

39:00.880 --> 39:04.400
lot because it's being honest with themselves. And I think it's something all of us self-hosters

39:04.400 --> 39:08.800
should think about. How do I prepare for a time when I'm just tired of tinkering with

39:08.800 --> 39:12.240
Home Assistant? That's the question that was on Reddit. And I love it because it's like,

39:12.240 --> 39:16.080
this guy writes, I've used Home Assistant for the last six months and I've had a blast

39:16.080 --> 39:20.160
tinkering with the platform. I've got a hundred plus devices. Everything is working as intended.

39:20.160 --> 39:25.200
And I know from experience there come a time when I just don't find home automation as flattering

39:25.200 --> 39:30.720
anymore, but I'll still need my lights and whatnot to function properly. So how do I prepare for this

39:30.720 --> 39:38.160
day? This is really, I need to take this advice in as well. Now I've always remained pretty

39:38.160 --> 39:42.640
fascinated. Home Assistant moves quick. The community moves quick. It hasn't lost my attention,

39:42.640 --> 39:49.120
but things have. And as geeks, I think we're just kind of prone to the new shiny sometimes as well.

39:50.160 --> 39:54.880
Do you have any hot tips on how to prepare your infrastructure for when you are bored with it?

39:54.880 --> 39:56.240
Do you have anything off the top of your mind?

39:56.240 --> 39:59.520
Don't get bored at the time where it's broken.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.520
Yeah.

40:01.520 --> 40:08.000
I don't know. It's such a hard question because I'm aware that the raindrop of inspiration

40:08.000 --> 40:14.640
in the desert of computer, you know, there's several things have to line up in order for me

40:14.640 --> 40:19.840
to be interested enough to tinker with something. I have to have enough free time in my mind and I

40:19.840 --> 40:24.000
always underestimate how long something is going to take. So if I think it's going to take four

40:24.000 --> 40:28.880
hours, I know I've got to estimate I've got to have a whole day free. And if it's quicker than

40:28.880 --> 40:34.320
that, great. I mean, that's often not the case with Home Assistant, but sometimes it is. Probably

40:34.320 --> 40:41.680
the best advice I can give, and it's not terribly wisdomful, but is just try and break down the

40:41.680 --> 40:48.160
things you're trying to accomplish into small tasks, small batches of stuff. Let's say you want

40:48.160 --> 40:52.480
to get a specific room behaving a certain way, or you want to get just a couple of new lights added

40:52.480 --> 40:58.560
or something and try not to leave anything half finished when you go to sleep or something like

40:58.560 --> 41:03.200
that. I know it's not always possible because, you know, I'll wake up tomorrow and my interest

41:03.200 --> 41:09.440
will be in cars tomorrow, not Home Assistant or what, you know, how it is. And for me, leaving

41:09.440 --> 41:14.720
stuff half done when I go to sleep is the enemy because, A, I've loaded it into context, like in

41:14.720 --> 41:19.840
my personal RAM buffer or whatever, and loading it back in again is going to take a long time,

41:19.840 --> 41:24.400
typically. Sometimes going for a walk or whatever, you know, can be the solution.

41:24.960 --> 41:28.560
We've also got to get the motivation program running again, too. So it's not just the context

41:28.560 --> 41:31.600
and the data and the state, but it's also you've got to get motivated again.

41:31.600 --> 41:38.640
Also, the caffeination station has to be fired up, too, you know. So, yeah, you know,

41:38.640 --> 41:42.480
essentially just break things down into atomic blocks, really.

41:42.480 --> 41:48.880
Yeah, and complete it one room at a time and complete it as much as you can. That's a great tip.

41:48.880 --> 41:52.800
Yeah, and I find that helps with motivation, too, because if you actually think,

41:52.800 --> 41:58.320
right, I've done that, and it works as intended, next time, you know, you'll be like,

41:58.320 --> 42:03.120
oh, well, yeah, I actually achieved what I set out to do, and it can be a self-perpetuate,

42:03.120 --> 42:05.280
self-fulfilling cycle of improvement.

42:05.280 --> 42:09.680
I think that's probably how I should probably attack, like, the rebuild of the sensors and

42:09.680 --> 42:13.360
all the switches and stuff and dupes. It's probably just one room at a time, and it'll,

42:13.360 --> 42:14.560
you know, it'll go quick.

42:14.560 --> 42:22.320
Also, you are your own worst enemy. Write this down. Document your crap, because you will forget.

42:22.320 --> 42:26.880
You think you won't, you think you remember it, but trust me, you won't.

42:26.880 --> 42:32.240
You've got to write it down. Absolutely agree. Absolutely agree. I have one bit of wisdom from

42:32.240 --> 42:35.520
my whole, my home assistant's been unavailable, and this is what this guy was worried about.

42:35.520 --> 42:38.320
Like, it would crash, and he just wouldn't have the motivation to fix it.

42:39.280 --> 42:42.720
This is something you can do in Z-Wave, but I read how to do it in ZigBee,

42:42.720 --> 42:47.280
and this seems like the thing to do. It's called device binding.

42:48.080 --> 42:54.160
So, you can bind a light switch to a particular light, for example. You can bind two ZigBee

42:54.160 --> 42:58.880
devices together, so they can control each other without the central coordinator. So,

42:58.880 --> 43:04.400
they, as long as they're both on the network and both devices support binding, you can have them

43:04.400 --> 43:09.360
operate without home assistant even running. And this is incredible, because it means, like,

43:09.360 --> 43:13.920
all of, like, your switches and buttons and those types of things continue to work,

43:13.920 --> 43:18.560
even if your server's crashed. And so, this is definitely something I want to look into for at

43:18.560 --> 43:24.560
least a few core devices. Like, switches to turn lights on and off, those always need to work. And

43:24.560 --> 43:28.560
I don't really have the flexibility to, like, open it up and, like, install a Shelby in the,

43:28.560 --> 43:34.720
or a Shelly in the wall, because my walls are, like, two inches thick. They're thinner than

43:34.720 --> 43:39.280
the Shelly is. So, I have to go with the soft button route, which means when home assistant's

43:39.280 --> 43:45.600
down, no light switches, which is crazy. Just absolutely crazy. And so, something like binding

43:45.600 --> 43:52.000
would keep it working and give you the time to continue to operate your stuff without having to

43:52.000 --> 43:56.640
actually get the server up and running. And they have groups and all kinds of stuff. And I've read

43:56.640 --> 44:00.080
that people also get this working with their Philips Hughes, so you can use binding with the

44:00.080 --> 44:04.800
Hughes lights as well. I'll have a link in the show notes for more information about binding.

44:04.800 --> 44:11.680
A dot technologies that you own the firmware of, you know, Tasmotor is a great example.

44:11.680 --> 44:16.800
Don't rely on a cloud-based service, you know, buy the right hardware, all that kind of stuff. Try,

44:16.800 --> 44:22.400
try and buy with the idea that you want it to just keep working until the hardware physically

44:22.400 --> 44:29.440
stops working would be a great idea. I like the chat room. Serverless IoT. Nice. It is kind of,

44:29.440 --> 44:34.480
isn't it? You're right, Aaron. That's pretty cool. We got some boosts into the show. Check out this.

44:34.480 --> 44:45.280
Yerero? I'm so sorry, dude. 135,000 sats was sent into the show this week. He says it's not a moly.

44:45.280 --> 44:50.320
I know. In fact, I'm going to buy a boat that put us on the hot list. So in Fountain, you know,

44:50.320 --> 44:54.480
highly boosted shows, I believe it was this boost put, put self-hosted on the hot list and

44:54.480 --> 44:59.520
then new people find the show. So when you send a big boost in, it's where we, the show trends

44:59.520 --> 45:07.200
and the people discover us. It's really great. So Yerero writes, it's not a million dollars,

45:07.200 --> 45:12.320
but these are all the sats I have. I am currently thinking of automating the lighting around my flat

45:12.320 --> 45:18.640
and unable to pick between smart lights or smart switches. What are the pros and cons of each one?

45:18.640 --> 45:25.040
Thanks, Alex, Chris and Brent. Fairly easy answer, actually. Switches mean that your bulbs stay

45:25.040 --> 45:31.280
powered all the time and you can, so you can control the switch, you retain physical control

45:31.280 --> 45:39.200
of the switch and you also gain the ability to control that switch remotely as well. Whereas if

45:39.200 --> 45:44.800
you just go for a smart bulb and someone turns the light switch off, uh-oh, you're out of luck.

45:44.800 --> 45:50.240
Yeah. And it's also just way more approachable by every other single human on the face of the planet.

45:50.240 --> 45:52.880
And so if you have anybody else that's going to be in the space with you,

45:52.880 --> 45:58.320
what I literally have on my switches here in the studio, I have tape over them that says

45:58.320 --> 46:03.760
no touch because like people just flip light switches all the time. And it still happens when

46:03.760 --> 46:09.040
we have a meetup here at the studio, inevitably like a listener will just walk out of the studio

46:09.040 --> 46:12.640
and they'll just instinctively flip the light switch off, you know, they'll even flip it right

46:12.640 --> 46:19.840
through the tape. Read the FM, huh? What? What is it? Hearty FM. Oh, even if it's just a bit

46:19.840 --> 46:23.920
of tape on the light switch, you know, you've got a hearty FM. Yeah, that's true. Read the tape.

46:24.480 --> 46:29.280
Prozac boosted with 1200 sats. Just thanking Alex for sharing your secret sauce. And so I thought,

46:29.280 --> 46:33.200
just in case people missed it last episode, we should probably put the Badgerstack link

46:33.920 --> 46:40.720
in the show notes for an overview of Alex's setup. People have been liking that. PA or PageDot

46:40.720 --> 46:51.600
boosted in with 3333 sats. Hi, please take a look at the FunkWhale project. It's a federated music

46:51.600 --> 46:58.080
service with a great GUI, active development, a subsonic API, mobile app, and financial support.

46:58.080 --> 47:02.320
I use it without the federation for my personal library, but I really like it because they really

47:02.320 --> 47:07.440
managed to keep me up to date and involve the community in their decisions I just wanted to

47:07.440 --> 47:13.120
make. So I went and looked at it, super quick, and I'm going to put this on my checkout. This

47:13.120 --> 47:17.840
and Jellyfin, which I realize are not quite the same, but Jellyfin's, the jelly amp app that

47:17.840 --> 47:22.880
people are working on, and this FunkWhale, I think could be great solutions for my music use, because

47:22.880 --> 47:28.240
I'm not so much looking for a whole home sync so much as I am just looking for something that could

47:28.240 --> 47:33.040
expose a local music collection to me in a way that I could consume when I want to listen, mostly

47:33.040 --> 47:39.120
in the car or on home pods. FunkWhale's really nice. Funkwhale.audio. Are you familiar with it,

47:39.120 --> 47:44.640
Alex? I tried it out once a few months ago, and then just for some reason it didn't stick. I can't

47:44.640 --> 47:49.600
remember why. If I might interrupt the boosts for a second, we're having a live question in the chat

47:49.600 --> 47:55.040
room. What is the boost address? We've got jupyterbroadcasting.com slash boost, but then what?

47:56.400 --> 48:02.800
So you need a new podcast app because it's an RSS feed-based thing. So the boost address is in

48:02.800 --> 48:09.360
the RSS feed. So you get a new podcast app, and that reads that RSS tag, and then automatically

48:09.360 --> 48:13.360
adds a button to your playback screen. There's also a browser extension, which I was actually

48:13.360 --> 48:19.200
going to suggest to you after the show, Alex, called ALBY. And that lets you do it in a browser

48:19.200 --> 48:22.800
based environment. And the reason I was going to mention it to you is they've launched a new

48:22.800 --> 48:29.840
platform called Saturn. And I think it's like, I don't know for sure, actually. I have to look

48:29.840 --> 48:34.240
at it, but I think it's kind of like having your own node, and then you could get a copy of the

48:34.240 --> 48:39.600
messages and a split of the SATs with Saturn, I think. And then I don't think you have to set up

48:39.600 --> 48:46.400
a whole node, but ALBY is an open source project for a Lightning wallet in the browser. I don't

48:46.400 --> 48:50.720
generally like it because I don't like stuff built into the browser, but I had a chance to talk to

48:50.720 --> 48:56.000
the co-founder and ask him my questions about security and open source practices, and I actually

48:56.000 --> 49:02.320
walked away with a pretty good opinion of where they're at. So ALBY for that. Then you could boost

49:02.320 --> 49:07.040
from the website using our new player on the website. Otherwise, it requires a new podcast

49:07.040 --> 49:14.800
app at newpodcastapps.com. And then one day, soon, one day, Alex, I have a dream. Jupiter

49:14.800 --> 49:20.080
Broadcasting will be generating all of our own RSS feeds independently. We use a service provider

49:20.080 --> 49:24.240
called Fireside right now. It's very common practice to have a service generate your RSS

49:24.240 --> 49:27.920
feeds or like a WordPress plugin or something because you never want them to screw up.

49:28.560 --> 49:32.720
So like people have just like specialized in that because it's like your radio signal.

49:32.720 --> 49:37.120
But right now we don't generate our own RSS feed, but we want to. And then we'll start taking

49:37.120 --> 49:43.040
advantage of even more podcasting 2.0 features like transcripts and host information in there,

49:43.040 --> 49:46.720
like, you know, guest, more guest information, richer context around that kind of stuff.

49:46.720 --> 49:50.560
And a big one that I'm really looking forward to, I don't know what we'll use it for exactly yet,

49:50.560 --> 49:56.720
alternative enclosures. So like maybe like an MP4 file or an Opus file if people want an Opus

49:56.720 --> 50:02.640
version or I don't know. But it's so your podcast player will just it'll see the entry and then in

50:02.640 --> 50:06.400
the player, you'll just choose like which format you want because we can just specify multiple

50:06.400 --> 50:12.400
formats in one RSS feed entry with podcasting 2.0 in the past. And you've probably seen JB has like

50:13.120 --> 50:18.560
so many different RSS feeds because any variation of file type, you had to do a whole new RSS feed

50:18.560 --> 50:23.600
because that's just how these players worked back then. So it's a whole new generation over there.

50:23.600 --> 50:27.440
Very excited about it. I think it's going to be big for podcasting. And I think it's the way to

50:27.440 --> 50:32.880
keep podcasting decentralized and self-hosted because the other big trend in the podcasting

50:32.880 --> 50:37.520
industry is consolidation with Spotify and players like that. And then they do dynamic

50:37.520 --> 50:42.240
ad insertion. They do the hosting. They manage your RSS feed and the podcaster doesn't have

50:42.240 --> 50:46.640
any control over it. And I think decentralization is key to keeping podcasting healthy.

50:46.640 --> 50:52.800
And I think self-hosting plays a big role in that. Fundek Hermit boosted in with 2,346 sets.

50:52.800 --> 50:59.040
Hey guys, I wanted to mention an amazing newish feature of R-Clone. You can now use a Docker

50:59.040 --> 51:04.640
plugin to mount the local or cloud storage directly as a Docker volume. That's great for

51:04.640 --> 51:10.720
host isolation and separation. That is great. R-Clone for the win.

51:10.720 --> 51:16.800
Yeah. So I guess you could use, you know, like Google drive as a Docker volume. I wonder what

51:16.800 --> 51:21.280
the latency is like, but that sounds amazing. I mean, if you're just writing like an encrypted

51:21.280 --> 51:27.040
tar file or something. Yeah. For something like my smoke ping, you know, history or something

51:27.040 --> 51:32.400
like that, that might be nice that I would like to keep around, but I don't really care

51:33.200 --> 51:37.680
that much about it. Maybe I'll investigate. That sounds pretty cool. Thanks Fundek Hermit.

51:37.680 --> 51:41.760
Last couple of boosts for this week, although we did read all of them. We only feature some

51:41.760 --> 51:47.040
of them in the show. Soltros boosted with 9,000 sets. I recently got into Docker after refusing

51:47.040 --> 51:53.200
to let go of my VM obsession. Welcome. Are there any tips out there for use case scenarios or cool

51:53.200 --> 51:58.400
project I can run at my home on my Ubuntu home server? Right now I have Nextcloud, Plex, and a

51:58.400 --> 52:05.760
few other odds and ends. Well, over at PerfectMediaServer.com, I have a list of my top 10

52:05.760 --> 52:12.400
recommended apps to run on your new media server. So I'll put a link to that in the show notes. And

52:12.400 --> 52:16.320
if you have any other recommendations, let us know at selfhosted.show slash contact.

52:16.320 --> 52:20.480
Look at that. And you know, just keep listening to the show because as you listen, you'll hear us

52:20.480 --> 52:25.440
mention our favorite apps over and over again. Like Alex just namedrop smoke ping. That's a great

52:25.440 --> 52:30.800
one. It's a classic. Yeah, it's funny. I got smoke ping from Linux action show back in the day way

52:30.800 --> 52:36.080
before you knew me. And then I wrapped it up as a Docker container on Linux server.io. And then

52:36.080 --> 52:40.320
now it's a thing. I know. And then I grabbed it one day. I'm like, hey, it pings Jupiter broadcasting.

52:40.320 --> 52:45.840
That's awesome. Yeah, that's why that's why I put you in there, bro. And it really is a great

52:45.840 --> 52:50.080
example of like an app that probably should be in a container because it's kind of super old and

52:50.080 --> 52:55.200
legacy in a lot of ways. And you don't want it on your whole system. Our last boost of the episode

52:55.200 --> 53:00.880
came in from bronzewing, who boosted nine thousand and one sets over nine thousand. There's another

53:00.880 --> 53:08.800
option called Mood M O O D E moody, perhaps that runs on a pie and says it can do multi room audio.

53:09.360 --> 53:14.560
And we have a link in there to mood audio dot org. It's free and you can get a hi fi Barry

53:14.560 --> 53:18.960
amp and put speakers on that in each room controlled by a Web interface. And that interface

53:18.960 --> 53:24.080
is mobile friendly. I hear it's actually better than Volumio. It could be the complete solution.

53:24.080 --> 53:29.360
Worth checking out. Does look nice. Yeah, I think when my rune free trial expires, which I think

53:29.360 --> 53:34.320
I've got another week left on, I think I'll probably have to give Volumio a spin next and then

53:34.320 --> 53:40.400
move on to this mood thing after that. But I'll be honest with you people. I'm getting a little

53:40.400 --> 53:45.200
fatigued with the music situation and I'll probably just go back to Spotify for a few months

53:45.200 --> 53:50.320
whilst I just calm down again. I'm just going to ship you like six home pods and you'll be good.

53:50.320 --> 53:54.080
Yeah, I know it's not what you want. I know. I know. I also want to say thank you to John A.

53:54.080 --> 53:58.720
who sent 2000 sats. He's going to be switching to Podverse. That is one of those new podcast apps

53:58.720 --> 54:04.480
that is totally GPL, Web, Android, iOS. And it's an F-droid. And I really appreciated that when I

54:04.480 --> 54:11.040
switched to graphene. And then Schmitzfeld, who Brent appropriately pronounces. I mentioned that

54:11.040 --> 54:16.240
it was recently his first boost ever that he sent into the show. And he also is a big fan of

54:16.240 --> 54:21.040
replacing the Raspberry Pi with a small, low power PC. He's had great results, he says. So

54:21.040 --> 54:27.520
I will let you guys know how the O-Droid H3 Plus works out. I'm super excited about that. And then

54:27.520 --> 54:34.480
that old Powerwall or Solar Wall device. I have a couple of ideas and I think I have a couple

54:35.120 --> 54:39.360
outside the box places where I could mount that because it is so rugged too. All projects for

54:39.360 --> 54:43.760
future episodes. That H3 is the type of device that I'm trying to think of a project for.

54:43.760 --> 54:48.320
But I don't already have a solution for. Like, I want to buy one. I just don't know why,

54:48.320 --> 54:52.240
what I'd use it for. I want one though. I mean, maybe you'll get lucky and your server will die.

54:54.960 --> 55:00.400
Oh, we can hope. Hopefully not, dude. Hopefully not. Thank you to our SRE subscribers. Those are

55:00.400 --> 55:04.400
our site reliability engineers. You guys make the show possible by investing in our ongoing

55:04.400 --> 55:09.360
content production. And as a thank you, we make an ad free version of the show and every episode

55:09.360 --> 55:14.240
gets a little extra content for the members, a post show. You can become a member at self hosted

55:14.240 --> 55:20.080
dot show slash SRE or support all the shows get ad free for everything at Jupiter dot party.

55:20.080 --> 55:24.720
And as you know, self hosted dot show slash contact is the place to go to get in touch with

55:24.720 --> 55:30.480
us. You can find me over on Twitter at ironic badger. Oh, do we want to tease all things open

55:30.480 --> 55:34.880
at all? Any updates there? Oh, yeah, we could do coming up around Halloween all things open in

55:34.880 --> 55:39.680
Raleigh. If you're going to be in town, keep an eye on the meetup page. I don't know if we do the

55:39.680 --> 55:43.520
official Jupiter broadcasting meetup or just the Raleigh room, probably just the Raleigh room on

55:43.520 --> 55:50.400
matrix could do either way. Myself and cheese bacon longtime friend of the network will be there.

55:50.400 --> 55:57.040
He's supporting a booth for system 76 at the conference. So I'll be at the conference too. And

55:57.040 --> 56:01.200
we might go out for a drinky poo in the evening after one of the talks. We'll see.

56:01.200 --> 56:05.280
Now I want to go. I really wanted to go to all things open. It's too much traveling, but I really

56:05.280 --> 56:11.920
want to go next year. Remember Halloween, Raleigh and you'll I think so. I think so. Also, I'll

56:11.920 --> 56:16.320
mention we have our discord server. You can find that on our self hosted website. And we also have

56:16.320 --> 56:21.440
a couple of self hosted matrix chat rooms. That's a Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash matrix. And

56:21.440 --> 56:27.600
then the podcast itself at self hosted show on Twitter. I do really mean it. I don't know if

56:27.600 --> 56:31.440
I say this every single week about thanks for listening, everybody. But genuinely, if you made

56:31.440 --> 57:01.040
it this far in the show, thank you very much for listening. This is self hosted dot show slash 82.
