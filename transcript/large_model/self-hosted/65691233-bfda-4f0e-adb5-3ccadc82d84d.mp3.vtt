WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
Well, I know this isn't the Apple Today podcast,

00:03.360 --> 00:05.160
but we've got to acknowledge that there

00:05.160 --> 00:08.040
was an event this week which has put a big hole in my wallet.

00:08.040 --> 00:10.120
Oh, did it?

00:10.120 --> 00:12.560
Yeah, this is one of those tech events

00:12.560 --> 00:15.160
that sucked all the air out of the tech room

00:15.160 --> 00:16.840
for the entire week that we're recording.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.120
There's just no way around it.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.000
So you get a big boy.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.680
You get one of them Macs Macs.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.360
I actually felt really sorry for Google,

00:22.360 --> 00:25.720
just to digress for a second, because they held their Pixel

00:25.720 --> 00:28.840
event the day after Apple announced all these MacBooks.

00:28.840 --> 00:29.340
Yeah.

00:29.340 --> 00:32.080
And you could just tell all the tech press were like, yeah,

00:32.080 --> 00:34.360
we've already heard all about this Pixel thing.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.480
MacBook, MacBook, MacBook.

00:35.480 --> 00:36.880
Let's just cover the MacBook.

00:36.880 --> 00:39.120
I know, and Google announced their Tensor SOC,

00:39.120 --> 00:41.040
and it really didn't get much interest in it.

00:41.040 --> 00:41.760
Not at all.

00:41.760 --> 00:44.400
You know, like I told you after the event,

00:44.400 --> 00:47.240
one of my first thoughts was like, man, you know, Alex,

00:47.240 --> 00:49.240
what I'm kind of excited about is the idea of one

00:49.240 --> 00:50.240
of these is a home server.

00:50.240 --> 00:51.860
I've been thinking of this more and more.

00:51.860 --> 00:53.520
You know, when a Mac mini is just sitting there

00:53.520 --> 00:56.600
not doing much, the processor's taking hardly any power.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.200
12 watts is like an average load.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.040
That's incredible.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.680
And you could really see, if they're

01:02.680 --> 01:06.320
building an H.264 accelerated encoding and decoding

01:06.320 --> 01:09.240
in these chips, and these things are low power,

01:09.240 --> 01:11.480
and they have Thunderbolt expansion,

01:11.480 --> 01:13.800
and who knows if they'll make desktop models,

01:13.800 --> 01:16.280
I could see these being a pretty legitimate home server,

01:16.280 --> 01:17.560
replacing Pis.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.840
Yeah, I was thinking that the biggest problem with it

01:19.840 --> 01:22.000
would be connecting disks up to the damn thing.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.840
But if you have Thunderbolt, I suppose

01:23.840 --> 01:25.840
you could be baller and spend thousands of dollars

01:25.840 --> 01:28.840
on a Thunderbolt shelf and connect disks that way,

01:28.840 --> 01:29.400
if you like.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.400
You know, I'd much prefer real expansion, right?

01:32.400 --> 01:37.160
But for my situation, I'm doing USB storage.

01:37.160 --> 01:40.840
I never thought I would do USB storage in a million years.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.700
But here I am with the Raspberry Pi 4,

01:43.700 --> 01:45.640
and I have pooled USB storage.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.160
So external Thunderbolt would actually

01:48.160 --> 01:49.920
be an upgrade for me.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.520
I see you like to live dangerously.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.360
I do.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.960
You know, that's why I like to stay trained, just in case

01:54.960 --> 01:56.620
I ever need a plan B. And you can, too,

01:56.620 --> 01:58.320
if you go to cloudguru.com.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.640
Yes, this episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru,

02:00.640 --> 02:03.360

02:03.360 --> 02:05.880
and other modern tech skills, hundreds of courses,

02:05.880 --> 02:07.520
and thousands of hands-on labs.

02:07.520 --> 02:12.160
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.680
Couple of months ago, I sold my 16-inch MacBook Pro.

02:15.680 --> 02:20.680
I had an i9 model with a 5600M Radeon GPU in it.

02:20.680 --> 02:24.580
It was, you know, like a $4,000, $4,500 laptop.

02:24.580 --> 02:27.160
Kind of crazy, actually, when you think about it.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.980
And I sold it to somebody two months ago,

02:29.980 --> 02:32.480
because we've known this event's been coming for a while.

02:32.480 --> 02:36.200
And I thought, right, can I live with just an M1 MacBook Air

02:36.200 --> 02:39.400
as my primary system for two or three months

02:39.400 --> 02:40.900
until these new MacBooks come out?

02:40.900 --> 02:43.240
And you also have a desktop system as well.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.980
So it's not like your only computer.

02:44.980 --> 02:48.240
True, but I do 99% of my work now

02:48.240 --> 02:50.240
on this MacBook Air, the fanless MacBook Air.

02:50.240 --> 02:50.740
Do you?

02:50.740 --> 02:51.240
Do you?

02:51.240 --> 02:54.640
It is a phenomenal system, truly.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.520
And I'm very excited.

02:56.520 --> 03:00.600
I've ordered one of the M1 Mac's 14-inch MacBook Pros.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.520
Oh, yeah, the 14-inch seems like a pretty sweet rig,

03:03.520 --> 03:06.200
a lot of horsepower for a pretty small footprint.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.960
64 gigs of RAM in that bad boy.

03:07.960 --> 03:11.000
I have no idea why I need 64 gigs of RAM.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.120
But hey, you know, in for a penny, in for a pound.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.560
That's a tough one, huh?

03:16.560 --> 03:18.720
Because it's like you can't change it after the fact.

03:18.720 --> 03:23.000
So if you think maybe you're going to use a lot of RAM,

03:23.000 --> 03:24.680
you might as well go all the way in.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.280
And I don't really know how this works,

03:26.280 --> 03:27.820
but I think that also means then you've

03:27.820 --> 03:29.880
got 64 gigs of video RAM addressable or something

03:29.880 --> 03:32.120
like that, because I know it's a unified memory space.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.800
Something like that, yeah.

03:33.800 --> 03:39.640
Yeah, 32-core GPU and the M1 Mac's 10-core, whatever it is.

03:39.640 --> 03:40.600
I'm not entirely sure.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.400
Honestly, I watched the event, and I

03:43.400 --> 03:46.240
pressed Go on my purchase after the store went live

03:46.240 --> 03:48.920
within about three or four minutes, honestly.

03:48.920 --> 03:52.020
I really didn't spend very long, because it's 2021,

03:52.020 --> 03:53.480
and everything is in short supply.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.400
And I knew if I waited even an hour,

03:56.400 --> 03:58.200
it was going to take weeks extra.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.280
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

03:59.280 --> 03:59.800
I know it.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.960
And I'll tell you, I would have been there with that instant

04:02.960 --> 04:05.440
buy if they had announced everything that's

04:05.440 --> 04:09.960
in that 14-inch Macbook in a mini, a little headless Mac

04:09.960 --> 04:12.200
mini, that would have been the way for me.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.960
Like I said, that would just be such an incredible server.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.920
But also, with that kind of horsepower,

04:16.920 --> 04:18.720
you could also have it be your desktop.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.240
That's, for me, a consolidation.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.440
That'd be nice.

04:21.440 --> 04:26.360
The only thing missing from this new set of laptops for me

04:26.360 --> 04:28.600
was a single USB-A port.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.160
I think it was possibly asking a bit too much for them

04:31.160 --> 04:32.200
to put that one back in.

04:32.200 --> 04:36.760
But I was hoping, because being back in England last month,

04:36.760 --> 04:40.600
I was doing a lot of stuff with old tech.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.960
I was taking files off my mom's old Windows XP laptops.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.840
I needed USB-A, so I had to have a dongle for that.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.000
So I'm still going to have to keep that one around.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.920
But thank the Lord, there's an SD card slot.

04:52.920 --> 04:53.840
Yes, there is.

04:53.840 --> 04:54.520
Yes, there is.

04:54.520 --> 04:55.320
Hallelujah.

04:55.320 --> 04:55.920
Yes.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.640
And you know, people say, why do you need SD?

04:57.640 --> 04:58.560
It's like, come on, man.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.160
Even if you don't have a camera that uses it,

05:00.160 --> 05:03.160
you could use it for external storage, portable storage.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.080
It's great for backup.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.480
Yeah, yeah.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.680
Yeah, I think they set the bar.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.120
I really think they set the bar with this one.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.560
And I'm really kind of looking forward

05:11.560 --> 05:16.000
to see where the Asahi Linux team gets with support for Linux,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.380
because I could see running these things with macOS

05:19.380 --> 05:21.460
and then trying to do Docker on top of all of that.

05:21.460 --> 05:24.240
But it seems like a lot of pain in the knee

05:24.240 --> 05:26.360
when you could just run Linux directly on there.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.080
And I think they're making good progress.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.400
We'll see where that goes.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.640
I have an M1 Mac Mini now.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.160
I haven't gotten through setting it up yet.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.840
But my intention is to try Asahi on it and see how it goes.

05:38.840 --> 05:42.920
And of course, I ordered the Mac Mini.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.280
I thought, all right, fine.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.840
I know Asahi Linux will support this,

05:45.840 --> 05:47.680
because that's what the developers are using.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.800
Even though I know Apple's about, even though I knew,

05:50.800 --> 05:54.040
I knew Apple was about to announce new machines.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.080
I ordered the Mini M1.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.080
Even risking there might have been an updated Mini,

05:58.080 --> 06:00.240
because I knew that would have the best compatibility.

06:00.240 --> 06:04.160
But I have to say, the next day, Apple announced the event.

06:04.160 --> 06:04.920
And it still hurt.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.640
It still felt like I should have waited.

06:07.640 --> 06:08.800
But it's good.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.480
It's here now.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.320
I've already got it.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.600
But they didn't announce anything in the Mac Mini

06:12.600 --> 06:13.200
form factor.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.320
So in a way, you were vindicated.

06:15.320 --> 06:15.840
That's true.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.000
I suppose so.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.200
I suppose so.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.680
I've been trying to, I've just been

06:19.680 --> 06:22.060
trying to think of my setup and how I'm going to redo it.

06:22.060 --> 06:25.560
Because now that I am doing so much more on my Raspberry Pi

06:25.560 --> 06:28.340
in Home Assistant, I'm running MQTT now.

06:28.340 --> 06:30.520
And I've got a lot more automations going.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.920
And I'm now doing power statistical tracking

06:33.920 --> 06:35.360
for a lot of different devices.

06:35.360 --> 06:39.320
And it has noticeably slowed down.

06:39.320 --> 06:42.920
The speed difference now between my Home Assistant Blue,

06:42.920 --> 06:45.400
which is doing a lot less, and the Raspberry Pi

06:45.400 --> 06:49.440
4 in the RV is extremely noticeable.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.120
It's night and day.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.160
We're talking like 10 minutes, 15 minutes

06:53.160 --> 06:55.360
to do a snapshot on the Raspberry Pi,

06:55.360 --> 07:01.040
and two minutes to do a snapshot on the Home Assistant Blue.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.040
So you were thinking about doing some stuff

07:03.040 --> 07:05.080
with your router at the studio.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.480
Have you gotten any further with that yet?

07:08.480 --> 07:10.280
Not necessarily.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.840
We hit a wall, a hardware wall.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.760
But one thing we're thinking about trying in the meantime

07:15.760 --> 07:17.680
until we get the right hardware, because we

07:17.680 --> 07:19.440
found this nice little x86 box that we

07:19.440 --> 07:20.920
thought would work really well.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.440
But we just can't, we cannot get it.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.920
Nobody has it available right now.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.280
So we are thinking about just in the interim trying a Raspberry

07:28.280 --> 07:30.160
Pi just as a temporary solution.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.040
I saw an interesting post on this,

07:32.040 --> 07:35.080
which I'll try and find and put in the show notes,

07:35.080 --> 07:39.040
where people were using VLANs to actually use a Raspberry

07:39.040 --> 07:43.240
Pi 4 and its single ethernet port as both a WAN

07:43.240 --> 07:44.200
and a LAN port.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.080
So I thought that might be an interesting experiment for you

07:47.080 --> 07:48.840
to try.

07:48.840 --> 07:52.000
My thought was just put the WAN on a USB ethernet,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.520
because USB 3.0 is pretty good, and it's just Comcast.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.760
So I could put that on a USB ethernet,

07:57.760 --> 07:59.720
and then the LAN side would be connected

07:59.720 --> 08:00.920
to the actual ethernet port.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.600
Well, if you try out OpenSense, which

08:02.600 --> 08:05.560
is my current favorite firewall of choice

08:05.560 --> 08:10.040
for the self-builders, I've come across a really cool repo.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.920
I think I've mentioned it briefly on the show,

08:11.920 --> 08:13.920
but I'm going to go into a bit more detail today.

08:13.920 --> 08:17.120
This is from a guy on Twitter who goes by the handle

08:17.120 --> 08:20.120
MIMU underscore MUC.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.960
That rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

08:21.960 --> 08:24.760
There's a link to his Twitter in the show notes.

08:24.760 --> 08:28.200
But essentially what this does, this repo,

08:28.200 --> 08:32.600
is it provides a whole bunch of plugins for OpenSense that

08:32.600 --> 08:34.160
aren't officially supported.

08:34.160 --> 08:39.080
So there's stuff in there like traffic, speed test, caddy,

08:39.080 --> 08:40.360
unify controller.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.400
But for me, the killer app is that I can now

08:42.400 --> 08:47.040
run AdGuard Home directly on my OpenSense instance as well.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.680
So I've completely disabled the unbound DNS

08:49.680 --> 08:53.080
that's built into OpenSense and just replaced it completely

08:53.080 --> 08:54.880
with AdGuard Home.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.760
And for me, that's been really solid.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.180
And when I'm coming in over WireGuard,

09:00.180 --> 09:03.520
I can now get AdGuard Home straight away on the same box

09:03.520 --> 09:05.120
as WireGuard.

09:05.120 --> 09:08.160
It's just really nice.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.520
Yeah, I have to say that that is a very compelling setup.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.640
And this kind of reminds me a little bit

09:13.640 --> 09:15.120
of Hacks for Home Assistant, where

09:15.120 --> 09:17.840
it's a community-created set of repositories

09:17.840 --> 09:18.800
that you can add on.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.400
It's a very similar deal, yeah.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.600
And it's nice to see this.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.960
The essentials are in there.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.560
I also noticed that, of course, you've

09:24.560 --> 09:27.960
got speed testers in there, Makesense, Grafana, Influx.

09:27.960 --> 09:32.240
That's all really nice to have as an easy-to-install add-on.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.160
That's great.

09:33.160 --> 09:38.600
If you wanted to, you could even run Mosquito MQTT.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.120
It's split into two halves, right?

09:40.120 --> 09:41.580
There's a bunch of plug-ins, which

09:41.580 --> 09:43.320
have a bit more about them.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.180
So they require graphical configuration

09:45.180 --> 09:46.320
and that kind of thing.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.400
There's also a list of packages, which if you install those,

09:49.400 --> 09:52.160
you'll need to drop to the terminal to configure those.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.560
And there's a few that stand out for me in here.

09:54.560 --> 09:58.280
Cloudflare D, which is pretty useful.

09:58.280 --> 10:01.080
Influx is in there, Mosquito, Smokeping.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.680
You can actually run that directly on your firewall.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.800
Tailscale, which you know I love these days.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.400
So yeah, I've found this repository

10:09.400 --> 10:12.420
to be an incredibly valuable asset to make OpenSense.

10:12.420 --> 10:14.120
It just takes it to that next level for me.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.160
And really makes it that all-in-one box.

10:16.160 --> 10:16.720
Absolutely.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.080
I mean, you could argue it's now a single point of failure

10:19.080 --> 10:21.160
for a bit more stuff.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.920
But it was doing DNS and Intel anyway.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.640
So if that went out when I was in England,

10:24.640 --> 10:26.320
I was out of luck anyway.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.920
So am I bothered?

10:28.920 --> 10:31.480
You're not a 1,000-person enterprise.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.440
Yes, there is more risk to having it on one box.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.880
But when you're in a home, there's

10:34.880 --> 10:39.680
also advantages to simplifying and reducing power usage.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.200
Absolutely.

10:40.200 --> 10:44.040
Now, talking of monitoring and keeping things available

10:44.040 --> 10:46.200
and stuff like that, we've set up a new status

10:46.200 --> 10:49.760
page for the network using one of my new favorite tools

10:49.760 --> 10:52.360
in the world called Uptime Kuma.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.940
And isn't this nice and clean?

10:54.940 --> 10:56.680
And we're putting it all out there.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.900
If there's an outage, you're going to know about it.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.960
That is Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.960
I mean, I used to use Statping for a little while.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.040
But then there was a new version came along,

11:05.040 --> 11:06.320
and it broke a bunch of stuff.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.520
And then the developer kind of got bored and just quit,

11:09.520 --> 11:11.280
I think, is what happened.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.360
I mean, if you go to the Statping repository now,

11:13.360 --> 11:15.880
the last update was about 10 months ago.

11:15.880 --> 11:20.440
I did see on Reddit this week that there's a statping-ng fork

11:20.440 --> 11:21.420
appeared, a statping.

11:21.420 --> 11:23.640
So we'll have to keep our eye on that one.

11:23.640 --> 11:27.760
But Uptime Kuma is designed after Uptime Robot,

11:27.760 --> 11:29.400
if you're familiar with that one.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.640
There's a live demo on their GitHub page, which

11:31.640 --> 11:33.440
is linked in the show notes.

11:33.440 --> 11:37.120
And this thing is just simple.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.760
It monitors an endpoint.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.680
So it could be an API, or in our case,

11:41.680 --> 11:44.040
it could be an RSS feed for all the shows

11:44.040 --> 11:46.080
that we have as a network.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.000
And then I've got a group with me, Chris, and Wes in it

11:49.000 --> 11:52.760
that we all get a notification if these pings fail

11:52.760 --> 11:54.760
for more than three minutes.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.280
So it supports Telegram, Discord, Go to Fight.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.480
There's a bunch of stuff it supports out of the box.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.840
And I've just run it in a container

12:03.840 --> 12:06.600
on a separate Linode instance.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.920
And it just works great.

12:08.920 --> 12:13.120
Yeah, and it's given us a nice, just easy, no-brainer

12:13.120 --> 12:14.280
overview of what's going on.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.360
In fact, just recently, we had a listener say, hey,

12:16.360 --> 12:19.720
is such and such RSS feed down, or was there no show today?

12:19.720 --> 12:21.040
Let me go check.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.760
Hold the status feed.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.680
It's up.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.680
Linode.com slash SSH.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.160
Go there to receive $100 in 60-day credit,

12:29.160 --> 12:30.720
and you support the show.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.760
Linode can be your lab in the cloud.

12:32.760 --> 12:33.840
That's how I use them.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.840
I'm always trying things out, because their infrastructure

12:36.840 --> 12:37.600
is super fast.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.360
They're constantly investing in that.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.880
They are their own ISP, so all of their connections

12:42.880 --> 12:46.000
between data centers and out to the internet are super fast.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
The hypervisors have 40 gigabit connections coming in.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.520
And Linode just recently revamped their block storage

12:51.520 --> 12:56.600
with MVME super fast PCIe disks, and they cost 30% to 50%

12:56.600 --> 12:59.320
less than the major cloud providers out there.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.360
So it's just a great way to experiment and try something

13:02.360 --> 13:04.480
out, and then grow it and scale it up,

13:04.480 --> 13:06.320
because they make it really straightforward to expand

13:06.320 --> 13:07.240
the RAM, the storage.

13:07.240 --> 13:09.840
And you can utilize things like object storage.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.600
They have S3-compatible object storage

13:11.600 --> 13:14.080
that you can use to increase storage as much as you like.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.800
I mean, that kind of stuff makes it super flexible,

13:15.800 --> 13:17.560
but it's just a great way to learn, too.

13:17.560 --> 13:20.640
And if you've never set anything up before, don't worry.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.480
Not only do they have great guides, super good tutorials,

13:24.480 --> 13:26.360
but they also just have one-click deployment.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.920
So you could do a one-click deployment of Nextcloud

13:28.920 --> 13:31.560
and see if you like it, or anything really,

13:31.560 --> 13:34.160
because you can start with a pretty base image of just

13:34.160 --> 13:37.160
the OS you like, some container runtime stuff,

13:37.160 --> 13:40.600
and then you add the container on top of that and try it out.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.720
And I know for some of us, you're

13:42.720 --> 13:45.560
willing to invest the time to learn something,

13:45.560 --> 13:47.360
but you want to see if it's worth it first.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.120
And Linode is great for that kind of thing.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.360
So I'll do a one-click.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.560
I'll figure out how it's set up and how it's running.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.440
If I like the application, if it's worth all the effort,

13:56.440 --> 13:59.520
and then I'll often rebuild it either locally or on Linode

13:59.520 --> 14:02.280
with a DIY setup or in my existing application server.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.960
One of the things that we do here

14:03.960 --> 14:06.120
is we run all of our Jupyter broadcasting services

14:06.120 --> 14:09.400
up on Linode for anything that's public facing.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.600
And there's a lot of catch-all services

14:11.600 --> 14:15.760
that just do things like supply us a pasteboard for us

14:15.760 --> 14:18.160
to put our emails from our listeners,

14:18.160 --> 14:22.680
or check the uptime of a server, or host our HedgeDock Markdown

14:22.680 --> 14:24.440
collaborative editing instance.

14:24.440 --> 14:25.880
And there's applications.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.880
And you can put all of that just on one Linode

14:27.880 --> 14:30.520
because they're so crazy powerful and fast.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.960
If it runs on Linux, it's going to run on Linode.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.240
They started in 2003 as one of the first in this business,

14:36.240 --> 14:38.320
and they have refined and honed it ever since.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.520
And nobody does it like them, and they back it up

14:40.520 --> 14:42.520
with the best customer service in the business.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.960
I've been a customer for more than two years now,

14:44.960 --> 14:47.160
and I've been happy every single day.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.840
They haven't let me down yet.

14:48.840 --> 14:52.160
Go try them out, support the show, and get yourself $100.

14:52.160 --> 14:56.680
Linode.com slash SSH.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.360
Well, it's time to welcome back to the show

14:58.360 --> 15:03.120
our resident doorbell expert, Morgan the Doorbell Guy.

15:03.120 --> 15:03.960
Welcome back, Morgan.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.040
How are you doing?

15:05.040 --> 15:05.360
Thank you.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.360
I'm not sure how I feel about the Doorbell Guy,

15:07.360 --> 15:09.960
but it's a pleasure joining back.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.120
Hey, we had a jingle with that phrase in it.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.200
I mean, that name's going to stick now.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.320
Yeah, I think that's true.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.040
That is true.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.380
I think it's time to actually join Twitter as the Doorbell

15:18.380 --> 15:18.880
Guy.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.240
Yeah, although today we're not just talking doorbells.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.520
We aren't, no.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.280
We thought we'd finally bring up Frigate, which

15:28.280 --> 15:32.760
is a new NVR, network video recorder piece of software.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.640
It's free and open source.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.880
And Morgan, you've been playing with it.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.960
Yeah, so I went ahead and I got it set up.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.520
Based on the previous episode where

15:41.520 --> 15:44.960
you mentioned WiseBridge, I was able to get WiseBridge set up

15:44.960 --> 15:46.720
really quickly.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.920
It found my doorbell.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.960
It found all my V3s.

15:50.960 --> 15:55.900
And I was able to pipe using RTSP from WiseBridge

15:55.900 --> 15:57.540
over into Frigate.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.960
It was a little difficult to get set up,

15:59.960 --> 16:02.400
mainly because I couldn't read the docs very well.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.840
But once I got it up and running, it was pretty good.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.960
One thing I would recommend, though,

16:07.960 --> 16:10.920
and I know this is pretty crazy, go with the beta.

16:10.920 --> 16:15.280
The beta seems to be where the software writer is going.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.800
He did a lot of changes.

16:17.800 --> 16:21.840
24-7 recording, for example, is now standard in the 9 beta.

16:21.840 --> 16:26.160
But the biggest improvement that I saw over 0.8

16:26.160 --> 16:29.760
was GPU acceleration worked, which was huge.

16:29.760 --> 16:32.640
Obviously, it recommends you have a Coral device.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.240
You definitely want a GPU accelerator

16:34.240 --> 16:35.960
if you're running a Wyze doorbell,

16:35.960 --> 16:39.240
because the Wyze doorbell comes in at 90 degrees.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.720
So you either rotate it at the Wyze bridge,

16:41.720 --> 16:44.800
which I don't recommend, doesn't support GPU acceleration,

16:44.800 --> 16:46.560
or you do it in Frigate.

16:46.560 --> 16:50.120
So that little adjustment of just 90 degrees

16:50.120 --> 16:52.120
is going to eat up your CPU.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.760
Yeah, that's just what I was going to say, actually.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.720
You were using the iGPU built into your CPU

16:56.720 --> 16:59.840
with QuickSync to do all of that transcoding, right?

16:59.840 --> 17:00.680
That's correct.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.320
Yeah, so as I mentioned when I was on the show

17:03.320 --> 17:05.840
not too long ago, I purchased the UNAZ from you

17:05.840 --> 17:10.840
running an i5-8500T, switching over to the GPU QuickSync.

17:10.840 --> 17:14.600
It was, I think my CPUs are at 41, 42C steady,

17:14.600 --> 17:16.480
and that's monitoring three cameras.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.640
So for those that aren't familiar,

17:18.640 --> 17:22.560
Frigate is a real-time object detection piece of software.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.800
It uses the Google TensorFlow library

17:24.800 --> 17:27.400
to perform real-time object detection.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.600
So it can do stuff like pick out cars, people,

17:30.600 --> 17:32.520
bears, dogs, cats.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.680
And actually, Morgan, you told me the other day

17:34.680 --> 17:36.600
that you think it saved your cat's life.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.640
Yeah, so I have kids.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.640
I mentioned before on the show that I have kids.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.600
And the downside of kids is that they're often, you know,

17:43.600 --> 17:46.400
they can be careless without realizing it.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.920
We came back from dinner one night,

17:47.920 --> 17:50.080
one of the rare outings, you know.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.400
We come back in, the kids are messing around outside,

17:52.400 --> 17:54.440
they get yelled at to come inside,

17:54.440 --> 17:57.120
and somebody doesn't close the front door properly.

17:57.120 --> 18:00.440
We hear the door open about an hour later from the alarm,

18:00.440 --> 18:02.840
somebody goes and shuts it, no big deal.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.280
Getting ready to go to bed.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.040
So I quickly grabbed my phone, I looked at Telegram,

18:07.040 --> 18:08.040
and I noticed that it said,

18:08.040 --> 18:10.400
a cat was detected at the doorbell.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.160
We have a couple stray cats in the neighborhood,

18:12.160 --> 18:13.360
didn't think anything of it,

18:13.360 --> 18:16.360
but for some reason, I decided to look at the video.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.320
And in the video, I see these two yellow eyes

18:18.320 --> 18:19.440
peering out of the bushes,

18:19.440 --> 18:22.320
and out comes my 10-month-old cat.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.920
Babe, wake up, the cat's outside.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.480
We go outside, we spent 30 minutes looking for the cat.

18:27.480 --> 18:30.200
We find the cat across the street under the neighbor's car.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.520
You know, it was, it's pretty crazy to think

18:32.520 --> 18:36.200
that home automation and AI and ML

18:36.200 --> 18:37.840
potentially saved my cat's life.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.480
Right, you had to get it, that was part of it, too,

18:39.480 --> 18:40.680
is you have to get it in front of your face.

18:40.680 --> 18:43.880
Just really kind of a funny, ironic thing.

18:43.880 --> 18:47.960
I also had a situation with a cat just the other day.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.920
I decided to put a little WiFi camera under the RV

18:51.920 --> 18:53.320
just to watch what was going on

18:53.320 --> 18:55.400
while we were parked out in the woods.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.160
And the morning we were leaving,

18:57.160 --> 18:59.520
I checked, I checked my camera events

18:59.520 --> 19:02.520
and found out that a cat was living under the RV.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.680
And I don't know what would have happened

19:03.680 --> 19:04.960
if we would have fired up and started rolling

19:04.960 --> 19:07.080
because we were packing up and getting ready to go.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.440
And the cameras, and the alert

19:08.440 --> 19:09.760
that there was motion down there,

19:09.760 --> 19:12.520
in my case, it wasn't as nice and fancy as yours,

19:12.520 --> 19:14.080
but it alerted me, and I thought,

19:14.080 --> 19:16.240
you know what, I better check this.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.480
I don't always check these

19:17.480 --> 19:19.560
because anything can set it off, really.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.120
But that one time, I thought, I'm going to check that.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.000
And man, was I surprised when I pulled that up

19:25.000 --> 19:26.400
and saw a cat.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.160
Stowaway alert. You were, too.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.120
Yeah.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.840
So to talk more about Frigate,

19:31.840 --> 19:33.360
one of the things that I would recommend,

19:33.360 --> 19:34.760
obviously I mentioned this,

19:34.760 --> 19:36.520
and the project mentions it as well,

19:36.520 --> 19:39.600
you definitely want to get a Coral device.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.120
They do not recommend using CPU for the detection.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.960
And as I found when I first set it up,

19:44.960 --> 19:47.240
it is very CPU intensive.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.760
Even with GPU acceleration,

19:48.760 --> 19:50.560
you think you still need a Coral?

19:50.560 --> 19:52.680
Yes, you definitely want to get a Coral.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.200
The downside is finding them.

19:54.200 --> 19:57.320
I had to purchase mine off eBay for twice the MSRP.

19:57.320 --> 20:01.480
That is the reality right now of the supply chain shortages.

20:01.480 --> 20:02.720
But it's fantastic.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.920
You plug it in through USB,

20:03.920 --> 20:05.480
you pass it in through your Docker file,

20:05.480 --> 20:08.640
it detects it right away and you're good to go.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.480
Unless you're Alex

20:09.480 --> 20:11.920
and it makes your instance crash every time.

20:11.920 --> 20:12.880
Yeah.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.880
I've just been trying to run it on a Raspberry Pi 4

20:14.880 --> 20:17.760
I've got just for testing for this episode.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.240
And I've been having kernel panics.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.480
So goodness knows what's happening over here,

20:21.480 --> 20:24.000
but it's not working terribly well for me.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.120
But I know that you've had some success.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.560
So why don't you tell us more about it?

20:28.560 --> 20:32.840
So my doorbell sits on that infamous 45 degree angle.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.160
You know, I went out and bought the door,

20:34.160 --> 20:36.160
the Wyze doorbell specifically

20:36.160 --> 20:39.080
because of the Wyze bridge that came out

20:39.080 --> 20:40.680
and I'm on a corner.

20:40.680 --> 20:43.840
So I'm able to see two of my neighbor's houses

20:43.840 --> 20:46.600
because of the way the house curves.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.840
And I get alerts from Telegram that says a human,

20:48.840 --> 20:52.240
you know, a person has been detected on the doorbell.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.280
So I of course watched the video

20:54.280 --> 20:56.800
and I kid you not all the way across the street,

20:56.800 --> 21:00.160
this itty little, bitty little speck of a human being

21:00.160 --> 21:01.280
walking their dog.

21:01.280 --> 21:04.040
So it detects the dog and the person.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.760
You know, you do have some false negatives.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.480
Like sometimes it tells me my cat is a dog,

21:08.480 --> 21:09.320
but in the end of the day,

21:09.320 --> 21:12.280
the detection quality of Frigate is really good.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.680
I have it set up to only retain, you know,

21:15.680 --> 21:17.360
to retain one day worth of video

21:17.360 --> 21:19.600
since I send all the clips to Telegram.

21:19.600 --> 21:23.000
I abuse the free Telegram, you know, storage.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.320
So it, I think right now with the three cameras,

21:26.320 --> 21:29.840
they're all running HD, you know, streamed from Wyzebridge.

21:29.840 --> 21:33.560
I'm seven or eight gigs a day and it auto refreshes.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.280
It really just needs an RTSP feed.

21:35.280 --> 21:39.120
You use Wyzebridge, but any camera that had RTMP would work?

21:39.120 --> 21:39.960
Correct.

21:39.960 --> 21:44.560
So I actually had a brand new Wyze V3 sitting in the box.

21:44.560 --> 21:48.760
I pulled it out, set it up, flashed the new RTSP firmware

21:48.760 --> 21:50.600
and it did work.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.120
I have not migrated any of the other cameras.

21:54.120 --> 21:56.160
This one is still sitting on my desk.

21:56.160 --> 22:01.160
So the idea is I will move all of the V3s over to the RTSP.

22:01.880 --> 22:06.200
The downside is I don't see the doorbell camera

22:06.200 --> 22:07.640
getting RTSP.

22:07.640 --> 22:08.560
Yeah, I don't think so.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.040
I also think there may be more of an encoding delay.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.480
I'm not sure, but I've been testing this.

22:13.480 --> 22:16.560
It is possible Wyzebridge may actually be faster

22:16.560 --> 22:19.560
than running the RTSP firmware directly on the Wyze camera

22:19.560 --> 22:22.560
because right now with, and I'm very grateful

22:22.560 --> 22:24.840
Wyze released the RTSP firmware for the V3.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.040
Thank you, Wyze.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.040
But I'm getting about a two and a half, three second

22:28.040 --> 22:31.120
encoding delay when I pull it directly off the camera.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.360
Whereas with Wyzebridge, it's nearly immediate.

22:34.360 --> 22:35.280
Correct.

22:35.280 --> 22:38.000
That is one of the best features, right?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.840
It detects the cameras.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.240
You don't have to modify anything.

22:42.240 --> 22:46.080
But then again, as we all know, that is inherit fear.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.080
How long before they turn it off?

22:48.080 --> 22:51.000
There are only certain firmwares that are supported.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.200
The V2s were working and a new firmware came out

22:53.200 --> 22:54.720
and then they stopped working.

22:54.720 --> 22:57.800
And in all honesty, we are at the mercy of Wyze.

22:57.800 --> 23:02.400
Whereas if you flash the RTSP, it does work.

23:02.400 --> 23:05.480
They do have a land mode only on the Wyzebridge,

23:05.480 --> 23:06.680
which is great.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.200
But again, you still have to authenticate.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.880
And I'm pretty sure it's not going

23:10.880 --> 23:15.240
to take long before they say this is eating into our money.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.400
One of the big issues I saw personally,

23:17.400 --> 23:20.040
especially with the Wyze app, just to talk about how they

23:20.040 --> 23:22.080
steal features away from you, you

23:22.080 --> 23:26.400
used to have the ability to save video clips to your phone.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.480
I was trying to save a video clip from the Wyze app

23:29.480 --> 23:31.280
to send to the wife last night.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.720
And I realized that I don't have that option anymore.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.080
Do you have an SD card in the camera?

23:36.080 --> 23:38.960
No, so I don't run the SD cards.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.000
I actually took all the SD cards out

23:41.000 --> 23:42.240
since I'm now using Frigate.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.000
Right.

23:43.000 --> 23:43.880
There is that feature.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.400
You can still do the playback thing

23:45.400 --> 23:47.680
if you have an SD card and that kind of stuff.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.600
The question is, how many customers are actually

23:49.600 --> 23:51.040
really running the SD card?

23:51.040 --> 23:52.760
Yeah, and it's more expense, too.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.960
One of the nice advantages is they're pretty low cost

23:54.960 --> 23:57.320
cameras, but you add an SD card and you almost

23:57.320 --> 23:58.560
double the price.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.680
You mentioned briefly that you're not using the Home

24:00.680 --> 24:03.880
Assistant integration, but I got to be honest with you, Morgan.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.920
That seems like that's why I would want to use Frigate,

24:06.920 --> 24:10.360
because it creates sensor entities and camera entities

24:10.360 --> 24:13.020
and switch entities in Home Assistant for me,

24:13.020 --> 24:15.640
and it uses Home Assistant's media browser

24:15.640 --> 24:19.200
to show me the still clips from motion from the camera feeds

24:19.200 --> 24:19.900
that it detects.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.320
The Home Assistant integration seems

24:21.320 --> 24:25.040
like the perfect aspect of this, but you said,

24:25.040 --> 24:26.240
no, I don't actually like it.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.080
Was it not working well?

24:27.080 --> 24:27.960
What happened there?

24:27.960 --> 24:29.600
Well, it's not that I didn't like it.

24:29.600 --> 24:33.120
The version it was using was the stable version.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.960
You didn't have the option to use whenever I set it up,

24:35.960 --> 24:37.320
and I'll be honest with you.

24:37.320 --> 24:40.040
Unlike a lot of people, it's working right now,

24:40.040 --> 24:43.600
so I haven't revisited it, because it works.

24:43.600 --> 24:47.120
But at the time,.9 was still in beta,

24:47.120 --> 24:52.200
and when you did the 8 when you installed the Home Assistant

24:52.200 --> 24:54.920
integration,.8 was the only one that was there.

24:54.920 --> 24:58.560
And again, the.8 was not working for me

24:58.560 --> 25:03.160
at all with GPU acceleration, and that was definitely a need.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.240
The features were great.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.760
It was super easy to set up Telegram.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.840
Whenever you had the Home Assistant integration,

25:09.840 --> 25:12.200
it was easy to set up Telegram.

25:12.200 --> 25:15.680
But definitely, when he gets.9, or he gets the 1.0 release

25:15.680 --> 25:19.920
up and running, use the Home Assistant integration.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.640
But for right now, if it currently

25:22.640 --> 25:25.960
doesn't support.9, the beta, and you

25:25.960 --> 25:29.360
want to get some of these extra features, the 24-7 recording,

25:29.360 --> 25:31.760
the GPU acceleration, you're definitely

25:31.760 --> 25:34.160
going to have to look at doing it outside in Docker Compose

25:34.160 --> 25:34.920
separately.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.600
And then it sounds like to really make

25:36.600 --> 25:39.500
it sing, getting one of those Google Coral devices

25:39.500 --> 25:42.800
to do the specific machine learning required

25:42.800 --> 25:44.520
for the quick object identification.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.240
That's really the cherry on top.

25:46.240 --> 25:46.760
It is.

25:46.760 --> 25:50.840
So that thing is like a machine learning AI.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.640
I don't know, it's about the size of two fingers

25:53.640 --> 25:56.960
next to each other, like a very small candy bar or something.

25:56.960 --> 26:00.240
And this thing, it's pretty cool if you think about it.

26:00.240 --> 26:04.120
It's basically a machine learning chip on a USB stick.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.240
It's essentially what it is.

26:05.240 --> 26:08.040
And it just accelerated everything.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.920
Like Morgan said, the CPU usage just

26:10.920 --> 26:13.080
disappeared when we plugged this thing in.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.600
It was pretty incredible.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.160
It makes me really appreciate the impact

26:17.160 --> 26:18.440
of dedicated silicon.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.060
So when I look at the Apple silicon announcement this week,

26:21.060 --> 26:25.600
and they're talking about the dedicated ProRes encoding

26:25.600 --> 26:27.800
circuitry that's in their new CPUs,

26:27.800 --> 26:29.240
it's a similar thing here.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.880
We're entering a new era in computing.

26:31.880 --> 26:37.160
We're leaving the general purpose CPU-only stuff behind

26:37.160 --> 26:40.560
and moving into sort of more ASIC-dedicated hardware

26:40.560 --> 26:41.120
territory.

26:41.120 --> 26:45.280
And it's very impressive what this little thing can do.

26:45.280 --> 26:48.280
So one last update before I go, and Alex

26:48.280 --> 26:49.920
will truly enjoy this.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.040
I have the worst luck possible.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.600
I always wait until the last minute

26:53.600 --> 26:56.840
and say, OK, let me just go ahead and buy this.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.580
I buy it, and a month later, they

26:58.580 --> 27:00.000
come out with a new version.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.680
Wyze just announced the new Doorbell Pro.

27:02.680 --> 27:03.240
It's bigger.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.080
It has the higher, the fisheye.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.520
And I really like it.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.400
And I'm probably going to buy it, which

27:09.400 --> 27:13.520
means I'll be back to then review that Doorbell.

27:13.520 --> 27:16.120
And I'll take the Doorbell.

27:16.120 --> 27:17.920
That's the Doorbell guy.

27:17.920 --> 27:18.680
You see?

27:18.680 --> 27:19.200
Good.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.760
It's just how it works.

27:21.760 --> 27:24.240
Well, we'll also have links to Morgan's Create

27:24.240 --> 27:26.480
Configs in the show notes, too, if anybody out there

27:26.480 --> 27:27.320
needs a few pointers.

27:27.320 --> 27:28.960
Thanks for sharing those with us, Morgan.

27:28.960 --> 27:29.800
Yeah, definitely.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.180
Thanks for having me back on the show, guys.

27:31.180 --> 27:31.960
It's always fun.

27:31.960 --> 27:35.520
And maybe I'll come back with a different review that

27:35.520 --> 27:36.560
isn't a Doorbell.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.840
Nah, not interested.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.120
Not interested.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.640
Only interested in Doorbell reviews.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.960
Backblaze.com slash SSH.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.640
Go there to get a free trial, no credit card required,

27:49.640 --> 27:50.800
and start backing things up.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.000
This is also the way I go for all my friends and family.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.480
For people that ask me, Chris, how should I back up?

27:55.480 --> 27:57.600
Don't fuss with all the details.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.800
Don't mess with all the different crazy plans out there

27:59.800 --> 28:01.200
from all the different providers.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.600
Just focus on Backblaze.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.640
This is what they do.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.680
And you know them for storage, and they

28:05.680 --> 28:07.680
have an awesome deal for you.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.960
Unlimited computer backup for Macs and PCs

28:09.960 --> 28:12.420
for just $7 a month.

28:12.420 --> 28:13.600
This is incredible.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.080
And I just gave this to my mom, too,

28:15.080 --> 28:16.500
to get all of her documents backed up

28:16.500 --> 28:19.160
off of her old Mac and her music and all of her photos.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.640
She only had that stuff on spread-out external drives.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.240
It was just no good.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.840
And if she ever has any problems,

28:25.840 --> 28:27.440
she can restore files from anywhere

28:27.440 --> 28:29.800
using the web or a mobile app.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.960
And my mom is also a graphic artist,

28:31.960 --> 28:36.160
so some of her Photoshop files are huge, ginormous.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.240
Not only does Backblaze have no problem with that,

28:38.240 --> 28:41.200
but if you ever need to restore like a big chunk,

28:41.200 --> 28:43.760
they'll let you restore by mail, snail mail.

28:43.760 --> 28:45.720
You can purchase a disk from them and restore.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.760
They'll restore everything you need right to that,

28:47.760 --> 28:49.540
and you can use that to restore at home.

28:49.540 --> 28:52.480
And then you can send it back to them for a refund.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.960
How great is that?

28:53.960 --> 28:55.000
I think that's pretty nice.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.900
And if mom's ever worried about maybe deleting files

28:57.900 --> 29:00.520
and she wants to go back a few revisions with her Photoshop

29:00.520 --> 29:02.520
projects, which this is actually something that

29:02.520 --> 29:05.240
has happened to her in the past, for $2 a month,

29:05.240 --> 29:05.960
she's good to go.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.320
And I like that, too, for myself for business documents.

29:08.320 --> 29:09.160
I think that's great.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.040
You get retention for up to a year.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.320
And the mobile apps are really well done.

29:13.320 --> 29:15.640
And Backblaze has proven it for 50 billion files

29:15.640 --> 29:17.480
that have been restored with their customers.

29:17.480 --> 29:18.640
I mean, you know Backblaze.

29:18.640 --> 29:19.960
You know they're good for this.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.640
This is what they do, but you've been

29:21.640 --> 29:23.520

29:53.080 --> 29:54.600
The Linux trucker writes in, I was

29:54.600 --> 29:56.400
listening to your last episode and heard you

29:56.400 --> 29:58.360
talking about Wall Panel.

29:58.360 --> 30:01.040
Although it's great software, I feel there's a better option.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.760
The fully kiosk browser does everything

30:02.760 --> 30:06.920
that Wall Panel does, including motion detection, auto-launch,

30:06.920 --> 30:10.360
and it will even function with the Home button on Android.

30:10.360 --> 30:13.640
There's a very small $5 fee to unlock all of the features,

30:13.640 --> 30:15.520
but I don't mind supporting great software

30:15.520 --> 30:18.160
that I use every single day.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.920
Now I was looking into this as part

30:19.920 --> 30:22.120
of the research for this episode and noticed

30:22.120 --> 30:24.880
that there's been an announcement around Wall Panel,

30:24.880 --> 30:26.080
Chris, right?

30:26.080 --> 30:28.640
Indeed, and yes, Wall Panel is great software,

30:28.640 --> 30:30.280
but it seems that it's just recently

30:30.280 --> 30:32.560
had a maintainer change.

30:32.560 --> 30:36.240
One of those kind of classic open-source situations,

30:36.240 --> 30:38.840
if you will, where the maintainer kind of came up and said,

30:38.840 --> 30:40.400
gosh, I think I'm done.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.960
After all these years, I think I'm burned out.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.560
Somebody stepped up right away, and we'll

30:45.560 --> 30:48.160
have the new GitHub for that in the show notes.

30:48.160 --> 30:50.120
It now has a new maintainer.

30:50.120 --> 30:54.760
But it looks like also if you were a user of the Alarm MQTT

30:54.760 --> 30:58.720
project that's a similar project that helps you set up alarm

30:58.720 --> 31:01.760
panels with your own home automation system, that's

31:01.760 --> 31:03.080
still looking for a maintainer.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.840
That was another one of his projects.

31:04.840 --> 31:08.000
So perhaps it's worth keeping an eye on Wall Panel

31:08.000 --> 31:09.640
for a little while and see where it goes.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.440
I love it because it's in the Amazon App Store

31:12.440 --> 31:15.200
and the Google Play Store and other places, of course.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.520
But being in the Amazon App Store

31:16.520 --> 31:18.980
means that you can go pick up a Fire tablet

31:18.980 --> 31:22.520
when they're on cheap sales and just

31:22.520 --> 31:25.240
toss that app on there via their app store, and you're good to go.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.160
But it seems like maybe Fully Kiosk Browser

31:27.160 --> 31:29.440
is a pretty good contender and worth looking into.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.120
So I'll give that a try soon.

31:31.120 --> 31:34.280
Yeah, when we stop using our Fire tablet as a baby monitor,

31:34.280 --> 31:36.760
I'm going to put the Fully Kiosk Browser on that.

31:36.760 --> 31:39.720
Remember, I put Lineage on that tablet a little while ago.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.080
It's been super solid.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.740
We just leave it plugged in all the time

31:42.740 --> 31:45.280
because the battery is completely knackered anyway.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.680
And we just use it as a Wyze Cam baby monitor.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.120
We can put it up on our phones.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.360
It's really useful.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.640
The one thing that wall panel does,

31:52.640 --> 31:54.560
and I'd be curious to see if Kiosk does this,

31:54.560 --> 31:57.960
wall panel communicates back to Home Assistant over MQTT,

31:57.960 --> 32:00.720
which is really nice, and also can

32:00.720 --> 32:04.000
turn the front-facing or rear camera into a camera

32:04.000 --> 32:05.840
that you can feed into Home Assistant.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.480
Oh, OK.

32:07.480 --> 32:08.680
That's pretty legit.

32:08.680 --> 32:09.520
That's pretty cool.

32:09.520 --> 32:12.440
It is nice because it turns every tablet

32:12.440 --> 32:15.800
into a camera that's feeding Home Assistant.

32:15.800 --> 32:16.320
I love that.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.080
But I have to say, so I've bought

32:18.080 --> 32:21.200
a lot of these Fire tablets, probably half a dozen.

32:21.200 --> 32:24.920
And thrown half of them in the sink as well, I might add.

32:24.920 --> 32:26.240
There was that.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.780
Because I have some here at the studio,

32:27.780 --> 32:29.000
and I have some at home.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.800
And this most recent one I got, which I think is a seven-incher

32:32.800 --> 32:35.240
or something like that, I can't remember.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.640
And I've had another seven-incher, four, from them.

32:37.640 --> 32:40.280
It crashes almost every day.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.280
It's a piece of garbage.

32:42.280 --> 32:43.640
So maybe if I did put Lineage on there,

32:43.640 --> 32:44.600
it'd be in better shape.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.560
I think it's the OS and all that crap.

32:46.560 --> 32:50.360
And the fact that it acts as an Echo, I think also,

32:50.360 --> 32:52.060
which I thought would be neat.

32:52.060 --> 32:53.160
I thought that'd be neat.

32:53.160 --> 32:55.920
But it's too slow and laggy.

32:55.920 --> 32:57.560
I saw this going around online, Alex.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.680
And I think you already have the solution for it.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.920
But I don't know if we've ever mentioned it on the air.

33:01.920 --> 33:04.040
So I thought this would be an opportunity.

33:04.040 --> 33:08.400
Essentially, and we all have been through this,

33:08.400 --> 33:10.960
a self-hoster goes through a lot of effort

33:10.960 --> 33:13.880
to set up a beautiful Plex library.

33:13.880 --> 33:17.120
In this particular case, he has 8,000 movies,

33:17.120 --> 33:20.120
curated movies in his Plex library.

33:20.120 --> 33:24.480
Everything's beautifully set up, all of the art's working,

33:24.480 --> 33:27.920
gigabit ethernet from the video player back to the NAS

33:27.920 --> 33:29.120
that has everything on it.

33:29.120 --> 33:31.800
But when the wife sits down on the couch,

33:31.800 --> 33:34.520
she goes to Netflix every single time.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.680
And so he said, okay, so I'm just curious,

33:36.680 --> 33:39.080
what is it about Netflix that you like more?

33:39.080 --> 33:42.240
And she tells him that she likes that Netflix

33:42.240 --> 33:45.600
kind of just tells her this is what's trendy right now.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.200
You'll probably like these.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.440
And there's too much choice when she's using Plex.

33:50.440 --> 33:52.640
And he wanted to know if there was a way

33:52.640 --> 33:54.680
to create her a curated experience.

33:54.680 --> 33:57.160
Now, you and I happen to share Plex instances,

33:57.160 --> 33:58.640
and I've been on your server.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.920
And I know that you really have taken,

34:01.920 --> 34:04.920
or at least put some effort into curating collections.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.880
And you can go to your collection screen

34:06.880 --> 34:08.280
and you have collections of everything.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.600
And it looks like you automated that.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.440
I thought that'd probably be the solution

34:12.440 --> 34:14.820
for this individual who's trying to come up with a way

34:14.820 --> 34:17.260
to curate the experience for family members.

34:17.260 --> 34:18.600
Collections for days, bro.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.000
Yeah, I've got loads of them.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.200
Yeah, you do.

34:21.200 --> 34:23.800
I use this thing called Plex Meta Manager.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.640
I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

34:25.640 --> 34:27.000
It's a Python script.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.880
And this thing basically just runs

34:29.880 --> 34:32.800
through your Plex library using the Plex API,

34:32.800 --> 34:37.600
looks at the different TMDB IDs, IMDB IDs,

34:37.600 --> 34:40.840
and creates collections based on those IDs.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.160
And the really nice thing about this

34:42.160 --> 34:46.080
is it has a whole bunch of predetermined collections.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.700
So if I go to my movies right now,

34:47.700 --> 34:50.000
I've got a popular section.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.200
And in there, it looks at what's popular on IMDB,

34:53.200 --> 34:54.260
for example.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.880
And right now, I look at my top four on here

34:56.880 --> 35:00.560
and I've got the Tomorrow War, Mortal Kombat, The Matrix.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.560
I guess a lot of people are catching up on The Matrix

35:02.560 --> 35:05.000
ahead of the version four coming out,

35:05.000 --> 35:06.520
and The Wrath of Man.

35:06.520 --> 35:09.360
I didn't have to do anything to create this collection

35:09.360 --> 35:13.320
except set up Plex Meta Manager in the first place.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.560
I've got an Ansible role that I use to do this

35:15.560 --> 35:17.200
linked in the show notes as well.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.920
And essentially, all it does is it puts a couple

35:18.920 --> 35:21.040
of config files in YAML,

35:21.040 --> 35:25.080
and I can set up collections based on stuff that I want.

35:25.080 --> 35:28.400
So I want a bunch of collections based on decades, say.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.600
I've got that set up in my config file,

35:30.600 --> 35:33.640
but honestly, the defaults it comes with,

35:33.640 --> 35:36.360
you've got popular, top-rated, Oscars,

35:36.360 --> 35:40.120
and then it starts doing things like by studio, by actor,

35:40.120 --> 35:42.800
all sorts of different filters, basically,

35:42.800 --> 35:44.960
that it creates these collections with.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.400
That's exactly what he needs,

35:46.400 --> 35:48.080
and that's actually something I think

35:48.080 --> 35:49.160
I want to take advantage of too,

35:49.160 --> 35:51.440
because I've done a few manual collections

35:51.440 --> 35:53.420
and I just don't keep up with it.

35:53.420 --> 35:55.380
It's a pain to keep up with, absolutely.

35:55.380 --> 35:57.440
Now this script, I have it set on a cron job

35:57.440 --> 35:58.560
to run every night,

35:58.560 --> 36:01.520
and let me just go and look at my health checks instance,

36:01.520 --> 36:02.680
because I've started monitoring

36:02.680 --> 36:04.880
how long it takes these jobs to run.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.400
Ah, a nice metric.

36:06.400 --> 36:09.240
Plex meta manager, it takes on average,

36:09.240 --> 36:10.520
let me have a look,

36:10.520 --> 36:14.960
anywhere from an hour to the longest,

36:14.960 --> 36:15.800
I think it was the first one,

36:15.800 --> 36:17.800
was about four hours to run.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.760
So it's something you want to set up to run overnight,

36:19.760 --> 36:21.200
because it will churn through your library

36:21.200 --> 36:23.080
every single time it does it.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.900
But if you have a lot of content,

36:24.900 --> 36:26.600
obviously that could take a while.

36:27.680 --> 36:28.880
So just be aware of that.

36:28.880 --> 36:31.120
But yeah, I mean, looking at the average time here,

36:31.120 --> 36:32.120
it's about an hour for me,

36:32.120 --> 36:34.680
and I've got about a thousand movies in my collection,

36:34.680 --> 36:36.720
so just be aware of that.

36:36.720 --> 36:37.800
Also just a note,

36:37.800 --> 36:39.400
people have been writing in and letting us know,

36:39.400 --> 36:40.720
and we also saw,

36:40.720 --> 36:42.280
after we recorded last week's episode,

36:42.280 --> 36:43.860
we mentioned that there was a big change

36:43.860 --> 36:47.040
in the way Tuya devices were handled with Home Assistant.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.460
And it seems like for a lot of people,

36:48.460 --> 36:50.960
when they're upgrading to the October release,

36:50.960 --> 36:53.660
the 2021 October release of Home Assistant,

36:53.660 --> 36:55.360
it's nuking their Tuya setups.

36:55.360 --> 36:58.360
So if you're a Tuya user, be careful,

36:58.360 --> 37:00.160
make sure you got your backups.

37:00.160 --> 37:03.660
They have moved over to an official built-in integration,

37:03.660 --> 37:04.960
but it's cloud only.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.200
And so what's a common thread,

37:07.200 --> 37:09.960
and I hate this because this has happened to me too,

37:09.960 --> 37:11.440
is people were just going along,

37:11.440 --> 37:13.360
they hit the update button,

37:13.360 --> 37:16.320
and all of their local Tuya control was wiped out.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.440
And man, have I been there when something like that's happened.

37:18.440 --> 37:21.440
I just recently tried to do the Z-Wave migration myself,

37:21.440 --> 37:25.160
and that was a dumpster fire I had to restore from backup

37:25.160 --> 37:26.080
and just get out of there.

37:26.080 --> 37:29.040
And I've just determined I am sticking

37:29.040 --> 37:32.040
with the old Z-Wave integration for as long as possible.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.600
And I'm going to hope to just switch to Matter

37:34.600 --> 37:35.880
like sometime next year.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.420
And then I went online, Alex, and I looked it up,

37:38.420 --> 37:42.440
and man, people said they were spending like six days

37:42.440 --> 37:45.240
fixing their setups after they migrated

37:45.240 --> 37:47.000
to the new Z-Wave JS integration.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.560
I love Home Assistant.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.880
You all know this, and it is a universal truth in my life.

37:51.880 --> 37:55.520
But it feels to me a lot like Alex as a teenager.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.920
I used to come along to my parents and say,

37:57.920 --> 37:59.160
I've got this cool idea

37:59.160 --> 38:01.280
about how you can make your life easier.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.240
All you do is this.

38:02.240 --> 38:03.460
You just do this.

38:03.460 --> 38:04.680
You just do that.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.720
And I kind of feel like Home Assistant

38:06.720 --> 38:09.200
is in that kind of adolescent phase at the moment

38:09.200 --> 38:13.720
where you just need to do this migration just this once,

38:13.720 --> 38:15.220
and then it'll just be fine.

38:15.220 --> 38:17.280
And six days later,

38:17.280 --> 38:18.880
you're just still picking up the pieces.

38:18.880 --> 38:19.900
It's a-

38:19.900 --> 38:20.740
Yeah.

38:20.740 --> 38:22.420
Sometimes I understand it's a necessary evil,

38:22.420 --> 38:26.520
but also I do think we need to be careful

38:26.520 --> 38:28.200
somehow as a community.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.800
I don't know what the solution is

38:29.800 --> 38:31.680
because if people don't maintain the old stuff,

38:31.680 --> 38:33.400
we've got to move to new stuff, right?

38:33.400 --> 38:34.760
Yeah, it's tricky too with open source

38:34.760 --> 38:37.200
because you only have so many contributors

38:37.200 --> 38:38.280
and they only have so much time.

38:38.280 --> 38:39.440
And yeah, I do get it.

38:39.440 --> 38:40.720
And I am actually just grateful

38:40.720 --> 38:42.120
they've kept the old integration working

38:42.120 --> 38:43.480
for as long as it does.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.560
And I'm hopeful it makes it until next year

38:45.560 --> 38:47.480
because that's when I'll probably switch over.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.120
And there were plenty of resources,

38:49.120 --> 38:50.480
but you have to have a few people

38:50.480 --> 38:53.800
that take a dive and try it and report back on how it goes.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.280
And maybe if you've got any success stories, let us know.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.240
In fact, we love all of your stories,

38:58.240 --> 39:00.520
your war stories, your success stories,

39:00.520 --> 39:02.460
