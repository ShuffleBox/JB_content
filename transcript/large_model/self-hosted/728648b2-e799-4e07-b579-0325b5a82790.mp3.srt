1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Well here we are fresh back from Denver we're joined by Brent again who's still

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,960
hanging around and Chris hey hi how are you doing gentlemen?

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,800
Hello hey Brent thanks for coming in again.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,240
Hey thanks it's good to be here.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,320
You're like our de-Google correspondent and we're going to be talking a lot about that this week.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,200
Yeah well my dumb ass mentioned de-Googling just the week before we're taking a massive

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,800
trip and I'd have zero hours to actually do any prep for the episode.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,400
Luckily the audience saw fit to write in with about 800 emails telling us all the different

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,120
ways that they're doing it so we're going to come across some of those later on in the show

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,560
but in the meantime this episode is brought to you by a cloud guru the leader in learning for

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,720
the cloud linux and other modern tech skills hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,160
labs get certified get hired get learning at a cloud guru.com did I followed through on my

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,360
challenge Alex I de-Googled my map experience which was crazy because we are on the road and

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,640
I was navigating Denver and now Colorado Springs for the entire time that the duration of this

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,160
challenge so I will report back on my results when we get to the feedback but I think we should

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,000
start with this news story that I don't know it's kind of a bummer actually.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,240
I was really sad to see this yes back in episode 33 we did a review of the Helios

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,480
64 arm-powered ultimate arm-powered NAS and unfortunately the Cobalt team today

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,040
have announced on their blog that they're pulling the plug.

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,280
Yeah no more they're not even going to do the next batch that there's already orders

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,840
in the pipeline for they say it really comes down to just two key points there's ongoing

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,840
difficulties with manufacturing and procuring parts and costs of getting higher and higher

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,080
that's been a problem and they say number two they made a rookie mistake they stretch

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,040
themselves too thin they essentially went into the Helios 64 while just being a three-man show

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,560
and they should have brought more people on board and they burned out.

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,120
You know we got a really interesting insight into this manufacturing difficulties during

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,760
our System76 factory tour last week where Jeremy who is the guy that designed some of

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,720
the firmware chips and some of the firmware itself for the launch keyboard was saying that

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,720
they had to redesign on the fly two or three times some of the circuitry in that keyboard

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,120
because parts would go out of stock within hours and that he decided in the end to go

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,080
ahead and order several you know hundred units of the parts they needed before he'd actually

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,480
finished the firmware so that it didn't go out of stock before he finished writing the code.

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,200
So if that's what System76 are up against then they're probably a much larger player

34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,400
in this space than Cobol. I can only imagine some of the issues that those guys are having.

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,440
It's a shame though because I think there's a lot of passion for an ARM powered NAS

36
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,400
specifically for those of us who are looking for low power solutions.

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,560
We had some hopes that Helios was going to produce that for us.

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,880
Well I think this speaks to some motivations that I've been feeling lately particularly

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,280
after the last week getting the tour of the factory and seeing all the CNC machines and all the

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,120
powder coating stuff and I mean if ever you get the chance to be in Denver and do a tour of System76

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,680
I'm not affiliated with them in any way you know they're not a sponsor of the show or anything

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,760
although they do sponsor other JB shows.

43
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,360
Just Coder but yeah.

44
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,200
Oh just Coder that's right.

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
I mean you know maybe we should have a sponsor of this show because they make those Thalioses

46
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,280
would make great NASes so maybe they should be.

47
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,280
It was a truly inspirational experience for me so I'm sat here thinking okay Cobol who was my

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,560
my hope my light in this space has just bowed out maybe Alex should start a company and

49
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,800
build the ultimate NAS you know maybe I should do that.

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,040
I think you've got a little bit of experience Alex and some trials and tribulations that you've

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
gone through already so maybe you're perfectly suited.

52
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,160
You could prototype 3D print the enclosure.

53
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,080
Well you know that was one of the things that struck me I know this is turning into a System76

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,480
factory tour recap but this is one of the things that struck me most during that tour actually.

55
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,960
I asked them you know do you use 3D printing for your prototypes and they were like well

56
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,160
no it's just easier to do it in metal isn't it and I'm like is it?

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,360
Yeah they used to back in the day they did.

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,120
I think one of the realities is that it's with the equipment they have it's faster to

59
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,080
make it out of metal.

60
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,520
It's really you know I think the reason why you keep coming back to it Alex is because

61
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,800
so it is so hard to appreciate the amount of work that goes into manufacturing and it's

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,240
that's an obvious thing to say but when you go to the factory and you see every little

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,000
thing they had to consider and when they're bringing things in as a block of aluminum

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,520
and what's coming out on the other end is a keyboard or a case you really have no idea

65
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,560
how intricate that process is until you see it and I think that's what is probably I mean

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,400
that's what resonated with me and stuck with me and I gotta imagine probably for you too.

67
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,560
Yeah well one example was Carl who is the founder of System76.

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,960
I was just stood next to a shelf with loads of different parts in it and I picked up

69
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,800
what like an innocuous little nameplate you know about the size of a dog tag or something

70
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,360
like that and he jumped straight into a five-minute discussion telling me about all the different

71
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,240
you know reasons why they pick that particular size how it goes through their laser etching

72
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,680
machine and how they're considering doing direct engraving instead and all that kind

73
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,560
of stuff and I'm like wow if that's if that's the amount of thought that goes into a nameplate

74
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,320
or a serial number plate oh this is going to be a big mountain to solve if I want to

75
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,520
try and do it myself.

76
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,000
That's where I that's what I take from it you take from it maybe Alex could make a NAS

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,240
that could be cool I take from it oh my god I would have to build a factory and I would

78
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,920
have to learn all this stuff.

79
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,360
Oh well that sounds fun doesn't it a daunting but fun.

80
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,560
Yeah if I had another life if I had if I had like you know another 100 years I definitely

81
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,840
would get into it for sure.

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,400
You manufacture stuff every week as well and you ship podcasts every week okay you're not

83
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,120
manufacturing aluminium into you know computer cases but you ship and manufacture stuff just

84
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,600
the same.

85
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,960
That's true and there have been many times when we refer to our production pipeline as

86
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,880
kind of a manufacturing pipeline and if one component is delayed or you know gets out

87
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,840
of out of order it does cause a jam up there is a lot of that kind of building tech around

88
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,440
that maybe that's why I don't have the appetite to do it again but I definitely would sit

89
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,080
here and encourage you I'll be customer number one I'll be number two well there's a lot

90
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,040
of roadblocks to overcome but if I could just bring it back to COBOL for a minute you know

91
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,600
one of the things I picked up on in my review was that the product wasn't 100% finished

92
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,600
and I've got to believe that with this news that some of the issues that were present

93
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,560
with that NAS now will never be solved you know things like the backplane breaking some

94
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,440
of the the plastic tabs you know the power connector and data connector on three of my

95
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,760
hard drives it turned out eventually yeah problems with the two and a half gigabit network

96
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,440
adapter there was a bunch of other stuff as well you know you can go and listen to episode

97
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,080
33 if you want the full review well I worry now this means that some of this stuff's never

98
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,080
going to get fixed do you think you killed them do you think that bad review killed them

99
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,360
Alex you murdered them oh don't say that I mean I didn't mean to I was just trying to

100
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,160
be honest it was presented in a way that I felt was constructive to say that there are

101
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,880
these it's a very promising piece of hardware I mean the aluminium chassis was was really

102
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,880
lovely there was just a couple of key things that let it down you know in terms of manufacturing

103
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,120
tolerances and a couple of firmware things but overall they did a really great job and

104
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,840
I I wish there was some way we could tell them that you know even though we weren't

105
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,920
100% positive it was just because we loved the idea not because we didn't want them to

106
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,880
carry on and succeed I agree completely and they don't completely close the door in their

107
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,840
blog post we'll have that linked in the show notes if you want they do kind of leave it

108
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,080
cracked a little bit like maybe they'll come back but I wanted to shift gears and talk

109
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,520
about something that could solve a big problem for me I actually went out and I pre-ordered

110
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,800
a bunch of wise three cameras a long time ago and I have a box of wise three cameras

111
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,200
that I haven't installed because they do not yet have an RTMP firmware an RTSP firmware

112
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,400
or an RTSP firmware for wise three but Alex I think you've solved that this week yeah

113
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,200
I don't know where I came across this but I found a docker container that is called

114
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,160
docker wise bridge link in the show notes of course and essentially what this does is

115
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,840
you give it your wise username and password and it goes and sort of acts as an intermediary

116
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,280
between the wise API and the cameras and somehow it hooks into the local feed on the cameras

117
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,440
on your LAN and then presents you with a normal RTSP stream so I've just got that feeding

118
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,240
into blue iris and it just works that's fascinating and yeah it will it can actually do both it

119
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,440
can pull from the wise servers using your credentials or with your credentials it can

120
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,000
use that there's a library that the app uses and it essentially does a discovery on your

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,560
network and the wise app does this as well and if it detects the camera it uses LAN mode

122
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,480
and it just does that locally and avoids the cloud relay and you can also in your docker

123
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,960
composed there is an environment variable you can pass through that says LAN underscore

124
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,080
only that says don't even don't even try the remote thing only stream if you can locally

125
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,080
detect them and that was the piece I was curious about that's why I dug into this and that

126
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,520
means I could absolutely do this here in the RV which means I could replace these wise

127
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,440
cams that have been giving me trouble the version two was good but just didn't have

128
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,640
enough horsepower didn't really work so great at night and the wise three solves those and

129
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,200
with this docker wise bridge which seems to have a decent community around it as well

130
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,120
and some active development I think my problems have been solved and I'll give this a go I

131
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,040
think once we get back into our home base so far as I can tell it only works on the v3

132
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,960
cameras so I've got a couple of v2s flashed with the RTSP firmware and a couple of v3s

133
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:04,320
and the app will in its logs show me a bunch of errors for the two v2 cameras I don't know

134
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,480
if that's because I'm running the you know custom firmware or whatever whatever it is

135
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,160
but the performance with the v3s is great we've been using it as a baby monitor for

136
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,160
my daughter and the night vision on there is just it's like daytime it's wonderful

137
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,320
they blew it out of the park with the night vision it's tricky with the firmwares so this

138
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,600
is an issue and I'm glad you brought it up because we need to mention this on the show

139
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,680
and they have it on their github page there is a slightly older version of the firmware

140
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,200
for v2 that is compatible with the bridge but if you use the latest firmware for v2

141
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,000
it doesn't work and that actually holds true for some instances of the v3 model too so

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
there's a version that does work and there's a version that doesn't work with the v3 and

143
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,320
the pan camera as well anyways the links in the show notes you do need to check into that

144
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,800
because I may have I may have a really old firmware and so I'm going to have a hard time

145
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,040
getting just the right compatible firmware in some cases but they have all the information

146
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:10,080
you need back in episode 48 we talked about the pi kvm you know that wonderful raspberry pi that

147
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:18,720
captures hdmi and basically acts like a bmc kvm type thing well good news their version 3 hat

148
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,520
has finally entered kickstarter mode it is a little pricey so the main hat which doesn't

149
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:33,040
include a raspberry pi costs 145 so by the time you've added a pi as well and a case it's going

150
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:40,160
to be north of 200 but you do get a lot of useful stuff in there like a usb c bridge and csi you

151
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,440
know cables all that kind of stuff now wendell's done a video about this on his channel on youtube

152
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,320
so if you're curious you can go and find out more about it over there i do wonder about the price

153
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,040
and what do you think chris at that sort of 200 level is that is that too much so it looks like

154
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,120
right now on kickstarter uh it's 145 bucks and you'd get it by october 2021 which seems pretty

155
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:12,160
reasonable to me the price is it it's yeah it feels high for a hat um now i think the price is

156
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,680
a little more reasonable if you make the assumption that just about everybody already

157
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,080
has a raspberry pi for that would want to use something like this right if you're going to use

158
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,160
a raspberry pi powered keyboard video mouse switcher you probably already got a couple of

159
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,320
pies laying around so i don't think i think you just kind of null that out because that's already

160
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,960
a sunk cost and so it really is just 145 bucks now you tell me alex like how solid is this is this

161
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,440
are you still using it is it worth 145 bucks now that you've used it for a bit i'm i'm i'm thinking

162
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,120
i probably couldn't get a good kvm at that price i probably couldn't so i'd have to go i'd have to

163
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,800
go with your word though if it's worth that well i'll tell you what i'm comparing it to in my mind

164
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:00,000
at least and that is a motherboard with ipmi built in so i'm actually going back to england

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,200
in a couple of weeks to go and introduce granddaughter to grandparents so i'm going to

166
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,800
introduce my granddaughter to grandparents so hello if you're listening and as part of that

167
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,360
i was thinking well it would be nice to upgrade my you know nearly 10 year old server in england

168
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,280
with a slightly more modern motherboard and a slightly more modern ipmi implementation that

169
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:28,320
isn't based around java and an eighth gen motherboard costs me around 150 give or take

170
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,320
depending on the features that i want and i was looking at some asrock rack stuff which thanks to

171
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:42,240
chip shortage seems to be in the 300 250 to 300 range and so if i look at that and think i've got

172
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:50,560
a built-in ipmi directly on the motherboard that i know is going to be absolutely rock solid versus

173
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,400
an external device which in my experience has been good but it's still an external device and

174
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,680
you know it's another power supply it's another operating system to keep updated etc etc which

175
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,880
in some respects could be a good thing in in other respects could be a bad thing so the cost is kind

176
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,600
of a wash you know it's about the same to get a built-in versus this external unit probably just

177
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,120
go for the built-in one to be honest with you um except for the fact that this pi version using

178
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,120
the hdmi switch which is linked in the blog post in episode 48 um that i talked about in that

179
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,200
talked about in that episode i've actually got three devices hanging off this single pi and

180
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,800
that has actually worked really really well so if you're able to spit that 150 between

181
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,600
three devices suddenly that tips the scales quite a bit i also could see some value in there if you

182
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,440
needed to add it to devices that ipmi wouldn't be an option like i'm you know i'd love to have

183
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,760
console level access to my studio machines right now while i'm remote while i'm here in denver

184
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,320
for your other raspberry pies yeah that too it would be a great way to get console access to

185
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,440
my raspberry pies oh okay all right now you're making me you're making me think maybe i should

186
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:13,040
back this damn it alex well now i've actually been in lady dupes uh i've seen how you cool

187
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:22,000
your air quotes server cupboard it's pretty cool yeah hey man i just gotta get airflow that's all

188
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,760
that matters i just gotta get airflow how hot was it in the uh in the rv whilst you were parked at

189
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:34,000
system 76 last week 107 yeah it was 107 i think the hottest we ever got in here though was actually

190
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,440
nebraska i think it got near 120 in here while we were recording which actually it was impressive

191
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:48,080
because the server quote room was the coolest place in the whole rv at that time leno.com

192
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,840
slash ssh go there to get 100 dollars in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to

193
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,960
support the show hey guys guess what this week's episode marks our one-year anniversary going

194
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,880
independent again yay how about that how awesome is that it's so cool it's so cool because lino

195
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,280
helped make that possible amongst amongst our member support and those of you who went over

196
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,280
to lino.com slash ssh we're here now rocking a year of independence and lino they've been

197
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:23,280
independent since 2003 so they've really figured this out like that's 18 years of focusing on just

198
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,560
being awesome at cloud computing they started when it was new and they have just evolved with

199
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,520
it and they have remained competitive and sharp they have 11 global data centers serving nearly

200
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:39,040
a million customers and businesses around the globe but really their mission remains unchanged

201
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,800
since 18 years ago make cloud computing simple affordable and accessible to all if you set up

202
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,520
thousands of servers or if you've never set up a server before lino can make that work i know it

203
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,480
sounds like an impossible task that's why i rave about them they've really done a great job we've

204
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,880
been using the absolute schmack out of their s3 compatible object storage we created a denver

205
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,800
bucket and we created a system 76 bucket and all of the media across multiple cameras multiple

206
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,760
recorders all gets uploaded to those buckets and then our next cloud instance what we put on there

207
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,640
also saves to their s3 compatible object storage and then my system's backup there as well right

208
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,920
here from the rv it's pretty awesome and it's really just a great way to use lino and not even

209
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,960
have to have a server running in front of it it's sort of it's sort of like feels like a power move

210
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,760
they also have a great dns manager they have kubernetes and terraform support they have super

211
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,360
fast networking because they are their own isp and their pricing is 30 to 50 cheaper than other

212
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,240
major cloud providers out there you know it's also a great way to go with a multi-cloud strategy

213
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,040
perhaps you want something local and you want something up in the cloud or maybe you want

214
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,920
something across multiple cloud providers and then network them using something like nebula

215
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,880
lino can be part of that strategy as well they made our jupiter colony reunion road trip possible

216
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,960
as well our meetups were powered by lino and it has been a hoot so go sign up today and see what

217
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,120
i've been talking about that 100 you're going to get you can really use that to try the service

218
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,360
out you can really get a feel for what it's capable of that's 100 to really try something

219
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:20,160
or learn something lino dot com slash ssh that's lino dot com slash ssh here's an email from hans

220
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,000
hans says hey guys you touched upon password managers and bit warden in episode 51 like brent

221
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,560
i'm using keypass xc good good choice what i like about it is that it's easy to back up because the

222
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,840
whole database is just a single file currently sync it between my devices via self-hosted sync

223
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,280
thing instance running on an arm board in our laundry room laundry room servers very nice

224
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,120
that being said this setup is a few years old and if i would start from scratch or if i had to share

225
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,840
the password with other people i'd definitely give bit warden it look one thing i wonder though

226
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,960
when you host your passwords in a more complex application like bit warden are you taking any

227
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,360
extra measures to secure your servers i suppose it's reasonable to trust the security of bit warden

228
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,640
itself but if an attacker would gain access to your server would it be easier for them to do

229
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:17,040
harm as compared to what you would just host an encrypted key pass database file to thanks and

230
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,320
keep on going hans well i think it depends on how open your server is if it's connected to the

231
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,520
internet you've got to assume at some point you know it's possible it might get compromised

232
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,600
but it it speaks to a larger philosophy that i tend to subscribe to with this kind of stuff of

233
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,440
don't be the tallest nail you know take some basic precautions have things like fail to ban installed

234
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,160
on your ssh logins open as few ports in your firewall as you possibly can use something like

235
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,400
wire guard or tail scale or something like that to actually connect to the service in question

236
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,240
so that all the data that travels between everything is encrypted you know and use things

237
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,560
and you know and use things like ssh keys instead of passwords just just those things alone are

238
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,960
going to make you more secure than the average server administrator vault warden is the new

239
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,160
hotness these days bit warden rs is the old name um and i do agree with everything you just said

240
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,760
alex don't don't be the tallest nail but also consider the security of the box of possible

241
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:23,600
limited internet access and also keep in mind bit warden is using local encryption so it encrypts

242
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,640
and hashes your data on your local device before it sends it to the cloud server even even if it's

243
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,240
their service or your self-hosted service so that gives you some peace of mind knowing that the data

244
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,720
that's at rest on the server is encrypted now alex you mentioned being a shorter nail um have

245
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,760
either of you in all of your years encountered situations when you were one of the taller nails

246
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,320
and ran into issues i mean like had a server compromised basically that's what i'm asking

247
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,680
yeah it's never very exciting um it's usually like a server gets turned into an ftp box

248
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,240
or somebody gets a process on your machine i mean i think i've had maybe a client or two

249
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,840
that that's happened to um it's never anything uh more exciting than somebody trying to mine crypto

250
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,520
or something these days can i admit something to you both oh yeah i used to run remote desktop

251
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:21,680
open to the internet with the password 22 you maniac for like three years and how'd that go

252
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:32,800
alex well uh it didn't end well brent it didn't end well at all no what happened tell us uh they

253
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:39,760
decided to wipe my hard drives oh no oh that sucks that sucks i suppose maybe that's better

254
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,120
than using it for something nefarious or maybe they did and then they wiped it so there's no

255
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,680
track so maybe they did do something nefarious i have no idea i mean if your password is to to

256
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:55,040
maybe of you know maybe old alex didn't know how to check yeah i mean back in the day that was that

257
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,880
was that was something you know you just didn't really think of like way back in the day things

258
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,440
were just on the internet when i when i first got exposure to tci tcp ip networking everything had a

259
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,360
public internet address on the network and it wasn't until sometime later that we had firewalls

260
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,800
and gnats and so for a short period of time you could basically connect everything

261
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,240
there was some crazy stuff we did back then i didn't want to put you guys on the spot but i

262
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,240
would be curious about how to go about detecting some of this stuff you know even from a most very

263
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,280
basic level well i i mean i'm sure alex you probably have a few ideas my first couple that

264
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,560
come to mind would be know what processes should be running on your box check your logs i mean

265
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,720
almost every single time that a client machine or something was behaving poorly i could almost

266
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,040
immediately just suss it out by running top i mean really because you know you know what

267
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,640
that machine is supposed to be doing and if there's some process going crazy on there that

268
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,880
has nothing to do with the responsibilities of that box you got a pretty good idea what it is

269
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,320
and then you look at your logs right you look at the active users that are logged onto the system

270
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,320
and you kind of start tracing it back usually you'll look at the process and there'll be like

271
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,160
some weird path or url for a for a process that looks normal but it's in the wrong place or it's

272
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:16,560
being run by the wrong user and you kind of track it back from there it depends where your expertise

273
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:23,760
lies if you're a networking guy you could use something like snort which is essentially a

274
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,560
packet filter and it looks for certain patterns of packets yeah or bandwidth charts as well you

275
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,840
know that sometimes will be an indication something's up as you'll see your bandwidth

276
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,240
usage spikes up and would you guys say that containerizing some of your services is a way to

277
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:47,040
help this situation no no all right no i mean really in a way it makes it worse i think it

278
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,440
makes it worse because there's more processes and more things going on on a box in some cases

279
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,320
but you do have better security in terms of networking control and process isolation and

280
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,560
the ability to just destroy a container and recreate it if something did go sideways so it's

281
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,920
i mean it's a mix i think it's good and bad but i'm sure alex you must have saw you must have

282
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:10,160
thoughts well containers good everything else bad right that's my viewpoint but uh oh man i think

283
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,960
i think containers are better in this situation because let's say you've got an nginx web server

284
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,640
listening with your volt warden behind it or whatever the web server is that's exposing your

285
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:28,000
passwords to you if somebody was to compromise something in that code and do a buffer overflow

286
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,520
or do something that meant they could get something out of memory that they shouldn't and

287
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:38,000
extrapolate some data that they shouldn't get the blast radius of that is going to be limited to

288
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,360
the scope that that container has access to and so running things in the container is more secure

289
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,120
simply by virtue of the fact that you are scoping what that container has access to on the host

290
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,480
system yeah i mean it will have access to any of the data that the container has access to which is

291
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,120
likely important data but it's contained to that region that's inherently more safe than say

292
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,400
running apache or nginx on a box and you pop apache and now you've got access to anything on

293
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,440
that host that apache had access to which if you're lucky is not much but sometimes is way

294
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,760
more than it should be so yeah um that it's it's gonna be different every time too there's not a

295
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,120
one-size-fits-all solution it's trying to make sure you're secure and monitoring in multiple

296
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,440
locations we got a lot of email about people's wi-fi systems we got some people who love mesh

297
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:36,720
setups some people who hate mesh setups but we got one email in about a free mesh wireless solution

298
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,880
it's at freemeshwireless.com it's an open source package that you load onto hardware um and then

299
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,680
we got some people that said don't do it just deploy multiple ap's so i'm still collecting

300
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,160
information and taking it all in and i got a few devices to research too so i wanted to say thank

301
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,200
you to everybody who sent in suggestions for different wi-fi setups wow there's a lot out

302
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,760
there including some of you who said you know what just stick with unifi it's fine it's fine

303
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,360
well okay just one guy and several folks brent were happy with your recommendation

304
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,240
of checking out mikrotik it's almost like i know something

305
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:19,040
at the meetup in denver several of you let me know that you are massive fans of cloudfree.shop

306
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,240
and they are sponsoring today's episode use the coupon code self-hosted and get a dollar off one

307
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,640
of their new version two smart plugs with energy monitoring built in also those of you in the uk

308
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,160
who have let me know that you wish that cloudfree.shop shipped to the uk well good news

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,240
self-hosted at both cloudfree.shop and mylocalbytes.com to get a dollar or a pound off

311
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,240
each smart plug both of these stores are owned and operated by a couple of our listeners so

312
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,920
head over there support the community and check out their cool stuff

313
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:06,160
we had a lot of emails in regards to de-googling and it really ran the whole spectrum we're going

314
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,600
to try to get to some of them but legitimately brent you saw the list there's just no way we

315
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,320
could read all those emails yeah you gave me a little sneak peek at just the number of sheer

316
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,520
number of just scroll through the list oh we did our best but we've it's a lot of email yeah

317
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,560
but dustin was one of the first to write in and dustin was at the boysy meetup with us brent

318
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,680
he says on today's self-hosted you guys talked about de-googling this is my journey and it has

319
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:37,200
been for two years and i'd say i'm about 90 of the way there dustin goes on to say this includes

320
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,920
replacing g-suite for my podcast and i've also gone with the model of self-hosting when it makes

321
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:48,000
sense so here's what he's done for mail contacts and calendar he switched from g-suite to fastmail

322
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,960
for notes and docs he's using joplin using next cloud to sync it for photo sync he's using next

323
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,760
cloud for his phone he's gone with the iphone se 2020 so he's not dealing with google there

324
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,840
for dns he's using next dns we got another vote for next dns as well uh for maps he's using a

325
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,000
combination of apple maps and the open street maps app on the app store and for the browser he's

326
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,480
sticking with firefox and safari and for his chromebook well he's replaced that with the

327
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,080
thinkpad x 260 with arch and now fedora on there he's still working on the home assistance he's

328
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,960
going to maybe consider the home pods and look at mike croft he says google photos has been working

329
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:34,240
great for my wife uh but i'm not using it and he's using free tube to bypass youtube but it has been

330
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,800
a bit of a challenge i suspect some good tips there although um fastmail uh isn't self-hosting

331
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,080
it is you know having somebody else host it but if you're gonna have somebody host something

332
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:51,200
email is a good one to do don't don't really do don't do don't do email what i noticed from

333
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,760
that feedback is that it took him well he's on a two-year journey and so gentlemen uh what does

334
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,800
that tell you about what you've just got on the alex has really really gotten us into something

335
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:11,840
what have i done i've opened pandora's box oh man um all right so carson and others wrote in about

336
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:18,000
about maps carson says he settled on here maps as a replacement wego.here.com a lot of people wrote

337
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,880
in about open street maps brent that's what you use yeah that's what i have been using until all

338
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,120
these suggestions came in and i well maybe i'll keep that till we talk about the maps a little

339
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,680
bit more well i want to talk about it right now because uh that's the route i decided to go during

340
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:39,120
a freaking road trip and i even really briefly tried ways even though i know it's owned by google

341
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,520
i just wanted to just do a comparison and ways actually screwed us up the worst out of all of

342
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,120
them during the middle of denver rush hour it had me get off the highway to like bypass the traffic

343
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,720
and then i got off the highway and i was stuck in more traffic and then it did a quick update and

344
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,400
it said get on the highway yeah it felt to me like a an attempt at like a dukes of hazard style like

345
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:05,040
walk around the traffic but uh but it didn't work out too well for us oh goodness so i know a lot of

346
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:11,200
you wrote in with the apps that you love and i tried them and boy do they stink magic earth was

347
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:18,080
one that i liked and that uses open street maps with a proprietary gooey on top magic earth have

348
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,040
linked in the show notes but um they they all have one critical flaw even apple maps has this critical

349
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:31,680
flaw and it's search for example i'm here in colorado springs and i searched for pikes peak

350
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:38,720
which is a very popular tourist destination apple maps sent me in the wrong direction they sent me

351
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,760
to some like business that was named pikes peak that was like 10 miles in the wrong direction

352
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,400
literally the opposite direction um the magic earth using open street maps wanted to send me

353
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:57,120
to a location 5200 miles away from my current location i was 25 30 minutes away when i started

354
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,360
from pikes peak and after i was done trying to use these other nav apps i ended up an hour away

355
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,600
and it was really bad um eventually what happened is my wife looked it up on her phone on google

356
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,200
maps and got uh got an address and then telegrammed it to me and then i put that into apple maps

357
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,040
um yeah it was interesting because she she kept using out google maps during this anytime i drove

358
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,360
or anytime i was looking anything up or looking at i used anything but google maps and she stuck

359
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:30,880
with google maps so i was always comparing the two and they clearly have the superior um search

360
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,520
however apple maps surprised me and i looked into the privacy and security of apple maps because i

361
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,240
mean that was really what part of this was about was reducing the amount of time that i was

362
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,600
out was reducing my cloud footprint with this and the thing i liked about apple maps is surprisingly

363
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,400
you don't even have to be signed in to any apple id or i cloud to use it the data that they do

364
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,600
collect is associated with a randomly generated identifier they reset like every few minutes

365
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:04,480
and it is not tied to your apple id they convert precise locations into less exact locations before

366
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,440
they store them and then they apply that to your current device location information and origin

367
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,640
within 24 hours and uh any any of the personalized features like where your car is parked or

368
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,560
suggested departure times um your favorite locations any of that kind of stuff that you

369
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,600
generate it's all stored on device they don't send it up to the apple servers at all it seems to me

370
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,360
the way they've defined how apple maps works is sort of their privacy first approach that they've

371
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,280
been um sharing throughout the years yeah i'm not gonna say it's perfect but it feels like they got

372
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:44,160
most of it right considering all of the sort of technical stuff that has to happen to get you

373
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:50,560
around on a maps app and well or or another way is it feels like they designed a product to say

374
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,760
to say screw you to google on data collection and stuff like that and did it work well um the

375
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,760
display is probably the best the other thing that i found surprisingly good is the voice routing it

376
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,040
does it has really good clear like very clear about which lane to be in which isn't too uncommon

377
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:13,760
and it's very clear about intersections and here in the colorado denver area they stack the

378
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,960
intersections so it's you go you drive through an intersection and then three or four car lengths

379
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,920
later there is another intersection and so when you look on a map you're not really sure like what

380
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,920
light to turn on and the voice prompt is very clear it'll say go through this light and at the

381
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,840
next light take a left be in the middle lane and when you're when you're now you're new to an area

382
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,080
and it's dark and you're coming up on two intersections and you know you've got a left turn

383
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,760
or a right turn that kind of clarity just makes it low stress then additionally they tie in with

384
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,040
the watch so it taps your arm when you need to turn and when you were driving i was able to just

385
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,840
look at my watch and tell you what the next turn is yeah that was really handy i will admit that

386
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,960
um halfway through the trip i kind of gave up on my phone and my map app because well we're doing

387
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,960
this this experiment and um my methods were failing so uh you were in the nav seat and you

388
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,560
were helping me out and that actually worked out all right i think i'm going to stick with it i

389
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,440
don't think i'm after that i mean i said i do it for two weeks and i think i'm going to stick with

390
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,480
it um i'll let my you know my wife will still have google maps as a backup but for me i'm

391
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,760
uninstalling google maps off the phone wow yeah that's quite a success yeah it's not open street

392
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,000
maps uh although i am playing with those still and i do really like the way magic earth displays

393
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,800
things so for some circumstances like if i already know the address and i'm not searching up

394
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:40,400
something they may have a place still but um i i was i was pretty impressed um you know if you

395
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,680
only could have one app and you didn't care about google tracking you i'd probably still suggest you

396
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:51,680
use google maps you know i for the trip used um the same app that i've been using for probably

397
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:59,040
the last two years since i've tried this de-googling a while ago uh mostly successfully and uh so i'm

398
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:06,080
on android and i've been using open street map the osm and plus there are things i love about it

399
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,360
things i hate about uh the one thing you mentioned search uh i find it's great if you know approximately

400
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,960
where you want to go if you're trying to find an exact business or even an exact address on a

401
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,960
popular street it's not necessarily going to have it it might have some of the street numbers but

402
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,760
certainly not all of them i found that to be a little bit frustrating but it gets me there i will

403
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,800
say 90 percent of the time it works for me but i like getting lost in new cities so maybe that's

404
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,680
a unique approach well there's that if you don't mind getting lost that's a feature yeah for brent

405
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,840
uh the thing i liked about the open street maps app is that you could download your maps offline

406
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:52,880
hold on a minute hold on a minute osm and plus is 25 dollars that's quite a lot isn't it for an app

407
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,520
well you know it's not 25 for me when i get it from uh f-droid ah there you go you see

408
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,360
i've been using view ranger uh for quite a number of years whenever i take a hike or something like

409
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,960
that i actually this is a very long term usage for me uh from back when i lived in england

410
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,600
it supports things like ordinance survey maps and you can download u.s geological survey maps

411
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,040
you can buy them uh and actually buy the tiles directly in view ranger they're changing their

412
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,280
name to outdoor active uh so you can find them at view ranger.com i've found that one pretty good

413
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,120
brent there mentioned f-droid um we got several people including ross who wrote in and said i

414
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,680
like the aurora store it's an alternative front end for google play which keeps your data away

415
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,560
while giving you access to those apps that are exclusive he's like that's the only way i could

416
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,400
get the starlink app i i will admit i have aurora droid installed and i prefer it over f-droid most

417
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,480
of the time it has a few little tiny bugs but i didn't know that was a feature so that's great to

418
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,440
hear ross says that he switched to proton mail from gmail and i've used proton mail and i like

419
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,680
it a lot um so there's something there there was also uh a lot of people wrote in about their

420
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,760
different approaches to contact syncing and brent did you cover in last week's episode how you do

421
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,400
that i think i did but i'll do it again uh i'm using nextcloud for contacts and i've found that

422
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,760
to be pretty bulletproof actually i was worried at first when i did it a while ago um because contacts

423
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,040
is arguably the thing that's most important to me uh getting all of that right and it's been

424
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,680
bulletproof well dale writes in i just listened to episode 51 and i think brent mentioned nextcloud

425
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,880
yes confirmed we just had that confirmed by brent thank you and i wondered if any of you have heard

426
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,600
or used etsy sync that's e-t-e-sync.com it's a self-hostable project whose value proposition

427
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,840
is secure end-to-end encrypted and privacy respecting sync for your contacts calendars tasks

428
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:53,440
and notes i've been using it for about two years now and more recently i've been using it on my

429
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,920
gnome desktop i pay for them to manage the hosting and syncing but you could absolutely host it

430
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,760
yourself highly recommend it thanks for the great show and all the best dale e-t-e-sync.com we'll

431
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,480
have a link to that in the show notes i looked at it uh before the show and it it's a solution

432
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:15,920
that really is kind of targeted at just a end-to-end encrypted sync of contact calendar

433
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,880
task notes like it just solves that problem that's what they focus on and they've got apps in the

434
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,480
apple app store google play they're on f-droid too and of course you can get it on your phone

435
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,800
and of course you can get it on your desktop it look it looks pretty legit actually i think i

436
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,720
just decrypted what their name means e-t-e-sync is end-to-end sync isn't it ah i was wondering

437
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,440
it's one of those moments you figure it out and you're like oh i feel like a dummy now

438
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,040
you know if i could mention one thing about nextcloud uh on android at least that made it

439
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,600
possible for me and integrates it at a system level everywhere uh is this little app called devx5

440
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:02,960
um it takes the nextcloud syncing which is cal dev and car dev and just sort of makes that

441
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,720
available at a system level in the same exact places and ways that all of the google stuff

442
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,600
appears so it's just seamless so that would be a huge recommendation from me say it again for me

443
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:19,680
devx5 available in f-droid and maybe in other stores can you put a link in the show notes

444
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,960
for us brent oh probably so what did you guys think of the meetup it was pretty cool to meet

445
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,400
some of our listeners huh yeah we saw a chris and the badger shirt there which was exciting

446
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,200
because i hadn't considered that somebody would get a shirt with the intention of bringing it to

447
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,440
the meetup that was great that was optimus gray rocking the chris and the badger yeah i thought

448
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,640
that was super cool he posed for a picture with us and we had to stand on the correct sides as

449
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,080
well you know i was on the badger side and you were on the chris side right my daughter thought

450
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,960
it was so cool that people wanted to take selfies with us so i was like really that's the thing you

451
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,280
think is cool all right okay well i thought the free donuts were pretty cool lino put on a heck

452
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,120
of a show for us yeah uh you know brent and i and west went to grab those donuts that was quite the

453
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:07,440
journey because it was 150 donuts and it was in downtown denver during friday rush hour i don't

454
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,360
know what we were thinking and so at a certain point i saw a little bit of canadian road rage

455
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:19,440
you emerge out of brent when this truck brent had gotten to a battle with a truck downtown and

456
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,200
he had to kind of cut in front of the truck because a lane was ending and the truck driver

457
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:30,720
never forgave him for it just brent get angry i mean i disgruntled i got slightly more aggressive

458
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,880
in my driving oh wow uh it was one of those situations where you just got to get over and

459
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,440
you got to do everything you can and uh it wasn't too bad actually i thought but that that truck

460
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,680
decided to very aggressively pass us on the right hand side he had to work at it too oh yeah and

461
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:52,480
promptly cut us off again on the left hand we're just trying to make a donut run i don't think he

462
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,880
realized what we were trying to accomplish i know i know hey before we go i want to say thank you
