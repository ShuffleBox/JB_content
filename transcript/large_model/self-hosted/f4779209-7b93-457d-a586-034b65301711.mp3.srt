1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
YouTube is such a time sink. I started watching videos about bonsai trees last night, Chris.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,560
Wait a minute, Alex.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,440
Bonsai trees.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,480
There's videos about bonsai trees? No, sir. No, I will not have it.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,560
Thing is, right, there's, you know, there are many, many hobbies that over

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,240
decades, millennia, whatever, have been knowledge passed down from person to person. And I think

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,000
these days, YouTube is just an incredible resource that anybody can learn anything about anything.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,600
And you were saying you went down a new rabbit hole yourself.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:44,080
Yeah. It's funny that you did this because just before we started, I was binging old diesel bus

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,280
repair videos. How strange is this? So let me tell you about these guys. They're like middle

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:58,800
American bros that are just, you know, the most down to earth guys that go out into fields and

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,160
find old broken down buses, like diesel buses have been parked there from maybe 15 years or

13
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,280
whatever. Like the bus I was watching today was from before World War Two. And they go fix them

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,600
all up and get them running down the road to get them to their shop where they can restore them.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,160
I suppose that's a good thing about, quote unquote, simpler, older technologies. There's

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,880
there's not going to be masses of electronics and laptops required to fix it. It's all mechanical

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,040
stuff, right? Yeah. And kind of to your point, I've used YouTube now as a resource for figuring

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,720
out how to fix my RV, for doing a lot of the home automation, little tricks and little things I

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,480
needed just to figure something out or even Zelda. I mean, I hate YouTube, but I love YouTube.

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,800
You know what I mean? Yeah. It's a chronicle of some of the best and worst bits of humanity,

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,640
I suspect. Well, so it sounds like you have been sucked into several rabbit holes this week then.

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,760
Yeah. The hard thing for me is like just observing something like that. Like bonsai trees. It's an

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,560
example that I don't know why the algorithm decided that Alex wants to learn about bonsai

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,480
trees this week, but it did. And I clicked on the video. So I guess it was right, the algorithm. And

25
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:17,040
uh, yeah, two hours later I knew everything about material and wire selection and clippers.

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,160
It's funny how that works. It's funny. Can I tell you about something I did last week after our show?

27
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,080
Yeah, sure. I've decided to take the RV on a project off-grid test drive just to see

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,280
if the basics would work. Would my camera mounts hold? Would the sensors stay up? How did things

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,760
work when I actually went offline? Because I've been building all of this to be offline while I'm

30
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,520
online. And so I've never really tested it. So I took the RV out on a half day mini road trip last

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,160
week and we found a spot by the river that we took our bus down by the river and we did a camping

32
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,840
kind of just set up for lunch for about an hour and a half, totally offline, no cellular signal.

33
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,160
And there was some positive things I discovered in this test and some negative things. I'm,

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,640
I'm very happy to say my camera and sensor mounts all held, nothing fell down in the

35
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,240
Richter 4 earthquake that we are going down the road. But there was a problem that I didn't catch

36
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,160
at first. So I'm that guy, I pull back in, I'm like, look at a successful test flight.

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,160
We also did some other maintenance things on the RV. So I'm like feeling like,

38
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,720
look at me, I'm taking care of stuff. I'm testing stuff. It all worked my big plan

39
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,760
and until about the next morning when I realized things in the RV weren't working quite right.

40
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,680
And it turns out I have to solve a little problem when I disconnect the RV from shore power

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,240
and the lithium battery power kicks in that transition from shore power to inverter power

42
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:51,600
from the battery causes a real momentary blip in the power. It's not enough to knock the raspberry

43
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,720
pies offline. All the raspberry pies stayed online, but the disks went offline and I didn't

44
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,800
catch it till the next day. So it took me a while to figure out what was going on.

45
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,080
And I don't really know how I'm going to solve this problem because a UPS would be

46
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,080
the obvious solution in a home, but in the RV a UPS is no good. They freak out when you're running

47
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,760
them off of battery via an inverter. They do not like that. Plus it's a horrible inefficient use

48
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,040
of power. You lose it in that conversion, just like 40%. It's really bad. So I got to come up

49
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,160
with some way to keep power steady and smooth to these raspberry pies and their disks, but that's

50
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,440
something that's not a UPS. That's an interesting problem. I'm sat here trying to think of something

51
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,200
and I'm glad that you said UPS is out because that's the obvious thing. Yeah, I've tried that.

52
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,880
I even tried like a small little APC one that's really essentially just a portable battery in a

53
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,920
UPS housing. Still no good. Do you have an Omnicharge or am I making that up? No, I don't.

54
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:01,440
It's essentially a UPS with a battery bank smushed together and this thing might be

55
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,520
sufficient for you. I know another route is there are raspberry pie hats that have a lithium battery

56
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,680
on them. So you power the pie through the hat and then the hat provides power via the GPIO pins.

57
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,120
All right, I'm going to send you a link to this Omnicharge thing. I think you need to have a look

58
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,640
at this. It's got a small little OLED screen in it. So it tells you all sorts of cool stats.

59
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,240
You got me already. The battery percentage is not just three or four little blinky LEDs. It's

60
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,200
an actual percentage. It tells you the amount of current and wattage being drawn from the battery

61
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:42,160
in real time. It supports pass through so you can charge and withdraw power from it at the same time.

62
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,520
The USB ports support quick charge. I don't know what version, but they support quick charge

63
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,960
and it comes in several different sizes. So there's like a 20,000 milliamp version.

64
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,200
There are big ones, small ones, all sorts of different things. It has a couple of other cool

65
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,920
things. Now, the one that I have, I got as a Kickstarter about three years ago and mine has

66
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,880
an AC inverter built into it, but the newer ones have USB-C out that support power delivery.

67
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,560
Oh boy, that's it right there, isn't it? Yeah, I think that's going to be your solution.

68
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:22,080
So this is essentially like the coolest battery bank, portable battery pack I've ever seen.

69
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,200
It's pretty sweet. Have you seen the big mother that they make as well?

70
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,680
If you scroll down into the pro series, there's the Omni Ultimate, which has got like a little

71
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,760
solar panel in it, I think. And that's how many? 38,000 milliamp hours.

72
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,560
I do remember this from when it was a Kickstarter. I am very happy to see they made it because I was

73
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,320
very tempted when it was a Kickstarter. They just kind of came out during that time when I was on

74
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,560
a Kickstarter break. This is legit. This is great. And USB-C, I know the Pi 4 requires a slightly

75
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,200
higher voltage than normal, but boy, that. All right, Alex, thank you. That might be what I do.

76
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,040
I think long term, and I'm just kind of waiting to redo my power system overall, but I think long

77
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,920
term, it's just power these things via DC somehow. Just go direct off the batteries and just get

78
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,240
the inverter out of the picture. Well, Omnicharge has a DC out as well. That's great. Okay. So I've

79
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,320
actually charged my MacBook with a direct DC to MagSafe cable and it works just fine because you

80
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,480
can manipulate the voltage in the firmware using the OLED screen. You can manipulate the output

81
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:36,640
voltage of the DC port just on the Omnicharge. Stop it. You're kidding me. No, no, no. I think

82
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,680
this is exactly what you need. It's like a UPS that is not a UPS, if that makes sense.

83
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,160
How's your wallet been this week? It's still recovering from the TV.

84
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,920
Yeah, I bet. Yeah, that takes a hit. Are you enjoying the hell out of that thing?

85
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:58,480
OLED, if you are on the fence about buying an OLED versus an LED TV, I think it's genuinely worth the

86
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:06,800
money. It's like an extra thousand or whatever, but it's a lot of money, but it's really, really

87
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:17,440
worth it. We've been watching a lot of 4K high encode video codec or something. HEVC is the

88
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,200
acronym. Oh, HVAC. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What does that stand for again? Well, I think it's just

89
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,600
like a newer version of H.264, essentially. It's like H.265. I could be wrong. Selfhosted.show

90
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,520
slash contact if you want to correct me. So I've been watching a lot of Blu-rays that I've

91
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:43,040
been storing for a while through my PlayStation 4 and I must say it's really something. If you're

92
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,560
watching some of those David Attenborough shows, there was one particular scene we were watching

93
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:55,600
where he was doing heat map cameras of tigers in inner city Mumbai and the blacks were just,

94
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,760
it was as if the screen was off. It's genuinely not hyperbole. It's really something. But now

95
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,000
the coolest thing about this TV is that it integrates directly with a home assistant

96
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,400
integration. How has that been? So that's what I really want to know. Yeah. I've been going on a

97
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:19,120
huge home assistant binge this week, which we'll get to. Well now I guess. Yeah, let's do it now.

98
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,280
Let's do it now because it really kind of all ties into this, doesn't it? Yeah. There was a new

99
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,760
version of home assistant released 0.102, which has a few new interesting integrations in it.

100
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,720
The principle one that I'm looking at is the WLED integration. But before we get to that,

101
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:44,560
I'm going to touch on the LG webOS integration. Now this allows me from my home assistant interface

102
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,680
to turn the TV on, turn the TV off. Okay. That doesn't sound that amazing, but it lets me select

103
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:59,360
the input of the TV from home assistant, but it's also contextually aware of what the screen is

104
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,440
playing as well. What? If I'm watching a YouTube video, the title of that video shows up in my home

105
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,160
assistant. See, I can do that only with Plex videos right now. Nothing else. So you... Works

106
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:17,680
for Plex too. So webOS is reporting back. How does it know? I mean, this TV must be watching.

107
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,640
Well, you've got to create a developer key or some kind of like API key to let the integration work.

108
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,600
But part of the reason that these integrations are so great is that they have knowledge of the

109
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,840
APIs that these different platforms use. So they're able to take advantage of API specific features

110
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,880
to my specific model number of TV. And this must only work when you're using the apps built into

111
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,920
the TV. Well, I can change the input to HDMI and then it doesn't know what's being played. If I

112
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,760
was playing it on the shield, for example. Right. But then it would just tell you in home assistant

113
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,200
that you're on that input. Right. Yes. So what that means is I can set up some quite interesting

114
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,760
automations now. You know, this is getting to the territory where it's getting a little bit Ironman,

115
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,000
you know, a little bit Tony Stark where I can just set up a scene and it will dim the lights,

116
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,880
change the lights to a certain color and brightness, change the input on the TV.

117
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,160
And then the TV using audio return channel will turn on my receiver and set that to the correct

118
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,360
input. And, you know, then it will turn off all the lights in the rest of the house that might

119
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,000
otherwise reflect in my screen. It can set the temperature in the house to a certain level if I

120
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,240
just want to get cozy. You know, it's just a case of thinking about how all these different facets

121
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,480
of your house link together and how you can just create automations that improve your quality of

122
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,360
life. If you would have had this conversation with me eight years ago, I would have thought

123
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,240
you were being a silly, fussy man right now. You know, turn off some lamps, you're good to go.

124
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,720
How much effort does it take to walk around, flip off a few light switches? By the way,

125
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,080
these lamps probably would have had fluorescent bulbs in them back then. And I just would have

126
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:05,120
said, you know, what's the big deal? But now, having gone deep into this with my own home

127
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,680
assistant setup and my own smart light solutions, it feels like it has made our home feel more like

128
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,240
a home. It feels cozier. I don't know, I was surprised by what a difference it made in the

129
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,440
feel of the place. And I don't think I would have appreciated that as much had I not just

130
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:31,440
given this a go. And I think sometimes home automation is conflated with remote control

131
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,000
unfairly. Remote control is just the beginning, you know, being able to turn that lamp on and off

132
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,000
is fine. But it's when you start integrating everything in one place that the magic really

133
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,120
starts to happen. Right. If you want just to remote control a light, get yourself a Clapper.

134
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,000
Job done. Right. We're not trying to make Clapper 2.0 here. We're trying to actually make your home

135
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,400
contextually aware. And that's why the integration with the TV is so key, because I assume you must

136
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,080
be able to kick off automations based on the sensor data from the television. So you can have

137
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,800
that stuff happen automatically. When you switch to an input, you could have those lights change

138
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,960
without I mean, it's not even like something you have to invoke, right? That's a good point. Yes,

139
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,960
because you know, Home Assistant has the concept of sensors built into it. So there are entities,

140
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,480
which are things like my light bulbs and the TV. But then each of those things report back to

141
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,000
Home Assistant to say what their current status is. You can then use that sensor information.

142
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Maybe it's a binary sensor that something is either on or off. Or maybe it's a temperature

143
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,280
sensor that something or humidity sensor that's returning a certain value. And then you can have

144
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:51,920
Home Assistant constantly reacting to those sensor inputs. And very quickly you end up with a complex

145
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,680
house of cards, sure, but it's actually very easy to manipulate. So the other change that I've made

146
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:06,880
this week is that I've switched from a Docker container on my Ubuntu system to HaasIO.

147
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,920
Okay, so I was wondering what led to this because I have debated this a lot, because there's a lot

148
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:22,720
of advantages to using HaasIO versus vanilla Home Assistant. And just briefly, I would describe

149
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,520
the Home Assistant version that I have installed as vanilla using the Docker image. And it's just

150
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:37,680
the project with no plugins, no add-ons. HaasIO is more of a community spin that has some plugins

151
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,280
that are very easy to install, but it's a much broader thing. It's more than just a core project.

152
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,680
And I just, I debate that. I'd say it's a platform. HaasIO is a Home Assistant platform.

153
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,280
And what made you decide to switch from vanilla to the platform?

154
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,880
Well, I was browsing YouTube, Chris.

155
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,440
I knew it! And, you know, there's that Dr. Z's guy

156
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,360
that releases a million YouTube videos a week. I don't know where he finds the time.

157
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,160
I think it's all he does.

158
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,280
And he's just browsing around, going into the HaasIO store and installing,

159
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,200
you know, add-ons left, right and center. And I'm like, why am I not doing that myself? It just,

160
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,720
that just looks like too much fun. So which plugin though, there must have been

161
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,680
a plugin or two that said, okay, this is worth the hassle because I've reviewed those plugins

162
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,280
and I've thought to myself, eh, not quite worth it.

163
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,880
There's a few. So the main one for me was the VS Code plugin.

164
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,520
You can direct from the Home Assistant interface, click a button that lets you load up

165
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,000
Visual Studio Code in the same browser window that has syntax auto-completion and highlighting

166
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,560
directly supporting Home Assistant. So if you start writing an entity

167
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,640
in the configuration file, it'll tell you that you've missed the required field or something like that.

168
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:01,840
That's so slick. So it's a Visual Studio Code editor for Home Assistant.

169
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,560
Pretty much. Yeah. It's just a normal VS Code instance under the hood using the,

170
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,240
there's a container that you can run VS Code in. And I think they're just using that under the hood

171
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,280
because if you log into the appliance that's running Home Assistant now under the hood,

172
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,360
and you do a Docker PS, it's just running a dozen containers under the hood.

173
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,440
So Home Assistant on HASSIO is still running in a container. You're just abstracted away from it.

174
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,200
So this is why I thought to myself, I said, you know, Chris, if you ever really had to have one

175
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,520
of these plugins, you could just go get that container. Couldn't I just run that container?

176
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,640
Of course you could, but you have to go and, I mean, it's a very small barrier to entry,

177
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,360
but you have to add that to your compose file. You've got to configure then all the plugins in

178
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,880
VS Code to be compatible with Home Assistant, set up the remote access, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

179
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,480
And I don't get to just browse a repo and just hit install either.

180
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah. Now the other thing that is often overlooked with UI based stuff is discoverability. So in the

181
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,720
HASSIO add-on store, there are only nine or 10 plugins. Tasmo Admin is a really cool one I've

182
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,640
also been using to update all of my Tasmotor devices. ESPHome is another cool one. It allows

183
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:32,720
you to configure single board like NodeMCU, ESP8266 type ESP devices with only a few lines of

184
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:42,000
YAML. That thing is super duper cool. There's Node-RED in there as well and AdGuard Home built

185
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,080
right into Home Assistant. But the main one that I saw Dr. Z's using is something called Hax. Now

186
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,800
this is Home Assistant Community Store, and this is nothing to do with like a HASSIO necessarily.

187
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:03,760
All this on any Home Assistant instance, but Home Assistant Community Store is what it sounds like.

188
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,320
You give it a GitHub personal access token, and then it will go and crawl GitHub for every GitHub

189
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,560
repo with a certain label or a certain tag. I don't know exactly how it works, but it's amazing.

190
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,640
Yeah. So that's at Hax.xyz, H-A-C-S.xyz. I will throw a link in our show notes.

191
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,960
This is really cool looking. Oh man, I kind of want to get this set up.

192
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,960
There are hundreds of things in GitHub that you would never have found otherwise,

193
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,920
and this thing will crawl the APIs and find them for you.

194
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,040
So it sounds like you've been using the hell out of this thing to manage a bunch of the stuff.

195
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,120
I mean, a lot of that is right up your alley.

196
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,760
Yeah.

197
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,440
What was the migration like from Home Assistant Vanilla to HASSIO?

198
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,120
I'm rebuilding from the ground up.

199
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:54,320
Oh my God. Well, I mean, in January, which is when I started with Home Assistant,

200
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,440
I didn't know what on earth I was doing. Some would argue I still don't, but I'm

201
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,360
a little more familiar with the situation now than I was then. We mentioned a little earlier that

202
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,160
one of the new integrations I was most excited about was something called WLED.

203
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,880
WLED. Now, why is that exciting, Alex? Well, in my Linux Fest Northwest talk,

204
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,200
I built a smart set of LEDs that were using MQTT. In fact, we talked about it last episode.

205
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,600
MQTT is wonderful for contextually aware stuff. So the LED controller knows what Home Assistant's

206
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,880
up to and vice versa. But WLED's better because it's a native Home Assistant API integration,

207
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,400
as opposed to MQTT, which sort of sits on top as another layer.

208
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,520
That alone means that the performance is better. But couple it with the fact that

209
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,400
the WLED developer provides a precompiled binary that you can just flash with ESP tool

210
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,960
in about 10 minutes end to end. And it's just wonderful.

211
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,440
Okay. That does sound really nice. Super quick. So you get a new device, not a big deal.

212
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,480
Yeah. So there have been two traditional ways to do it. One is the custom Arduino code,

213
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,520
which is what I did, which I used the bruh automation stuff. And the other was ESP Home,

214
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,360
which is why I installed it and started looking at it this week. And with ESP Home, you gain

215
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,360
simplicity of configuration, but you lose configurability for things like effects and

216
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:38,000
that kind of thing. But with WLED, if you really want to go in and change the data pin or something

217
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,160
like that, let's say you've got a NodeMCU that's got four or five sensors on it, as well as

218
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,000
controlling your LEDs. You can go in and compile a custom firmware just the same as you could with

219
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,920
the custom Arduino code that I was using before. Or you can just flash the precompiled binary.

220
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,840
It is amazing.

221
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,400
That is really handy. There's all kinds of great ideas on the site too, esphome.io.

222
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,120
Now I read a blog post about WLED this week, which we'll put a link to in the show notes.

223
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,560
And essentially for $16, you can build yourself a smart LED strip that is fully

224
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,000
compatible with Home Assistant that you own completely.

225
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:26,560
Really nice. Those things, I mean, $15? You can get some really crappy LED strips for around that

226
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,520
price on Amazon, but not ones that are fully automated. So this thing, I guess it joins your

227
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:40,560
Wi-Fi and then it starts communicating. Give a fair description on the quality of those LEDs

228
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,360
though, because that's a big thing with LED lights is the quality of light that they give off.

229
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,920
Some of them are less good than others, but that depends

230
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,120
entirely on the LED strip themselves that you buy.

231
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,680
I mean, are you including that in the cost when you say $15?

232
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:05,680
Well, yeah, a 300 long LED strip with 300 pixels. So that's one microcontroller per LED

233
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,800
is $28 on Amazon.

234
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,320
Okay. Oh, that's all right.

235
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:17,040
So the reason I said $16 was because I generally only put $20 or $30 off a single microcontroller

236
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:23,120
because I want small mood lighting. I don't necessarily want a whole long strip.

237
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,880
If you're going to do a long strip, I would go with a 12 volt LED strip.

238
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,600
These ones in particular are five volt. And why that's particularly nice is you don't need any

239
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,520
buck converters or anything like that. You can just plug it straight into USB and you're good to go.

240
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,680
Okay. Here's a little comparison. The TP-Link KASA smart LED strip lights is what they call them,

241
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,840
which are 6.6 feet long, $70.

242
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,160
Wow.

243
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,480
Yeah. And that's using obviously with their cloud service too.

244
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,080
It's probably KASA generally stuff works pretty well with Home Assistant, but just to kind of

245
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,320
give you a comparison. So if you wanted to do a lot of LED lighting, that really adds up.

246
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,120
And that's kind of the great thing is like, if you can do it at that price, you could do a lot of it.

247
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,720
Yes. Yep. You absolutely can. Now I'm not quite finished talking about how awesome WLED is yet.

248
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:23,040
So you flash the firmware and then what makes this way better than anything that I've used before

249
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,800
is that it turns your NodeMCU or your D1 mini into a mini wireless access point.

250
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,880
And you then connect to that with your phone, navigate to an IP address in your browser,

251
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,840
and then you can configure everything about the LED strip straight from your phone.

252
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,640
You don't need Home Assistant necessarily because they also make an official WLED app for Android

253
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,720
and iOS. So I was looking through the firmware and there's a bunch of super cool stuff in here.

254
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,720
And bear in mind, this is running off a $6 microcontroller.

255
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,680
Okay.

256
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:05,760
It will integrate natively with Philips Hue, with Blink, with MQTT, with Alalax.

257
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,560
That's how you do it.

258
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,040
I try not to set it off for people, but I probably do.

259
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,000
Your Echo devices.

260
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,680
And then you can go in and configure the specific number of LEDs that you have.

261
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:24,320
It does current current estimating. So it will say like you're using 150 milliamps right now.

262
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,400
You got to really watch it with those LED lights, Alex.

263
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,520
Well, some of them actually you do.

264
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,520
So there are some microcontrollers that can draw up to 30 watts on the whole strip just on idle.

265
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,000
So you do have to pick them with care.

266
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,240
These ones I picked so that they're fine.

267
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,280
But there's a video from a guy called The Hookup on YouTube

268
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,120
and he goes through all the different types of LEDs, which we'll put a link to in the show notes.

269
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,120
He goes through all different types of LEDs and their phantom current draw and all the rest of it.

270
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,960
So, you know, there are some things you got to be aware of,

271
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,120
but I just can't overstate how excited I am by WLED and Home Assistant this week.

272
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,640
Like, I haven't been this excited about a project,

273
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,040
and I'm talking about Home Assistant here, since I discovered Docker for the first time.

274
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,640
What specifically do you think this week brought that up again?

275
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,600
Because I've been feeling that way a lot.

276
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,880
I think for me, it's just that I think to myself,

277
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,800
I wish I could integrate with this or I wish I could control that.

278
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,800
I go and look for it and it's there.

279
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,600
It's already there.

280
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,560
Someone's already done it.

281
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,000
And there are products I've been looking about maybe buying,

282
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,200
like some Kef speakers maybe that have like the Kef LS50 wireless speakers.

283
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,520
There's a native integration already there in Home Assistant

284
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,200
for these speakers I don't even own yet.

285
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,520
And it's like, it just feels to me like I was watching the State of the Union

286
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,560
Home Assistant YouTube video.

287
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,920
I spend a lot of time watching YouTube.

288
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,480
Are you getting that?

289
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,440
I'm noticing that.

290
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:53,920
It's a theme.

291
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,880
And just looking at the excitement of these people who are actively working on the project.

292
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,840
It's in the top 10 in the Octoverse for contributors of all GitHub projects.

293
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,320
It's up there with Ansible and Kubernetes, for crying out loud.

294
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,800
It just feels to me like everybody is waking up to the fact that

295
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,600
having a open home automation system is just awesome.

296
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,720
And I love that.

297
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,160
And I think it's also compounded by all these different manufacturers

298
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,760
have their own apps and their own cloud services that are all their own silos.

299
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,120
And it's nice to have something that can aggregate and bring them all together.

300
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,080
On top of that, it's sort of like the deal is changing constantly on these devices.

301
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,680
You and I were just recently discussing that Wise had to announce

302
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,440
they're removing person detection from their cameras.

303
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,360
So I bought this last round because I was really impressed that Wise managed to develop

304
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,080
on camera person detection on a $25 camera.

305
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,040
I was like, all right, I'm in.

306
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,600
Well, I got an email says they have to pull that because the company they partnered with

307
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,040
to develop that AI on the edge devices has exercised a clause in their contract.

308
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:12,000
And Wise has to ship out firmwares now that removes that feature.

309
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,640
What's that going to mean for you and I who are running the custom RTSP firmware?

310
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,760
Well, this is back to my main point is I feel like I'm insulated from these types of changes.

311
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,000
When a company decides they can no longer support feature A or product Y,

312
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,280
I'm not impacted by that because the way I have my system set up

313
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,200
is I've flashed it with that RTSP firmware.

314
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,800
I'm leaving that firmware, Alex.

315
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,800
I'm not changing it.

316
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,560
I've configured my network to record everything to the Pi locally.

317
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,880
I don't use the cloud service and I actually have everything blocked at the DNS level.

318
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,520
So they can't even communicate with the Wise service.

319
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,560
Oh, good man.

320
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,840
Yeah, I'm leaving it and then I'll let them sort it out.

321
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,320
They say they will try to add person detection back in 2020,

322
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,960
but it's going to be cloud based likely and not on the camera.

323
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,440
And I much prefer on camera because then it's in my actual recordings too.

324
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,800
Maybe I'm missing something here.

325
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,560
Why do they need an API for motion detection if it's on camera?

326
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,760
It won't be with the new system is what the implication is.

327
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,640
No, but right now.

328
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,800
So how can they pull a feature that's local?

329
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,960
That's what I don't understand.

330
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,320
Their new firmware will remove the functionality.

331
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,440
So they licensed the tech to do the person detection

332
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,840
because to get it working on these incredibly low powered cameras,

333
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,680
it was like a feat of engineering.

334
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,560
It was something that Wise was extremely proud of.

335
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,160
And it's kind of like the tech that can do it.

336
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,600
And there's really nobody else has developed person detection,

337
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,840
human object detection that can run on processors that slow.

338
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,960
So do we think that we'll be able to still buy those Wisecams

339
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,200
for the next year or two and flash that?

340
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,720
That's a great point.

341
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,520
I bet you if you bought them within a certain timeframe,

342
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,120
they would probably ship with the person detection firmware.

343
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,400
Yeah, but even if they don't,

344
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,160
maybe we can install the current RTSP firmware that you and I have.

345
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,880
Yeah, I did.

346
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,600
I did save it offline just in case it ever disappeared.

347
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,720
Yeah, good idea.

348
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,920
So it's possible.

349
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,760
I wonder if you go too far ahead, though,

350
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,680
in the firmware is if you can't go back.

351
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,040
Yeah, you know, say it's down the road is firmware 1.8

352
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,520
and the RTSP is like version 0.9.

353
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,120
Maybe that could be a challenge.

354
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,360
So it may be worth if you've been on the fence

355
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,000
just pulling the trigger now, not to change the topic,

356
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
but just for a second, it's crossed my mind.

357
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,480
It's funny how these things we do like I'll get a new TV

358
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,200
or for me it was I want to solve heating problems.

359
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,480
It just spiral into a bigger and bigger project.

360
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,960
And if you're willing to do it, it can be some of the most fun.

361
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,480
So I'm totally on board.

362
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,760
Just a big shout out to Homocyst.

363
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,880
We've talked a lot about it recently,

364
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,840
but it's just because we are so elated about it.

365
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,080
What do you say we do and ask SSH to round us out?

366
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,960
Let's do it.

367
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,320
All right, Kai wrote in, he says,

368
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,280
peeps, Kai calls us peeps, Alex.

369
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,160
Hey peeps, if I wanted to set up a simple

370
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,560
Kodi-based media center Raspberry Pi

371
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,280
with an external SSD drive connected to a TV via HDMI

372
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,280
or HDMI as you would say.

373
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,720
Jerry's triggered right now.

374
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,760
Would a Raspberry Pi 3B with one gigabytes of RAM,

375
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,400
one gigabytes, be powerful enough to do that?

376
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,160
He says, because I have a spare one,

377
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,840
or is it time to get a new Raspberry Pi 4?

378
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,720
I think it's on the edge actually, to be honest with you.

379
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,520
On the edge for what?

380
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Because direct play, the Pi 3 will do most anything,

381
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,400
even 4K H.265, right?

382
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,040
Yeah, Pi 3 with video drivers would.

383
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,800
It's generally the bit rates that start to be an issue.

384
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,480
However, if you're looking at standard 720p content

385
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,880
or if you're 1080p and it's stuff that's below 15 megabits,

386
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,520
I think the Raspberry Pi 3 with Kodi would kill it.

387
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,480
It'd be great.

388
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,760
It would eat through that stuff no problem,

389
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,880
especially if you're feeding it via an SSD on USB 3.

390
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,040
And you know the thing, Kai, that I would say here

391
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,560
is you already have one,

392
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,920
so it would take you about 10 minutes

393
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,080
to find out if it's suitable.

394
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,200
If you're like Alex over here and you're rocking 4K

395
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,320
and you want high bit rate,

396
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,720
you want really good looking picture,

397
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,120
I would be tempted then at that point

398
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,320
to throw in for a Pi 4

399
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,120
because looking at your overall setup,

400
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,320
the Raspberry Pi 4 is gonna be

401
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
the least expensive aspect of it.

402
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,840
Still even cheaper than the SSD.

403
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,200
But like Alex says, give it a go with the 3.

404
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,040
If you're not looking at ultra high quality,

405
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,160
high bit rate stuff or even serving to multiple people,

406
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,640
if you don't plan to install Jellyfin or Plex,

407
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,000
Pi 3 is gonna kill it.

408
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,560
If you wanted to go up a notch

409
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,000
and you wanted to do something like Jellyfin and Kodi,

410
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,440
which is a nice little kumbaya,

411
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,160
and you wanted to do it to a couple of TVs

412
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,200
in your house,

413
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,360
that's when I'd probably go over to a Pi 4.

414
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,520
What's crazy, you can do it with either one though.

415
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,120
I mean, that's where we're at today.

416
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,880
Yeah, it is crazy.

417
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,920
But one important hardware difference of course

418
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,720
is that the Pi 4 uses the mini or micro HDMI cables.

419
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,520
So you'll need a dongle for that versus the Pi 3.

420
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,720
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

421
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Geez, of course the other advantage would be,

422
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,160
so that's the dongle's a downside.

423
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,280
The advantage is you get better throughput to that disc

424
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,800
on that USB 3.0 bus.

425
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,760
Yeah, because the, well, there's two things at play here.

426
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,160
They finally separated out on the Pi 4,

427
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,040
the ethernet and the USB at last are on different buses.

428
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,120
At last, at last, freed at last,

429
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,400
and it makes a big difference.

430
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,520
And then the other difference is the Pi 4 has USB-C.

431
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,200
So you might need different cable or a better power supply.

432
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,160
And then the only other thing I would sort of,

433
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,040
it's not a word of caution, it's just something to be aware of

434
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,640
is the Pi 4 gets kind of toasty.

435
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
And I'm gonna add onto that,

436
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,680
even though I'm running three of them

437
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,440
and I absolutely love them, it's early days still.

438
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,320
Mm-hmm.

439
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,640
One of the Libre Elec project,

440
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,920
which is a really slick way to do a media center

441
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,160
on a Raspberry Pi, is just within the last couple of weeks

442
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,200
rolling out early support for the Raspberry Pi 4.

443
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,120
And that's something to consider

444
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,080
because the Raspberry Pi 3 is solid at this point.

445
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,320
I've been looking around and trying to find a good answer

446
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,840
as to whether it supports the newer HDMI 2.x standards,

447
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,760
but it looks like both are only 1.4.

448
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,560
If I'm wrong with that, please write in

449
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,680
with selfhosted.show slash contact and let me know.

450
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,240
Yeah, or do like I did, hashtag ask SSH on Twitter

451
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,280
or in Telegram.

452
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,840
We're always lurking and collecting information

453
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
or always lurking and collecting those.

454
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,600
I've done a neat thing on Twitter

455
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,560
where I've taken the hashtag ask SSH

456
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,000
and I've plugged that into Feedly

457
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,880
and Feedly supports just treating it like an RSS feed.

458
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,520

459
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,720
Oh, that's cool, I should do that.

460
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
I've got an if this, then that integration, but-

461
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,760
We are such nerds.

462
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,840
I might do a Feedly, that sounds good.

463
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,240

466
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,560
and you may push me over, we'll see.

467
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:41,600
And that's been selfhosted.show slash eight.
