00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
Well, we've got a special interview for episode 45 today.

00:03.520 --> 00:05.360
We're gonna have our guest coming up in just a moment.

00:05.360 --> 00:07.520
So I wanna thank our sponsor, A Cloud Guru.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.120
They are the leader in learning for the cloud,

00:09.120 --> 00:10.800
Linux and other modern tech skills.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.200
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

00:13.200 --> 00:18.080
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.560
So today, instead of a bunch of different segments,

00:20.560 --> 00:23.040
we're really kind of just doing one thing, Alex?

00:23.040 --> 00:23.680
We are indeed.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.440
Yes, we've got Paulus who is the founder

00:25.440 --> 00:27.600
of Home Assistant on the episode today.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.400
And Chris and I talked to him about all sorts of different subjects

00:30.400 --> 00:34.160
from how Home Assistant's becoming more turnkey ready

00:34.160 --> 00:36.400
through to the ESP Home acquisition.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.320
And there's a couple of interesting tip bits

00:38.320 --> 00:39.680
about the future in there as well.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.640
Well, I don't know if you remember,

00:42.640 --> 00:46.240
but you and I chatted back in 2017

00:46.240 --> 00:48.800
on a Linux action show special about Home Assistant

00:48.800 --> 00:51.280
what feels like a hundred years ago now.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.240
Yeah, no, I do remember.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.880
Well, I remember it was somebody from Jupiter broadcasting.

00:54.880 --> 00:55.920
I didn't realize it was you.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.960
Yeah, and man, have things come a long way.

00:58.960 --> 01:02.480
So thank you for joining us to catch us up on stuff.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.640
I am the happy owner of a Home Assistant Blue device.

01:06.640 --> 01:07.360
Love it.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.080
Awesome.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.480
I put the order in during the live stream,

01:10.480 --> 01:12.480
so I got it fairly early.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.560
And I got to say, months into it,

01:14.560 --> 01:16.880
the performance holds up compared to the Raspberry Pi 4.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.440
I think it is outperforming the Raspberry.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.120
I mean, it's a beast.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.520
The M2 is just like, it's amazing.

01:23.520 --> 01:27.040
So are there any plans for more expansions in that direction?

01:27.040 --> 01:29.200
Is that going to be a focus going forward?

01:29.200 --> 01:31.840
Because it really seems like a pretty sweet integration.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.760
Yeah, so there are definitely plans.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.760
Nothing to announce just yet.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.560
We realized with the M2 Plus,

01:38.560 --> 01:40.880
like we only made the case, right?

01:40.880 --> 01:42.720
So it's just a board.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.720
And when people think of home automation,

01:44.720 --> 01:47.680
they obviously think of like ZigBee or Z-Wave or Chip

01:47.680 --> 01:50.720
or Matter, whatever it's going to be called.

01:50.720 --> 01:55.280
And so that's something that we want to address.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.560
We want to include that as well.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.480
And I think the Home Assistant Blue

01:58.480 --> 02:01.680
was really like the ultimate race car,

02:01.680 --> 02:05.200
but it was not very accessible in that the price was not...

02:06.640 --> 02:09.440
The price was pretty steep for a device

02:09.440 --> 02:11.280
that also you needed to add like a ZigBee stick

02:11.280 --> 02:12.080
and these kind of things.

02:12.080 --> 02:15.520
So I think we are definitely going to look into something

02:16.240 --> 02:17.120
as a successor.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.040
Nothing to announce just yet,

02:19.040 --> 02:22.800
but it will also be hopefully lower priced

02:22.800 --> 02:27.600
and more capable out of the gate to be used for smart home.

02:27.600 --> 02:32.240
Yeah, I can absolutely see how that would be way simpler

02:32.240 --> 02:34.960
for new users to get into the space as well.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.520
Yeah, and I think when we look at these things,

02:38.480 --> 02:40.640
we don't just want to create a box that competes

02:40.640 --> 02:42.560
with like Philips Hue or anything, right?

02:42.560 --> 02:43.840
Like we're Home Assistant,

02:43.840 --> 02:49.280
so it needs to be kind of hackable, playful, open.

02:49.280 --> 02:52.240
Like it just needs just like the Odroid N2 Plus

02:52.240 --> 02:53.200
or the Home Assistant Blue.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.600
I mean, you can flash anything on it that you want, right?

02:57.120 --> 03:00.080
We're not interested in building a lockdown box

03:00.080 --> 03:02.800
that will just keep the users out.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.160
That is completely understandable,

03:04.160 --> 03:05.760
especially now having used one.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.680
But so what about guys like me

03:07.680 --> 03:09.760
who will always have a use case

03:09.760 --> 03:11.520
where I'm going to want to run it on a server?

03:11.520 --> 03:12.480
Like here at the studio,

03:12.480 --> 03:14.240
we have a server that's doing like 100 other things.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.800
And so running Home Assistant in a container

03:16.800 --> 03:18.080
is perfect for the use cases

03:18.080 --> 03:19.600
of just controlling studio lights.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.440
And we're not really using any integrations

03:21.440 --> 03:22.480
and stuff like that.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.960
How do you see that user base being addressed in the future?

03:24.960 --> 03:27.600
Right now, we have four installation types.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.120
We have the Home Assistant operating system.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.880
We have the Home Assistant supervised,

03:32.880 --> 03:34.160
the Home Assistant container,

03:34.160 --> 03:35.520
and then Home Assistant core,

03:35.520 --> 03:38.240
which is just like running it in Python yourself.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.720
And all the other three installation approaches

03:40.720 --> 03:43.200
all rely on containers.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.040
And so they all use the same image.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.680
So it's like the core technologies are all very similar.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.200
Yeah, it's all the same thing, really.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.680
The only one that's different is core

03:53.680 --> 03:57.360
because you maintain your own Python virtual environment.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.880
The other three are all Docker based.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.400
So it's all the same thing.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.080
So those four installation types

04:02.080 --> 04:03.760
are pretty much set in stone right now.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.640
I think that if you, in your studio,

04:06.640 --> 04:08.560
you can either run the container

04:08.560 --> 04:10.240
or you can run a virtual machine

04:10.240 --> 04:12.240
with a Home Assistant operating system.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.720
The benefit, of course, of the virtual machine

04:14.720 --> 04:17.920
is that you have one-click updates of Home Assistant.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.880
Well, with the container,

04:18.880 --> 04:21.840
it really depends on your container management software,

04:21.840 --> 04:26.800
which can be Unrate or Portainer or Synology or whatever.

04:28.240 --> 04:31.040
That software then has to do the update of the container.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.560
I think that's the only real difference.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.480
In the end, all of these containers,

04:34.480 --> 04:38.480
they're all run Alpine, they run Python,

04:38.480 --> 04:39.680
and we maintain that, right?

04:39.680 --> 04:42.560
So we have a big wheel server.

04:42.560 --> 04:45.680
We make sure that all the dependencies work and compiled

04:45.680 --> 04:47.360
and are just up to date and running.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.480
And that's just a big benefit as a user.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.400
And I think that moving forward,

04:52.400 --> 04:54.240
you just wanna run Home Assistant container,

04:54.800 --> 04:56.000
that will be possible.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.400
I see.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.680
So it's not like it's ever gonna go away,

04:57.680 --> 05:00.160
but you just feel like there's a lot of benefits

05:00.160 --> 05:02.720
to Home Assistant managing the entire stack

05:02.720 --> 05:05.200
because of all of the interdependencies.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.200
Yeah, I mean, there's just so many moving parts.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.560
I think that if you look at our requirements.txt,

05:10.560 --> 05:13.120
which is where we define the Python dependencies,

05:13.120 --> 05:14.800
it's like over a thousand, right?

05:14.800 --> 05:17.920
Because each integration comes with its own Python library,

05:17.920 --> 05:19.520
which is a requirement we made ourselves.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.800
So it's obviously our own guidelines.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.280
But the reason we always do this is that

05:25.280 --> 05:28.480
we want integrations to rely on an SDK.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.200
So an SDK is a Python package at the standalone

05:31.200 --> 05:34.880
that translates the protocol into Python objects.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.640
And that way, other Python projects,

05:36.640 --> 05:39.200
not just Home Assistant, can also use this package, right?

05:39.200 --> 05:41.840
So we don't want protocol-specific information

05:41.840 --> 05:44.320
inside Home Assistant because we wanna make sure

05:44.320 --> 05:47.440
that other Python-based home automation systems

05:47.440 --> 05:50.240
or just one-off scripts can use these protocols as well.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.000
Wow, so it kind of sounds like to me

05:52.000 --> 05:54.080
what you guys did as a team as you looked at the,

05:54.080 --> 05:56.000
kind of, if you will, the whole problem and you said,

05:56.560 --> 05:58.800
quite frankly, it is easier for us as a team

05:58.800 --> 06:00.720
to just do a whole OS than say,

06:02.080 --> 06:05.200
you must have considered, well, bless Ubuntu LTS

06:05.200 --> 06:07.120
as the supported Home Assistant platform.

06:07.120 --> 06:10.320
And anything else is DIY, but if you want our official way

06:10.320 --> 06:12.320
or our official image, it's all Ubuntu-based.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.240
Yeah, but the problem with that is that

06:14.240 --> 06:17.120
your virtual environment that runs Python

06:17.760 --> 06:20.880
is going to be, has to be maintained as well.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.120
So, I mean, this is, of course, how Home Assistant started.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.560
It was just a Python application

06:24.560 --> 06:26.400
that we distributed through PyPI.

06:26.400 --> 06:26.960
Sure.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.080
And people would run into, like, they would do pip upgrades.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.160
And then, of course, some people will upgrade

06:32.160 --> 06:33.280
from the last release.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.840
Some people will update from, like, six releases ago.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.240
And people got stuck all the time.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.080
And the way it works with our Docker containers

06:40.080 --> 06:43.120
is that we install all the Python dependencies

06:43.120 --> 06:44.320
fresh in each container.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.760
And so, when you update your container,

06:48.320 --> 06:50.160
all your old dependencies are thrown away.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.560
We make sure you have the latest and greatest

06:52.560 --> 06:54.480
and the dependencies all work together.

06:55.120 --> 06:58.000
And that way, it just works.

06:58.000 --> 06:58.960
Yeah, that makes sense.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.520
I could see how that also is just much more manageable

07:01.520 --> 07:03.600
and supportable by you guys as well.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.760
And I got to say, you know, on the blue,

07:05.760 --> 07:06.640
it's working really great.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.720
I kind of am, I'm a user of both use cases,

07:08.720 --> 07:11.280
just the core version and the whole OS stack.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.320
And I do really like the snapshots.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.120
I feel like the more recent updates that have also set it

07:17.120 --> 07:19.200
so you can have a snapshot right before you upgrade

07:19.200 --> 07:19.840
is brilliant.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.840
All that kind of stuff just keeps getting better.

07:21.840 --> 07:22.080
Yeah.

07:22.080 --> 07:26.000
And I think, you know, the features are really driven.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.560
You know, we look at the way people use Home Assistant

07:28.560 --> 07:32.000
and we look at the issues we see on our forums

07:32.000 --> 07:32.960
and our Discord.

07:32.960 --> 07:36.000
And then we just ask ourselves, like, why is this?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.560
What can we do to make it easier and better?

07:38.560 --> 07:41.840
And we just constantly try to, like, kind of tackle this.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.160
And, you know, we're really focused on making

07:44.800 --> 07:47.840
Home Assistant easier to use while still also,

07:47.840 --> 07:50.080
you know, making sure that our power users,

07:50.080 --> 07:51.440
of course, can do their things.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.640
And, you know, it's been really paying off.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.880
I think that, like, we launched Home Assistant analytics,

07:56.880 --> 08:00.240
like, a month ago, two months ago already, right?

08:00.240 --> 08:02.480
And I think, like, around, we didn't do much promo,

08:02.480 --> 08:05.040
but, like, 45,000 people have opted in.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.880
And you can actually see our operating system

08:06.880 --> 08:08.800
is, like, 65% of our users.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.680
Oh, okay.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.160
I mean, that was pretty unexpected.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.760
Like, we knew it was high.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.080
I think, you know, internally, we were like,

08:16.080 --> 08:17.840
ah, that's probably, like, 50%.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.520
But it's actually 65%.

08:19.520 --> 08:23.280
And I also understand it because it's just convenience, right?

08:23.280 --> 08:26.480
Like, if you want to be a system administrator at home,

08:26.480 --> 08:27.840
you can be, of course.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.720
But if you want to be, like, automating your home,

08:30.720 --> 08:31.520
you can be that, too.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.040
Linode.com slash SSH.

08:35.040 --> 08:38.160
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on your new account,

08:38.160 --> 08:40.960
and you support the self-hosted podcast.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.720
Linode is my playground to learn,

08:42.720 --> 08:45.040
and it can be yours, too, without $100 credit.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.480
And sure, maybe, ultimately,

08:46.480 --> 08:49.040
you decide to self-host something on your LAN.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.320
But every now and then, and that's more and more these days,

08:52.320 --> 08:55.120
there's a job that's really perfect out in the cloud

08:55.120 --> 08:57.600
on a service provider you can trust,

08:57.600 --> 08:59.200
and you have full control.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.800
That's one of the things I like about Linode

09:00.800 --> 09:03.040
is unlike entry-level hosting services,

09:03.040 --> 09:05.760
they don't try to lock you into their platform with gimmicks.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.680
Linode gives you full back-end access

09:07.680 --> 09:10.000
to customize and control your server to fit your needs.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.440
And their DNS manager allows you

09:11.440 --> 09:13.440
to easily switch your domain to your new server.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.680
You can manage SSL certificates with breeze

09:15.680 --> 09:17.760
and deploy applications with a single click

09:17.760 --> 09:20.160
or build the server up from scratch if you want.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.960
If you need a simple personal server for a blog or portfolio

09:22.960 --> 09:24.160
or maybe a game server,

09:24.160 --> 09:26.480
in fact, they make that really straightforward.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.040
Or maybe you want to set yourself up a next cloud server

09:29.040 --> 09:29.920
and sync your own files.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.480
Whatever the scale of your task or your business,

09:32.480 --> 09:34.240
or even when your app goes viral,

09:34.240 --> 09:37.680
Linode is going to reliably serve to millions of users.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.160
It can be just you and your friends and family,

09:40.160 --> 09:42.160
or it can be millions of users.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.520
And we've really put it to the test here

09:43.520 --> 09:44.880
at Jupiter Broadcasting.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.600
And like I say, it really is a fantastic playground

09:47.600 --> 09:48.800
to learn as well.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.560
And that $100 credit means you can play around

09:50.560 --> 09:52.000
with all kinds of different hardware

09:52.000 --> 09:53.360
and configuration stacks,

09:53.360 --> 09:55.600
which has been a massive advantage for me.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.120
Before I deploy something in production,

09:57.120 --> 09:59.280
I'll sometimes spin up a couple of versions of it

09:59.280 --> 10:00.480
on different stacks.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.640
Maybe this one's on NGINX and this one's on Apache.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.960
Maybe this one's on Ubuntu, maybe this one's on CentOS.

10:04.960 --> 10:06.640
I'll try them out and test them right there.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.720
And then I'll just keep the winner and destroy the others.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.800
That kind of flexibility and not having to mess around

10:10.800 --> 10:13.040
with some slow VM software on my laptop

10:13.040 --> 10:15.520
to test that stuff out, it's just brilliant.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.960
And then of course, there's the perk as a listener

10:16.960 --> 10:19.040
of supporting this here podcast too.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.040
And we use our S3 compatible object storage

10:21.040 --> 10:22.960
as the backend storage for our next cloud,

10:22.960 --> 10:25.200
which means we're not constantly managing disk space

10:25.200 --> 10:25.920
all the time.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.360
They've really got this stuff dialed in

10:27.360 --> 10:29.120
because they've been doing it since 2003.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.400
So I want you to go try it.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.880
So go to linode.com slash SSH.

10:32.880 --> 10:36.160
Go there, get that $100 in credit and support the show.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.080
linode.com slash SSH.

10:38.080 --> 10:42.160
Yeah, so I mean, Home Assistant's been headed down

10:42.160 --> 10:45.040
the more turnkey route for quite a while now.

10:45.040 --> 10:48.880
And I think hasOS is, or am I calling it the right thing?

10:48.880 --> 10:50.640
I'm still confused by the name change.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.000
It's been headed down the turnkey route for quite a while.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.560
What else do you have planned in that space?

10:56.560 --> 10:57.520
I mean, there's been a lot of work

10:57.520 --> 10:59.360
around automations recently,

10:59.360 --> 11:03.360
as well as some other aspects of the experience.

11:03.360 --> 11:07.120
So I think that our goal really like in the longer term

11:07.120 --> 11:10.480
is that we wanna make sure that a lot of people have access

11:10.480 --> 11:13.680
to having like great home automation at home

11:13.680 --> 11:16.640
that focuses on local control and privacy.

11:16.640 --> 11:19.440
And so having Home Assistant be accessible

11:19.440 --> 11:21.280
is important to us, but for example,

11:21.280 --> 11:24.720
we've also, the company behind Home Assistant,

11:24.720 --> 11:28.240
my company Nabucasa, we've also recently acquired ESPHome.

11:28.240 --> 11:33.280
ESPHome is a firmware for ESP devices that runs on a,

11:33.280 --> 11:36.560
which is a firmware that can run on a lot of products

11:36.560 --> 11:40.240
that come from China, like light switches, lights.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.200
And with ESPHome, we are also trying to make it easier

11:43.200 --> 11:47.680
for people to get access to devices that work locally

11:47.680 --> 11:50.800
and work private and work with Home Assistant.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.920
So yeah, our long-term goal is really just to make it

11:53.920 --> 11:55.200
accessible to everybody.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.280
And I think that launching hardware

11:57.280 --> 11:59.840
was a really obvious step.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.600
I feel that for a long time,

12:01.600 --> 12:04.800
I didn't wanna go down that route because logistics,

12:04.800 --> 12:06.560
just like all that stuff.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.280
But at the end of the day, we were looking at it

12:09.280 --> 12:11.200
and we were like, we've been working on making it

12:11.200 --> 12:13.040
so much easier to use.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.600
But then the first step of instructions is,

12:15.600 --> 12:17.920
download Azure, download this image

12:17.920 --> 12:19.680
and flash it to an SD card.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.840
And most people don't even know those words.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.120
Yeah, it's true.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.880
That has me thinking about something like,

12:24.880 --> 12:26.800
you know, the made for iPhone program?

12:26.800 --> 12:27.600
Yeah.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.440
It makes me think with ESPHome in particular,

12:29.440 --> 12:31.600
I know it's aimed primarily at hackers

12:31.600 --> 12:34.240
and people that wanna build and make and solder

12:34.240 --> 12:36.080
and all that kind of stuff.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.160
But it's got me thinking, it's acquisition of ESPHome,

12:38.160 --> 12:40.800
why isn't there a made for Home Assistant program?

12:40.800 --> 12:45.520
Well, I think that the main thing about making it

12:45.520 --> 12:46.720
a made for Home Assistant,

12:46.720 --> 12:49.840
is that we don't have an API ourselves, right?

12:49.840 --> 12:52.240
Like we always integrate with the other products.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.720
I did consider like starting one

12:54.720 --> 12:56.880
or like having like at least some certification

12:56.880 --> 12:58.640
and more official certification,

12:58.640 --> 13:03.520
but we see that there's not much interest in it

13:03.520 --> 13:04.800
in a way that like, you know,

13:04.800 --> 13:06.880
manufacturers will come to us and be like,

13:06.880 --> 13:09.120
well, what's your API, we'll integrate.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.880
And I'm always like, no, that's not what we want.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.960
We want you to create an open API.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.240
We will integrate with it,

13:14.240 --> 13:16.640
but other projects should also be able to allow

13:16.640 --> 13:18.080
to be integrated with it.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.600
And then we see a lot of companies be like,

13:19.600 --> 13:21.360
ah, that's not in our interest.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.840
Or, you know, we were talking to Ring

13:23.840 --> 13:26.320
because, you know, they wanted to say like,

13:26.320 --> 13:28.880
hey, can we get like a partnership going?

13:28.880 --> 13:32.000
And then we looked at it and the first step is sign NDA

13:32.000 --> 13:34.640
to make sure that you don't expose their APIs.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.960
And like, we're open source, this is not gonna happen.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.960
And the same thing happened to us with Sonos,

13:39.840 --> 13:42.640
who also was like, yeah, we wanna keep it to partners only.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.640
It's like, ah, okay, that doesn't work.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.880
Oh, that's super frustrating to hear that kind of stuff

13:46.880 --> 13:49.040
because some of those companies you listed,

13:49.040 --> 13:50.240
you know, Ring and Sonos,

13:50.240 --> 13:52.720
they're big players in this space.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.600
And that's kind of frustrating to hear

13:55.600 --> 13:58.800
that they're not compatible with an open source ethos yet.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.160
Well, their partnerships are not,

14:00.160 --> 14:02.560
but I mean, we still integrate with them, right?

14:02.560 --> 14:05.840
It's just less official because they still have APIs

14:05.840 --> 14:08.240
and people have been able to figure out those APIs.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.800
And so we will still integrate with them.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.880
It's just, if you are a partner,

14:12.880 --> 14:14.320
they will make sure it stays working

14:14.320 --> 14:16.400
or they will give you a heads up so you can adjust.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.560
And that's something we don't have, right?

14:18.560 --> 14:20.640
So we sometimes get caught off guard,

14:20.640 --> 14:23.920
like some brand will change an API,

14:23.920 --> 14:25.600
Home Assistant stops working,

14:25.600 --> 14:27.520
we have to update our code, ship a hotfix

14:27.520 --> 14:28.640
and it will work again.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.400
Which leads me nicely into my next question,

14:30.400 --> 14:32.160
which is about the velocity of change.

14:32.160 --> 14:33.920
Now, I've been using Home Assistant

14:33.920 --> 14:35.360
for a couple of years myself,

14:35.360 --> 14:38.160
so I've been through quite a few breaking config changes

14:38.160 --> 14:38.960
over that time.

14:38.960 --> 14:42.640
I feel like, and this is just anecdotal personal experience,

14:42.640 --> 14:44.480
that that experience has gotten better,

14:44.480 --> 14:47.200
that the pace of change hasn't decreased,

14:47.760 --> 14:50.480
but the amount of changes that break stuff,

14:50.480 --> 14:53.840
that has decreased significantly from my perspective.

14:54.640 --> 14:58.480
What things are you doing from a Home Assistant side

14:58.480 --> 15:03.760
to make that velocity of change more easy for people to handle?

15:03.760 --> 15:06.560
So the biggest change there, and this is actually,

15:06.560 --> 15:08.160
it started out with a policy change,

15:08.160 --> 15:10.800
and then it resulted also in code changes.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.480
So there's this thing called Convid flow.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.360
So through the UI, you can set up an integration.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.280
And what we said is that this is going to be mandatory

15:19.280 --> 15:20.080
moving forward.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.720
So it used to be that you could go into YAML,

15:22.720 --> 15:25.840
and then for example, let's say for your Philips Ubridge,

15:25.840 --> 15:27.840
you would say, this is the IP address.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.880
And then, well, Philips used maybe a bad example,

15:30.880 --> 15:32.800
because you would still have to press a button in the UI

15:32.800 --> 15:34.320
and it was storing some extra data.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.000
But for some things you have to like,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.840
here's the username, here's the password,

15:37.840 --> 15:40.240
username, password, and IP address of a device

15:40.240 --> 15:40.880
on my network.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.280
But then when the IP address would change,

15:44.080 --> 15:45.280
Home Assistant wouldn't work.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.600
And Home Assistant couldn't find the new IP address

15:47.600 --> 15:50.240
because you had it hard coded in your configuration files,

15:50.240 --> 15:52.160
and we're not changing your configuration files.

15:52.720 --> 15:57.120
And so those cases, we really had to handle through UI.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.760
We had to like say, hey, this is a temporary IP address,

15:59.760 --> 16:01.200
but we still have an identifier.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.080
So if your Chromecast changes IP address,

16:04.080 --> 16:06.000
we can still find it and we will set it up again,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.080
or your Shelly or whatever you have.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.280
And then we realized that,

16:09.920 --> 16:12.000
oh, actually a lot of our breaking changes

16:12.000 --> 16:15.200
is because people are adding support

16:15.200 --> 16:17.440
to having to like go from one device,

16:17.440 --> 16:20.320
support multiple devices, or these kinds of things.

16:20.320 --> 16:23.040
And so when we go for a config flow,

16:23.040 --> 16:25.680
Home Assistant is responsible for how it is written to disk.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.320
So Home Assistant knows exactly the configuration format.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.640
And if we have to change it,

16:30.640 --> 16:32.960
because we are going to support multiple devices,

16:32.960 --> 16:34.880
we can actually migrate that data

16:34.880 --> 16:36.560
because we own how it is stored.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.560
If it is a configuration file,

16:40.000 --> 16:40.960
and this is kind of silly,

16:40.960 --> 16:43.040
but we kind of programmed our way

16:43.040 --> 16:45.200
into like a corner we can get out of.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.000
Because if you look at configuration.yaml,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.680
we have all these advanced structures

16:49.680 --> 16:51.280
to break up your configuration files.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.040
There's packages with includes,

16:53.840 --> 16:56.320
include their names, include their list,

16:56.320 --> 16:58.320
and there's all these different types.

16:58.320 --> 17:01.600
And what that means is that Home Assistant

17:01.600 --> 17:04.000
cannot go update your configuration file anymore

17:04.000 --> 17:06.560
because it doesn't know where your configuration file is.

17:06.560 --> 17:09.360
We would have to reverse track all your includes,

17:09.360 --> 17:12.000
and then we need to find like a yaml writer

17:12.000 --> 17:13.440
that respects your comments

17:13.440 --> 17:15.920
and respects your indentations exactly how it was.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.640
And it's just, it's impossible.

17:18.640 --> 17:21.200
I think safe mode was a really good invention.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.960
Well, not invention, idea, right?

17:22.960 --> 17:25.040
Where Home Assistant still starts

17:25.040 --> 17:27.360
and then just goes back to a safe mode.

17:27.360 --> 17:31.360
Yeah, so safe mode was really driven by the blue, right?

17:31.360 --> 17:32.880
So we had the blue in mind

17:32.880 --> 17:35.600
and we were like, okay, we're gonna have a box.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.720
We're gonna sell this people,

17:36.720 --> 17:39.680
like it will actually allow more people to use Home Assistant

17:39.680 --> 17:41.680
that previously were not using Home Assistant.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.640
So how can we make sure that they can always boot

17:44.640 --> 17:45.920
and always have a UI?

17:46.880 --> 17:48.240
That shows you just how long it takes

17:48.240 --> 17:49.200
to develop a product

17:49.200 --> 17:51.920
because they were released a long time apart,

17:51.920 --> 17:52.800
those two things.

17:52.800 --> 17:53.520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.400
I mean, it took us a year to make that case for the blue.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.760
So it's, I mean, a pandemic happened

17:59.760 --> 18:01.040
and like what other stuff,

18:01.040 --> 18:04.560
but yeah, it took us a year on all to just get a case.

18:04.560 --> 18:08.480
So I hope our next product will not take that long

18:08.480 --> 18:10.640
at least, I mean, we'll see, but yeah.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.680
Yeah, it is very tricky.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.960
It's fascinating though how thinking about

18:16.960 --> 18:18.320
from a developer perspective,

18:18.320 --> 18:20.240
how to ship something for an end user,

18:20.240 --> 18:21.840
we got a feature like that.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.640
I think that's kind of telling how created that use case.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.200
So I'm curious, let's shift gears to the personal side.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.760
If you do have some self-hosted services,

18:29.760 --> 18:31.440
what are you running on your LAN

18:31.440 --> 18:33.680
and roughly how much storage do you have

18:33.680 --> 18:36.080
on this quote unquote LAN?

18:36.080 --> 18:39.440
So I run Unrate at home

18:39.440 --> 18:43.040
and I made a server that must've been like

18:43.600 --> 18:45.760
six, seven, eight years ago or something.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.360
Like now it's six years.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.240
It's getting really old.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.840
It's like a core I5 still.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.240
And I think it takes up way too much power

18:52.240 --> 18:53.280
compared to what it does.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.520
You know, and I chose Unrate

18:57.520 --> 18:59.840
because this was during the beta phase of Unrate.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.080
So beta phase of Unrate 5.

19:02.080 --> 19:05.040
And Unrate 5 was where they introduced the Docker containers.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.720
So that was like almost kind of right away,

19:08.720 --> 19:10.960
I kind of shifted into like this perfect world

19:10.960 --> 19:12.480
of having all these containers at home.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.160
And so I'm actually still the maintainer

19:14.160 --> 19:16.960
of the Home Assistant core templates for Unrate.

19:16.960 --> 19:17.460
Love that.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.320
So that's how I used to run Home Assistant for a long time.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.160
I was like, I just have my container at home.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.880
And then I have like, I have Plex running

19:26.880 --> 19:27.920
and some other stuff.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.040
And then you had to go and make it a whole OS.

19:31.040 --> 19:31.600
No, I'm kidding.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.760
Yeah, I hear Plex in there.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.560
Interesting.

19:34.560 --> 19:35.520
What's that set up like?

19:35.520 --> 19:38.080
I mean, so I mainly use Plex

19:38.080 --> 19:40.640
because there's a bunch of that.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.160
So I'm from the Netherlands,

19:42.160 --> 19:43.680
but I live in the United States.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.080
And there's a bunch of content from the Netherlands

19:46.080 --> 19:47.200
that is geo-blocked.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.600
And so I cannot access it in the United States.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.600
So I have to jump on a VPN

19:51.600 --> 19:53.520
and download either stuff from YouTube

19:53.520 --> 19:54.320
or whatever.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.400
And then I also don't want my son

19:56.400 --> 19:58.320
to be on YouTube unsupervised.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.480
So that's also why I pull in some videos.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.640
And then I'll just have a Plex account for my son

20:02.640 --> 20:05.280
and he can kind of just browse through it.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.960
I do that same thing for my kids.

20:06.960 --> 20:07.680
Yep, exactly.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.360
It's a great use case for Plex.

20:09.360 --> 20:09.920
Well, that's it.

20:09.920 --> 20:12.240
And then how much storage roughly would you estimate?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.680
I think it's like eight terabytes.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.000
I just got some smart errors the other day.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.520
Two months ago, some CRC smart check error.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.520
So I just...

20:23.520 --> 20:24.720
But then, I mean, with Unrate,

20:24.720 --> 20:25.760
you have this parity disk.

20:25.760 --> 20:27.840
Your parity disk needs to be the same size

20:27.840 --> 20:29.920
or bigger than your biggest disk.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.160
And so my biggest disk were like four terabytes.

20:32.160 --> 20:32.800
And so it's like, wow,

20:32.800 --> 20:35.680
I should really update to like eight terabyte disks.

20:35.680 --> 20:38.400
And so I only updated my parity disk now.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.480
And that took like more than a week, right?

20:40.480 --> 20:42.480
Because you have to like pre-clear it

20:42.480 --> 20:43.440
and all that stuff.

20:43.440 --> 20:43.940
Yeah.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.960
And then I still have one disk

20:46.960 --> 20:48.400
that is like on riser FS.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.240
And I think they stopped using riser FS

20:50.240 --> 20:51.360
and they're using something else.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.600
And I was looking into, should I migrate this?

20:53.600 --> 20:56.400
And then I was like, no, this is just like, no.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.280
It's too much.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.400
It still kind of works.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.120
And so I actually only updated the parity disk.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.120
And then I've...

21:03.120 --> 21:05.840
The old parity disk I installed now as in my rate

21:05.840 --> 21:08.400
because there's only a couple of errors.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.600
And then I read online that like,

21:09.600 --> 21:11.680
ah, it's okay if you have a couple of errors.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.160
And that was already after I did my whole process.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.360
But of course, I mean...

21:15.360 --> 21:16.960
That just means it's time to start shopping.

21:16.960 --> 21:17.760
Yeah.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.040
Exactly. Yes.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.760
I'm waiting for some like deals, right?

21:21.760 --> 21:24.240
Because those disks are expensive.

21:24.240 --> 21:28.240
I was like, I use the Western Digital Red, I think.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.480
Are you familiar with shucking drives?

21:30.480 --> 21:32.320
Is that of any interest to you?

21:32.320 --> 21:33.360
What is that?

21:33.360 --> 21:37.440
So you buy a USB hard drive from Amazon

21:37.440 --> 21:38.560
or Best Buy or something.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.240
This is Alex's favorite thing to do.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.240
I'll show you.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.440
I've literally got one over here.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.600
It's just like it sounds.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.360
You grab the disk off Amazon

21:47.360 --> 21:49.040
and you shuck it out of the case.

21:49.040 --> 21:54.800
I paid for this Iron Wolf NAS Pro $170 for a 10 terabyte drive.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.440
Oh, wow.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.360
And all I had to do to get this was buy a USB enclosure drive

21:59.360 --> 22:00.800
and pop it out the USB enclosure.

22:00.800 --> 22:05.280
It took five minutes and it's a normal SATA drive.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.080
There's nothing special about it once you get it out of the case.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.360
If you look just on eBay, just for this drive on its own,

22:11.360 --> 22:13.600
I could sell this thing for $350.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.800
In fact, why don't I do that?

22:15.840 --> 22:16.400
There you go.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.000
You got to pay for that solar setup somehow.

22:20.720 --> 22:20.960
Yeah.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.800
So the shucking technique is Alex's favorite.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.720
Sometimes it requires a little more work than that,

22:24.720 --> 22:27.360
but it is a great way to get drives at a great price.

22:27.360 --> 22:28.640
Oh, that's a good tip.

22:29.520 --> 22:32.080
I heard you talking about solar, Alex.

22:32.080 --> 22:32.560
Yeah.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.080
We're actually working.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.320
We have an intern at Home Assistant.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.160
And well, he actually is an intern at Nabucasa,

22:40.160 --> 22:42.000
but he's working on Home Assistant stuff.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.920
And his focus right now is create a solution.

22:45.920 --> 22:50.320
How do we use Home Assistant to give the user insight

22:50.320 --> 22:52.880
into the energy usage and allow optimizing it?

22:53.520 --> 22:59.440
So, of course, Home Assistant has been always very focused on home control,

22:59.440 --> 23:01.520
home automation, and it's been our strength.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.480
History has not been our strength that much, right?

23:04.480 --> 23:08.400
Our database has been clunky and it's pretty shitty.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.640
So, I mean, we're actually changing this right now.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.840
So in the next release, it's going to be what we call statistics.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.920
And it's going to be a new table in our database.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.200
And it will take a snapshot every hour.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.760
It will analyze certain entities that you have.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.320
Right now, it's temperature and energy.

23:26.320 --> 23:30.400
We calculate the min, the max, the mean, the sum, all that stuff.

23:31.200 --> 23:36.080
And then the goal is to start generating dashboards on your energy usage

23:36.080 --> 23:41.280
and to show predictions and show comparing current period,

23:41.280 --> 23:43.920
current week to last week, these kind of things.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.400
Now, that second part is not going to be in the next release,

23:46.400 --> 23:50.640
but we're already going to start generating statistics in the next release.

23:50.640 --> 23:51.520
Sounds fantastic.

23:51.520 --> 23:55.600
And I'll tell you, the solar company that's doing my install,

23:55.600 --> 23:57.360
it's a local one in North Carolina.

23:57.360 --> 24:02.240
They want to charge me $800 for energy monitoring.

24:02.800 --> 24:07.680
So I'm using the, I think SolarEdge is the manufacturer of the panels.

24:07.680 --> 24:12.960
And they have a cloud API, which Home Assistant can poll every 15 minutes,

24:12.960 --> 24:14.080
I think, to get the data.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.640
But I'm like, it's in my house.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.040
Why do you need to go to the cloud to get this stuff?

24:19.040 --> 24:23.440
So I'm thinking I might get one of these Shelly energy monitors.

24:23.440 --> 24:27.760
And then with everything you've just said, I think I might be in business.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.440
No kidding, right?

24:29.440 --> 24:32.960
You know, Paul, I know too, I got to speak up for the van lifers out there.

24:32.960 --> 24:36.720
The Victron Venus system speaks MQTT.

24:36.720 --> 24:40.960
And so I know there's guys out there that are pulling that information

24:40.960 --> 24:43.120
into their Home Assistant setup as well.

24:43.120 --> 24:43.360
Yeah.

24:43.360 --> 24:46.320
And so we're really been looking at, or we have, I don't know if you,

24:47.360 --> 24:50.960
we tweeted it from the class tweeted like two weeks ago, I think.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.120
But he has already has a lot of paper mockups.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.400
And he's been like playing.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.640
I think he has interviewed like 20 different people.

24:57.280 --> 25:01.200
And he's been really focusing on, can we kind of gamify it?

25:01.200 --> 25:04.880
Where like, for example, if you know your yesterday's usage

25:04.880 --> 25:09.520
and we show your today's usage, can we tell you like, hey, tone it down a little?

25:09.520 --> 25:13.120
Because otherwise you're going to use more than like yesterday.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.480
I've actually had an idea.

25:14.480 --> 25:18.160
A friend of mine, I've just had my first kid, by the way.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.920
A friend of mine was telling me they were doing that,

25:19.920 --> 25:23.520
automating nap time, a light in the nursery with Home Assistant.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.560
You know, certain times if the light bulb's green,

25:26.560 --> 25:28.000
then the kids are allowed out of the room.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.440
And if it's red, they're not.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.840
I'm thinking we could play games with colored light bulbs

25:31.840 --> 25:33.120
and children at this point.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.640
That's where my brain's going.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.280
Oh, I do it.

25:35.280 --> 25:35.680
I do it.

25:35.680 --> 25:39.360
That's, you know, I train my kids with a series of light changes at night for bedtime

25:39.360 --> 25:41.840
and then noisemakers come on throughout the rig.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.280
It's real.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.160
It's brilliant.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.520
I can't wait to play with that.

25:45.520 --> 25:50.240
And gamifying, it feels like that's an idea that could be applied to a lot of things.

25:50.240 --> 25:54.000
As somebody who uses Home Assistant to manage an off-grid setup,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.880
I would love something around energy history

25:56.880 --> 26:02.000
and a gamification system that would encourage the family to maybe conserve energy.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.320
Because one of the things I did that really encouraged family adoption was

26:06.320 --> 26:10.560
we got a fire tablet and we just put Home Assistant up on it all the time.

26:10.560 --> 26:14.160
It's on the wall and it's always there so the kids can see what's going on.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.520
And once I did that, it like it clicked for everybody.

26:17.520 --> 26:20.240
So to get something up on that screen would, man,

26:20.240 --> 26:22.560
they just take my off-grid game to like the next level.

26:23.520 --> 26:27.360
Yeah, I think honestly just getting people inside in it is like step one.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.840
Then all of a sudden they start to realize it's like,

26:29.840 --> 26:33.760
oh, I can actually, you know, we can generate more energy than we use today.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.200
Let's go for it, right?

26:35.200 --> 26:36.560
I think that's going to be fun.

26:36.560 --> 26:40.480
So my last question, I think, before we let you go is about automations.

26:40.480 --> 26:44.880
This kind of goes back to the turnkey aspect, I suppose, and simplification.

26:44.880 --> 26:50.000
There's been a lot of work around making the YAML automation interface

26:50.000 --> 26:51.600
built into Home Assistant easier.

26:52.320 --> 26:56.880
But I always find myself for the more complex things reaching for Node-RED.

26:56.880 --> 27:01.200
And I wondered how you felt about people like me doing that.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.960
Do you want us to all be using YAML all the time or do you not really care?

27:04.960 --> 27:06.000
I don't really care.

27:06.000 --> 27:13.120
In fact, I think it's great that our APIs are so generous that you can get anything out

27:13.120 --> 27:17.440
that you can actually build Node-RED and do a full automation engine

27:17.440 --> 27:21.440
without being part of the Home Assistant integrations.

27:21.440 --> 27:24.240
And I think that, you know, each has their own.

27:24.240 --> 27:29.440
And I think because Node-RED exists, we don't have to make a lot of things ourselves, right?

27:29.440 --> 27:32.560
A lot of feature requests that would normally come to us are now,

27:32.560 --> 27:34.080
ah, I will just use Node-RED.

27:34.640 --> 27:38.720
And I just saw a pull request, I guess it's been like one and a half months ago,

27:39.520 --> 27:43.040
from the maintainer of the Node-RED Home Assistant integration,

27:43.840 --> 27:47.920
who makes the nodes for Node-RED.

27:47.920 --> 27:52.080
And I think he's been working on getting the triggers from the Home Assistant automation

27:52.080 --> 27:54.480
YAML into Node-RED as well.

27:54.480 --> 27:58.640
So we have a lot of triggers that are not very accessible yet,

27:58.640 --> 28:01.760
a lot of advanced triggers that are not accessible in Node-RED yet.

28:02.320 --> 28:06.960
But that would allow Node-RED to use anything that a normal YAML automation can,

28:07.520 --> 28:10.800
would be possible inside Node-RED, which I think is really cool because

28:11.440 --> 28:15.840
all of a sudden it makes Node-RED a lot more powerful or any other automation engine.

28:16.560 --> 28:21.280
And, you know, in the end, one way or the other, if you have like local control,

28:21.280 --> 28:23.760
local data, we succeed.

28:23.760 --> 28:24.800
Yeah, I totally agree.

28:24.800 --> 28:29.360
And I think my number of input booleans could use some spring cleaning.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.880
So I'm happy to hear that.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.120
ProvadoVPN.com slash SSH.

28:39.120 --> 28:43.840
That's P-R-I-V-A-D-O-V-P-N.com slash SSH.

28:44.560 --> 28:48.080
Go there to try out Provado for free and of course support the show.

28:48.080 --> 28:51.760
ProvadoVPN is a zero log VPN.

28:51.760 --> 28:54.400
That means there's no records of your activity.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.720
We looked into this for you guys and we wouldn't feature them unless it was this way.

28:58.720 --> 29:02.960
And even in the event of a legitimate authority requesting logs associated with your activity

29:02.960 --> 29:06.480
when connected to Provado, they got nothing to give.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.360
And even better, they're backed by Swiss privacy laws.

29:09.360 --> 29:14.160
In addition to having that strict zero log policy, ProvadoVPN is based in Switzerland.

29:14.160 --> 29:18.000
That means you're protected by the absolute strongest consumer privacy laws

29:18.000 --> 29:18.720
in the world.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.200
And Provado has the tech where it matters.

29:21.200 --> 29:24.560
They own and operate their own data centers and fiber lines.

29:24.560 --> 29:28.880
And the network is composed of hundreds of servers physically located in 45 countries

29:28.880 --> 29:31.040
and 58 cities around the world.

29:31.040 --> 29:35.280
What that means for you is you can connect in seconds and no matter what server you choose,

29:35.280 --> 29:38.480
you're going to get incredibly fast speeds every time you connect.

29:38.480 --> 29:42.800
ProvadoVPN's network was built from the ground up and fully optimized for lightning fast speed.

29:42.800 --> 29:48.480
So visit ProvadoVPN.com.ssh and try it out right now for free.

29:48.480 --> 29:52.800

29:52.800 --> 29:58.720
as well as 10 gigabytes a month of data transfer and access to the top 12 servers for one device.

And all ProvadoVPN users get access to their dedicated team of customer support.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.560
It's 24 seven.

30:04.560 --> 30:07.280
And they also have an unlimited plan with hundreds of servers,

30:07.280 --> 30:09.600
P2P traffic support and more.

30:09.600 --> 30:14.240
So go check it all out at ProvadoVPN.com.ssh.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.560
So I mean, if you buy a Chromecast or whatever,

30:18.560 --> 30:22.080
then sometimes you have to like connect to an access point and then like your phone.

30:22.080 --> 30:27.280
And then sometimes it crashes and you're like lost and you don't know how to set up the Wi-Fi.

30:27.280 --> 30:31.760
So we're building a Bluetooth spec that is going to be built into ESP home.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.520
It's going to be built into the Home Assistant apps.

30:33.520 --> 30:38.320
So if you buy it, well, I mean, if eventually we hope you're going to be

30:38.320 --> 30:39.760
able to buy ESP home products.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.600
But if you build an ESP home product and you give it to your friend,

30:43.600 --> 30:45.760
they will just be able to go on with Bluetooth.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.040
And we even have a web Bluetooth SDK, so you can use like a Chrome browser

30:49.680 --> 30:50.720
to actually just set it up.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.640
Oh, that is cool.

30:53.440 --> 30:54.640
Yeah, right.

30:54.640 --> 30:59.040
And I mean, I think I really want like, you know, they're like on tindy.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.640
People are selling their creations.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.920
I just want like more of that because those products are way cooler.

31:04.480 --> 31:07.920
Like, it's just like, you know, we had the tech reader last year

31:07.920 --> 31:11.360
and there's like actually for the energy meters in the Netherlands,

31:12.160 --> 31:14.400
they actually have a protocol called P1.

31:14.400 --> 31:17.120
And we're going to have an ESP home based device somebody's building

31:17.120 --> 31:20.640
that like, you know, people can just plug it in and boom,

31:20.640 --> 31:23.040
all the energy data is available in Home Assistant.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.320
So I'm sure you do.

31:24.320 --> 31:30.080
But do you realize just how perfectly positioned you are to uniquely so to do this?

31:30.800 --> 31:32.720
No, no, definitely, definitely.

31:32.720 --> 31:36.080
It's because, you know, ESP home, like we acquired it.

31:36.080 --> 31:40.080
Maybe because like the original founder was like burned out and,

31:40.080 --> 31:42.720
but he was still getting like all these donations, right?

31:42.720 --> 31:46.960
So we couldn't really say, hey, we're going to hire somebody full time to make this great.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.280
So we acquired it from him.

31:49.280 --> 31:54.320
We have now Jesse working on a full time and like, you know, just we keep,

31:54.320 --> 31:55.760
you know, pumping out cool stuff.

31:56.880 --> 32:00.800
Yeah, a full time employee is going to, you know, they've got some time to fill.

32:00.800 --> 32:06.800
You know, it's, yeah, well, the thing is, because we're so big, like, you know,

32:06.800 --> 32:08.720
we are 13 people full time now.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.080
And yeah, thanks.

32:12.640 --> 32:13.440
Lucky 13.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.400
But the thing is, they work all over the place, right?

32:18.400 --> 32:22.400
Like we have the operating system guy, we have the supervisor people,

32:22.400 --> 32:23.920
we have the front end people.

32:23.920 --> 32:28.080
And so we're actually very thinly spread because there's just so much happening.

32:28.960 --> 32:29.600
For sure.

32:29.600 --> 32:33.040
Yeah, yeah, it's both a lot of people from when you started at one,

32:33.040 --> 32:37.840
but it's also not a lot of people for the scope of work there is out there.

32:37.840 --> 32:38.320
Exactly.

32:38.960 --> 32:42.480
Can you even imagine how many people, you know, a commercial entity,

32:42.480 --> 32:46.640
let's just hypothetically say you are owned by EA or some,

32:46.640 --> 32:49.120
some massive conglomerate like that, right?

32:49.120 --> 32:52.800
How many people would they employ to write a piece of software like Home Assistant?

32:52.800 --> 32:56.000
And it's just, to me, that speaks to the power of open source, right?

32:56.000 --> 32:59.600
I mean, we definitely couldn't, we couldn't have things in the world like Home Assistant

32:59.600 --> 33:00.640
without open source.

33:00.640 --> 33:01.920
So, no, I think so.

33:01.920 --> 33:07.200
I mean, there's just, you know, we, if you, we get people from like all over the place

33:07.200 --> 33:10.000
that are brilliant programmers, but they have their day jobs.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.160
And like, you know, it's, it's funny.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.600
We have a couple of people.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.920
One is a CEO of a company.

33:15.920 --> 33:18.160
The other is like a director of software engineering.

33:18.160 --> 33:22.320
So he's like a manager and like, they just don't get to code at work anymore, right?

33:22.320 --> 33:27.360
So they come home and they're like, well, yeah, absolutely.

33:27.360 --> 33:27.680
I agree.

33:27.680 --> 33:33.040
And also those sorts of people who have had a lot of training in programming and stuff

33:33.040 --> 33:34.320
like that in the past.

33:35.920 --> 33:40.480
They've got a lot that they can bring to the table, but their motivation might be sporadic

33:40.480 --> 33:45.280
and, you know, it's not really suitable to do a full-time job that way, but absolutely

33:45.280 --> 33:49.360
can contribute, you know, a couple of weeks worth of evenings of your brain to an open

33:49.360 --> 33:50.400
source project.

33:50.400 --> 33:54.560
Well, that, I mean, that's how our core was originally all on threads and like we had

33:54.560 --> 33:56.240
like deadlocks all the time.

33:56.240 --> 34:00.320
And then somebody came along who was, who works in Mozilla and he had a lot of Python

34:00.320 --> 34:00.880
experience.

34:00.880 --> 34:07.600
He made like pylons in the past and yeah, he, he rewrote our core to async and that's

34:07.600 --> 34:08.640
what we still run today.

34:08.640 --> 34:09.760
And that's why we're so fast.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.800
So that's just a random guy that came along.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.400
You know what else I love as well about the number of people you've just shared work

34:16.400 --> 34:21.920
from Nebuchadnezzar is the fact that that means that somebody like a Mozilla isn't

34:21.920 --> 34:25.200
needed to come out and buy you out to keep you sustainable.

34:25.200 --> 34:28.880
It's, it's a self-sustaining funding model you've created here.

34:28.880 --> 34:29.920
I think that's great too.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.280
No, it's been really great.

34:31.280 --> 34:36.240
I think, you know, we have no investors and no loans and these kind of stuff because it

34:36.240 --> 34:38.000
misaligns incentives, right?

34:38.000 --> 34:40.160
Just, you know, they want like return on investment.

34:41.440 --> 34:41.680
Yeah.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.600
I mean, it's, it's, it's working great so far.

34:43.600 --> 34:49.600
I mean, I expect as the pandemic like wheeze off that maybe people are spending less time

34:49.600 --> 34:52.240
at home, maybe spending less time on home assistance, who knows?

34:53.120 --> 34:54.960
But they might need remote access.

34:54.960 --> 35:01.760
That's you know, I mean, I, I happily, happily pay that because I think it's a, not only

35:01.760 --> 35:06.320
is it a fantastic service and I like how you are implementing it, but I also appreciate

35:06.320 --> 35:11.440
sort of the virtuous cycle of it incentivizes the company to make home assistance better,

35:11.440 --> 35:14.320
which just continues to drive more value to my subscription.

35:14.320 --> 35:18.320
And it, it's legitimately one of those arrangements that I happily pay.

35:18.320 --> 35:19.360
That's awesome.

35:19.360 --> 35:19.600
Yeah.

35:19.600 --> 35:19.840
Same.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.040
I don't really need it.

35:21.040 --> 35:26.640
I could quite happily set up my own reverse proxy with WireGuard and I used to, and then

35:26.640 --> 35:27.920
Nebu Kassek came along.

35:27.920 --> 35:32.000
That's the origin of the name, by the way, that, that word Nebu is, is quite unusual.

35:32.000 --> 35:39.520
So Nebu is, it was some God of the wisdom in some, somewhere in some religion or language.

35:39.520 --> 35:42.960
And so then we had like the word, yeah.

35:42.960 --> 35:43.680
Okay.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.280
I like it.

35:45.280 --> 35:48.000
And then we also have the URL, nebu.kassek, right?

35:48.000 --> 35:51.840
Cause that actually, we, we kind of set it on Nebu and then I was looking at domains

35:51.840 --> 35:54.720
and all of a sudden I said Nebu Kassek and I was like, that's it.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.920
So it's essentially comes down to Wise House.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.280
Is that a trade?

35:59.280 --> 36:00.000
That's great.

36:00.000 --> 36:00.560
That is good.

36:00.560 --> 36:00.800
Yeah.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.000
And now we're, we're waiting.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.200
Razer had a smartwatch called Nebu in 2015 or 16 or something.

36:07.200 --> 36:10.720
I was just waiting for their trademark to lapse and then maybe we can

36:13.040 --> 36:15.440
Get a little more, a little more mileage out of that name.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.320
That's great.

36:16.320 --> 36:21.040
I mean, I know, I know lawyers are, have a reputation, but can you confuse a house

36:21.040 --> 36:23.200
automation system and a watch?

36:24.240 --> 36:27.760
You know, smartwatches, smartwatches you can talk to nowadays.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.080
And so, yeah.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.520
Who wants to even worry about a fight?

36:31.520 --> 36:32.640
Why just, yeah.

36:32.640 --> 36:32.880
Yeah.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.040
But boss, thank you so much for joining us and updating in on these things.

36:37.040 --> 36:41.840
And also thank you and thanks to the team for making a piece of software

36:41.840 --> 36:45.440
that has improved my family's quality of life on a daily basis.

36:45.440 --> 36:49.120
I just, not much actually touches our lives in that way.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.640
So we're just really grateful for that too.

36:50.640 --> 36:50.960
Awesome.

36:50.960 --> 36:51.600
Well, you're welcome.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.880
So I hope you enjoyed that interview with Paulus.

36:54.880 --> 36:59.040
Now we're not going to actually do any feedback this week, just in the interest of time.

36:59.040 --> 37:01.760
But next episode, we're going to discuss the

37:02.480 --> 37:06.400
distributed file system question that Chris posed last week.

37:06.400 --> 37:09.680
We've had lots of feedback in the mailbag about that one.

37:09.680 --> 37:13.040
Oh, I can't wait to see what people have suggested.

37:13.040 --> 37:17.760
I feel like I'd be cheating if I read ahead, but now I kind of want to go in there and take a look.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.240
But I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for the show.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.000
So that way my reaction is fresh.

37:22.000 --> 37:22.560
Awesome.

37:22.560 --> 37:22.800
Yeah.

37:22.800 --> 37:28.800
