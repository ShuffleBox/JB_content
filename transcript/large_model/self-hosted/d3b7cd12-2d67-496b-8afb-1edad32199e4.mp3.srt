1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Coming up on the show, I review Home Assistant's new dedicated hardware, Alex is literally buried

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,880
in computers, and our favorite Google Docs killer has a big update. I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,040
And I'm Alex, and this is Self Hosted.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:21,040
Oh, Chris, I am surrounded by computer parts. I mean, literally, I could open a shop right now.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,360
I've got every single computer I own in pieces right now.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,240
I feel your pain. I am surrounded in laptop parts at the moment.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,320
Is that because of the XPS reviews you're doing?

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,080
Yeah, I have a couple of machines in for review at the moment, plus a personal server project that

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,640
I'm working on. And then I was moving offices, and I had all of the different screws neatly

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,520
organized for each laptop case. And my daughter came in and said, what are these, daddy? And

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,160
mixed them.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,800
Oh, no.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,040
Mixed them all.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,320
Screws to the worst as well.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,960
Yeah.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
Particularly laptop-sized ones.

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,840
What are you deep in projects over there, several at a time?

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,520
Yeah, that's just it. So I built a system around the UNAZ and QuickSync a little while ago,

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,800
but I decided that I wanted something that was a little more future-proof in terms of expansion

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,560
and stuff like that. And the ITX board that the UNAZ case can fit only has one PCI port,

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,520
which is taken up with the HBA disk expansion card that I have.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,240
Right.

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,240
Right. And so if I wanted to put, say, OpenCent as a VM on top of Proxmox, I don't have any

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,640
PCI ports to add an extra NIC to the motherboard. So anyway, I decided to take my desktop motherboard

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,720
and put it into my Rosewill server case that was housing my dual Xeon system. Basically,

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,880
all this comes as a result of me finally deciding to break up with my dual Xeon system and go

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,040
all in on QuickSync. It's worked really well for the last month or so as I've been testing

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,480
it in the UNAZ build. So I'm going all in. My Home Lab is going to be an i5-8500,

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,960
and my NAS is going to be also an i5-8500. So yeah, I'll have two of those QuickSync-capable

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,080
systems in the house. And the idea is that I've got one system that is just sort of

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,520
always on, bulletproof, and is running Blueiris and Home Assistant and DNS, separate from the

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,440
storage, which will be running on the other system, which is housing Plex and media apps

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,840
and that kind of stuff. Because the one you take offline most of all is the one with the hard

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,800
drives in it. And it's not like I take it offline a lot, but when I do, it takes everything out

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,880
because I've got, you know, all of my services running on one box. So it's been a pain because

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,440
I've had to move all of my desktop out of its case and my server out of its case and my...

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,360
It's just, I've got literally four or five computers worth of parts around me and I'm

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,960
selling stuff off to people and it's, it's nuts. And doing the day job all off a laptop

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,560
in the meantime, I suppose. Yes. Yeah. And the worst part is my IRC bouncer for Red Hat is

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,960
currently in pieces on the table behind me. So I haven't been on IRC all day, which has been a bit bad.

41
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,480
I was moving offices recently and like literally like my priority was get the desktop reset up,

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,280
get everything connected, get it powered on. It's gotta be online. The best part was as well that

43
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,200
my laptop decided it was going to screw up and I had to reinstall that today as well. So I've,

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,280
I've completely nuked and paved seemingly everything in this house and I'm starting from

45
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,640
scratch. So that's going to be fun. I haven't yet found out what I've forgotten to back up yet,

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,520
but I'm sure there'll be something. And days of setting small little things up as it always goes.

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,320
Yeah. Just before we were recorded, for example, I'd turn off turbo boost on my Mac so that the

48
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,480
fans weren't spinning up. Oh, Max. Well, let's take a moment and say that this episode is brought to

49
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,880
you by the all new cloud guru, the leader in learning for the cloud for Linux and other modern

50
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,040
tech skills. They have hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs. So get certified,

51
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,400
get hired and get learning at a cloud guru.com. One of the things I have in my new office is a

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,600
bench for projects and I have the new home assistant blue hardware on there, which I'm

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,480
going to be talking about in a little bit in the show. But in the meantime, before we get there,

54
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,280
Alex and I kind of wanted to do a PSA on the show and talk a moment about hedge doc, which might be

55
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,480
a solution for anyone out there who wants a really modern Google docs alternative that you can self

56
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,960
host. And it happens to be an excellent Markdown editor. Real-time collaborative editing for

57
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,640
Markdown documents. It's great. You know, we've used it at JB now for how long? Two years?

58
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,160
Three? Yeah. So it's, it's stood the test of time, battle tested in, in production, air quotes.

59
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,200
You use it for all the LUP show notes as well and stuff like that. And you and Wes use it and

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,160
we use it for all the shows. And now I use it for a lot of my notes, just for JB stuff in general.

61
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,800
It's the project for formerly known as Cody MD. They went through a name change, uh, to annoy,

62
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
just to avoid, um, like naming conflicts out there. Cause I guess there was another project

63
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,240
that's had a similar name. And so now it's called hedge doc and it lets you just easily collaborate

64
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,560
on Markdown documents. And all you really have to do is get started and you just share a link

65
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,280
with somebody and now they're in and they can start editing. And then if you create an account,

66
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,920
you get kind of like a document library and it'll, it supports things like tags, which we don't use

67
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,280
a lot, but it supports things that allow you to recall documents pretty quickly or categorize

68
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,040
documents. It also does real time rendering of that Markdown so you can see what you're writing in

69
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,680
real time. And then it gives you a bunch of a shortcuts. So maybe you don't remember how to do

70
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,480
a table in Markdown or embed an image. It's got a button for that as well. It does. Yeah. I didn't

71
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:47,520
know that right along, right along the top there. Yeah. And, uh, Alex, you recently reset it up for

72
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,080
us cause we were on an older Cody MD instance. Yeah, that's right. There's nothing more permanent

73
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,880
than a temporary solution, right? Yeah. Wes threw it up on a, was it a droplet or something a couple

74
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,680
of years ago? We wanted to test it for an episode of Linux unplugged or something like that. And

75
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,120
then we liked it so much, we just kept using it. That's right. And it was, uh, it was just hanging

76
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,920
out on an open port with no TLS or anything. So I've been wanting to fix that for a while. So when

77
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,800
I saw the renaming come through on the Linux server image, I was just like, yes, here's my excuse to

78
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,320
push it to Chris and say, I can do it. Yep. So, uh, yeah, Wes sent me the database. He, uh, zipped

79
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,960
up the, uh, the Docker app data volume that stores, you know, the database and stuff like that, uh,

80
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:40,480
span it up in a container on Linode, uh, with, you know, just SCP the tar.gz file across, unzipped

81
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:47,040
it, pointed the container at the correct directory. And, uh, I think it uses Postgres on the backend

82
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,680
our setup, uh, all the infrastructure by the way is open sourced on the, uh, self-hosted infra wiki,

83
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,480
not wiki, uh, GitHub, GitHub repo. Um, but yeah, it just came straight up, you know, there was,

84
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,200
there was no drama. The only slightly tricky bit was that you own the domain name and we had to

85
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,080
point the name service for the domain name at my Cloudflare account so that we could get TLS

86
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,720
through traffic working with, uh, the DNS challenge. Yeah, but I love what we ended up with. Um, it's

87
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,920
a cute little URL. That's easy for the team to remember and it makes it possible to share easily

88
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,960
with anybody and they'll, they'll remember it as well. So I think it turned out to be a pretty nice

89
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,960
setup and maybe the perfect time to migrate. I mean, it seems like it was nearly flawless

90
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,400
to import a somewhat stale Kodi MD database right into HedgeDog.

91
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,680
So if you're, if you're using Kodi MD today, it's probably a good time to upgrade because that,

92
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,920
that migration is pretty simple right now. Easy peasy. Yeah. There's a couple of options for

93
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,280
containers that you could use. Linux server, of course, make a container for this one. Um,

94
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,920
they've migrated over from Kodi MD to HedgeDog, but I actually ended up for our installation here

95
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,160
using the one that the development team now provide. This is the thing about Linux server is

96
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,480
a lot of their images make projects popular enough that the devs go, Oh, we've got lots of people

97
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,120
using it in Docker. And then the projects themselves start providing an image. And

98
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,400
generally speaking, I will keep using the Linux server image until I have good reason to switch.

99
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,080
And the, uh, the migration seemed like the, like a perfect excuse, as you say. So, yeah,

100
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,360
we're running out of the official HedgeDog image and yeah, it just works and there's nothing more

101
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,520
really to say about that. It's the best kind of tool because admittedly, it takes a little more

102
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,720
skillset and a little more effort than just going and signing up for a Google doc for, you know,

103
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,560
signing into a Google docs account and using Google docs. Like it takes a little more effort

104
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,120
than that, but we own this it's self-hosted and we get to have fun with the domain because of that.

105
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,360
We get to, we get to just sort of own the entire stack and that's great because it's

106
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,640
a tool we use every single day, six days a week to produce the shows.

107
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,440
And replicate the data from the backend to a local endpoint that so it's, it's completely

108
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,520
backed up offline so that if for any reason that Linode ever had a problem, we're good to go.

109
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:23,680
Linode.com slash SSH go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account and support the show.

110
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,400
Like Alex was saying, they are our cloud server provider. We have the wiki on there.

111
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,040
PerfectMediaServer.com is on their hedge docs on there and a lot more. We have the matrix server

112
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,800
on there. We have our casting coding server, next cloud, a lot of our backend infrastructure

113
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,640
and new things that we're working on that we haven't even announced. We're hosting them all

114
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,880
on Linode. And personally, one of the things that I think is great about Linode is all the

115
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,400
distributions they support. So whatever environment you're comfortable working in,

116
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:57,040
even the Alpines, Arch, recent CentOS releases, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, several versions of

117
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,360
Ubuntu, on and on and on. But what I really like about Linode is you can tell when a company is

118
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,400
passionate about the actual technology. And I think people listening to the show probably get

119
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,080
that when you, when you're passionate about the technology, you have the insight into what it's

120
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:19,040
capable of. And that's why Linode started in 2003 as one of the very first companies to

121
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,840
as one of the very first companies in something we weren't even really calling cloud computing yet.

122
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:30,560
That was three years before AWS even started. And now they're the largest independent cloud provider

123
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,280
and you can get a $100 credit and play with infrastructure that's professional grade with

124
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,400
native SSDs, 40 gigabit connections to the hypervisors, 11 data centers around the world,

125
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:49,920
object storage, node balancers, a really nice clean dashboard. You can get started

126
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,960
at linode.com slash SSH. You go there, get that $100, 60 day credit towards a new account

127
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,520
and support the show. It's linode.com slash SSH.

128
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,600
Alright then, why don't you tell me about this Home Assistant Blue Box. I've been pretty jealous,

129
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,280
honestly, since I heard you got yours.

130
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,560
You know, it's real. I was watching the Home Assistant conference when they announced it and

131
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,760
I ordered one as fast as I could. A lot of other people did too because the order page was having

132
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:25,040
issues. But it is a small, tiny, I mean, it's not as small as a Raspberry Pi, but it's smaller than

133
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,360
a NUC or any kind of desktop PC. And it is a dedicated Home Assistant box and it's called

134
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,600
the Home Assistant Blue. It's a six core ARM processor system. It has four gigs of DDR4 RAM

135
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:45,600
and a big upgrade over the Raspberry Pi 4 is it comes with 128 gigabytes of eMMC storage.

136
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,440
Plus, of course, there's other ways to expand that like through USB because it has four USB 3.0

137
00:11:51,440 --> 00:12:00,720
ports on the sucker, as well as an Ethernet and full HDMI out. And it's really well built, Alex.

138
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,960
It's very, very solid. I would feel comfortable with this strapped to the RV going down the road

139
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:14,720
for years. On the inside or the outside? Definitely the inside. But the top is a nice blue aluminum.

140
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,520
They've made it look really nice with a classy white version of the Home Assistant logo.

141
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:25,520
And the bottom is an integrated heat sink system. Oh, neat. How big is it? It's about four inches

142
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:34,160
wide and about I'd say about an inch and a half high at its peak, maybe because it's kind of got

143
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,560
an arched shape to the case. And it's about half a pound in weight. So it's just over half a pound.

144
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,600
So it's got a really solid, hefty feel to it. So it's like what, a couple of CD cases stacked

145
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,720
on top of each other? Yeah, with a little bit of an arch at the top of it. And what's really

146
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,040
at the heart of this thing is an Odroid N2 Plus. That's really what this is. I've noted that the

147
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,640
Home Assistant team has mentioned the Odroid N2 Plus a few times, and it seemed to be one of the

148
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,320
favorite devices of one of the primary Home Assistant developers. So I think this box is kind

149
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,800
of like their favorite experience. It's the one that they personally test on. And so to say it's

150
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,920
well supported is an understatement. And so I think it was a natural fit for them to just bundle it

151
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,520
when they partnered up with a hardware provider. In terms of a smart home hub,

152
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,880
it's lacking a couple of things. So you need to add Z-Wave or Zigbee via USB, right? Yep. Although

153
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,040
that's the same kind of trade off you have with any of these other kind of arm boards, because

154
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,520
it's kind of competing, it's between something like a SmartThings Home Hub and a Raspberry Pi

155
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,240
DIY kit. It's like trying to live in that middle ground there. So remind me of the price then,

156
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,440
how much was it? It's listed for $140, but after all in for me with $21 and change of shipping,

157
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,720
it was $180 total to get this device. Oh, okay. I had a hundred in my mind for some reason,

158
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,640
but 180. Wow. Okay. That's getting up there. Well, okay. So I'll get to the value. So I'll,

159
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,480
you know, the first boot experience, they're trying to make it very out of the box friendly,

160
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,120
two steps to set up. You plug it in to your network and then go to your browser and you

161
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,760
type in homeassistant.local and it's supposed to just come up. But of course, that's not how it

162
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,080
works on my network. I already have a DNS and DHCP server set up and my system isn't going to start

163
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,680
resolving some new machine, but I was able to get the IP out of the DHCP log, pretty simple.

164
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Put that in, went to port 8123. And it's really at this point, it's a basic home assistant install.

165
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,440
It's really kind of just what you'd expect if you'd set up the home assistant suite with

166
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:47,360
supervisor and everything you create the first time account. But Alex, it feels fast. It definitely

167
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,000
feels noticeably faster in the UI than my raspberry PI for granted. It's a new, happy,

168
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,320
fresh install, but I've set up home assistant enough times on the PI to know what it feels

169
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,920
like. And I can tell you with confidence, this thing absolutely feels faster.

170
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
Are you SD card based in the PI then?

171
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,000
USB. So it is on a disc.

172
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,800
Oh really?

173
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,040
Yeah.

174
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,080
That's interesting then.

175
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,400
I think it's just got a little more horsepower and I think the developers are optimizing for

176
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,200
this thing. That's why when we talk about the value, so I'd say rounded off to $200

177
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:25,760
or just under $200 just as a concept price point. Well, what is a totally local,

178
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,960
merges all the different vendors together with no subscription and is completely under your control

179
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:40,880
standalone box worth. See to me, home assistant is one of the few open source projects that has

180
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:48,240
changed my life at the level that like say Linux has. Where it has changed the quality of life

181
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:56,160
for my entire family. And I also use it here at the studio to help with remote presence and other

182
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,480
like, you know, just light management in the studio. And so it also helps in a professional

183
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,160
capacity. So $200 for a dedicated box. It's really fast. It feels very well built. I mean,

184
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,640
it feels like a polished product. That is also supporting home assistant development at the same

185
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,880
time when I buy it. I feel like that's, you know, under $200. It is a good value for this. And I

186
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,240
think I'm actually going to buy another one. I'm going to buy one for the studio. Cause this is

187
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,720
what I set this one up for. I wasn't sure if I was ready to deploy my serious, serious home

188
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,880
assistant set up yet. So I put it in production here at the studio where it's, it's kind of

189
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,920
important, but honestly, like I could recreate it in a day. You know what I mean? It's that level of,

190
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:43,040
but at home, like I just, I mean, I would take a snapshot and I would restore the snapshot,

191
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,320
but it just has to be perfect at home because it literally impacts our quality of life. So I wanted

192
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,760
to take it slow and I wasn't sure if I was ready to replace my raspberry pie. But I am a believer

193
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,760
in having home assistant on its own dedicated host, either being a VM or on hardware. And I

194
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,360
don't necessarily think having it live alongside a lot of my other services in Docker while trying

195
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,720
to also use the supervisor is a good long-term strategy. Like in there, it gives me errors about

196
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,760
being on an unsupported OS all the time. And I look at the development trajectory and I think

197
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,160
if they're selling these machines and they are themselves are developing, like you have to

198
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,480
imagine the developers all have these or will all have these, that's likely where they're going to

199
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,920
invest a lot of their time and energy. And they're going to be developing with a mindset that they're

200
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:33,440
doing it on a dedicated host. When I look at the power draw for this thing and I look at the, you

201
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,720
know, I got to always do that math. Like if I bring a box in, I really have to be aware of what it's

202
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,560
going to take because I want to be able to go off grid. I want to be able to survive on solar power

203
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,520
alone, which means I got to extend the life of my batteries as long as possible. And that's

204
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,600
possible. And this thing under load, and I'm not, you know, I didn't, I didn't do extensive testing

205
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,520
here, but it went, it was right in line with what their specs were six Watts. That's pretty

206
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,000
remarkable. Six Watts. Wow. Yeah. And, and around idle, it was around two Watts, sometimes two and

207
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,040
a half Watts. I only really started testing it today. So I want to do more extensive testing,

208
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,440
like, because it's a pretty simple home assistant install, but I was monitoring it during the first

209
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,600
load and getting all that stuff like first set up. And I monitored a little bit under, under just

210
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,600
sitting there idle, you know, just like kind of just daily, just sitting there running. That's

211
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,880
what I noted. And I went and checked and I looked up their specs for this, for this board. And that's

212
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,080
exactly what it's in line with the specs. Pretty sure my garage door opener uses more than six

213
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,600
Watts just sat there doing nothing all day. I know there's power bricks that just sit there and

214
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,320
plugged into the wall that use more than two Watts. Yeah. So we'll see, because that's the,

215
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,800
that's the big deal breaker is if that ends up being a higher, higher load wattage that would be,

216
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,360
that'd be a deal breaker. But at this point, I think plugging in a device that would be using

217
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,480
around six Watts would be kind of just lost in the wash. I don't think I'm really going to notice

218
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,400
that on my runtime. So I think it means from a power budget standpoint, I can put this thing

219
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,280
in production. I think, I think I'm going to get another one. You do like highly available

220
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,800
single board computers though, don't you? So there is something to this. You could,

221
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,520
you know, if a guy really wanted, he could buy two of these. I'm not saying he should,

222
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,040
but he could and just keep one in the drawer. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And keep a snapshot somewhere.

223
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,520
And if one pops you in, in 35 seconds, you pull it out. All the plugs are all the same.

224
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,920
You swap it in and you restore the snapshot and you're back in business.

225
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,960
Well, if ever there is a use case for a literal plug and play appliance,

226
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,800
it's your smart home hub. Yeah. And this is version one, right? And maybe even, and I'm not,

227
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,120
I'm not knocking it when I say this, but maybe it's even version 0.5 because I have a sense

228
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,320
this kind of came along during the year and it's, it's, it's a really good, it's a really good first,

229
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,560
first start, but I could see future ones that maybe have things like Zigbee or Z-Wave or,

230
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,960
or whatever this new conglomerate standard is that I can't remember.

231
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Makes me think of the XKCD comic.

232
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,640
Yeah. Just one more standard, Alex. That's all we need.

233
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,440
There are 12 standards. We should have one that unifies them all.

234
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
Okay. Now we have 13 standards. Great.

235
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,720
Also, like, you know, one that has wifi built in. I don't know how they would handle it with the,

236
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,800
the metal housing, because I think the casing is providing some heat transfer.

237
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,800
It's mostly cool to the touch. The bottom is warm, but that's, that's kind of expected.

238
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,400
It's a heat sink. Is, is wifi the right kind of expectation to set for reliability for this type

239
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,160
of device though? Probably in that light, it's probably a good thing. They at least didn't put

240
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,400
it in 1.0. Right. I'll tell you one thing that I am just a little concerned about, and I'd be

241
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:53,360
really curious to see how this actually plays out in the long-term for you, is eMMC write endurance

242
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,400
is not famously very good. So I'd be curious to see how Home Assistant, which writes a lot of data

243
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,160
to that database all the time will be, you know, in, in a year or two's time, whether it'll have

244
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:12,080
burnt through that flash or not. Yeah. And I wouldn't be surprised if they have a way to

245
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,320
switch it to USB storage. Cause I do remember there being some discussion about that during

246
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,120
the product launch, but going through like the first time setup process, there's nothing that

247
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,760
prompts you to store it anywhere else. You know, it's all on that eMMC. I got bitten with a PF

248
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,480
sense box. Uh, this was, um, one of the APU 1D boxes, I think several years ago, I didn't move

249
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:40,400
the logs off of the, uh, M SATA SSD. So obviously M SATA is different to eMMC, but just to, you

250
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,320
know, a related comment really that if you don't move logs off of SSDs, they can wear out pretty

251
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,480
quickly. Yeah. I had a free NAS box that had the eMMC finally die on it. It was a really old one.

252
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,360
It was like an appliance version that somebody pre-built. And, um, that's when I learned that

253
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,920
those things have a limit. Actually, that's when I learned that it was actually even using eMMC

254
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,560
and then I learned they had a limit. So you're right. That's a good thing to keep an eye on.

255
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,200
I'm also gonna, if I was going to put it in production, I would prefer to have all of the

256
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,600
home assistant data and anything that needs a lot of read, write on external storage. I mean,

257
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,240
the thing has plenty of USB ports. I want to take a moment and mention that a cloud guru has

258
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,680
learn Docker by doing, which is a course that gives you a series of hands-on labs that are

265
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:15,760
Isn't that amazing? That's so good. That's exactly what I was thinking of when I was

266
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,600
talking about it that who, do you know who sent that in? Because it's, it's pure amazement.

267
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,120
I do. Yeah. Someone on the discord with the username. Oh yeah.

268
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,960
Yeah. That's perfect. Actually. Wow. Yeah. I really liked that. Yeah. I could see it. Alex,

269
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,760
you know, you and I, in another reality, we're just two morning am DJs talking about people's

270
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,720
tech problems and telling people about the morning commute and the traffic. Yeah. Yes.

271
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,960
Let's come to the chopper. We'd be good at it. I think though, you know, are we silly enough?

272
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,720
Your whole bit would be like a silly face holding a coffee cup, right? And mine,

273
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,560
my thing would be hats, but it's a radio show. So it only worked in the promotional material.

274
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,040
We had a question from gone in a flash on Twitter and he asked, I'm thinking about retiring my

275
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,960
Docker on rancher OS setup as it doesn't support Docker compose. What's the most supported and

276
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,800
easy way to manage an alternative Docker system? Is it something on Ubuntu? Is that light and small

277
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,800
as possible? Thanks. Gone in a flash. So he wants to move off of rancher OS and embrace the Docker

278
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,720
composed lifestyle and is wondering what the simplest minimalist stack is. That's a hard

279
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,720
question to answer because we don't know exactly what his use case is. What would you go though?

280
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,920
What would you, what would be your go-to perfect media server.com? Yeah. That's an Ubuntu base,

281
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:41,200
right? Yeah. So I, I, I based that off of Ubuntu 20, a four. I use an answerable role by Geeling

282
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,720
guy, uh, to install Docker. Uh, although you could of course just install Docker, however you like,

283
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,440
uh, install Docker compose and that's it. You done really isn't a lot to it.

284
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,640
I think it's funny that this is coming from a Red Hat employee. If anybody ever needed proof that,

285
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,080
uh, Alex is independent and speaks his mind, uh, there you have it. But I think that's a

286
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,720
fantastic setup too, because the community support is huge. The free five-year patches from Canonical

287
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,120
on an LTS are pretty tough to beat at this point. Um, there's other, there's other games in town,

288
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,960
but yeah. Well, I've avoided commenting on the whole Centos thing quite deliberately because

289
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:28,000
obviously Red Hat pay my mortgage, but you know, I feel somewhat vindicated in my choice of using

290
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,520
Ubuntu for my personal systems and keeping that separation between work and pleasure, uh, with

291
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,880
all this news. So, uh, it's, it's been an interesting time. I know this is what nobody wants

292
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,400
to hear right now because it's just too damn reasonable and low key, but I will go on record

293
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:51,440
right now in, in early 2021 and say that I bet you Centos stream makes for an excellent containers

294
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,520
platform. If you wanted to run Docker or Podman, I, uh, uh, Centos could make a great host OS

295
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,880
because I mean, what was the thing that people loved about core OS? It was essentially rolling

296
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,120
updates at an enterprise scale for an enterprise distribution to run your containers. And what's

297
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,280
Centos stream now? It's going to be a consistently updated, rolling enterprise grade distribution

298
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:22,160
that can run your containers. I think it's worth considering going down that route, especially if

299
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,160
you work with Red Hat systems, but otherwise I just really have to agree with Alex. I think the

300
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,160
Ubuntu ecosystem makes for a fantastic home server because there's such a good community

301
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,880
support system out there. Canonical really has their eye on the ball when it comes to their LTS

302
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,400
releases and cloud support is just fantastic as well. You could, I mean, you could go with Debian

303
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,280
without much penalty. The reason that I go with Ubuntu really is for a couple of reasons. The

304
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:53,760
first is ZFS support baked right into the kernel that may or may not be important to you. The other

305
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,000
one is WireGuard support baked right in as well. So for both of those things, you only have to

306
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,200
install the user space tool. You don't have to do any DKMS modules or anything crazy like that.

307
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,440
You could do the same thing on Debian and arguably, you know, if you're a freedom respecting

308
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,480
person, like I purport to be, I should be running Debian everywhere, but I don't like DKMS. So I run

309
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,880
Ubuntu everywhere. And having seen a bit behind the curtain for the Ubuntu development process,

310
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,760
I am keenly aware of the kind of attention that Canonical puts into an LTS. It's not that they

311
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,560
don't put a lot of work into their other releases, but they really want to make sure that thing is

312
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,600
enterprise grade and supportable for the time that they're committed to support it. And that means it

313
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,480
just gets a level of polish and pass that maybe Debian 9 doesn't. I just wish they'd stop pushing

314
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,920
snaps. You know, it's such easy fodder for people when they come to me and say, Oh, you can't, you

315
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,800
can't, you shouldn't use Ubuntu because snaps are horrible. And you know, when I want to install

316
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,320
Docker, I don't want to install Docker as a snap. I just want it as a package and stuff. And I'm

317
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,360
like, yeah, well, yeah. I mean, you can go and grab the Docker Deb file from wherever you like

318
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,520
and install it, but the default is a snap. And as I always say, default is king. So yeah, I'm torn

319
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:16,240
on that. I myself don't prefer it, but I've also heard from audience members who dip their toes in

320
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,640
the next cloud for the first time because it was just a snap away and it was approachable for them.

321
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,480
And, you know, like we got that email from that one guy who set it up on a snap first and then

322
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,600
migrated it to a whole instance afterwards. I just don't like, I suppose, how a snap is

323
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,840
an Ubuntu canonical thing. It's, I don't know, I can't really explain it or articulate it very

324
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,320
well, but I feel like the packaging system should almost be vendor agnostic, which is kind of where

325
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,520
Docker really wins or containers in general really win.

326
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,400
containers do, yeah.

327
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,840
They'll just run on any Linux kernel. It doesn't really matter which.

328
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,400
Yeah, I think there is, there's some things that are always going to be vendor specific.

329
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,760
You know, Debian is always going to have apt and that's unique to them, you know,

330
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,560
Debian and Debian derivatives. But there's some things that people really want to be vendor neutral

331
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,360
in the Linux ecosystem. And it seems software distribution at that level is one of them.

332
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,280
And I also can appreciate that a lot of projects want to host their own repositories. And I think

333
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:19,040
that's what's really been nice for Flatpaks is you could host your own Flatpak repository. And,

334
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,240
you know, I think our audience understands why people might prefer that. You can't do that with

335
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,800
snaps.

336
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,840
I mean, they have their place, don't they? But then again, when I'm on my desktop, I'll run Arch.

337
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,160
Everything is just in one place. There's no installing repos. It's just all in the AUR.

338
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,520
Yeah.

339
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:42,080
If we could somehow get the AUR for every Linux distro, then problem solved, right?

340
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,800
It sounds silly, but I agree so much. It's so nice. Just, it's, I manage everything with Yay.

341
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,920
It's Yay for anything. And there's never any math of, is this going to be isolated? Is this a

342
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,720
Flatpak? Is this a snap? Is this an app image? Is this an out of date version? I never have any of

343
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,520
those questions.

344
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,200
And you don't even have to Google it. You just search in Yay first and not

345
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,280
times out of 10, you'll find it. It's so nice on the workstation side. Now here's the thing,

346
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,800
and I'll just wrap it up with this. Here's where I think snaps do play a role because I've seen

347
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,840
this side of it too, is in the business world, it generally works. If you have something that's of

348
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,520
a high value, like a piece of software, like Adobe might have or Blackmagic or whoever,

349
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,880
you want to talk to another company. You want to work with another company and you want to have a

350
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,360
legal relationship. And then you want to have like cross team relationships. So the packaging

351
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,760
people at Plex, for example, interface with the snap people at Canonical, and they actually have

352
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,600
a business to business relationship, Plex and Canonical. And there is a vendor relationship

353
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,040
there where I think just for Plex, they package for everything. But I think a lot of companies

354
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,760
like that kind of traditional relationship. And that's a role where snaps can really kind of be

355
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,760
more appealing to the commercial software industry because they can have an agreement with Canonical,

356
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,400
they can distribute via Canonical store. It works on most distributions and they are the ones that

357
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,920
can publish. I think that's really appealing to that type of business, but it just doesn't seem to

358
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:18,160
really be appealing to community use cases as much. Despite all that I just said about snaps,

359
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,520
I still use Ubuntu everywhere. So yeah, and you really learn the tricks, you know, you, you know,

360
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,120
you learn the tricks. I don't, I just, I follow the directions on the Docker site for getting

361
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,200
Docker set up really. I don't even use it from the repos. Yeah. Get.docker.com and then pipe

362
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,760
it to pseudo bash, right? You could do that. You definitely could. What could go wrong?

363
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,760
I thought maybe I should summarize like several emails we've gotten over the last couple of weeks

364
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,000
since we talked about power line networking, which just super brief follow up still working awesome.

365
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,200
I haven't even had to reset any of like the adapters or anything. They're still working great.

366
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,080
It's like having ethernet. It's so wonderful. It's just slightly slower. We have had a few people

367
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,800
write in that have told me I'll actually had a whole range of concerns like from the, from my

368
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,880
solar is going to generate too much interference, but of course they're separate systems to turning

369
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,400
my RV into a radio broadcast system. I don't think we've had a topic that has been quite so

370
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:14,240
feedback generating. Yeah, it's really, and a wide range of successes and failures, but there has been

371
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,120
one consistent theme and that is you got to go to the next level if you really want this to work

372
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,760
great. And that is checkout ethernet over coax. People have been writing that in for a couple of

373
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:32,160
weeks straight now and the action tech MOCA network adapter for ethernet over coax two pack has been

374
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:38,480
linked a couple of times and the word from these emails is it's night and day difference. Way

375
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,360
better. If you, if you've got coax pre run in your place, it's a way better route to go than power

376
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:50,320
over ethernet. Apparently haven't tested it myself. I do have a bit of coax, um, not in the areas where

377
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,920
I would want to have servers, but I do have a bit of coax in the RV. So maybe at some point it could

378
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,960
be useful. I could see maybe using it for like say a Nvidia shield hookup or something like that.

379
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,120
Say a Nvidia shield hookup or something where the TV is already at and that's where coax connection

380
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,520
is. I think that's a perfect use case. Something, I mean, a shield is not going to be using crazy

381
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,160
amounts of bandwidth, but the other thing to consider as well is that coax is a lot cheaper

382
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,440
than ethernet cable and it can be purchased a lot cheaper than weatherproof ethernet as well,

383
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,560
which is also, you know, if you want to run it from the attic, say down to your basement,

384
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,320
probably the easiest route is going to be out the side of the building and doing that with ethernet

385
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,560
could get expensive. So it's a definitely an interesting thing and it's not something I

386
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,600
considered before. So I don't know, maybe next house, I'll give it, I'll give it a whirl.

387
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,360
I'm going to keep it in my back pocket for a future project. And it hasn't, it has a cool

388
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,400
acronym too. MOCA, M O C A, MOCA, Moca Chino. So I kind of like it already. Sounds delicious.

389
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,080
If the reports from the email are true, it's like, if they say it's a gigabit,

390
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,040
it's a true gigabit. It's actually that fast or faster. I mean, people were saying you can get

391
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,480
them in 2.5 gigabit speed varieties as well. That does sound interesting. A special thank you to our
