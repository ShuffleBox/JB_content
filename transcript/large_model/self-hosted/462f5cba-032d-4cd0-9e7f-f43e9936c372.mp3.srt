1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
I said I wouldn't do it until it was at least 10,000 miles old, but here I am at seven and a

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:12,000
half thousand miles. I just tuned my Golf R. Okay, now when you say tune, there's like a couple of

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,280
different ways to interpret that when you're talking about the Golf, because they have several

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,240
levels of tuning, there's software tuning. You got to break it down for me. It's weird, right? So

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,200
people say, oh, I've gone stage one, I've gone stage two, all this kind of stuff. So I've gone

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:32,960
stage one with an equilibrium tune. I was at a car show at the weekend at the local tuning house

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,560
in Raleigh, Black Forest Industries. I took the R32 down there and exhibited that off in their kind

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,160
of main like exhibitor area. And I took the R down there as well. And nobody was interested in that

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,600
one because it's too new and too common. But I got talking to a few guys about tuning options and

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,320
stuff like that. And someone was selling what's called a cob access port. This is a tiny little

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:03,280
cell phone sized computer that you plug into the OBD2 port of your car. I then paid $175 to a

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,800
company called Equilibrium Tuning to purchase a staged tune map. So what they do is they go into

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,920
the ECU and they remap all the valve timings and injections and all that kind of stuff. And so it

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:24,800
takes the car from being a 280 horsepower car to being a 370 horsepower car with no hardware mods

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:32,000
required. No way. It's insane. That's remarkable. I did something similar to my RV and I think I

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,120
got like a 10 horsepower improvement. 10. These four cylinder, two liter turbo engines that are

17
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,800
in the Golf, it's the same engine as is in your GTI. The only difference with the R is there's

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,520
an uprated turbo. It's a bit of a bigger turbo. And the R is all wheel drive versus your front

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,720
wheel drive. I tell you, if you've never got into tuning and you want to talk to someone about it

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,720
and you've been thinking about it, I would love to talk to you on Discord. I won't take up too much

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,000
more of the show about it. But just to say I'm giddy with excitement with the possibilities that

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,520
this has unlocked for me. Yeah, that's amazing. And so can I flash my GTI with a software update

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,520
in theory and see some sort of improvement too? Yeah. Oh, man. Oh, boy, it's getting dangerous.

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,680
I think it's just about as much horsepower as you'd want with a two wheel drive car. But of

25
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,400
course, what do I know? But to me, it seems like it seems like if you get much more, I'd want to

26
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:32,320
go all wheel drive. That's so awesome. I remember when I flashed my RV's ECU, it was a drive that

27
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,880
you were driving a bus. It felt like I was driving more of a truck. That was a nice improvement just

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,760
because the biggest change for me was it meant I could get on the on ramp. That's just it. Yeah.

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,200
Yeah. At speed. And you know, I just had her checked. It's been flashed for probably three

30
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,520
years now. And I just had her checked yesterday and she just passed all her checks. She's a

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,280
excellent, healthy as can be. Yeah. Made it back from California in one piece. Yeah, we did. And

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,920
now it's weird because we basically moved out to get some work done and I had to rip out the Wi-Fi

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,640
network. And of course, my, you know, my Raspberry Pi server died. So all of my services were down

34
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,800
and I had to shut down my Pi hole. And it's just strange. It doesn't quite feel like home anymore

35
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,080
because I don't have control over everything that I want. Home is where the Wi-Fi is, right?

36
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,200
Yeah. I don't have Wi-Fi. I don't have internet. It's so strange. So after tonight's episode,

37
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
after we're done recording tonight, I'm going to go home, I hope, and get like the Pi hole

38
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,280
and get the Wi-Fi back online. Well, I couldn't quite believe it when you messaged me this week

39
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,760
and said that your home assistant Yella has finally shown up. It's ridiculous. It's here

40
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,560
at perfect timing. It's perfect timing, right? Because the Raspberry Pi died on the road trip.

41
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,040
I get home from the road trip and the yellow's there on the porch waiting for me. I saw the

42
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,120
shipping notification. So I also ordered a one terabyte MVME stick. So I've already opened up

43
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,560
the yellow once and I've installed an MVME drive. I have a quick pile of hardware here, Alex. Before

44
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,560
I get to the yellow, I want to mention what I was going to use. This is a really cool piece of

45
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,280
hardware that's been ruggedized, industrialized, can get into super hot conditions. And it's an

46
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,520
Intel Atom system with QuickSync that's out of a Tesla solar wall that I picked up on the road

47
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,720
trip from a listener. It's decent. You could even run a full Linux desktop on it and it only takes

48
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,200
about five watts idle. So this is where I was considering going. The only problem with this

49
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,000
box, and I'm probably still going to use it. I love that it's DC too. And it's got two COM ports,

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,280
which is amazing. Is that an XT60 connector I see on the power cable? Yeah. Now I know who gave it

51
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,360
to you. Yeah. And I'm probably going to use this for something else, but it's such a cool little

52
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,920
box. I thought, okay, I've got an option now, right? So this was one of my options and it's

53
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:01,200
an X86 box. Good power draw. Then the yellow arrived. Now I have to say I'm very impressed.

54
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,120
I think the Home Assistant team did a good job with the case. I've taken it apart a couple of

55
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,760
times. It goes right back together. I can get access to it really quick. They have the logo

56
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,240
for Home Assistant ingrained in the casing. Laser etched up there. Yeah, it's nice. Yeah.

57
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,200
And all the ports are on the back. The compute modules just popped right in. My MVME popped

58
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,640
right in. I think this is going to be how I will do Home Assistant in the RV is on a dedicated

59
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,680
machine. I'm going to have a dedicated machine for Home Assistant and I'm going to have an

60
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,080
application server for all my other stuff. So Home Assistant yellow will run all of the

61
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,760
automations and jupes. And you know, she's got this yellow has got EMMC for storage for the

62
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,960
primary OS and they've got MVME expansion. I don't really know how you use that, but it's in there.

63
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,920
So it's going to give me, I think I expect at least five years of runway with that device.

64
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,200
But then on your encouragement, and I didn't expect this for like a month. I also picked up

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,200
the Odroid H3 Plus that they announced shortly after our last episode. It arrived today

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,160
just a little bit before the show. It's still in the packaging. You went for the plus, huh?

67
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,120
Of course. Of course. Who am I talking to? Sorry, I forgot myself for a second.

68
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,680
Now I'm showing Alex on the camera, but I'll describe it to you. But check this out,

69
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:30,800
Alex. Here it is. It's got two Ethernets. It's got four USB-A. It's got USB-C, DC barrel power

70
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,440
connector. It has audio out ports, including optical audio out, and it has HDMI and Display

71
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,520
port. Plus it has an Intel chip on here. It's got a pretty meaty heat sink on it. And on the bottom,

72
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,480
it's got two slots for RAM and a slot for an MVME disk. And the killer feature for me,

73
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,080
two SATA ports on the board. That's massive. That's a game changer for me because I've been

74
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,680
using USB storage forever. Welcome to the world of real hardware, dude.

75
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,280
I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so pleased. I think it's going to be perfect.

76
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,440
So this is what will replace my Raspberry Pi 4. And I'm going to run all my applications and more,

77
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,480
right? Because I've got more horsepower here and it's got quick sync as well.

78
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,400
I got to get some RAM ordered for it. I didn't expect it to arrive this soon. So I haven't

79
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,320
ordered anything for it. What type of RAM is it? Laptop style, the smaller stuff?

80
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,280
Yes. Yeah, it's the small stuff. I think it's DDR4.

81
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,720
Do I recall reading that thing will take up to 64 gigs of RAM?

82
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,560
Yes, I believe that is the case. I should have grabbed the specs before the show.

83
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,640
I'm so excited. It's funny, right? Because when the Pi 4 died, I was like,

84
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,880
crap, I don't know what I'm going to do. I have nothing I want to replace this with. I'm like,

85
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,400
I guess I could build it around another Pi 4 again, but then I'm going through all this work

86
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,320
and I'm not getting a performance upgrade. And then this thing shows up just a little

87
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,880
bit after last episode. Yeah, it's perfect timing.

88
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,600
They actually shipped it. I got it. I can't believe it. I can't believe it.

89
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,440
I think what I want to do is first is I want to load desktop Linux on here just to see

90
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,160
what it's like. And then I'll wipe it off immediately and start building,

91
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,640
I think, a NixOS server. I mean, it looks amazing. And I shared it

92
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,400
with you for this exact reason. It's got a passive heat sink on it. So, you know,

93
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,080
it can run completely, completely silently, which is perfect for a small space like the RV.

94
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,280
Yes, totally. The only thing I would change about it, and I don't have one,

95
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,400
but the only thing I would change about it is the fact that both of those Nix are

96
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:38,720
Realtek 2.5 gig Nix. I would have preferred two Intel Nix, just simply for better hardware

97
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,640
compatibility reasons. In a real text, probably fine. But if ever I've had a Nick issue in the

98
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,960
past, it's been not an Intel, Nick and a quantia or real tech or something like that. Whereas Intel

99
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:57,120
Nix just work and it takes all the problems away. But anyway, I'm nitpicking. Otherwise,

100
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,160
it's a fantastic looking board. I imagine they'll be fine, but I also 100% agree with you.

101
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,840
I would also prefer that, though I'm just excited to have a Nick that isn't on the USB bus. So,

102
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,400
that's good, too. I don't think it was for the Pi 4, but it is for most of the Pis. And

103
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,720
if you wanted to ever add a secondary Nick to the Raspberry Pi to like use it for a firewall

104
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,880
or something like that, you would be doing that over USB. So for me, it's like, okay, at least

105
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,000
they're on the PCI bus. And then it would be nice if they were Intel, but I'll take on the PCI bus.

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,840
So what are you going to run on it? Proxmox and then virtualize like Home Assistant that way?

107
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,080
Oh, I should consider Proxmox, huh? Well, you know, I'm still kind of subscribed to the no

108
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,120
container theory for a lot of this stuff. And NixOS would be really good for that. But it does

109
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,880
make a lot of sense to have Proxmox sitting on there. And I shouldn't have any problem passing

110
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,040
quicksync through, right? That should be fine. So what would you need to pass it through for?

111
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,240
Plex. Yeah, I mean, we'll come on to this topic later in the show because it's actually been

112
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,720
coming up quite a lot in Discord lately about LXC versus Docker versus VMs, all that kind of stuff.

113
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,920
We'll come to that later. Please remind me if I forget. But in the meantime, I also saw another

114
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,360
update in the news feed this week that I thought would make you a happy little bunny. Apple with,

115
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,040
I think iOS 16.1 are actually shipping. It's real. It's really happening, people.

116
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,480
They're shipping matter. This is my week, man. This is my week. It's all coming together, buddy.

117
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,480
And the thing is, they're shipping it on the HomePod. They're updating the HomePod to support

118
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,760
matter. And they just announced today as we record a new Apple TV and the fancier version

119
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,000
that has Ethernet also supports thread and matter. So they're, I mean, surprisingly going all in

120
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,560
for Apple, at least. I don't really know if this changes what I'm going to do hardware wise in

121
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,520
terms of sensors and devices yet, but I am curious what it means for accessibility of Apple's remote

122
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,960
control features to Home Assistant. When Home Assistant gets their hands on this, maybe I'll

123
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,040
have remote integrated control even better than I did before without even having to use HomeKit

124
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,520
at all or something. That would be nice, wouldn't it? Yeah. Yeah, maybe not. What's important about

125
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,040
this update coming out now, Apple being the first mover, I think, in actually shipping,

126
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,760
you know, provider level support for this stuff. It's a very strange place for Apple to be.

127
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,120
But anyway, you've already got HomePods. You've already got Apple TVs. So for you, you could just

128
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,320
purchase one or two matter devices and kind of dip your toe in nice and early and get a feeling

129
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,280
for it without having to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on all new sensors and all

130
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,320
new whatever. And you can just do a couple of things and kind of drip feed this stuff in as

131
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,240
support lands in Home Assistant and that kind of stuff. Which is probably the best way to go,

132
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,320
right? Because I guess if history is to be our teacher, it's very possible that the Rev1 devices

133
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,960
could be kind of so-so and this thing takes a couple of revisions and... No. The first iPhone

134
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,280
was perfect. Yeah, right. Right, of course. And the first wireless communications protocols are

135
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:01,280
always perfect, too. Yeah. I'm seeing the reaction to the H3, the Odroid H3 that we just talked about

136
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,520
in the Discord chat. It's probably a good job you got one because I think half our audience are

137
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,720
about to buy one. I've got to imagine they would be because it seems like the perfect device for

138
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,840
what we do. I mean, low power but performance where it counts, MVME storage instead of an

139
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:22,000
EMMC or SSD, and of course, having those two SATA ports. I have a request for you. Could you

140
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,400
do some energy monitoring for us and compare what a Pi draws versus this thing? Because my argument

141
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,360
to you for all these years has been, look how much more powerful x86 is for the same power budget.

142
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,000
So I'm curious as to what that in reality is. Is that true or not? Yeah, that's a great thing

143
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,560
to check. I will. I'm also wondering, should I figure out what my power budget is? I've always

144
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,280
just kind of played fast and loose. Three, four Pis down to two Pis. So if I look at that, what

145
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,880
would four Pis have taken versus having everything on just two devices? The yellow, which I expect is

146
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,880
going to be, you know, what a CM4 takes plus a little bit more. And then now this H-Droid or

147
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,000
O-Droid, H3. I'm expecting somewhere around five to six watts idle and then who knows when it's

148
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,680
ramped up. We'll find out. You just got to figure it out, eh? Figure it out. lino.com slash ssh.

149
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,680
That's where you go to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account. And it's a great way to support

150
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,360
the show while you're checking out a service. It's frankly awesome. We run everything we've

151
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,600
built for the last few years on Linode, including our brand new shiny website, jupitabroadcasting.com,

152
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,080
which is kicked off and rebuilt on the regular on Linode. And we are super impressed with the

153
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,920
speed. We've integrated it overall with our infrastructure management tools. And you can

154
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,720
too. Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes. It works with all of that. But maybe you're brand new. Maybe

155
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,280
you've never done any of this stuff. Linode has what they call an app marketplace. It's basically

156
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,360
like one click deployment for a lot of really great open source applications. And they just

157
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,720
recently refreshed their whole approach to Nextcloud. It's got a new feature in the marketplace.

158
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,720
They're working with the project. You hit that deploy button, you get a properly set up Nextcloud

159
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,320
instance on Linode right away. This week, I'm also just playing around with their GPU instances

160
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,360
with a little bit of AI image generation because they got GPU machines. And I'm not going to go

161
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,120
build a crazy huge Nvidia box just to play around with a project, right? But I'll go deploy a Linode

162
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,280
for a couple of days. And you can too. With that $100, you can really kick the tires and try just

163
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,280
about everything out. From their backups, their S3 object storage, to those powerful CPU or GPU

164
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,560
rigs. Or maybe you just want a gaming server, a blog server, or a Nextcloud instance up in the

165
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,280
cloud. Well, you'll have full control with Linode and you'll be super appreciative of their support

166
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,680
if you ever run into any problems. I'll guarantee you that. So go try them out and get $100 while

167
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:55,760
you support the show. linode.com. That's linode.com. I thought I'd continue my journey down the whole

168
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,440
home audio rabbit hole exploration, spelunking exercise that I've been doing recently.

169
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,000
Lots of people write in, give me lots of excellent recommendations of different things to try.

170
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Volumio is still on my list of things to try. However, I thought I would try out the big dog

171
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,200
in the room in the Rune. The big dog in the Rune. I see what you did there. Terrible. I tried out

172
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:26,160
Rune this week for all of you lovely people. I love it. I didn't want to because it's so damn

173
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,760
expensive. Yeah, but Rune bills itself as the audio file player for music fanatics.

174
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:41,680
So essentially you run a piece of software on a NAS or a computer or a server like I have,

175
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,880
and it goes through and it catalogs all of your FLAC files, all of your audio. So it can be lossy

176
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,080
stuff. It can be lossless, whatever. All right. That sounds great. I've got about a quarter of

177
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,680
a million files I've acquired over the years. A lot of them have ripped actually of CD rips. I did

178
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,080
a decade plus ago. I went before I donated all my CDs to the charity shop. The performance has been

179
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:13,120
fine. It indexed that quarter of a million files in, I don't know, six hours or so, maybe three,

180
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,200
four, five, six hours, something like that. Is this running on a Windows machine, Linux machine,

181
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,760
Mac? I'm running it in a Docker container on my Linux server, but you can run it on a Windows

182
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,240
machine too. So they do offer it as a Docker container. Yeah. Well, I don't know if they

183
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:33,040
officially do, but it's certainly possible because it's just a Linux app. The real issue with it

184
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:42,080
though, is that to run this server, they charge, I can't believe I'm going to say this, they charge

185
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:50,640
me $10 a month for access to my own files. Yeah. Okay. It's bring your own streaming service,

186
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,800
bring your own music streaming service, essentially. It does have a couple of nice

187
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,520
features like it integrates with Tidal and Cobuz for high res gap filling in your library. So let's

188
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,200
say you're missing an album or a new album came out that you haven't bought yet or something like

189
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,560
that. It will automatically go to Tidal and Cobuz if you have an active subscription with those two

190
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,440
services and pull it in and fill in the gaps for you, which is just really nice. And it tries to

191
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,000
automatically prioritize the highest quality version of a track available. So let's say I had

192
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,280
an MP3 in my local library, but Cobuz has a high res, you know, high res mastered version of it.

193
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,840
It will play the Cobuz version, which I really liked. Yeah. That does seem like the way you'd

194
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,640
want it. And I guess that $10 is going towards the access to the licenses to stream that stuff

195
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:44,240
automatically. I guess so. But Roon's killer feature, and I say this genuinely out of love,

196
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,200
is the way it presents metadata. So you end up with this kind of like magazine view

197
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,080
of an album. So let's say I'm listening to some Led Zeppelin or something and it shows me Led

198
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,040
Zepp 4. That's the best Led Zepp album in my opinion. And so I go in there and I look at it

199
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,640
and I click on one of the tracks and I can see on the credits, you know, all the different people

200
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,080
associated with a specific album and you know, who produced it, who did the mixing for it. And

201
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:18,080
if you're a proper audio nerd, you can go down the rabbit hole really deep, really fast, because

202
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,000
each of the names and each of the albums mentioned in the description about this thing is a link.

203
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,600
And that's powered on their server side. You know, for example, Stephen Wilson is one of my

204
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,960
personal musical heroes. He's in a band called Porcupine Trees and a bunch of solo stuff as well.

205
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:43,280
And he is probably the most famous musician you've never heard of. Like he works with all,

206
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,840
he does mixes film soundtracks and all kinds of stuff. And so when I dig into Stephen Wilson's

207
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,240
Stephen's profile, I get to see everything he's associated with and everything he's worked as an

208
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,040
engineer on and worked as an editor on. And before you know it, you found 10 new bands you didn't

209
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,360
know you liked because it's got some of your favorite influences in. So that's amazing. The

210
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:08,320
way it presents metadata is genuinely Rune's killer, killer feature. The other thing that

211
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,880
I like about it is the fact it does multi room audio much in the same way as like a Sonos does.

212
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,240
You have a little icon in your playback client, and then you can just check a box and suddenly

213
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,400
you've got two devices playing in sync. That doesn't sound too incredible until I explain

214
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:31,760
the scenario that really blew my mind. So Rune has this thing called Rune Advanced Audio Transport

215
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:40,400
RAT that runs on anything that runs a Rune ready or a Rune native client. So certain amplifiers

216
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,640
and amplifiers have been certified by Rune and by Marantz and Denon and all these big guys.

217
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,160
They pay Rune a small fee and they embed the Rune ready receiver software into their

218
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:03,840
network streamers. You can also run a RAT ready device on a Windows PC, a Mac computer, an iOS

219
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:11,280
device, a Raspberry Pi. And so you can cast effectively, it's not quite casting, but you

220
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,360
can stream music to any RAT ready device in sync, no matter what iOS it's running. So

221
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,360
just paint this, I've got my iPad out on the deck where I'm grilling some meats.

222
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,080
In the lounge next door, I've got a Raspberry Pi plugged into a HiFi running Linux. In the room

223
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,000
next door, I've got my laptop running Mac OS and all three of those devices are playing audio

224
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,320
perfectly in sync that I'm controlling from my iPhone with a single checkbox.

225
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,160
That is pretty glorious.

226
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,680
That's the dream, isn't it?

227
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,520
Yeah. All the machines, all the speakers, all the OSs.

228
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,160
The catch, and unfortunately I think there's probably some technical limitations here at play,

229
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:00,560
is that you can only stream like that to devices that are part of the same kind of ecosystem.

230
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:07,520
So I can only group devices that are RAT devices. I can only group Chromecast devices together. I

231
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,200
can only group AirPlay devices together. I can't stream to an AirPlay and a Chromecast

232
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,480
device at the same time.

233
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,880
Do you have any idea why? That's a pretty interesting limitation.

234
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,600
Well, I mean, AirPlay, the way it buffers the stream is quite different to how Chromecast

235
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,400
buffers the stream.

236
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,600
So it's using their native protocols. It's not using like a client on that. Oh, yeah. Okay.

237
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,320
That makes sense.

238
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,560
Well, that's what the RAT stuff is doing. So the RAT stuff is running a native client on the

239
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:38,080
specific device, iOS or whatever. And that's why you can't group them together. And I was a little

240
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,480
bit deflated to start with when I found that out because I had this magical vision of all the

241
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,440
Google Home Nest mini hub things I have around the house and all my computers and everything

242
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,240
all working perfectly in sync. And unfortunately, that isn't the case.

243
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,120
What if you bought the Nucleus Plus, which is their $2,600 server that you can buy from them?

244
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,520
How do you know this service is aimed at audio files, huh?

245
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,320
How to tell, right? I mean, it's a cool looking case. I'll give them that.

246
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,760
It's a beautiful ecosystem. Yeah, they've got, so you can run this rune core,

247
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,480
this server software. You can run it in a Docker container like I am. You can run it on a Synology

248
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,840
on a computer. But rune also sell this thing called the Nucleus. And Chris is showing on the

249
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,840
stream now something called the Whirlwind, which is a rack mount version of the same thing.

250
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,040
It's so great. That one's $4,500.

251
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:38,880
Yeah. And you know, what's funny is if you actually dig into the specs page on these pages,

252
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,120
there is zero information about what CPU is in there.

253
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,040
There is a page where they just say they have on their partners page,

254
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,520
they say they have partnered with Intel. Yeah, that's it. I mean, who's to say whether

255
00:22:51,520 --> 00:23:00,480
it's a Celeron from 2003 or whether it's an i7 12th Gen. I mean, I imagine it's neither,

256
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,800
but we don't know. And that's the point, right? It's a black box, literally.

257
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah. And when you're dropping that kind of cash, I guess, you know, and of course,

258
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,480
the answer is they're selling this to a market who couldn't care less. We realize that.

259
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,520
But it's still it wouldn't kill them to put the specs on there.

260
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,200
If you go by the ports, it looks like it's a knock in there. I have to say.

261
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,840
Yeah, I agree. So, I mean, if we can get over the price of this thing,

262
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:30,400
because I mentioned the monthly price. I didn't mention they also offer a lifetime pass for $700.

263
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,800
I mean, if you really stuck with it and they stuck around, you know, you got somewhere between

264
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:44,400
five to 10 years out of this and it had high spousal approval. Maybe. I mean, I could see that.

265
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:52,960
So Rune as a company was founded, I think, in 2015. And so if you bought into Rune in 2015

266
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,160
and paid $700, you would only just be breaking even on your monthly subscription.

267
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:04,320
Just put that into perspective. Seven years is a long time for an ROI on that kind of thing.

268
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,080
Yeah. And I wrestled with this pretty hard before I actually tried Rune out. You know,

269
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,560
I wanted to hate it because it was expensive. I wanted to hate it because it was closed source.

270
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:19,360
But then I thought, well, so is Plex, isn't it? And you like Plex just fine. And so I kind of

271
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,040
came to terms with it and got over myself and thought, yeah, you know, it's fine. You can try

272
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:32,240
it out and you'll hate it anyway. I don't. I love it. The trouble is just as I've been doing this,

273
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:39,120
they've made a big release. They've just released the 2.0, the version two, which if you're a Rune

274
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:47,920
aficionado is a huge deal. But to me as a newbie, it's just unstable, right? So you're familiar

275
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,040
with Plexamp, right? The app that lets you play your Plex music remotely. Love it. Rune have just

276
00:24:53,040 --> 00:25:00,880
released an equivalent app called Rune Arc, A-R-C. And this lets you access all of your Rune music

277
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,600
outside the house. As it stands, the Rune desktop and mobile clients that already existed only worked

278
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,120
if you were on your LAN and directly connected to your Rune core. I couldn't get it to work over

279
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:20,720
tail scale remotely. So Rune Arc kind of bridges that gap for a lot of people. However, this brings

280
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:29,440
us to the cons section of my document. I don't really know how else to say this, but Rune with

281
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:39,280
2.0 have shot their, they're kind of eating their own face. Okay. And the reason I say that is

282
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:46,640
because firstly, they're charging me $10 a month for access to my own files, plus the metadata,

283
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:55,200
plus the integrations with Tidal and Kobuz. Okay. However, it gets worse. They guarantee with the 2.0

284
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:03,360
update zero minutes of offline playback. If the Rune core cannot connect to the internet,

285
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:11,280
Rune's position is that they guarantee zero minutes of playback. Because they don't want to

286
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,160
have to pay out when somebody's wifi goes down or their router takes a crap, something like that,

287
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:22,320
you think? Well, according to Johnny Darko, who is the source of this information, he spoke to,

288
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,960
I think his name is Danny over at Rune about this. There's a link in the show notes to this video

289
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:34,160
because I couldn't quite believe what I was watching. And Johnny Darko is a proper audiophile

290
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:40,000
and I trust his opinion almost implicitly on an awful lot of audio gear. And I like the way his

291
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,160
videos feel. I like the way he presents information. He's a British guy living in, I think, Berlin.

292
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:54,400
We've got to stick together, you know? But what's interesting is Johnny is clearly not a techno guy

293
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,000
like us, right? And listening to someone who's operating on the edge of their understanding

294
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,720
about how some of these technologies on the server side of things work, it's really interesting

295
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,040
because it shows you actually that I think Rune are just trying to pull the wool over people's

296
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:15,440
eyes. And I don't say that lightly. And the reason I do say it is because the Rune projects say

297
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,760
they're doing this always online connectivity thing for the server because they want to move

298
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,120
a lot of the processing to the cloud and to move the product forward and all that kind of stuff.

299
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,120
So a lot of the local processing that currently happens on the Nucleus, on the Rune core, on my

300
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,400
local network is moving into the cloud. And they say that they'll be able to batch stuff up and

301
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,600
make it more efficient and kind of, you know, de-duplicate a lot of, you know, template matching

302
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,640
and all that kind of stuff, which I get, which I understand and does actually make some semblance

303
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,880
of sense. However, we're talking about this through a lens of self-hosting, right? That's

304
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,960
the name of the podcast, right? Just imagine a situation where your internet goes out for half

305
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,200
an hour every day and you suddenly can't play back the files on your NAS under your desk in

306
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,360
your basement. You know, it's just unacceptable on a huge number of levels for me personally.

307
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,840
And I think despite how much I love Rune so far and, you know, the 2.0 release has been a little

308
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,160
buggy and, you know, not perfect, a little rough around the edges, I just can't adopt a product

309
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:36,720
that costs this much money and compromises on such a fundamental capability like that of an

310
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,680
offline self-hosted type product. It's just, I just can't. Yeah, that's a fair point,

311
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,120
especially when you consider there's people out there that maybe they're on Starlink and they're

312
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,160
having a bad day or they're on LTE and they're having a bad day. Or they live in the third world

313
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:58,480
and the entire island is connected through a single satellite type people. That surely is

314
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,920
not a big part of Rune's core audience. Starlink customers, I could see the Starlink customers.

315
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,840
Starlink people are out there, you know. You know, the thing is, it's sort of taking away

316
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,920
one of the biggest advantages of you collecting all that stuff locally for so many years and it's

317
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:17,200
just... At that point, why not just have a Cobuz subscription or a Tidal subscription? What value

318
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,680
is Rune adding if I can't even, let's say, you know, one of my friend's dads was out of power

319
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:30,480
for like 8 to 10 days with Hurricane Ian a couple of weeks ago, you know? Yikes. It's just no good.

320
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,320
It's no good. You know, for the pricing, especially if you were looking at server hardware,

321
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,080
you could almost just afford to just buy sets of speakers for every single room and just

322
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,480
put a dedicated hardware device on them and just call it good. Yeah. It does sound like it was

323
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,680
really nice for a moment though. The alternative is Sonos, really, that's got this level of fit

324
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,360
and finish and polish and all the rest of it. But Sonos is just hardware and as we talked about

325
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,200
several episodes ago, when Sonos decided that a device is no longer supported, suddenly that

326
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,440
perfectly good speaker cone and that perfectly good amplifier unit become a brick, thanks to

327
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,480
their business model, you know? And that's a thing. It's frustrating. So I think that the next one to

328
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,320
look at is probably Volumio, although I've heard mixed reports about that and I certainly don't

329
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,800
expect the level of fit and finish I've seen from Rune. The other one to keep an eye on is Plexamp

330
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,760
Headless. There's been some pretty good movement over there lately. I think they're working on

331
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:34,000
multi-room audio stuff, but it won't have the Rune audio transport stuff, so I doubt it will

332
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,080
be quite as polished again, but who knows? Who knows where this will go? But that's my review

333
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,640
of Rune, people. Fascinating. Thank you for updating us on that. We've been getting a good

334
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,800
series of feedback on multi-room audio. It's something people are trying to solve and I know

335
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,880
there's got to be somebody out there that's like, just get a Pi Zero, you know, or something like that,

336
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,680
but who do you really have time? Well, Rune, sorry to come back to Rune again, but I'm running one of

337
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:06,880
the playback devices is a RU-P, a Raspberry Pi running the Rune server. Right, okay. So I am

338
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:13,200
using Raspberry Pi as part of this as well. So, you know, maybe one day I'll find the perfect

339
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,240
solution, but I think until Rune guarantee, I don't know, seven days before the server,

340
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,160
the core has to phone home again, it used to be 30 days. The grace period, by the way,

341
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,280
with 1.8, which was the previous release, used to be 30 days and now it's zero minutes.

342
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,320
It's just a hard sell. Yeah, especially when you're paying 10 bucks a month.

343
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,960
Feels like you, you know, when you're paying for something like that that's using your own media,

344
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,440
they should give you grace periods like that. 30 days sounds about right. That's about it.

345
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,440
You know, I'm going to be buying new gear soon. Cloudfree.shop is where I'll go to check it out.

346
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,920
And you can too if you use the promo code SSH. I think you get like a buck off. Light switches

347
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,400
coming soon. Cloudfree light switches. Light switches is definitely the way I want to go.

348
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,520
And after we get to the feedback today, I think I'm going to be doubling down on ZigBee. I'll

349
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,240
tell you more about that later, though. Cloudfree.shop. Promo code self-posted.

350
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,160
Yeah, one of my Shelleys just failed actually in the, in the garage. The actual switch,

351
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,640
the relay part still works. But when I flick the physical switch in the wall,

352
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,680
which in the garage you do all the time, nothing happens. So I've no idea what's happened with that

353
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,560
one. Bummer. It's kind of apparent they're about to take it out. Yeah. Well, I'm looking,

354
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,320
I was thinking about getting one of those zoo switches that we talked about last episode,

355
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,760
but I don't want to go just Seawave just for a few light switches. I'd like to stay

356
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,280
within the ZigBee universe. So if you have a good ZigBee switch recommendation, please let us know

357
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,480
at self-posted.show slash contact. Speaking of feedback,

358
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,320
Docker versus LXC versus a VM. You teased it earlier in the show and it's been a point of

359
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,920
conversation recently. Yeah. Monkey Angst and I were talking on Discord and he wrote in saying,

360
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,880
I'm trying to decide between using an LXC or another containerization technology.

361
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,440
What are you using these days, Alex? And why? Well, the short answer is

362
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:13,040
Docker and Docker and more Docker plus some virtualization. And I think that's a, oh,

363
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,800
and I suppose in the cloud too, there's a couple of things up there. Most of that stuff's running

364
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,600
in Docker too. And I'm just going to preface everything I'm about to say by saying that it's

365
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:28,880
a personal choice. And there's more than one way to skin a particular cat in this arena.

366
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,640
The way I do it is I run everything in Docker because Docker Compose is awesome.

367
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,840
It's a great way to manage your personal systems. It's a great way to separate without really having

368
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,720
to do much anything, separate out the application and the data. And just from a system building

369
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,600
standpoint, that is a great design practice and Docker just gives it to you as a general practice.

370
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,600
And the other thing about LXCs to consider is that the benefits of them is that it gives you

371
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,600
an init system. So for those that aren't familiar, an init system is something like system D

372
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:06,000
with a typical Docker container or some kind of other Linux container. What happens is the main

373
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,880
process inside that container gets given PID one, process ID one. And when that PID dies,

374
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,680
the container dies with it. The same, by the way, is true of your Linux server or your Linux desktop

375
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:23,440
or whatever you're running Linux on. When PID one dies, the system dies. And typically that PID

376
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:31,440
one is system D these days. In an LXC, what happens is you get an init system like system D.

377
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:39,040
My biggest gripe with LXC generally, and there's two really, one is that it's an extra layer of

378
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,840
complexity that not that many people are using. Some people in our self-hosted community are

379
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,240
using it, but generally it's on the fringes compared to the number of people that are using

380
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:54,240
Docker containers. The second thing is that running more than one process in an isolated

381
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,320
environment like that is a bit of an anti-pattern. And the reason I say that is because containers

382
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,560
are designed to be this black box almost of just a single block with a single purpose.

383
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,440
And if you start trying to run more than one service inside that container, so let's say

384
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,520
system D plus a web server, on the face of it, you're only running one service, right? A web

385
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,080
server, but actually you're running two, you're running an init system plus a web server, which

386
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:27,280
is a whole bunch of overhead that you A, don't need and B, technically speaking is like I said,

387
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,640
a bit of an anti-pattern. And so the other thing it gives you is some issues, well not issues,

388
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,320
it's not the right word, but added complexity around passing hardware through. So like QuickSync,

389
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,120
for example, which I think is what we talked about earlier in the show. If you're running

390
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:48,560
QuickSync in a Docker container, it's a couple of lines to pass through the render device.

391
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,280
To QuickSync running in Plex or whatever, it's no big deal. With LXC, there can be some

392
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,440
compatibility issues. It's a similar thing, you've got to pass it through, but I can never remember

393
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,200
if it has a distinct lock on the GPU once you pass it through to an LXC or not. So somebody

394
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,120
in the chat could update in real time, I'd appreciate it. But then the other thing you've

395
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:17,120
got to consider is if you want to run multiple services in one isolated environment, that's

396
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:23,120
exactly what a VM has been designed to do. The tooling around VMs is extremely mature at this

397
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:32,400
point. They're very, very well understood. And I don't know, LXC for me fall into this awkward

398
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,240
middle ground of not quite knowing who they're for. It's not to say they're a bad technology

399
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:46,160
because I think LXCs do have their place. They just don't in my world personally.

400
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,480
Yeah. Well, and I think they're also a little more popular in the Ubuntu ecosystem as well,

401
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,440
which is probably just not as prevalent in the North America area. So I think there's that

402
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,560
element as well. I like what you're saying about VMs, just to step back a little bit there. Your

403
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,600
point about the VM sometimes the right tooling, people shouldn't feel bad about it, I think is

404
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:14,880
underscored by the fact that VM performance, it's like it's not your grandpa's VM anymore.

405
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,160
On modern hardware with modern virtualization software, VMs can be extremely performant,

406
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,960
way better than they were when we were emulating the entire hardware stack. Because these days,

407
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,520
not only do we have pair of virtualized devices, but there's also just been a lot of plumbing in

408
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,600
the kernel to get virtual driver requests to the physical hardware so much faster than they were

409
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,600
even four or five years ago. Exactly. I mean, you think about all those cloud servers that are

410
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:46,400
running virtualized stacks, a lot of that investment trickles down to us mere mortals.

411
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,040
A lot of those improvements end up in the kernel one way or another. So yeah, the other thing we

412
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,200
didn't talk about at all yet is Podman. I know being a Red Hatter, I should probably be a bit

413
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:04,560
more pro Podman, but for me, the tooling's just still not quite there yet. I rely on Compose all

414
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,720
the time for interacting with all of my services. I know Podman Compose exists and I've tried it

415
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,920
several times, but it's still just- It's not 100%.

416
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,400
It's not quite there. Yeah. It's like 90% or so, but it's not 100%. I have the same opinion.

417
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,000
I feel like Podman is a better design system architecturally. It feels cleaner. It feels

418
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,920
more native as well. But then again, you have like monsters in our chat room that are running

419
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,880
Docker in LXC. Oh my goodness. Well, you can run Docker in Docker in Docker in VN.

420
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,480
Right. These are the people that show up to our live streams.

421
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,000
Yeah, right. Say the tip of the iceberg.

422
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,600
Yeah, there you go. Very interesting. I'd love also to hear other people's opinions on it too.

423
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,600
So do feel free to go to the contact page or send us a boost. There was discussion going on

424
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,440
on Reddit that I wanted to just kind of touch on because I have a lot of thoughts on this,

425
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,880
but I had something I think is actionable. And the question is, and Alex, I liked this question a

426
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,400
lot because it's being honest with themselves. And I think it's something all of us self-hosters

427
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,800
should think about. How do I prepare for a time when I'm just tired of tinkering with

428
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,240
Home Assistant? That's the question that was on Reddit. And I love it because it's like,

429
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,080
this guy writes, I've used Home Assistant for the last six months and I've had a blast

430
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,160
tinkering with the platform. I've got a hundred plus devices. Everything is working as intended.

431
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,200
And I know from experience there come a time when I just don't find home automation as flattering

432
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,720
anymore, but I'll still need my lights and whatnot to function properly. So how do I prepare for this

433
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:38,160
day? This is really, I need to take this advice in as well. Now I've always remained pretty

434
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,640
fascinated. Home Assistant moves quick. The community moves quick. It hasn't lost my attention,

435
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:49,120
but things have. And as geeks, I think we're just kind of prone to the new shiny sometimes as well.

436
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,880
Do you have any hot tips on how to prepare your infrastructure for when you are bored with it?

437
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,240
Do you have anything off the top of your mind?

438
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,520
Don't get bored at the time where it's broken.

439
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Yeah.

440
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't know. It's such a hard question because I'm aware that the raindrop of inspiration

441
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,640
in the desert of computer, you know, there's several things have to line up in order for me

442
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,840
to be interested enough to tinker with something. I have to have enough free time in my mind and I

443
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,000
always underestimate how long something is going to take. So if I think it's going to take four

444
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,880
hours, I know I've got to estimate I've got to have a whole day free. And if it's quicker than

445
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,320
that, great. I mean, that's often not the case with Home Assistant, but sometimes it is. Probably

446
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:41,680
the best advice I can give, and it's not terribly wisdomful, but is just try and break down the

447
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:48,160
things you're trying to accomplish into small tasks, small batches of stuff. Let's say you want

448
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,480
to get a specific room behaving a certain way, or you want to get just a couple of new lights added

449
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,560
or something and try not to leave anything half finished when you go to sleep or something like

450
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,200
that. I know it's not always possible because, you know, I'll wake up tomorrow and my interest

451
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,440
will be in cars tomorrow, not Home Assistant or what, you know, how it is. And for me, leaving

452
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,720
stuff half done when I go to sleep is the enemy because, A, I've loaded it into context, like in

453
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,840
my personal RAM buffer or whatever, and loading it back in again is going to take a long time,

454
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,400
typically. Sometimes going for a walk or whatever, you know, can be the solution.

455
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,560
We've also got to get the motivation program running again, too. So it's not just the context

456
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,600
and the data and the state, but it's also you've got to get motivated again.

457
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:38,640
Also, the caffeination station has to be fired up, too, you know. So, yeah, you know,

458
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,480
essentially just break things down into atomic blocks, really.

459
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,880
Yeah, and complete it one room at a time and complete it as much as you can. That's a great tip.

460
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,800
Yeah, and I find that helps with motivation, too, because if you actually think,

461
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,320
right, I've done that, and it works as intended, next time, you know, you'll be like,

462
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,120
oh, well, yeah, I actually achieved what I set out to do, and it can be a self-perpetuate,

463
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,280
self-fulfilling cycle of improvement.

464
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,680
I think that's probably how I should probably attack, like, the rebuild of the sensors and

465
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,360
all the switches and stuff and dupes. It's probably just one room at a time, and it'll,

466
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,560
you know, it'll go quick.

467
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:22,320
Also, you are your own worst enemy. Write this down. Document your crap, because you will forget.

468
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,880
You think you won't, you think you remember it, but trust me, you won't.

469
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,240
You've got to write it down. Absolutely agree. Absolutely agree. I have one bit of wisdom from

470
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,520
my whole, my home assistant's been unavailable, and this is what this guy was worried about.

471
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,320
Like, it would crash, and he just wouldn't have the motivation to fix it.

472
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,720
This is something you can do in Z-Wave, but I read how to do it in ZigBee,

473
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,280
and this seems like the thing to do. It's called device binding.

474
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:54,160
So, you can bind a light switch to a particular light, for example. You can bind two ZigBee

475
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,880
devices together, so they can control each other without the central coordinator. So,

476
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,400
they, as long as they're both on the network and both devices support binding, you can have them

477
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,360
operate without home assistant even running. And this is incredible, because it means, like,

478
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,920
all of, like, your switches and buttons and those types of things continue to work,

479
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,560
even if your server's crashed. And so, this is definitely something I want to look into for at

480
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,560
least a few core devices. Like, switches to turn lights on and off, those always need to work. And

481
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,560
I don't really have the flexibility to, like, open it up and, like, install a Shelby in the,

482
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,720
or a Shelly in the wall, because my walls are, like, two inches thick. They're thinner than

483
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,280
the Shelly is. So, I have to go with the soft button route, which means when home assistant's

484
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,600
down, no light switches, which is crazy. Just absolutely crazy. And so, something like binding

485
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:52,000
would keep it working and give you the time to continue to operate your stuff without having to

486
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,640
actually get the server up and running. And they have groups and all kinds of stuff. And I've read

487
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,080
that people also get this working with their Philips Hughes, so you can use binding with the

488
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,800
Hughes lights as well. I'll have a link in the show notes for more information about binding.

489
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:11,680
A dot technologies that you own the firmware of, you know, Tasmotor is a great example.

490
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,800
Don't rely on a cloud-based service, you know, buy the right hardware, all that kind of stuff. Try,

491
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,400
try and buy with the idea that you want it to just keep working until the hardware physically

492
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,440
stops working would be a great idea. I like the chat room. Serverless IoT. Nice. It is kind of,

493
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,480
isn't it? You're right, Aaron. That's pretty cool. We got some boosts into the show. Check out this.

494
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:45,280
Yerero? I'm so sorry, dude. 135,000 sats was sent into the show this week. He says it's not a moly.

495
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,320
I know. In fact, I'm going to buy a boat that put us on the hot list. So in Fountain, you know,

496
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,480
highly boosted shows, I believe it was this boost put, put self-hosted on the hot list and

497
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,520
then new people find the show. So when you send a big boost in, it's where we, the show trends

498
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:07,200
and the people discover us. It's really great. So Yerero writes, it's not a million dollars,

499
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,320
but these are all the sats I have. I am currently thinking of automating the lighting around my flat

500
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:18,640
and unable to pick between smart lights or smart switches. What are the pros and cons of each one?

501
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:25,040
Thanks, Alex, Chris and Brent. Fairly easy answer, actually. Switches mean that your bulbs stay

502
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,280
powered all the time and you can, so you can control the switch, you retain physical control

503
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:39,200
of the switch and you also gain the ability to control that switch remotely as well. Whereas if

504
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,800
you just go for a smart bulb and someone turns the light switch off, uh-oh, you're out of luck.

505
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,240
Yeah. And it's also just way more approachable by every other single human on the face of the planet.

506
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,880
And so if you have anybody else that's going to be in the space with you,

507
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,320
what I literally have on my switches here in the studio, I have tape over them that says

508
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:03,760
no touch because like people just flip light switches all the time. And it still happens when

509
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,040
we have a meetup here at the studio, inevitably like a listener will just walk out of the studio

510
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,640
and they'll just instinctively flip the light switch off, you know, they'll even flip it right

511
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:19,840
through the tape. Read the FM, huh? What? What is it? Hearty FM. Oh, even if it's just a bit

512
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,920
of tape on the light switch, you know, you've got a hearty FM. Yeah, that's true. Read the tape.

513
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,280
Prozac boosted with 1200 sats. Just thanking Alex for sharing your secret sauce. And so I thought,

514
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,200
just in case people missed it last episode, we should probably put the Badgerstack link

515
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:40,720
in the show notes for an overview of Alex's setup. People have been liking that. PA or PageDot

516
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:51,600
boosted in with 3333 sats. Hi, please take a look at the FunkWhale project. It's a federated music

517
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:58,080
service with a great GUI, active development, a subsonic API, mobile app, and financial support.

518
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:02,320
I use it without the federation for my personal library, but I really like it because they really

519
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,440
managed to keep me up to date and involve the community in their decisions I just wanted to

520
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,120
make. So I went and looked at it, super quick, and I'm going to put this on my checkout. This

521
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,840
and Jellyfin, which I realize are not quite the same, but Jellyfin's, the jelly amp app that

522
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,880
people are working on, and this FunkWhale, I think could be great solutions for my music use, because

523
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,240
I'm not so much looking for a whole home sync so much as I am just looking for something that could

524
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,040
expose a local music collection to me in a way that I could consume when I want to listen, mostly

525
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:39,120
in the car or on home pods. FunkWhale's really nice. Funkwhale.audio. Are you familiar with it,

526
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:44,640
Alex? I tried it out once a few months ago, and then just for some reason it didn't stick. I can't

527
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,600
remember why. If I might interrupt the boosts for a second, we're having a live question in the chat

528
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:55,040
room. What is the boost address? We've got jupyterbroadcasting.com slash boost, but then what?

529
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,800
So you need a new podcast app because it's an RSS feed-based thing. So the boost address is in

530
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:09,360
the RSS feed. So you get a new podcast app, and that reads that RSS tag, and then automatically

531
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,360
adds a button to your playback screen. There's also a browser extension, which I was actually

532
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:19,200
going to suggest to you after the show, Alex, called ALBY. And that lets you do it in a browser

533
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,800
based environment. And the reason I was going to mention it to you is they've launched a new

534
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:29,840
platform called Saturn. And I think it's like, I don't know for sure, actually. I have to look

535
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:34,240
at it, but I think it's kind of like having your own node, and then you could get a copy of the

536
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,600
messages and a split of the SATs with Saturn, I think. And then I don't think you have to set up

537
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:46,400
a whole node, but ALBY is an open source project for a Lightning wallet in the browser. I don't

538
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,720
generally like it because I don't like stuff built into the browser, but I had a chance to talk to

539
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,000
the co-founder and ask him my questions about security and open source practices, and I actually

540
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,320
walked away with a pretty good opinion of where they're at. So ALBY for that. Then you could boost

541
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,040
from the website using our new player on the website. Otherwise, it requires a new podcast

542
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:14,800
app at newpodcastapps.com. And then one day, soon, one day, Alex, I have a dream. Jupiter

543
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,080
Broadcasting will be generating all of our own RSS feeds independently. We use a service provider

544
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:24,240
called Fireside right now. It's very common practice to have a service generate your RSS

545
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,920
feeds or like a WordPress plugin or something because you never want them to screw up.

546
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,720
So like people have just like specialized in that because it's like your radio signal.

547
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,120
But right now we don't generate our own RSS feed, but we want to. And then we'll start taking

548
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:43,040
advantage of even more podcasting 2.0 features like transcripts and host information in there,

549
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,720
like, you know, guest, more guest information, richer context around that kind of stuff.

550
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,560
And a big one that I'm really looking forward to, I don't know what we'll use it for exactly yet,

551
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:56,720
alternative enclosures. So like maybe like an MP4 file or an Opus file if people want an Opus

552
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,640
version or I don't know. But it's so your podcast player will just it'll see the entry and then in

553
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,400
the player, you'll just choose like which format you want because we can just specify multiple

554
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:12,400
formats in one RSS feed entry with podcasting 2.0 in the past. And you've probably seen JB has like

555
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:18,560
so many different RSS feeds because any variation of file type, you had to do a whole new RSS feed

556
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,600
because that's just how these players worked back then. So it's a whole new generation over there.

557
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,440
Very excited about it. I think it's going to be big for podcasting. And I think it's the way to

558
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,880
keep podcasting decentralized and self-hosted because the other big trend in the podcasting

559
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,520
industry is consolidation with Spotify and players like that. And then they do dynamic

560
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,240
ad insertion. They do the hosting. They manage your RSS feed and the podcaster doesn't have

561
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,640
any control over it. And I think decentralization is key to keeping podcasting healthy.

562
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,800
And I think self-hosting plays a big role in that. Fundek Hermit boosted in with 2,346 sets.

563
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:59,040
Hey guys, I wanted to mention an amazing newish feature of R-Clone. You can now use a Docker

564
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:04,640
plugin to mount the local or cloud storage directly as a Docker volume. That's great for

565
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:10,720
host isolation and separation. That is great. R-Clone for the win.

566
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:16,800
Yeah. So I guess you could use, you know, like Google drive as a Docker volume. I wonder what

567
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,280
the latency is like, but that sounds amazing. I mean, if you're just writing like an encrypted

568
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,040
tar file or something. Yeah. For something like my smoke ping, you know, history or something

569
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,400
like that, that might be nice that I would like to keep around, but I don't really care

570
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,680
that much about it. Maybe I'll investigate. That sounds pretty cool. Thanks Fundek Hermit.

571
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,760
Last couple of boosts for this week, although we did read all of them. We only feature some

572
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,040
of them in the show. Soltros boosted with 9,000 sets. I recently got into Docker after refusing

573
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:53,200
to let go of my VM obsession. Welcome. Are there any tips out there for use case scenarios or cool

574
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,400
project I can run at my home on my Ubuntu home server? Right now I have Nextcloud, Plex, and a

575
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:05,760
few other odds and ends. Well, over at PerfectMediaServer.com, I have a list of my top 10

576
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:12,400
recommended apps to run on your new media server. So I'll put a link to that in the show notes. And

577
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,320
if you have any other recommendations, let us know at selfhosted.show slash contact.

578
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,480
Look at that. And you know, just keep listening to the show because as you listen, you'll hear us

579
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,440
mention our favorite apps over and over again. Like Alex just namedrop smoke ping. That's a great

580
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,800
one. It's a classic. Yeah, it's funny. I got smoke ping from Linux action show back in the day way

581
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,080
before you knew me. And then I wrapped it up as a Docker container on Linux server.io. And then

582
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:40,320
now it's a thing. I know. And then I grabbed it one day. I'm like, hey, it pings Jupiter broadcasting.

583
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,840
That's awesome. Yeah, that's why that's why I put you in there, bro. And it really is a great

584
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:50,080
example of like an app that probably should be in a container because it's kind of super old and

585
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:55,200
legacy in a lot of ways. And you don't want it on your whole system. Our last boost of the episode

586
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,880
came in from bronzewing, who boosted nine thousand and one sets over nine thousand. There's another

587
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:08,800
option called Mood M O O D E moody, perhaps that runs on a pie and says it can do multi room audio.

588
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,560
And we have a link in there to mood audio dot org. It's free and you can get a hi fi Barry

589
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,960
amp and put speakers on that in each room controlled by a Web interface. And that interface

590
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,080
is mobile friendly. I hear it's actually better than Volumio. It could be the complete solution.

591
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:29,360
Worth checking out. Does look nice. Yeah, I think when my rune free trial expires, which I think

592
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:34,320
I've got another week left on, I think I'll probably have to give Volumio a spin next and then

593
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:40,400
move on to this mood thing after that. But I'll be honest with you people. I'm getting a little

594
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,200
fatigued with the music situation and I'll probably just go back to Spotify for a few months

595
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,320
whilst I just calm down again. I'm just going to ship you like six home pods and you'll be good.

596
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,080
Yeah, I know it's not what you want. I know. I know. I also want to say thank you to John A.

597
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:58,720
who sent 2000 sats. He's going to be switching to Podverse. That is one of those new podcast apps

598
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:04,480
that is totally GPL, Web, Android, iOS. And it's an F-droid. And I really appreciated that when I

599
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:11,040
switched to graphene. And then Schmitzfeld, who Brent appropriately pronounces. I mentioned that

600
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:16,240
it was recently his first boost ever that he sent into the show. And he also is a big fan of

601
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,040
replacing the Raspberry Pi with a small, low power PC. He's had great results, he says. So

602
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:27,520
I will let you guys know how the O-Droid H3 Plus works out. I'm super excited about that. And then

603
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:34,480
that old Powerwall or Solar Wall device. I have a couple of ideas and I think I have a couple

604
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,360
outside the box places where I could mount that because it is so rugged too. All projects for

605
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,760
future episodes. That H3 is the type of device that I'm trying to think of a project for.

606
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,320
But I don't already have a solution for. Like, I want to buy one. I just don't know why,

607
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,240
what I'd use it for. I want one though. I mean, maybe you'll get lucky and your server will die.

608
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,400
Oh, we can hope. Hopefully not, dude. Hopefully not. Thank you to our SRE subscribers. Those are

609
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,400
our site reliability engineers. You guys make the show possible by investing in our ongoing

610
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,360
content production. And as a thank you, we make an ad free version of the show and every episode

611
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:14,240
gets a little extra content for the members, a post show. You can become a member at self hosted

612
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:20,080
dot show slash SRE or support all the shows get ad free for everything at Jupiter dot party.

613
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:24,720
And as you know, self hosted dot show slash contact is the place to go to get in touch with

614
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:30,480
us. You can find me over on Twitter at ironic badger. Oh, do we want to tease all things open

615
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,880
at all? Any updates there? Oh, yeah, we could do coming up around Halloween all things open in

616
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,680
Raleigh. If you're going to be in town, keep an eye on the meetup page. I don't know if we do the

617
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,520
official Jupiter broadcasting meetup or just the Raleigh room, probably just the Raleigh room on

618
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:50,400
matrix could do either way. Myself and cheese bacon longtime friend of the network will be there.

619
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:57,040
He's supporting a booth for system 76 at the conference. So I'll be at the conference too. And

620
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,200
we might go out for a drinky poo in the evening after one of the talks. We'll see.

621
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,280
Now I want to go. I really wanted to go to all things open. It's too much traveling, but I really

622
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,920
want to go next year. Remember Halloween, Raleigh and you'll I think so. I think so. Also, I'll

623
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,320
mention we have our discord server. You can find that on our self hosted website. And we also have

624
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:21,440
a couple of self hosted matrix chat rooms. That's a Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash matrix. And

625
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:27,600
then the podcast itself at self hosted show on Twitter. I do really mean it. I don't know if

626
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,440
I say this every single week about thanks for listening, everybody. But genuinely, if you made

627
00:56:31,440 --> 00:57:01,040
it this far in the show, thank you very much for listening. This is self hosted dot show slash 82.
