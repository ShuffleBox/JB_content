WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
Coming up on Self-Hosted Episode 10,

00:02.480 --> 00:04.680
we'll find out why it was a really good idea

00:04.680 --> 00:07.800
for Alex to run Cat 6A in his new home.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.800
And a handy-dandy speed test app.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.320
And I'll give you a very expensive

00:12.320 --> 00:13.800
project off-grid update.

00:13.800 --> 00:14.640
I'm Alex.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.520
And I'm Chris.

00:15.520 --> 00:16.600
And this is Self-Hosted.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.760
So it's 2020 now, Chris, huh?

00:19.760 --> 00:23.080
2020 and episode 10, two big moments.

00:23.080 --> 00:26.080
I think this is officially the future now, 2020.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.360
That's like a big number.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.560
30 felt like a big age, but now I'm

00:30.560 --> 00:34.440
in the process of coming to grips with reaching nearly 40.

00:34.440 --> 00:37.080
And 40 feels like that's how old my dad was.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.120
40 is old.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.120
We have people.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.080
You can't say that, Alex.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.000
You can't say that.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.760
OK, so look, let me just preface this with, when I was a kid,

00:49.760 --> 00:52.800
I remember my dad's 40th birthday being like a big deal.

00:52.800 --> 00:53.920
I know.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.440
That's what I'm saying.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.760
And now it's me.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.480
And 2020 feels the same way.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.920
And episode 10, not quite.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.240
That's more like episode 100.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.680
But episode 10 is important.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.120
One of my best friends just had his second kid today.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.640
So congratulations, Chris.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.360
Not you, my Chris Hudson, my other friend.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.400
A lot of name conflicts with this one.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.840
I got a name that just every office has a few Chris's in it.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.280
You can just shake a stick.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.200
So my parents picked Alex because they

01:18.200 --> 01:20.120
thought it was original, Alexander.

01:20.120 --> 01:24.920
When I got to preschool, there were five in my class of 22.

01:24.920 --> 01:29.800
I suspect I was named after Superman, Christopher Reeves,

01:29.800 --> 01:32.840
because I think my mom had a thing for Superman.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.680
That's my theory.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.240
Oh, that explains the heaven.

01:37.240 --> 01:40.040
So really, though, what's relevant for this show

01:40.040 --> 01:42.360
is to celebrate episode 10, we're

01:42.360 --> 01:44.640
introducing a few corners to the podcast.

01:44.640 --> 01:45.440
We are.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.480
And we need to start with camera corner this week

01:47.480 --> 01:49.840
because while we were on holiday break,

01:49.840 --> 01:53.000
WISE went and had themselves a bit of a data compromise.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.440
And just about the entire internet

01:54.440 --> 01:55.720
wanted us to know about it, because we've

01:55.720 --> 01:57.840
talked about those WISEcams here on the podcast.

01:57.840 --> 01:58.960
I'm so sad.

01:58.960 --> 02:01.280
Those WISEcams were like the panacea.

02:01.280 --> 02:01.800
I don't know.

02:01.800 --> 02:07.440
I mean, $25 each, when it's that good of a deal,

02:07.440 --> 02:09.400
there's a higher risk profile, most likely.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.240
There's got to be something wrong with it.

02:11.240 --> 02:14.720
And there have been other cameras, like from Sonoff.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.360
They're just releasing a pan tilt zoom camera as well,

02:17.360 --> 02:19.880
which will run, I believe, Tasmota firmware.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.120
So there are other games coming into this town as well.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.560
So luckily, even though WISE appear

02:25.560 --> 02:29.480
to have had a few missteps, which we'll cover now, I guess.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.080
Yeah, so I guess let's talk about what happened.

02:32.080 --> 02:35.680
It looks like it was essentially an operational error.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.440
Their production database was duplicated and for a bit

02:39.440 --> 02:41.240
put out into the public.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.520
Now, this group that likes to call themselves security

02:43.520 --> 02:46.840
researchers, but they're really just sort of stunt actors,

02:46.840 --> 02:49.040
had a lot of fun with this.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.060
They came across this, and they contacted WISE

02:52.060 --> 02:54.320
and gave them very little notice.

02:54.320 --> 02:55.360
Stunt actors.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.640
Yeah, they were.

02:56.640 --> 02:57.800
That's just funny.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.680
Well, they're just completely irresponsible.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.640
So you can't really call them security researchers.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.440
It's really a shame what happened to WISE.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.440
But at the end of the day, it was their mistake.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.120
So device information, like tokens

03:08.120 --> 03:12.040
associated with your Echo integration, user email

03:12.040 --> 03:16.400
address, your camera nicknames, your Wi-Fi network information,

03:16.400 --> 03:21.160
and WISE device information were in this public database.

03:21.160 --> 03:24.160
There was nothing to do with credentials.

03:24.160 --> 03:28.280
However, I think Amazon has reset everybody's tokens.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.920
And there was also a small number

03:29.920 --> 03:33.800
of users who were beta testing, I think, a scale, a WISE scale.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.880
And so some body metric information was public.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.720
Doesn't seem clear if it was accessed by anyone

03:39.720 --> 03:41.840
other than this research group.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.600
But I think it's something we touched on with our chat

03:45.600 --> 03:47.280
with Quindor last episode.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.080
And that is these companies have to become infrastructure

03:51.080 --> 03:53.440
experts when they roll out a cloud service that

03:53.440 --> 03:55.000
goes along with their product.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.080
Well, everybody's a software company these days.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.840
Look at John Deere tractors.

03:58.840 --> 03:59.800
Yeah, yeah.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.000
And so that's why when this news came out,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.420
I was frustrated that any information that

04:05.420 --> 04:08.080
was in the app at the time I set up these cameras

04:08.080 --> 04:09.320
may have been leaked.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.120
But my cameras are fully offline.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.440
They're blocked from WISE services.

04:13.440 --> 04:16.500
They're reflashed with the RTSP firmware.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.780
And I use them via Shinobi.

04:17.780 --> 04:19.760
And I don't use the cloud service at all.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.560
So I'm not as concerned about a compromise.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.560
But it's still really disappointing to see it.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.880
I kind of knew something like this could potentially happen.

04:25.880 --> 04:26.640
They're new.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.760
The products are cheap.

04:27.760 --> 04:28.960
It seems possible.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.760
I think one thing is clear to me working in the industry

04:31.760 --> 04:34.840
that there's a lot of people who like

04:34.840 --> 04:39.620
to spam their resumes and CVs with technology names.

04:39.620 --> 04:42.040
And they don't necessarily have enough experience

04:42.040 --> 04:43.600
to back it up.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.920
People want 10 years of DevOps experience.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.760
Well, what does that even mean?

04:47.760 --> 04:51.160
DevOps hasn't really even been around for 10 years as a concept.

04:51.160 --> 04:55.120
So people want a good example in my line of work,

04:55.120 --> 04:58.320
10 years of OpenShift, 10 years of Kubernetes experience.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.080
Well, good luck.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.120
Yeah, it's like one part a joke.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.580
But it is also a real problem.

05:04.580 --> 05:06.480
And everybody thinks they're an expert.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.880
And it's not just the small guys.

05:07.880 --> 05:08.880
I'm picking on WISE here.

05:08.880 --> 05:12.880
But YaoMei, the ginormous Chinese corporation,

05:12.880 --> 05:16.680
had some sort of issue on their back end proxy service.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.800
So Google had to completely disable the ability

05:18.800 --> 05:20.500
to pull up YaoMei cameras because it

05:20.500 --> 05:24.360
was showing other folks' cameras inside other homes.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.920
You'd ask the Google Smart Home to show your camera.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.760
And it would show you somebody, a complete stranger's camera.

05:30.760 --> 05:31.920
That was freaky.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.680
I remember looking at that one on Reddit

05:33.680 --> 05:37.360
and seeing just the video and the kind of panic

05:37.360 --> 05:41.320
almost that Reddit went into frenzy over that one.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.680
And for once, it was justified.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.720
And Google pulled the plug pretty quick that day.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.160
I'm kind of glad they can.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.620
They just revoked Xiaomi's token.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.600
And they're good to go.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.680
That's why I was pretty impressed

05:52.680 --> 05:54.760
when you were setting up your own self-hosted cameras

05:54.760 --> 05:55.560
at the new place.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.680
So you're in the new house now.

05:57.680 --> 05:58.540
I am.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.920
And you have been on a project streak.

06:01.920 --> 06:05.540
I've been so impressed with how much you've actually just

06:05.540 --> 06:06.160
gotten done.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.460
Like, you're not waiting around.

06:07.460 --> 06:10.080
You've got thermostats, cameras, lighting.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.560
I mean, gradual.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.200
There's so much to talk about, Alex.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.600
But why don't we talk about the cameras

06:14.600 --> 06:16.360
that you installed, because it's perfectly

06:16.360 --> 06:17.780
in line with the camera corner.

06:17.780 --> 06:19.840
Well, so in the last house, I was renting.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.280
And this one, we bought a house.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.000
And I can run ethernet, so I can do what I want.

06:25.000 --> 06:25.680
Oh, yeah.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.560
So I've run Cat 6A from the basement to the attic.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.320
That was literally the first big job that we did.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.000
So my server's down in the basement.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.080
And I've got a humidity sensor down there.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.160
And so far, it's not been above 63%, 64%.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.160
So we're looking tasty on the basement front.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.160
Isn't that nice to know in a new place?

06:45.160 --> 06:47.800
And all that information gets fed into Home Assistant,

06:47.800 --> 06:48.760
and therefore Grafana.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.720
So I could already look back at the last two,

06:51.720 --> 06:54.560
three weeks' worth of data and say, we've had a bit of rain,

06:54.560 --> 06:55.440
not too much.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.280
And say, look, my basement is fine.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.360
I don't need the dehumidifier or whatever.

07:00.360 --> 07:01.600
That's so cool.

07:01.600 --> 07:06.760
So running Cat 6A because, and here's the reason,

07:06.760 --> 07:11.000
I wanted to future-proof it so I could run 10 gig over copper.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.760
Yeah, that doesn't surprise me at all.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.000
I'm curious if you're also doing POE for these cameras.

07:16.000 --> 07:16.520
I am.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.480
Yeah, so I looked at a bunch of options.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.280
Unifi makes some really great gear.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.060
But ultimately, I didn't want to be

07:23.060 --> 07:26.440
locked into their kind of proprietary ecosystem

07:26.440 --> 07:27.220
with the cameras.

07:27.220 --> 07:30.200
I had a couple of Nest cams from the last house

07:30.200 --> 07:32.680
and a thermostat, actually.

07:32.680 --> 07:36.600
But after they retired the Works with Nest API program,

07:36.600 --> 07:39.160
I have sworn off that Nest train.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.400
Yeah, that's your warning shot.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.120
If you don't learn your lesson from that.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.000
Yeah.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.920
So I wanted something that was completely not going

07:46.920 --> 07:49.720
to rely on the vendor ever.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.440
So I bought two different brands of cameras to try out.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.640
And I like them both.

07:55.640 --> 08:03.120
So I bought an Amcrest 4K IP8M T2499EW.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.800
That rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

08:04.800 --> 08:07.560
And then that's plugged into Shinobi with an RTSP feed.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.640
So those were my requirements, really.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.400
POE, RTSP.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.240
Absolutely.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.160
And then the rest, generally speaking,

08:15.160 --> 08:17.600
comes that they do night vision.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.440
They do all the rest of it.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.960
And they're working pretty well and pretty reliably?

08:21.960 --> 08:23.040
Yes, perfect, dude.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.000
Every time I log into Shinobi, it's right there.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.240
Now, I haven't actually had the time

08:27.240 --> 08:30.240
to go in and configure motion and that kind of thing,

08:30.240 --> 08:31.880
like recordings and stuff.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.220
But I tried a couple of different ways to run Shinobi.

08:34.220 --> 08:36.280
The first one was out of a Docker container

08:36.280 --> 08:38.880
that my friend Alex wrote.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.720
He's one of the Linux server guys.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.240
And it was fine.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.880
But I was getting about a 5 to 10 second lag.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.560
And I couldn't really figure it out.

08:46.560 --> 08:50.680
And so I hopped onto the Discord with Moeis Cool, who I think

08:50.680 --> 08:52.560
is part of the Shinobi project.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.520
And he helped me out with a few different things.

08:54.520 --> 08:55.640
Oh, that's awesome.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.080
Yeah, I know it is, right?

08:57.080 --> 08:58.440
I love open source.

08:58.440 --> 09:02.920
And I built an Ubuntu VM on my ESXi box.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.280
And I'm running Shinobi in there.

09:04.280 --> 09:07.280
And my lag is down to maybe one, one and a half seconds.

09:07.280 --> 09:07.920
There you go.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.440
I can hear a car door close outside.

09:10.440 --> 09:11.520
And it's sort of.

09:11.520 --> 09:12.480
That's pretty good.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.520
Yeah, I like it a lot.

09:13.520 --> 09:17.280
So if I hear a van pull up, there's no window behind me.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.160
So I can't see the front driveway from where I'm sat.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.440
I just have Shinobi on a screen next to me all the time.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.680
And I can see perfectly what's going on in 4K.

09:24.680 --> 09:25.760
It's great.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.560
So Amcrest was one of them.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.480
Amcrest, OK.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.200
And then the other one, I bought a pair of Reolink cameras.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.800
Now, the reason I bought three cameras

09:32.800 --> 09:37.160
was because the Amcrest 4K was about $100.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.160
The Reolinks were about $50 each.

09:40.160 --> 09:43.120
They don't have 4K, I don't think.

09:43.120 --> 09:47.120
But they're like 2.5K five megapixel sensors.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.520
So my rationale for that was I want the camera I'm going to use

09:50.520 --> 09:52.200
the most is the driveway.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.920
And then the other cameras I'll use,

09:53.920 --> 09:57.040
I'll put one in the back garden and watch the deer run past.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.080
Yeah, sure.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.280
And then have another one looking up the street.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.360
4K is nice not just for future proofing,

10:03.360 --> 10:05.680
but also for getting enough resolution

10:05.680 --> 10:08.120
to read license plates in the driveway and stuff.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.640
That's where 4K can be nice.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.680
I can see individual raindrops in the puddles outside my house.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.200
It's phenomenal.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.720
It's so great.

10:15.720 --> 10:18.680
So out of the couple there, though, the two brands,

10:18.680 --> 10:22.360
sounds like you like the slightly more expensive Amcrest

10:22.360 --> 10:23.080
ones.

10:23.080 --> 10:23.960
I do.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.160
But is it worth twice the price?

10:26.160 --> 10:27.280
I don't know.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.080
If you were to do a blind test and put them on a 1080p screen,

10:30.080 --> 10:31.920
which in reality, they're only ever

10:31.920 --> 10:34.000
going to be one quarter of a 1080p panel

10:34.000 --> 10:38.440
for 99% of their life, I couldn't tell the difference.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.040
So is it worth it?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.840
Probably not.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.120
But I've already bought it, so.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.720
And they'll probably last quite a while.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.320
I do hope so, yeah.

10:47.320 --> 10:51.880
I'm really curious to know if anyone has suggestions for me.

10:51.880 --> 10:55.480
Because I'm pretty satisfied with interior cameras,

10:55.480 --> 10:57.480
but now I want exterior cameras.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.560
That would be really nice.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.760
Somebody was in the yard just the other day.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.800
A rando was in our yard the other day.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.000
And the only one I have is the dash camera.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.840
Something like this, I really like the idea,

11:06.840 --> 11:11.000
although I've been not a big fan of running ethernet in an RV.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.240
Yeah, I can imagine.

11:12.240 --> 11:13.800
Something I can mount on the outside.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.400
And I'll tell you what, PoE switches

11:15.400 --> 11:18.800
are a whole minefield of different standards,

11:18.800 --> 11:21.600
and specs, and voltages, and all sorts of nonsense.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.920
Oh, yeah, was that a rabbit hole?

11:22.920 --> 11:25.240
Did you spend forever doing research and stuff?

11:25.240 --> 11:25.720
It was.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.160
It was about an evening.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.960
I wasted about maybe four or five hours just researching

11:29.960 --> 11:31.800
PoE switches.

11:31.800 --> 11:36.320
And I settled on $100 Netgear eight port PoE switch,

11:36.320 --> 11:40.240
which is compatible with my two UniFi access points,

11:40.240 --> 11:41.680
as well as the three cameras.

11:41.680 --> 11:45.320
And it will do, I think, 80, 90 watts or something total.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.960
So it's going to be totally fine for what I need.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.040
So before we completely get out of camera corner,

11:50.040 --> 11:51.600
I did want to ask you about that.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.280
Sounds like these are all ethernet,

11:53.280 --> 11:56.160
but you did install new APs.

11:56.160 --> 11:59.520
I bought a pair of UniFi AP AC Pros

11:59.520 --> 12:01.640
when I lived in London, because my flat in London

12:01.640 --> 12:03.640
was long and thin with brick walls.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.560
Even though it was a 700 square foot apartment,

12:05.560 --> 12:07.020
I still needed two of the darn things

12:07.020 --> 12:09.480
to get signal at the front and the back of the house.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.120
I have two for my RV.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.080
I assume it's the metal wall or something.

12:13.080 --> 12:13.960
It kills signal.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.240
So I have one in the bedroom and one in the living room.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.720
Yeah, so I'm still running the UniFi controller in the cloud

12:19.720 --> 12:22.440
on a droplet with DigitalOcean.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.880
And yeah, I'm now actually using the UniFi component

12:25.880 --> 12:28.160
of Home Assistant to do presence detection.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.840
And one of the other projects, which we'll

12:29.840 --> 12:33.160
get to in the next episode, is my automated garage door

12:33.160 --> 12:34.040
opener.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.720
And so I'm actually using the presence detection of UniFi

12:36.720 --> 12:40.060
and Live 360 combined to automatically open

12:40.060 --> 12:41.640
my garage door and all sorts of stuff.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.840
But we'll get to that.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.360
Oh, boy.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.180
OK.

12:45.180 --> 12:48.540
So I am currently watching the Wi-Fi market

12:48.540 --> 12:49.920
to see what direction I want to go.

12:49.920 --> 12:53.440
I'm not huge on the requirement of the UniFi controller.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.680
I'm not huge on that.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.980
And I would love to see somebody come along and really

12:56.980 --> 12:58.040
challenge UniFi.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.440
Well, it's not a requirement.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.840
OK, it's just when you want to set it up,

13:01.840 --> 13:03.960
you can do it through the app these days.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.280
And if the controller goes away, these APs

13:06.280 --> 13:07.920
will continue working forevermore

13:07.920 --> 13:09.360
until you reconfigure them.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.240
I mean, the Home Assistant integrations really

13:11.240 --> 13:14.000
might put it over the top.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.600
I just love Home Assistant so much

13:15.600 --> 13:17.960
that if it works with Home Assistant, I'm like,

13:17.960 --> 13:19.800
I'll use a controller then.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.300
Cool, Alex.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.200
Well, congratulations on the move

13:22.200 --> 13:25.080
and congratulations on the new setups.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.840
Sometimes you can let that stuff get away and never get to it

13:27.840 --> 13:31.240
and all these projects build up, but you have been cracking.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.720
Oh, I've been so excited about this house, you know?

13:33.720 --> 13:37.640
So how the heck did you find time for our little app

13:37.640 --> 13:38.720
this week?

13:38.720 --> 13:40.600
So when you're running ethernet, turns out

13:40.600 --> 13:42.480
you want to figure out whether what you've run

13:42.480 --> 13:44.640
is actually capable of what you hope it is.

13:44.640 --> 13:45.440
Of course.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.520
I found an app called LibreSpeed,

13:47.520 --> 13:50.520
which you can run in a Docker container.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.560
And I do on my server.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.360
And this thing, it's a little web app

13:55.360 --> 13:57.380
that you can run in a browser.

13:57.380 --> 13:58.680
There's an Android app as well.

13:58.680 --> 14:01.600
And the HTML5 version should work

14:01.600 --> 14:05.200
in the browser of an iOS or any other flavor of device.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.720
So I love this for myself.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.780
I threw this on a Docker container in the RV.

14:08.780 --> 14:12.600
And when I move about, it's a very simple, reliable,

14:12.600 --> 14:14.800
and reproducible way for me to measure

14:14.800 --> 14:16.040
the speed of my connection.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.660
And one of the things that it highlights,

14:17.660 --> 14:19.160
which is extremely important to me,

14:19.160 --> 14:22.440
is the actual jitter level of your connection, which

14:22.440 --> 14:24.360
can have a huge impact on VoIP calls.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.560
It's nice if you think about the possibilities here.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.760
Normally, we rely on speedtest.net

14:28.760 --> 14:32.600
to figure out how fast our Wi-Fi is, how fast our 4G is,

14:32.600 --> 14:33.480
all that kind of stuff.

14:33.480 --> 14:37.640
And a lot of providers actually seriously prioritize

14:37.640 --> 14:40.960
that traffic because they know that people will call into the

14:40.960 --> 14:43.440
call center and say, hey, my internet's

14:43.440 --> 14:44.600
only getting 300.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.240
You promised me 400, blah, blah, blah.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.720
So a lot of providers actually really prioritize

14:49.720 --> 14:51.140
those packets heavily.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.880
So a really good way to test you're

14:52.880 --> 14:56.760
getting what your ISP says you should be getting

14:56.760 --> 14:58.600
is to just run some normal traffic

14:58.600 --> 15:00.840
to a self-hosted droplet.

15:00.840 --> 15:04.480
Yeah, or run it on a droplet or a VPS of whatever provider

15:04.480 --> 15:06.240
and ensure that you're getting the speeds

15:06.240 --> 15:09.800
that you're paying for because it's so simple to start.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.960
It took me seven seconds to get it up and running

15:12.960 --> 15:14.920
in a container.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.480
We'll put a snippet of the Docker compose

15:17.480 --> 15:19.320
YAML in the show notes.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.020
But it is super-duper simple to run.

15:22.020 --> 15:25.040
And it shows you your ping and your jitter, like Chris said.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.600
But for me, the most important thing

15:26.600 --> 15:28.240
was I could run it on my desktop,

15:28.240 --> 15:30.380
plug it into the ethernet that I'd just run,

15:30.380 --> 15:32.880
and see that I was getting that gigabit speed that I wanted.

15:32.880 --> 15:36.600
So not only could I plug in my ethernet cable tester

15:36.600 --> 15:38.480
and check the pairs are all OK, I

15:38.480 --> 15:40.880
could check that the 200, 300-foot run that I'd just

15:40.880 --> 15:42.960
done was actually giving me the speeds

15:42.960 --> 15:45.160
between my desktop and my server that I wanted.

15:45.160 --> 15:49.040
I could also make a half bonus suggestion for stat ping

15:49.040 --> 15:50.680
in this category, too.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.880
I'll put a link to stat ping in the show notes.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.480
And that just gives you an overall health

15:55.480 --> 15:58.200
check of the quality of your connection,

15:58.200 --> 16:01.680
the average response time, the 24-hour uptime,

16:01.680 --> 16:03.960
and your overall uptime for the last seven days.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.480
And it gives you a graph of that.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.280
So you can see how reliable your connection's been,

16:07.280 --> 16:08.720
which is super handy for me.

16:08.720 --> 16:13.000
Status.ktz.cloud is my stat ping instance.

16:13.000 --> 16:13.920
There you go.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.560
I'll tell you what's interesting was when I moved house.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.600
So I went from AT&T Fiber to Spectrum,

16:19.600 --> 16:24.160
which is a DOCSIS 3.1 cable connection, same as Virgin

16:24.160 --> 16:26.000
Media in the UK, I think, use.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.380
And I noticed my average response time

16:30.380 --> 16:33.960
went from about 8 milliseconds to about 35 milliseconds.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.280
Ooh, womp womp.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.860
Yeah, you were a little worried about it, maybe justifiably so

16:38.860 --> 16:40.080
then.

16:40.080 --> 16:40.920
Yeah, a little bit.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.320
I mean, I've sacrificed my gigabit upload

16:43.320 --> 16:46.120
for 35 meg upload, which hurts.

16:46.120 --> 16:49.120
But it's a nice house.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.340
It's an opportunity to just engineer things

16:51.340 --> 16:51.960
slightly different.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.000
That's how I look at it.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.120
I mean, that's where my whole project off-grid thing really

16:55.120 --> 16:56.120
came from.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.720
So what's going on with off-grid then?

16:57.720 --> 17:00.240
So project off-grid is my personal project

17:00.240 --> 17:03.480
to essentially get a bit of an internet presence

17:03.480 --> 17:04.680
while offline.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.880
I've moved all of my IoT devices to be

17:06.880 --> 17:09.320
controlled by Home Assistant, been setting up

17:09.320 --> 17:14.360
things like offline readers and caches of movies and games.

17:14.360 --> 17:15.920
And part of this project off-grid

17:15.920 --> 17:17.760
has always eventually been solar.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.840
So that way, I could be off-grid in terms of power generation

17:20.840 --> 17:22.120
as well.

17:22.120 --> 17:23.920
So I'm starting to look at that right now

17:23.920 --> 17:27.760
because there's a lot of other motivating factors.

17:27.760 --> 17:31.100
Our setup right now is it's a 50 amp connection to shore.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.640
So when I'm plugged into shore power,

17:32.640 --> 17:34.260
I've got 50 amps of power to work with.

17:34.260 --> 17:35.120
That's plenty.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.720
When I am mobile, it's much less.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.800
It's an 1,800-watt inverter.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.280
So I have about eight.

17:41.280 --> 17:44.980
It can go up to 2,000, but it's an 1,800-watt inverter.

17:44.980 --> 17:48.320
And I've got two lithium-ion batteries.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.220
It's not very much room to work with.

17:50.220 --> 17:53.240
So I've been planning to upgrade the whole system,

17:53.240 --> 17:55.200
and I'm ready to make a plunge.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.920
And I kind of want to run past you

17:56.920 --> 17:59.160
with what I think I'm going to do for project off-grid.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.240
How long can you go on battery power then?

18:01.240 --> 18:05.920
Right now, about anywhere between six to 12 hours

18:05.920 --> 18:10.320
in a really kind of conservative run, just the bare minimum,

18:10.320 --> 18:13.600
keep the fridge on, a few lights, and maybe the TV.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.300
Oh, that's right.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.240
You've got to run a flipping fridge.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.840
Yeah, I've got a residential fridge.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.480
And it's a 40-foot RV, so it's a big RV.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.640
And there's a lot of stuff in there.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.160
And only a few of the plugs are on the inverter.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.880
And the inverter is a modified sine wave,

18:28.880 --> 18:31.320
so it really messes with my audio equipment.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.680
It creates a lot of buzz in the audio.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.720
It's bad.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.280
And the UPSs, I take it.

18:36.280 --> 18:40.160
And it's aggressive, and it does not work with UPSs.

18:40.160 --> 18:44.160
So I'm looking at going with three solar panels.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.120
I have room for more, but I want to start small at first,

18:47.120 --> 18:49.840
because I am in the Pacific Northwest, which would bring

18:49.840 --> 18:53.760
in 510 watts of solar, but would, in theory,

18:53.760 --> 18:56.280
be expandable to 1,000 watts.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.280
I have the room, and the system can handle it.

18:58.280 --> 19:01.560
So what are you realistically expecting from that 500-watt

19:01.560 --> 19:03.400
panel in Seattle?

19:03.400 --> 19:06.360
Well, or when I travel outside of Seattle,

19:06.360 --> 19:07.900
down in Arizona or Texas.

19:07.900 --> 19:08.600
Yeah, that's a good point.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.400
I'll tell you what.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.640
That's probably your more usual use case for the solar, right?

19:12.640 --> 19:13.840
Not at home.

19:13.840 --> 19:14.360
Good point.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.120
Yeah, and while you're going down the road,

19:16.120 --> 19:17.640
it'll be charging, too.

19:17.640 --> 19:21.400
But even, say, at Linux Fest Northwest, there's sun

19:21.400 --> 19:23.600
sometimes.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.320
I mean, it was quite sunny last year.

19:25.320 --> 19:29.200
So the idea would be that it sort of supplements your power.

19:29.200 --> 19:33.680
And you go from maybe being able to stay parked for 12 hours,

19:33.680 --> 19:35.760
which would be really kind of tight right now,

19:35.760 --> 19:38.680
to maybe 24 hours, to kind of bring

19:38.680 --> 19:40.240
in a little supplemental power.

19:40.240 --> 19:43.680
I have a generator on board, too, which I can run and charge

19:43.680 --> 19:44.440
up the batteries.

19:44.440 --> 19:45.760
I can't currently do that.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.120
Burning those dead dinosaurs is effective.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.160
It's very effective.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.120
So that's why I kind of thought I'd go balanced.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.680
I'd go with just 510 watts of solar,

19:53.680 --> 19:55.000
plus I have a generator.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.500
So between the two of them, I could charge up a battery bank.

19:58.500 --> 20:03.560
And then as part of this, add three more 100-amp-hour

20:03.560 --> 20:07.960
Battleborn lithium batteries, a Victron MultiPlus 3000 VA

20:07.960 --> 20:12.240
inverter, and upgrade the alternator charging system

20:12.240 --> 20:15.880
in the RV engine so it can charge this battery bank.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.200
Because when it's all said and done,

20:18.200 --> 20:20.280
there'll be like five or six lithium ion batteries

20:20.280 --> 20:21.680
this thing's got to charge.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.920
And so what's your expected run time at the end of this?

20:24.920 --> 20:26.800
I don't have a final number yet.

20:26.800 --> 20:27.760
What do you want?

20:27.760 --> 20:30.600
I'm shooting for 24 or 48 hours.

20:30.600 --> 20:34.480
Well, 24 or 48, there's only 100% difference there.

20:34.480 --> 20:34.980
I know.

20:34.980 --> 20:37.800
Well, it depends on if my current lithium ion batteries

20:37.800 --> 20:38.920
are usable or not.

20:38.920 --> 20:39.520
OK.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.760
I'm working with a company called AM Solar, really, really

20:42.760 --> 20:46.320
well-known, well-respected, good craftsmanship kind of company

20:46.320 --> 20:47.760
based out of Oregon.

20:47.760 --> 20:51.200
Do you have a guess on what this rough price for a system

20:51.200 --> 20:52.440
like this would cost?

20:52.440 --> 20:53.120
Oh, lord.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.320
So I was looking at solar for the roof of my house,

20:56.320 --> 20:59.320
just with the Tesla Powerwall stuff.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.560
I'm not in a position to buy it.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.440
But it was like 15 or 16 grand.

21:03.440 --> 21:06.400
So this is a much smaller scale system.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.040
But then again, it's in an RV, so it's

21:08.040 --> 21:10.000
got to be earthquake proof.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.880
So I'd say similar.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.320
Let's go 10, 15 grand, something like that.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.440
Yeah, it's 15 grand.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.880
Oh, wow.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.960
15 grand, yeah.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.320
Now, that takes the whole system and replaces

21:21.320 --> 21:23.160
my entire electrical system.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.400
It's a pure sine wave inverter.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.200
All of my outlets would be powered,

21:27.200 --> 21:29.480
which is actually pretty important since I have a CPAP

21:29.480 --> 21:31.000
and other things.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.040
And it would mean we'd have the capability

21:34.040 --> 21:36.800
when we were visiting somewhere that wasn't wired for an RV.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.120
This is such a cool feature.

21:38.120 --> 21:42.040
And you could plug my entire RV into a standard wall outlet

21:42.040 --> 21:45.760
with an extension cord, like you would a vacuum cleaner.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.800
And the Victron system, you set it.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.800
You say, hey, I'm on a, you set it,

21:50.800 --> 21:53.400
say don't use more than 15 amps from shore power.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.960
The Victron system, once you have that set,

21:56.960 --> 21:59.720
when it senses load more than the 15 amps,

21:59.720 --> 22:02.440
it will pull the additional power it requires

22:02.440 --> 22:04.200
from the battery bank.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.680
So that way, you can just keep on using stuff in the RV.

22:06.680 --> 22:10.040
You can peak above 15 amps and it'll just make up

22:10.040 --> 22:11.160
the difference from the batteries.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.120
And that, for the style of travel we do,

22:14.120 --> 22:17.720
would be so killer because I show up in the RV

22:17.720 --> 22:19.480
to do a podcast about a place.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.760
We did this at Dell, we did this at Linux Academy.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.560
We just, we've done this so often.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.240
And they're not wired for an RV.

22:25.240 --> 22:27.040
Like they can give me some power,

22:27.040 --> 22:28.880
but they're not, this is not an RV park.

22:28.880 --> 22:32.000
And this would let me hang there for days at a time,

22:32.000 --> 22:35.280
get the work done and have just the right amount of power.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.320
I don't even know how that would work.

22:37.320 --> 22:39.320
It's amazing, that is magic to me.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.560
It really is pretty cool.

22:40.560 --> 22:44.840
And with that, I would be completely off-grid

22:44.840 --> 22:47.520
because we'd have, we'd be generating our own power.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.280
We store our own water.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.000
We'd have our own network with Home Assistant

22:52.000 --> 22:56.200
that does all of this automation off-grid, offline.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.200
It's really cool, it's really close.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.560
And so I was talking to the shop

22:59.560 --> 23:01.680
because they're a really in-demand place.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.320
And they were telling me if I do it in January, February,

23:05.320 --> 23:07.560
I can probably get it done in the next six months.

23:07.560 --> 23:11.000
If I go much beyond January, February,

23:11.000 --> 23:12.880
it's, they're booked months out.

23:12.880 --> 23:16.560
Well, six months is still booked months out in my opinion.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.560
They must be in demand.

23:17.560 --> 23:20.480
So here's another suggestion.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.160
There's a program on YouTube called Fully Charged,

23:25.160 --> 23:27.880
which is by, what's the name of the guy in Red Dwarf

23:27.880 --> 23:30.080
with like the blocky face?

23:30.080 --> 23:32.240
Robert Llewellyn, I think is his name.

23:32.240 --> 23:35.280
He runs a YouTube show called Fully Charged.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.800
And they talk all about electric cars

23:36.800 --> 23:38.840
and electric vehicles and stuff.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.760
And he was showing off some cool stuff

23:40.760 --> 23:45.760
with using his Tesla as like a power wall for his house.

23:47.320 --> 23:50.840
So not only did he have the power wall on the wall,

23:50.840 --> 23:54.760
but he was using his car as a residual battery pack as well.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.640
So I'm wondering if you ever bought an electric car,

23:57.640 --> 23:59.520
you could plug it into this inverter system

23:59.520 --> 24:02.320
and then go and charge your car at a fast charger

24:02.320 --> 24:04.120
and then bring that electric home.

24:04.120 --> 24:08.000
Or charge the car while the RV is going down the road.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.680
The RV is generating power, more power than I can use

24:11.680 --> 24:13.360
because the alternator is running,

24:13.360 --> 24:15.320
the solar would be collecting power.

24:15.320 --> 24:18.280
If I could charge an electric vehicle

24:18.280 --> 24:20.720
that I was towing behind the RV while I'm driving

24:20.720 --> 24:22.120
and then I would get to my destination

24:22.120 --> 24:23.600
and my car is fully charged.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.680
But additionally,

24:24.680 --> 24:26.520
this is something I've actually been looking into.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.040
A lot of electric vehicles have regenerative braking.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.080
You know, about regenerative braking.

24:31.080 --> 24:34.640
If you're towing an electric vehicle behind an RV

24:34.640 --> 24:36.160
and using its braking,

24:36.160 --> 24:37.680
doing what's called four down towing

24:37.680 --> 24:39.520
where all four wheels are down on the road

24:39.520 --> 24:41.000
when you're towing the electric vehicle

24:41.000 --> 24:43.040
and you use the brakes of the electric vehicle,

24:43.040 --> 24:46.120
it does in fact charge the batteries

24:46.120 --> 24:47.360
of the electric vehicle.

24:47.360 --> 24:50.520
As an F1 guy, I love all of that stuff,

24:50.520 --> 24:52.920
like trickling down into road cars and things.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.080
Yeah, yeah.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.560
So a few years ago, they brought in something

24:55.560 --> 24:57.760
called Kerr's Kinetic Energy Recovery System,

24:57.760 --> 24:59.120
which they were like,

24:59.120 --> 25:00.880
oh, this is gonna be the future of the road car.

25:00.880 --> 25:03.240
And everyone at the time was like, no, what a load of BS.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.760
But no, it's actually real

25:04.760 --> 25:07.720
and people are actually using it and it's the future.

25:07.720 --> 25:08.560
I just don't know.

25:08.560 --> 25:13.000
I mean, you know, $15,000 is such a massive commitment.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.640
So how much of it can you take with you

25:14.640 --> 25:17.040
if you were to ever replace dupes with something else?

25:17.040 --> 25:19.080
Like how much can you take with you?

25:19.080 --> 25:21.880
And you could take probably the panels and parts of it,

25:21.880 --> 25:24.560
but I would probably be more inclined to leave it in

25:24.560 --> 25:28.320
because it adds a considerable amount of value to the RV.

25:28.320 --> 25:32.240
This is a top of the line system and installed by AM Solar,

25:32.240 --> 25:34.800
so it's top of the line installers too.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.640
That's always the thing,

25:35.640 --> 25:37.280
when you wanna put an extension on your house,

25:37.280 --> 25:39.440
like when we were looking at houses in North Carolina,

25:39.440 --> 25:41.440
they had swimming pools and we were like,

25:41.440 --> 25:42.960
oh, does a swimming pool add value?

25:42.960 --> 25:44.440
And the realtor was like, nope.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.360
So you could spend 50 grand on putting a swimming pool in

25:47.360 --> 25:48.960
and get none of it back, so.

25:48.960 --> 25:52.240
Yeah, but a solar system on the other hand,

25:52.240 --> 25:54.520
that is pretty, especially in the RV space,

25:54.520 --> 25:56.280
everybody wants solar eventually.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.960
It's something that's been on my list.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.760
Let me know what you think about that.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.840
If you've got experience with the Victron system,

26:02.840 --> 26:06.080
especially, this is an esoteric ask,

26:06.080 --> 26:08.440
but if anybody's gonna be out there

26:08.440 --> 26:11.560
that would have any information on this, it's our audience.

26:11.560 --> 26:14.160
If you know how to use say Bluetooth or something like that

26:14.160 --> 26:18.120
to get the stats out of a Victron unit into Home Assistant

26:18.120 --> 26:21.840
and then into Grafana, please contact me

26:21.840 --> 26:25.120
because this is a big part of what I want to do

26:25.120 --> 26:28.200
is have real-time information on how much power

26:28.200 --> 26:29.800
my entire system is using

26:29.800 --> 26:31.560
and then I wanna graph it over time

26:31.560 --> 26:33.880
and then I wanna teach people how to do this.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.960
So I'd really love to hear from somebody,

26:35.960 --> 26:39.800
selfhosted.show slash contact or at Chris Elias on Twitter

26:39.800 --> 26:42.480
and let me know because man, oh man,

26:42.480 --> 26:44.280
I think the potential there,

26:44.280 --> 26:46.080
the kind of data I could pull off these units

26:46.080 --> 26:48.440
that are running and monitoring everything

26:48.440 --> 26:50.240
could be phenomenal.

26:50.240 --> 26:54.240
Eric got in touch with us via selfhosted.show slash contact

26:54.240 --> 26:57.560
to say, I just wanted to send a quick thanks for the show

26:57.560 --> 27:00.080
and sharing Alex's favorite smart plug.

27:00.080 --> 27:03.360
I just ordered the four pack of the Tekin SP20 plugs,

27:03.360 --> 27:05.320
figured out what TAS motor is

27:05.320 --> 27:06.840
and did the over the air flash

27:06.840 --> 27:09.720
with the amazing two-year convert script.

27:09.720 --> 27:12.560
Yes, awesome, well done.

27:12.560 --> 27:13.680
That is good to hear.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.720
Yeah, and now they're yours forever.

27:15.720 --> 27:16.840
Absolutely are.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.040
That is so cool.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.360
The other one that I really recommend,

27:19.360 --> 27:20.760
so the SP20s are great.

27:20.760 --> 27:23.400
They seem to work pretty well with two-year convert.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.840
And the other one is the SS31 that Tekin make

27:26.840 --> 27:28.560
and this is a pretty cool one.

27:28.560 --> 27:33.080
It's got four AC outlets and four USB plugs

27:33.080 --> 27:34.680
and there are five relays in there.

27:34.680 --> 27:38.280
So you can turn on and off all the USB ports at once

27:38.280 --> 27:41.360
and then each of the AC ports has its own relay

27:41.360 --> 27:42.360
in it as well.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.920
And they work flawlessly with two-year convert.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.760
I'm using my Raspberry Pi 4

27:46.760 --> 27:51.200
and I get it out of the box and within maybe two minutes,

27:51.200 --> 27:53.080
this thing has TAS motor on it.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.960
When you say it, you say it like two-year convert

27:55.960 --> 27:57.960
but it's two-ya convert.

27:57.960 --> 28:00.720
T-U-Y-A convert.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.000
Yeah. Yeah.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.720
Two-ya.

28:03.720 --> 28:04.760
Yeah, exactly.

28:04.760 --> 28:05.600
Well, great.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.500
That's really awesome.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.600
It is awesome.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.920
I'll tell you what else is awesome, smart doorbells.

28:09.920 --> 28:14.280
So David Carollo, I'm sorry if I butchered that name,

28:14.280 --> 28:18.600
I'm talking about Ring doorbells, camera devices, et cetera.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.780
Any advice on installing your own?

28:20.780 --> 28:22.500
Oh, great question.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.900
Ring did just issue an update by the way,

28:24.900 --> 28:27.560
allowing you to opt in or not

28:27.560 --> 28:29.960
if your footage is shared with law enforcement.

28:29.960 --> 28:30.960
Nice to see.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.920
But I think everyone's been scared off the product

28:32.920 --> 28:34.200
but they've sort of proven out

28:34.200 --> 28:35.520
that there's some usefulness to it.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.360
I disagree.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.600
So one of my new neighbors invited to me

28:38.600 --> 28:41.160
to his poker night on Friday.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.120
And it was really interesting.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.440
It was very eye-opening for me

28:44.440 --> 28:46.920
to hear what normal people think.

28:46.920 --> 28:51.480
Oh, this is absolutely good on the ground research.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.560
I attend these kinds of things myself as well.

28:53.560 --> 28:54.400
Yeah.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.240
And they were talking about

28:55.240 --> 28:56.600
all the different streaming services

28:56.600 --> 28:58.200
they're subscribed to and about,

28:58.200 --> 28:59.200
oh, have you seen this show?

28:59.200 --> 29:00.040
It's on Hulu.

29:00.040 --> 29:00.860
Have you seen that one?

29:00.860 --> 29:01.700
It's on Amazon.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.480
It was really fun to listen to

29:04.480 --> 29:08.020
sort of normal non-technical people talk about this stuff.

29:08.020 --> 29:09.760
But the other thing they were talking a lot about

29:09.760 --> 29:11.040
were Ring doorbells.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.400
And they're like, oh, they're amazing.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.240
They're so great.

29:13.240 --> 29:14.640
Like I've got one on my garage door

29:14.640 --> 29:15.680
and one on my front door

29:15.680 --> 29:16.520
and one on my back door.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.720
And I'm like, so you've got three of these things?

29:18.720 --> 29:20.380
Oh yeah, we just pay the subscription

29:20.380 --> 29:22.520
and I can look back 30 days in my history and all that.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.280
I'm like, oh, okay.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.600
Like trying to play the dumb ignorant guy

29:26.600 --> 29:28.120
to get them to tell me more stuff.

29:28.120 --> 29:29.660
Did you just turn up the accent a little bit?

29:29.660 --> 29:30.800
Oh, interesting.

29:30.800 --> 29:31.640
Yeah.

29:31.640 --> 29:33.280
Oh yes, that's very interesting.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.400
This is such good data though

29:36.400 --> 29:37.400
because you get an idea

29:37.400 --> 29:40.760
with what compels and appeals the average consumer.

29:40.760 --> 29:42.440
Right, yeah, normal people.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.280
Yeah.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.440
As much as I love you, Chris,

29:44.440 --> 29:46.280
you and I are not normal people.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.680
No, I know.

29:47.680 --> 29:50.440
The things that we think are important in a device,

29:50.440 --> 29:52.600
not what the regular consumer thinks is important

29:52.600 --> 29:54.840
in the real world.

29:54.840 --> 29:55.960
To give you an example,

29:55.960 --> 29:57.920
the first project I tackled in my new house

29:57.920 --> 29:59.160
was running ethernet.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.120
Most people would replace the toilet flappers

30:01.120 --> 30:04.560
that were running for days on end as the first job.

30:04.560 --> 30:05.760
No, I ran ethernet.

30:06.960 --> 30:09.200
So what that led me to

30:09.200 --> 30:10.920
was looking at different doorbell options

30:10.920 --> 30:11.920
and seeing what was out there.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.520
And I came across a YouTube video

30:13.520 --> 30:16.400
by a company called Nelly's Security.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.520
And they make $140.

30:18.520 --> 30:20.680
Yes, that is expensive for a doorbell.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.320
They make $140, three megapixel,

30:24.320 --> 30:28.920
30 frame per second, 1080p doorbell.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.800
And this thing supports ONVIF.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.760
So it will plug straight into Shinobi

30:32.760 --> 30:35.880
and any other NVR that speaks that language.

30:35.880 --> 30:39.080
And it also has a micro SD card built into it inside.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.960
They seem like a really good company.

30:40.960 --> 30:45.000
So I'll put a link to the YouTube video in the show notes.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.080
And it seems like a normal guy

30:47.080 --> 30:49.040
just making a video about his company.

30:49.040 --> 30:52.600
So if you're listening and wanna send me one for review,

30:52.600 --> 30:53.960
I'll do that.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.080
I'm gonna buy one right now.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.400
You haven't bought one?

30:56.400 --> 30:57.320
No, not yet.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.040
Oh, well, I will buy one

30:59.040 --> 31:03.960
because I need something that is offline for the RV.

31:03.960 --> 31:08.400
And the ring doorbell used to integrate with Home Assistant,

31:08.400 --> 31:10.000
even if you didn't wanna pay for the service.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.520
And over the holidays, they killed it.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.840
They killed the integration.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.560
Merry Christmas to me.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.880
And they killed the API.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.320
They ring turned it off.

31:19.320 --> 31:23.080
And now I can't just go grab stills from the camera

31:23.080 --> 31:24.440
and show it in Home Assistant.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.040
Oh, it's disgusting, isn't it?

31:26.040 --> 31:27.920
It's so frustrating.

31:27.920 --> 31:28.960
So I'm gonna buy this.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.880
And I'll tell you if it works or not.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.320
You don't own the hardware.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.160
And I know I sound like I'm on a soapbox.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.000
I kind of am.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.200
If you require a cloud service or an API

31:38.200 --> 31:42.040
to retrieve an image, to access the feed or whatever,

31:42.040 --> 31:44.000
via the company's cloud service,

31:44.000 --> 31:45.400
you do not own that hardware.

31:45.400 --> 31:46.240
And that's one of the reasons

31:46.240 --> 31:49.240
that Tasmota on those smart plugs is so great.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.080
And that's one of the things

31:50.080 --> 31:51.800
I think that makes this doorbell so good

31:51.800 --> 31:56.000
is that if you want it to remain 100% local on your LAN

31:56.000 --> 31:59.720
forevermore until the hardware physically stops working,

31:59.720 --> 32:00.760
it will.

32:00.760 --> 32:03.960
When I'm making these purchase decisions at this new house,

32:03.960 --> 32:08.080
those are my minimum viable requirements now.

32:08.080 --> 32:09.040
I can't stress that enough.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.040
It really is a mind shift.

32:10.040 --> 32:13.120
When you re-flash something or you get it controlled locally,

32:13.120 --> 32:16.640
you look at it and you go, I can use this forever now.

32:16.640 --> 32:20.680
And over the holidays, I was gifted some smart lights.

32:20.680 --> 32:24.640
And it really, like the apps, they just suck.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.320
The whole thing is just, it's really just awful.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.200
And just being able to just be done with all of that

32:30.200 --> 32:31.040
is so nice.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.280
So I am the same way now.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.160
If I'm gonna spend my money,

32:33.160 --> 32:34.640
I'll find out this is the rare case

32:34.640 --> 32:36.840
where I don't actually look ahead of time.

32:36.840 --> 32:40.000
But since you and I both wanna know

32:40.000 --> 32:41.560
and it'd be interesting to talk about in the show,

32:41.560 --> 32:42.880
I'll go ahead and I'll grab this.

32:42.880 --> 32:43.720
I really like this to work.

32:43.720 --> 32:47.480
So I'll pick up this smart doorbell and I'll let you know.

32:47.480 --> 32:48.320
Fantastic.

32:48.320 --> 32:49.200
Can you call it smart?

32:49.200 --> 32:50.840
I mean, it's a camera doorbell.

32:50.840 --> 32:51.760
What makes it smart?

32:51.760 --> 32:53.720
I guess it would be the stuff built into Shinobi

32:53.720 --> 32:56.000
for like motion detection and all the rest of it.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.120
Yeah, I like that it has built in support

32:58.120 --> 33:00.280
for that security camera standard.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.480
That's really nice.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.440
On VIF, yeah.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.280
Yeah, on VIF.

33:04.280 --> 33:06.200
That really put it over the top for me.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.480
When you mentioned that the other week,

33:07.480 --> 33:08.360
I didn't know what it was,

33:08.360 --> 33:10.040
but now I've done a bit of camera research.

33:10.040 --> 33:12.560
I understand that that's quite an important standard

33:12.560 --> 33:14.280
for NVRs and stuff, so.

33:14.280 --> 33:15.120
Right.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.000
And the Wyze cams do not support that.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.200
I'd love to see Wyze add support for that.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.160
To be honest with you,

33:20.160 --> 33:23.320
I still like the Wyze cams for internal capture,

33:23.320 --> 33:26.080
but I think they're more casual cameras

33:26.080 --> 33:27.800
than the ones that you got.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.480
So that's something for people to keep in mind.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.560
Thanks to Eric and David for their feedback.
