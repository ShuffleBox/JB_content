00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Coming up on Self Hosted 13, Alan Pope from Canonical joins us and Alex crashes a drone

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,940
into a tree.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,940
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,940
And I'm Alex.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,200
And this is Self Hosted, episode 13.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,500
Welcome back to Self Hosted, everyone.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,800
We start today with a special guest, Mr. Alan Pope.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,800
Hey, Popey.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Hey, how you doing, guys?

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Great.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,080
I appreciate you coming on.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,280
And honestly, I think our topic today, I think you're going to make me put my words in my

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,960
emotive when you have to eat what you said, because today Popey is going to join us and

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,400
convince us why IRC is not dead.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,440
When I went on air and said IRC is totally dead, but I was actually just being a little

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
click baity.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,920
So I appreciate you being here.

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,000
You triggered me, Chris.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,560
You triggered me.

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,400
Alex, before we started the show, you and I were talking drones, and I discovered this

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,960
week that you managed to crash a drone into a tree.

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,880
And a car park and a building.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,360
And so to be clear, it's not one of the DJI balloon simulator drones.

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,800
It's a racing drone made of carbon fiber that does 70 miles an hour.

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,680
And yeah, this thing ended up in a tree.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,200
And there's a video in the show notes, one of my buddies made, where we have to fly another

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,320
drone with a rope tied to it over the tree I'd crashed into to actually shake the damn

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,320
thing out of it.

29
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,080
So yeah, that was a lot of fun.

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
That was my Sunday.

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,800
So you threw another drone at that drone?

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,960
We tied a piece of string or a rope to the bottom of another drone that I have, flew

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,940
it over the tree that it was stuck in, did a sort of loop-de-loop to try and tie it in

34
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:45,400
some kind of like a Maypole style situation around the tree, and then used the quad that

35
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,360
had just flown over with the rope as like an anchor, like a barb fishing hook or whatever,

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,200
to shoot the tree.

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,520
And it all came down and I didn't lose any drones.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,200
The only thing that happened was I snapped an arm off the drone, which sounds like a

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,360
big deal, except for the fact the frames that I use have a lifetime warranty.

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,280
So I just email them a picture and they send me a new one for five bucks every time I actually

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
have to cover shipping.

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,760
Do you send them a picture of the drone in the tree or just the drone that's broken?

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,120
You have to send them a picture of the carnage.

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,300
I posted it on Twitter about how I cracked the arm of this thing, but you can maybe see

45
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,840
how I can bend this thing.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,680
That doesn't look like it should do that.

47
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
No, that's pretty bad.

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,080
We will put a video to this in the show notes.

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,760
Were you trying to use toilet paper at first to recover this thing?

50
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,600
It looks like toilet paper, but it's actually a piece of AT&T rope that they use.

51
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,480
Like fishing string through cable.

52
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,480
It can hold like 2,000 pounds or something crazy.

53
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,440
So you were being a fancy fly boy and you were flying too close to the trees.

54
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
What happened?

55
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
Yeah.

56
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,960
Or I just ran out of talent and... Well, I have no excuse because I flew my

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,440
drone into the side of a barn the other day.

58
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,320
Can I say the tree leapt out at me?

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,680
I think barns are inanimate, aren't they?

60
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
Yeah.

61
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Yeah.

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Totally.

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
Totally.

64
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,280
Well now, before we prove why I was wrong about IRC, you have been writing recently

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,320
and I have been sneaking into your computer at night, checking your documents and following

66
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
along.

67
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,120
I don't know if I should be creeped out about this or... I think I'm creeped out.

68
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,600
Well, you did give me pseudo access after all.

69
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Oh yeah.

70
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Yeah.

71
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Maybe I should revoke that.

72
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,000
But Docker Compose workflows has been on your mind.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,280
It's funny that this came up in the show because this week I've been told by a couple of individuals

74
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,880
that Docker is dead and I asked them if they've met my friend Docker Compose because I think

75
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,040
it's sort of breathed new life into people using Docker online.

76
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,520
Every project you see now, somebody dropped some Docker Compose example along with it.

77
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,640
Why do they think Docker is dead though?

78
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,720
That's what I want to know.

79
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,000
I am the worst person to ask about Docker because I never use it for anything.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Well that's the way.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hold on.

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's a good perspective.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,320
I think there's one service that I installed, two services that I installed via Docker and

84
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,480
that's only because that's the upstream supported way of doing it and I couldn't find a better

85
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:18,360
way and that's Mastodon and Discourse and they were both upstream supported ways.

86
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
So that's what I used.

87
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,840
I don't feel part of a Docker ecosystem or I don't feel like a power user or anything.

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,560
I just pasted a command in a terminal and the service started and I was like, okay,

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
I'm done.

90
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,320
But that's how it goes the first few times, right?

91
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,400
With anything, not just Docker.

92
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,720
And that's really what it's supposed to be like, you know, if you're consuming some software

93
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,320
and you want to start a service, you just want to run a command.

94
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,080
You want to run whatever the right command is to get the thing working and then walk

95
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,800
away and leave it and then come back to it three months later and think, how did I set

96
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
this thing up?

97
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,840
I've got to do some software updates on this and I don't know.

98
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,440
I had to relearn like how to do it all and that was a learning curve.

99
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,640
But yeah, once you get over that, it's fine.

100
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,060
Yeah, that's a very fair assessment of it.

101
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,060
That's really true.

102
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,400
I just recently went back to a system I set up a couple of months ago and went, oh, oh

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
right.

104
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
I have this URL.

105
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
I go to admin it.

106
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,520
I have this URL where I go to use it.

107
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Okay.

108
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Yeah, right.

109
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
I can remember all of this.

110
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,080
And maybe that's part of what appeals to me about some of these newer install techniques

111
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
like using Docker Composes.

112
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,880
I can go read a compose file and it's all in YAML and I can have a pretty good understanding

113
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,080
of what it's doing.

114
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,280
But Alex, to answer your question, I think it's a combination of answers.

115
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,140
Fundamentally, Docker isn't doing anything that other technologies can't do because it's

116
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,240
relying on underpinning technologies that are built into the operating system.

117
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,700
So a lot of different vendors have different takes on how to solve this problem.

118
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,160
And a lot of times they are better integrated into their overall product than Docker itself

119
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,680
is.

120
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,080
And when you combine the technical aspects of what a container actually is and how any

121
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,280
Linux host operating system or many other OSs now can run them and the fact that many

122
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,760
distributions have a preferred container technology that tends to work better on their distribution

123
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,120
and ecosystem, I think it's understandable that people kind of see Docker as sort of

124
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,680
being pointless, not necessary.

125
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,040
And then you have the VM crowd as well, who is maybe not even totally bought off on the

126
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,880
idea of running applications in containers when they could just run it in a VM system.

127
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,320
I was about to argue with you that various different people didn't have their own versions

128
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
of container runtimes.

129
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,280
And then I realized that Red Hat have their own, Docker have their own, VMware have bought

130
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,320
Pivotal, so they're going to have their own, so yeah, you're totally right.

131
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,240
I can see why people might come to that conclusion.

132
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,640
And if I was on the Red Hat platform, I might use Podman.

133
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,200
And I could be wrong, but if I'm on Ubuntu, I'd probably use LXD.

134
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,680
Yep, I use LXD for everything.

135
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Right.

136
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,880
And there's even nice scripts or applications built around those tools to make setting up

137
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,640
environments super quick and fast and kind of a no brainer when you're on those platforms.

138
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:06,060
So my thrust for bringing this up really was that one of the first questions I see and

139
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,540
hear from people getting into containers for the first time is, is there a UI?

140
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,540
Is there a GUI?

141
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,640
Is there a web app that I can run that exposes this stuff to me?

142
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,180
And my general answer is you don't need one.

143
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,180
What do you think?

144
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,160
Do noobs need a UI?

145
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
What are noobs doing running containers?

146
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,240
They're running unraid boxes or free NAS boxes or...

147
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,200
Which have web UIs, don't they?

148
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,000
Or Raspberry Pis.

149
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Running what though?

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,760
You don't, nobody, nobody goes out to install a Raspberry Pi.

151
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,760
You go out because there's an appliance that you want to put on a Raspberry Pi, or there's

152
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,960
some device you want to build around a Raspberry Pi.

153
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,120
Or you just think, hmm, that's $25, I'm going to buy one.

154
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,760
And then what should I do with it when it arrives?

155
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,560
And put it in a drawer with all the others.

156
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,980
I have got a couple of Raspberry Pis here in service.

157
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,160
One is my DNS, so it does Pi-hole and blocks adverts and stuff.

158
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,440
That has a web UI.

159
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,560
I almost never use it because I just don't care.

160
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
It just works.

161
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,720
Like if I have to whitelist something, then yeah, I consider myself expert.

162
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,800
So I could use the command line, but the web UI is nicer.

163
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,000
And for other things that I run on a Pi, they have web UIs as well.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,480
So I don't know, I think it's just a nicer experience.

165
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,280
I could see the argument for being hardcore and doing it on the command line because it's,

166
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,520
you know, you have total control and power.

167
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,320
But I also quite like a pretty graph now and then.

168
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,080
I don't necessarily disagree in a couple of ways.

169
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,360
And I recently got a note from a listener who said, Chris, you're always advocating

170
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,320
people just use the command line.

171
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,860
And I have kind of in the last year and a half sort of transitioned to just learn the

172
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,880
command line because it's sort of a universal tool that will always work.

173
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,240
But working with team members that learn in different ways than I learn here on our podcast

174
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,240
team, I realized that for some of them, they want to see what the end result is that they

175
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,820
could achieve if they invest the time to learn the whole stack.

176
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,340
So if they can do something that gets them deploying software and turning on things and

177
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:29,240
actually using the end product that gets them excited and motivated, it's worth it.

178
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,840
So they'll use a GUI to sort of skip learning how to get on the command line, learning how

179
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,760
to run Docker and end up running the application.

180
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,560
And they'll go right to using the application.

181
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,760
They go from zero to using the application.

182
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
They go, okay, this is great.

183
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,040
This is worth it.

184
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,280
And then they kind of walk it back.

185
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,640
So in that way, I kind of think, yes, it is important to have a GUI tool because different

186
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,080
people learn differently and some people are extremely visual learners.

187
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,120
But I want to just sort of caveat all of that with, I just want to remind us that sometimes

188
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,880
some groups do actually put some form of design into their tools.

189
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,760
I remember, I think I might even have been having a conversation with you, Poppy, about

190
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,600
having folks at Canonical look at the syntax of the snap commands or the Docker folks,

191
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,940
they look at the syntax of the Docker commands to actually see if it logically makes sense.

192
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,640
There is some design that goes into command line tools to make them more usable.

193
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,600
So some tools are more usable than others on the command line.

194
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,160
I think for me, it's not necessarily about being a hardcore elite super hacker.

195
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,280
It's about having some way to repeatably rebuild my system when it goes tits up.

196
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,720
I love committing text files to Git and just being able to copy paste whatever that Docker

197
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
run command.

198
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
I mean, this is how I started.

199
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,680
I used to run one Docker run command after another and just keep that in a GitHub repo

200
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,400
in a text file.

201
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,480
I used Fig when that was new and Docker compose was new.

202
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,560
And as it's gone on, Docker compose has matured.

203
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:06,520
And now I manage something like 30, 35 containers on a single host with one interface to it.

204
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:12,560
And for me, I have a single text file now, it's a YAML file admittedly, not a text file.

205
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,880
I have a single file which defines what every single container on my system looks like.

206
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,160
And if I want to add a new container, I have to add maybe eight lines of code because I

207
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,960
figured out what the syntax of that YAML is.

208
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Now that's investment I've made to learn that.

209
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,440
And I will fully admit that for a completely new user, that's not realistic.

210
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,320
However, I think simply asking, is there a UI like Portainer or something like that?

211
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,800
Using that as your crutch rather than actually investing in learning how the underlying stuff

212
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,600
works, over time will bite you in the bum because it's just that question of when you

213
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,920
want to redeploy something, how do you do it?

214
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,240
I mean, taking a few steps to address that, I've started writing a Wiki at home as we

215
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,240
discussed last episode, keeping notes as Chris is doing now, all these things, but nothing

216
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,360
beats the source of truth, which is the file that you use to deploy the application itself.

217
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,760
And for me, compose.yaml is the one.

218
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,160
I think you're two steps ahead of me.

219
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,160
I've just started a Wiki at home to keep track of some of these things because I've now been

220
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,340
bitten in the butt where I, like I said, didn't remember how I set up the Mastodon instance.

221
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,600
And now I have to revisit the thing because I've got to clean it up or upgrade it or something.

222
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,600
And I think we're in a similar state along that course.

223
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,960
But I think what a lot of people are doing is they want to get to the goal, as Chris

224
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,160
says, they just want to have that appliance working.

225
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:49,120
They want to have that thing installed and they want the fast track to get it in.

226
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,760
And what they don't have is the blessing of experience that you've had of things going

227
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:01,020
tits up over and again, and you learning from that experience and deciding to write stuff

228
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:06,280
down so that the next time it does, or hopefully it doesn't, you've got a document that you

229
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,880
can refer to to get your system back in order.

230
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:18,820
And my pie hole has never broken, but it is a Raspberry Pi sat in a warm room and it's

231
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,960
using an SD card for its storage.

232
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,620
So inevitably it's going to fail at some point, right?

233
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,440
And I couldn't tell you off the top of my head how I installed that thing.

234
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,840
I probably just did curl pipe to bash or something like that.

235
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,680
I think appliances are a different use case altogether though.

236
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,420
I'm more talking about those people on FreeNAS, on Unraid, or maybe people like Open Media

237
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,340
Vault users or people like me that just run Debian with some stuff, actually Ubuntu these

238
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,480
days that'll make you happy, as my server OS, and I just run a bunch of containers on

239
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,800
top of that.

240
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,040
The other thing to think about, of course, is discoverability.

241
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,640
App stores have shown us that people like to browse through a list of stuff and click

242
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,720
on buttons and install things to try them out.

243
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,680
There are some good resources that I use to kind of counteract the gooey discoverability

244
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,240
versus the command line stuff.

245
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,800
One of those is the awesome self-hosted list, which we'll link to in the show notes.

246
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,600
And the other is a list of containers published by the linuxserver.io team.

247
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
That's at fleet.linuxserver.io.

248
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,080
And you can actually just look through the list and it will take you through to the project

249
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,600
page and show you how to deploy each one and all that kind of stuff.

250
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,600
And even when I was actively involved in that project, which I'm not anymore, I used to

251
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,080
find containers on there all the time.

252
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,240
I didn't even know they would have been working on.

253
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,480
So, there are ways to find this stuff, even if you don't have a UI.

254
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,860
I think that's a good point is now the Linux ecosystem has matured to the point where we

255
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:57,120
have these different app stores and places people can go and browse a list of applications,

256
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,720
whether they're containerized or not, is light years ahead of where we were going and finding

257
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,440
all the individual components and compiling them from scratch like animals.

258
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:15,560
Now it is a point and click user interface and you can stand up a service or a bunch

259
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,000
of services really super easily these days.

260
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Too easily, maybe sometimes.

261
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,200
Well, yes, I'm a danger to myself.

262
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,640
I mean, what I mean by that is that if the barrier to entry is so low that you set something

263
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,400
up and you have no idea how you did it, in six months time, maybe you set Nextcloud up

264
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,400
using a snap or a container or whatever it is and you go, where's my actual data live?

265
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,680
And you don't really understand how you did it and you wipe the wrong drive and oops,

266
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
it's easy done.

267
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
Yeah.

268
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,480
And the bigger worry is if other people depend on that service, like if you set up a public

269
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,880
service like a Mastodon instance and other people are using it and you haven't kept up

270
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:05,440
with your security updates or you haven't set it up using the best practices, then people

271
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,320
might come knocking on your door because their data is compromised or their features are

272
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,800
not available anymore.

273
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,680
And of course, it's going to happen on a weekend.

274
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,920
When you're away from a keyboard and your only interface to your Docker containers is

275
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,960
SSH on your mobile phone.

276
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,260
This is why you need an IRC room filled with community members.

277
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,960
And of course, everyone knows that IRC is exploding with popularity in 2020.

278
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,200
Oh, Chris.

279
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,280
So I made the bodacious claim, although I was a little out there, that IRC was dead.

280
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,440
And that actually came from a Fosdom talk where a member at Fosdom said, I'm not joining

281
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,840
your open source community because it's on IRC.

282
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,200
I'm of the GitHub generation and I want to use Discord.

283
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,440
I want to use Twitter.

284
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,680
I want to use discourse, but I don't want to use IRC.

285
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,880
Oh, my friends, we all chat on Slack.

286
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,480
We don't chat on IRC.

287
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,800
And he threw up some numbers like 13 million Slack users versus 400,000 IRC users.

288
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,560
But there is a tinge of sadness when I talk about this because obviously you can self

289
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,320
host IRC and you can run other things in IRC as well.

290
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,640
How many of those Slack users actually want to be there versus the IRC users, though?

291
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Yeah, fair enough.

292
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,440
I'd say a decent percentage are there simply because their employer mandates it.

293
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,640
Yeah, I mean, there are some definite communities that use Slack, but you're probably right.

294
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Same with teams.

295
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
It was a big number for teams.

296
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,840
Yeah, I've been in slacks where it was the network effect.

297
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,800
There was one individual who pushed everyone towards a Slack.

298
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,460
And the second they left the company, everyone left that Slack completely.

299
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,680
So nobody is in that Slack anymore as a result of it being actually not what anyone wanted

300
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,120
it to use.

301
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,680
And I realise, I appreciate that there are younglings who are using new modern tools,

302
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,000
like you say, like Slack and Twitter and discourse, and that's fine.

303
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,520
But it turns out there are still existing communities that have been around for a long

304
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,300
time who do still have a presence on IRC.

305
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,160
And it's actually not that painful to use IRC.

306
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:23,800
Yeah, okay, if you're advocating for the use of ERC or BitChecks or one of the, you know,

307
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:30,280
more quirky IRC clients, then for a new user, it's a bit frosty.

308
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:37,560
But there are plenty of other ways to access IRC that are not quite as comparable with

309
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,200
Slack, but nowhere near as frosty as it used to be.

310
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,480
IRC Cloud is a great example of a very modern IRC client that I like to use.

311
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,080
It does a lot of the things that Slack does, like image previews, URL previews, avatars,

312
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,000
all just based on IRC.

313
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,240
And the thing that pains me the most, and obviously our live stream for Jupiter Broadcasting

314
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:07,080
still IRC, the community is going right now, it's just over my shoulder, is it's all text.

315
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,520
At the end of the day, it's all beautiful, wonderful, gorgeous text.

316
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,400
And I would think that would be extremely appealing to the community at large.

317
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:25,840
I think there's certainly a compelling argument for getting down to raw ASCII.

318
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,400
There are times when I sometimes want to paste an animated GIF or, you know, something richer

319
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,040
in an IRC channel, but really you've got to think about all the other people in the room.

320
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,520
What is the purpose of this channel?

321
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,120
Why does it exist?

322
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,200
It exists to discuss the development of a piece of software.

323
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:53,480
And you've got a whole bunch of people from different cultures, perhaps different connectivity.

324
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,880
And if you're respectful of those and just use text, then it's accessible to everyone.

325
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,600
Absolutely, and you could layer on client richness on top of that.

326
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,440
So if you're someone that wants to see that animated GIF get a preview, then you could

327
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
elect to use a client that shows that.

328
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
Right.

329
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,000
I mean, if I'm using IRC Cloud, which I have done for a couple of years now, it feels very

330
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,600
much like the more modern, richer clients.

331
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:27,680
Actually I think Slack have not really done an awful lot in the last couple of years.

332
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,520
And that's given an opportunity for some of the other clients to catch up.

333
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:40,240
Whether it is the newer IRC clients or things like Mattermost and Discourse and Rocket Chat,

334
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,560
a lot of them are catching up with the richness that Slack has.

335
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,720
So they're getting to be mostly on a par.

336
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,840
And yeah, I will concede IRC is a bit behind all of the others, but there are still, like

337
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,240
I say, a bunch of projects that are still on IRC, and so sometimes if you're working

338
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,440
in the open source world, as we do, it's useful to maintain a presence on IRC so you can talk

339
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,840
to these people.

340
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,200
It does one thing, it does one thing really, really well.

341
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,760
And there is the saying that there'll be a few things left after a nuclear holocaust,

342
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,500
cockroaches and IRC.

343
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
And maybe ham radio.

344
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:23,920
I mean, I look at IRC, it's almost like it's the communications protocol and then the client

345
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
can add the richness.

346
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,820
I know I've just said that, but I mean, think about it.

347
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,000
One of the traditional complaints about IRC is that, well, I'm on mobile and I have varying

348
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,200
connectivity so it's hard for me to follow a conversation, Slack handles that really

349
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
well.

350
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Well, no.

351
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,680
An IRC client that has a server log that is keeping track of the conversation and logging

352
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,880
it to a SQL database and then disseminates it to a client when it reconnects works perfectly

353
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
well.

354
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Quozzel can do that.

355
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
You can host it yourself.

356
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
It's doable today.

357
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,240
I've used Quozzel for many years and the app that makes it the best IRC experience in my

358
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,160
opinion is Quozzel Droid.

359
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,760
Red Hat use it for most of their internal communications.

360
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,200
So I'm on eight, 10 hours a day and I get all the notifications through to my phone

361
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
and it just works.

362
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
It's just great.

363
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,840
I went for an alternative approach and I used to use IRC or I-R-S-S-I if you want to spell

364
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
it out.

365
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,840
I used to run that on my VPS and I would miss notifications when smart, I've been using

366
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,800
it since before smartphones were a thing and when smartphones became a thing, I quite liked

367
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:36,080
the idea of having that connectivity to IRC on the phone and I didn't get the notifications.

368
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:44,760
There's an app in the Android App Store called IRC Notifier and you load a plug-in into IRC

369
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,520
and then authenticate it with your Android device and from that point onwards, you get

370
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,140
push notifications through to your phone when people mention your name or highlight you

371
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,680
in some way or PM you on IRC.

372
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:04,580
So I started to get that availability of the messages people were sending me and the conversations

373
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,580
people were having.

374
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:11,400
I didn't feel left out of the conversations but the problem was I couldn't then reply

375
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,560
because they were just notifications and so I did find myself leveraging that SSH client

376
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:23,960
on my phone and I would SSH into the VPS and use IRC inside a screen session so that I

377
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,720
could bash out a quick reply to someone if it was urgent and then disconnect from SSH

378
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
when I'm done.

379
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,960
Okay, when you say all that, I know why people are switching to Discord.

380
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,560
And that's quite brutal, I mean that is between 10 and 15 years ago I was doing that.

381
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,280
I remember being on holiday 15 years ago with my daughter in a pram and getting a push notification

382
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,600
on IRC but something was going on and while I'm pushing my daughter along with one hand

383
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,040
I'm typing in my SSH password on my phone with the other and getting into IRC but it's

384
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:03,780
possible but things have moved on a bit now and we now have better ways of being on IRC.

385
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:10,200
The juxtaposition of you, Popey, on one hand you're advocating for UIs to make things simpler

386
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,360
and on the other hand we're talking about SSH passwords on IRC from our phone.

387
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:20,960
Yeah, I'm not complaining, I love the fact that I could SSH to my VPS from walking along,

388
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,780
having a stroll around the Isle of Wight with my daughter, that was great.

389
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,040
So what do you use for IRC on iOS, Chris, because that was one of the major pain points

390
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
I had.

391
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:37,480
I got iOS in the fall last year in autumn and I just couldn't get away with any clients

392
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,200
that really were as good as Quasildroid.

393
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,960
Quasildroid does look really good so I don't know if this is as good but I just use the

394
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,160
IRC Cloud client for iOS which is just a native IRC app.

395
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,680
I think I might have some unique requirements in that the Red Hat IRC stuff I have to be

396
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,480
on a VPN to connect to it so IRC Cloud wouldn't really work for that use case.

397
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,740
That's sort of the tricky thing is you can both roll your own solution and you have to

398
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,600
roll your own solution with IRC in that regard.

399
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,320
So I'm not going to sit here and try to say it's as easy as all of the other alternatives.

400
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,880
It might even honestly be easier to set up a Mattermost server than an IRC server these

401
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,260
days but there's other aspects of IRC that I don't know what we would do if say we switch

402
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:30,440
to Discord I guess we would rewrite JBot I guess I don't know.

403
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,760
The bot aspect is a very nice thing about IRC and it feels like it's a Wild West you

404
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,320
can do whatever you want whereas with these other platforms you have to get an integration.

405
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,360
And I think that's one of the reasons why Slack took off so well with open source developers

406
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,120
is you could press a couple of buttons and you'd have an integration that told you whether

407
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,040
your Jenkins was operating correctly and whether your code was landing and if someone had reviewed

408
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,320
your code and so for developers Slack with a few integrations was a very compelling argument

409
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,740
against oh well IRC and I have to write some Python to make my own bot or go and find a

410
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,440
bot that someone's made and create a new IRC account and all that nonsense.

411
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,760
I could totally see why that's more compelling.

412
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,760
So the whole reason we're really talking about IRC and the reason that Popeys on the show

413
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,440
today is he reached out to me a few days ago about something he's just put into a snap

414
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
is that right?

415
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,360
Yeah it's actually been a snap for a while but we've improved it.

416
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,560
It's an IRC client shall we say but it's a web front end so you can effectively think

417
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:41,120
of it as self-hosted IRC cloud so you install it it's called the lounge and it's a fork

418
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,940
of a previous project that was called Shout IRC.

419
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,960
You install the lounge on your own machine you create an account for every user who's

420
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,900
going to use it so multiple users can use that IRC client and then you just point your

421
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,560
web browser at it and log in.

422
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:05,520
Once you've logged in you can then sign into all your different IRC networks and the connection

423
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:13,400
is then maintained from that the lounge server to all of those IRC networks and so you don't

424
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,700
have to run any client anywhere because the lounge is the client and all you need to do

425
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,120
is point a web browser at it and you're an IRC and you can point a web browser at it

426
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,920
from anywhere like from your desktop or from your phone.

427
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:36,080
So I have a Chrome window on my my desktop but it could just as easily be Firefox or

428
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,240
any other browser and that window points to my lounge server which is connected to all

429
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,160
my IRC but then I also have a similar browser window on my phone which points to exactly

430
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,560
the same URL and connects to all the same IRC channels.

431
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:00,640
So I can be on exactly the same IRC channels on my phone in a browser with the rich content

432
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,760
that you see with you know images showing up and stuff like that that you would see

433
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,200
in something like IRC cloud or you know other modern chat systems.

434
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,960
It's made a real change to me because I'm now self-hosting my own IRC client again instead

435
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:22,720
of relying on IRC cloud but also I can access it from anywhere on the phone and the desktop.

436
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,600
That's great I like that a lot and it's something that the Linux server team containerized quite

437
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,440
some time ago so you can get it in a container as well if that's more up your street.

438
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,600
It looks like the UI is really sharp too it probably is I would even say competitive with

439
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,960
IRC cloud do would you agree having used it?

440
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,400
Yeah I went through a process last week of disconnecting from all my IRC networks in

441
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,540
IRC cloud and closing it and now I only use the lounge.

442
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:55,320
The thing that I love about it is because it's self-hosted I feel a lot more safe it's

443
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:01,300
logging everything on my own server and a change that we made last week to the snap

444
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:07,620
because we've got it published in the snap store we integrated certbot into the snap

445
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,840
so now once you've installed the lounge you can then put an SSL cert on it with one line

446
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,400
and then it puts a cron job on your system automatically and it will just keep refreshing

447
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:25,220
that SSL cert so I've now got SSL between me and my lounge server whether I'm on my

448
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,360
phone or I'm on the desktop and then from my lounge server to my IRC networks I've got

449
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,680
an SSL connection there as well so I feel a lot happier.

450
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,120
I always had this nagging thing in the back of my head that I was there's nothing wrong

451
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,300
with IRC cloud it's great but all my IRC logs are hosted on IRC cloud and there was that

452
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,520
little twinge in the back that I just thought I don't like this.

453
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,040
You're kind of losing one of the best things about IRC by doing it on IRC cloud and I do

454
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,160
it out of convenience but I think of this weekend I'm gonna make the switch to this

455
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,680
this looks so so nice do you happen to recall what the database back in that it's storing

456
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,760
all of this in?

457
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:09,120
The logs are free text stored on your file system I love that it also does push notifications

458
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,560
because it's in a browser I just press the button to say enable push notifications and

459
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,120
now on my phone I get notifications when people mention me on IRC I click on them and it takes

460
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,480
me straight into the browser window it feels like an app you know it's it's just a browser

461
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,220
window just like all the cool kids use these days.

462
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,360
It's so nice to see something like this that you can host yourself ah I love this kind

463
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,720
of stuff Poppy I love it the lounge we'll have a link in the show notes of course I

464
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,160
don't know if I'll switch from my beloved causal droid but we'll see I'm gonna I'm gonna

465
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
try that and spin it up at least.

466
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:51,680
People who use IRC who have used it for years are often totally wedded to the solution they've

467
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:58,800
got like IRC for me I don't care what IRC client anyone else uses this is God's own

468
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,480
IRC client and you will never make me move from it right but you'll hear people just

469
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,360
as passionate about Quossel or any of the others the guys in France at Canonical have

470
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,400
their favorite IRC client and that all the guys in France seem to use the same one and

471
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,580
all the guys in the UK all seems to use IRC I don't know why whether the translations

472
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,520
are better or different or what I don't know but people are super passionate about their

473
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:28,640
IRC client which is a thing you never get with slack because there are no really first

474
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,640
class alternative clients for it it's just not a thing you just don't have that choice

475
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,680
right yeah it's very true that's a good point so Chris I have a question for you yes sir

476
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:47,340
why are you in your dressing gown oh outing me like this on the show the furnace is broken

477
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:53,480
in the studio and I'm doing a podcast when it's 30 degrees outside so I figured you know

478
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,500
I'd get comfortable and put my robe on so the furnace broke in your RV and the studio

479
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,600
in the same week well the furnace in the studio has been going out for the last couple of

480
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,560
years and it was just this winter that it kind of gave the ghost out you know just like

481
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:13,760
some sort of like final thing happened and it's just falling apart it works but it only

482
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,020
it only heats the upstairs so like 50% of the studio is livable good job heat rises

483
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:26,920
hey I know but when I do get it fixed I'm gonna need somewhere to document the fix Alex

484
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:33,960
do we have perhaps a wiki the self-hosted wiki is in full flow we have a group now with

485
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,920
about 15 or 16 people already since the last episode who have started contributing their

486
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,860
free time chatting all day every day about what you know different technology stacks

487
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:52,160
to use for now we're using mkdocs but we are trying to decide whether to use that platform

488
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:58,360
or another one called Hugo which is a static site generator that might have some more customization

489
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,560
when it comes to theming but we're early enough in the process that what we're really looking

490
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:11,080
for right now is good solid content and we're not trying to reproduce stuff that's already

491
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,640
out there on the internet you know we don't want to provide a list of self-hosted apps

492
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,920
because the awesome self-hosted list already does that what we're looking to do is actually

493
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:26,760
provide you know code snippets docker compose for example snippets of maybe the lounge or

494
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,080
causal like we talked about on this episode just to help people break down that barrier

495
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,000
of entry of self-hosting some of this stuff you know I flashed some tasmota devices the

496
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,720
other week so I'm in the middle of writing up a little page to go on there about tasmota

497
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,700
and what it is and why you might like it but also we'll link back to the particular episodes

498
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,260
in which we talk about certain stuff as well so one of the things I quite often get is

499
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,020
oh which episode did you talk about cameras I don't want to go through the show notes

500
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:02,440
one by one but if I can search it in the wiki and find the episode that way that's one of

501
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,880
the problems we're trying to solve with this wiki but I've been delighted with the response

502
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,720
I must have had 30 or 40 different emails or telegram messages from people just in this

503
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,040
last few days alone so if you want to be part of it you can go to wiki.selfhosted.show which

504
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,840
will take you to the github pages hosted site we are going to host it ourselves but for

505
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:29,940
now it's on github pages and be part of it help us choose the tech stack choose what

506
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,200
content goes in there and what the different directory structures and layout and all that

507
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,060
kind of stuff looks like it's going to be a crowdsourced thing so if you want to have

508
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,560
input now is the time I'm really happy to see people that are getting involved with

509
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,800
this it's like really that telegram groups almost too much at this point for me this

510
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,840
is completely throwing me I've got my own wiki on like poppy.com it's just a docu wiki

511
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:01,320
that I use for keeping some notes but I've also been using Hugo for another project and

512
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,160
now you've mentioned it I'm thinking why don't I just replace my wiki with a Hugo instance

513
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,520
and then I could do it all nicely in markdown I can just use standard git tools to commit

514
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:18,880
my changes and then automate pushing it live such a good idea use github issues and pull

515
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,960
requests and all that kind of stuff no I just commit to master because it's my it's my wiki

516
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,480
I could do what the hell I want what was it you called me earlier a leet hacker hardcore

517
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,680
leet hacker yeah that must be you now yeah so you're loving Hugo huh oh yeah there's

518
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:41,240
a theme I'm using on one of my sites I think it's called paper and it automatically changes

519
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,560
light to dark throughout the day so when I refresh the browser if I if it's in the evening

520
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,980
I know it's the evening because the browser just all dims nicely it's really really nice

521
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,480
that is slick don't look out the window and see what the light level is no just look at

522
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:03,080
your browser yeah who needs it we can automate that my blind is closed I can't see outside

523
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:11,560
I never never do that so how will the self-hosted podcast end up self-hosting it's self-hosted

524
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,240
wiki stay tuned and find out but in the meantime wiki dot self-hosted dot show if you want

525
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,600
to get involved I guess we kind of need to get a sense of what the interest is to kind

526
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,520
of get an idea of what the traffic's going to be to then decide how we're going to host

527
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,200
it so that's the phase we're in right now it's looking really great though so that's

528
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,480
super neat that's really cool so pope where should people go to find more of you throughout

529
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:41,640
the week oh gosh well they can go to my wiki I have a contact page but that might be moving

530
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,040
can they find your last will and testament there I had a very funny email actually from

531
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:54,760
a gentleman who was it no it was on Twitter honey I need to set up a wiki yep that was

532
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,480
great that was very funny Twitter exchange but yes we need to have a morbid conversation

533
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,080
in case something ever happens to me we need a wiki darling yes of course pope you're on

534
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,980
user error which is one of my favorite podcasts yes absolutely oh thank you yes it's lovely

535
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:17,880
having a an argument with Dan and Joe about all kinds of random stuff we enjoy hearing

536
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,960
the audience questions and trying to answer them so if people have questions for us just

537
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,440
ping us in the JB telegram with hashtag ask error or on Twitter or anywhere we'll probably

538
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,240
spot it I am delighted by how often you are voicing exactly what is in my head even you

539
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,400
are all the way across the pond all the way over there that's worrying it is a bit actually

540
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:46,020
isn't it it's really quite something you really often echo my thoughts on very many topics

541
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,680
but you deliver them better than I would so it really it is one of my favorite shows as

542
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,640
well and of course rumor has it the Ubuntu podcast may be coming back soon so of course

543
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:00,200
Ubuntu podcasts it's more than a rumor we're recording first episode of season 13 next

544
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:07,920
week as we record this boom oh announcing season 13 on ssh 13 I like it right there yes
