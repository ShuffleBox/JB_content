WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.300
Coming up. We've spent thousands of dollars and over a decade refining the perfect home media setup today

00:07.300 --> 00:09.300
we get nostalgic and share what worked and

00:10.020 --> 00:15.700
What really didn't I'm Chris and I'm Alex and this is self-hosted 23

00:17.140 --> 00:19.140
over the years you and I have

00:20.300 --> 00:25.340
Inadvertently converged on two or three different things in our lives

00:25.340 --> 00:31.000
The finer things in life. I might say, you know, we both have the perfect car the Volkswagen Golf

00:31.580 --> 00:36.100
we both have the same laptop as of last week and also

00:36.740 --> 00:40.900
The perfect media player the Nvidia shield TV and I thought it would be fun today

00:41.260 --> 00:46.180
To walk the audience through both of our rationales for ending up at the Nvidia shield

00:46.820 --> 00:50.140
Completely separately from one another. I think the timing is perfect

00:50.140 --> 00:55.020
because I just recently went through an old stash of hardware and

00:55.580 --> 01:01.140
Pulled out a bunch of old gear that over the years I used for my media center setups

01:01.140 --> 01:04.300
So my memory is fresh on this topic. It's been a long journey

01:04.300 --> 01:07.100
And I also feel like this was one of those journeys

01:07.100 --> 01:11.980
I am happy to have walked even though I tried a lot of things that didn't work out and I

01:12.220 --> 01:13.900
Spent a lot of money on devices

01:13.900 --> 01:20.700
But I think it ultimately led me to where I'm at now and I'm very happy with my media set up now, which I'm sure we'll get to

01:21.420 --> 01:26.540
Unfortunately Chris failure is a prerequisite for me being happy with the current situation

01:26.540 --> 01:27.180
You know

01:27.180 --> 01:33.100
I have to fail a few times in order to be happy with what I've got because if I don't fail

01:33.420 --> 01:38.540
I'll be sat here going. Well, that was too easy. I'm gonna go and try this other shiny thing over there instead

01:38.540 --> 01:44.060
You know, I started thinking maybe that's why folks ask us why we like Plex so much

01:44.060 --> 01:50.220
maybe if you've just come into it right now and don't have the historical context of where

01:51.020 --> 01:55.980
Media centers that you could self-host came from it's easy to overlook what Plex has brought us

01:56.220 --> 01:57.900
I mean, there's lots of solutions now, too

01:57.900 --> 02:03.660
So that's not completely the reason but I wonder if by the end of this episode if maybe that's something worth reflecting on

02:03.660 --> 02:09.420
If maybe that's something worth reflecting on I know I personally really started getting deep into this probably

02:10.540 --> 02:11.980
mid-2000s

02:11.980 --> 02:14.540
Oh, okay. I was a wee boy back then but

02:15.900 --> 02:20.700
I I know for me the big like moment that stands out clearly where there's two products

02:20.700 --> 02:26.220
I I tried multiple branches for a while. I tried commercial offerings open source offerings

02:26.700 --> 02:31.420
What was your quote unquote first media player media server center thing?

02:31.420 --> 02:33.420
My recollection was

02:33.900 --> 02:36.540
I which was unusual for me at the time

02:36.940 --> 02:42.700
Tried out windows media center. I went for it. I think I started I don't know if you recall this

02:42.700 --> 02:48.700
But there was a media center edition of windows xp. I do. Yeah. Yeah, I think that I

02:49.020 --> 02:53.500
Dipped the toes in around then I never actually used that one in anger. Although I do remember it

02:53.900 --> 02:56.700
My first kind of playback device was win amp

02:56.700 --> 03:00.620
And the reason I use win amp was because it had a detachable video window

03:00.700 --> 03:06.540
So I had the whip the llama's ass bit at the top and then I had a component cable coming out of my graphics card

03:06.540 --> 03:08.540
Going into my crt

03:08.860 --> 03:11.500
Television and that was playing, you know

03:11.500 --> 03:18.780
It's the first time I watched snatch and lock stock and so many classic movies that I absolutely adore to this day and family guy

03:18.780 --> 03:20.780
I was watching season

03:20.940 --> 03:22.940
One or two, you know, it was

03:22.940 --> 03:29.980
You know, it was a while ago. I suppose my very first iteration like the alpha stage prototype model was

03:30.620 --> 03:37.020
Just a machine. I think it ran plasma desktop with vlc and then a wireless keyboard that had a built-in trackpad

03:37.420 --> 03:41.100
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but that didn't have high spousal approval factor

03:41.420 --> 03:46.780
Well, that's something i'm going to talk about throughout this because I mean i've i've had the same girlfriend and wife now since

03:46.780 --> 03:52.240
2008 7 I should probably know that a long time

03:52.240 --> 03:57.360
So she's been through a lot of this journey with me and before win amp. I was just using

03:57.840 --> 04:03.440
Dvds into dvd players and video, you know vhs cassettes and that kind of stuff, you know, like a normal person

04:04.320 --> 04:08.880
And then the internet came along and kind of changed the game for delivering music and then video

04:09.120 --> 04:13.520
Kind of slowly caught up because the file sizes were a lot bigger and it was hard to get them

04:13.520 --> 04:20.080
Um, so I started using handbrake to rip the dvds that I did have and just collated them in a folder, you know

04:20.800 --> 04:24.880
With you know movie name and and whatever so I had a very small, you know

04:24.960 --> 04:29.120
We're talking how many dvds a 15 year old kid have like a dozen

04:29.760 --> 04:32.800
We're not talking a lot, you know, like I have a thousand movies on my server now

04:33.360 --> 04:38.960
Which leads me to probably the next important milestone, which was buying the playstation 3 for me

04:39.600 --> 04:42.160
And I bought this because of the promise it could run

04:42.160 --> 04:45.040
Linux it was a blu-ray player that could run

04:45.520 --> 04:50.720
Linux and that sounded cool to me. I was at uni. So I was I think I was 18 19 something like that

04:51.440 --> 04:55.600
And uh, I I must have discovered you 11 years ago

04:56.480 --> 05:01.680
Yeah, my playstation 3 installed linux video was pretty popular back in the day

05:01.680 --> 05:05.680
Like back in the day 300 000 views on a video was pretty good

05:05.840 --> 05:10.240
That was considered like a lot of views on youtube back then the dark ages

05:10.240 --> 05:16.000
Yeah, and the great thing about the playstation 3 was it had support for dlna

05:16.160 --> 05:21.280
So it could do some basic network browsing if I recall it wasn't very good though, right dlna

05:21.520 --> 05:23.680
That's the acronym. I could never quite say right

05:24.480 --> 05:29.520
But more importantly is it was initially the cheapest way to get a blu-ray player

05:29.760 --> 05:32.240
There was just no better cheaper way to get a blu-ray player

05:32.480 --> 05:38.560
No, I remember going into I think it was hmv in the middle of manchester and seeing some guys playing grand turismo

05:38.560 --> 05:43.760
On this they had this huge like 90 inch tv on the wall and just being absolutely

05:43.840 --> 05:47.120
Flawed by the quality of the graphics back then, you know, it was an xbox 360

05:47.680 --> 05:49.680
ps3 kind of era so

05:50.400 --> 05:54.720
We're going back a fair bit, you know 720p was considered really good quality

05:55.760 --> 05:56.720
Yep

05:56.720 --> 06:01.040
Did you ever get your hands on an xbox the original xbox?

06:01.360 --> 06:05.200
I actually had an original xbox when it was actually just a games console

06:05.200 --> 06:09.760
But obviously later on people modded it to run xbmc, but we'll come on to that. So

06:10.480 --> 06:17.920
My next system was a core 2 duo. I built my first standalone dedicated home theater pc

06:18.320 --> 06:23.940
I went to aria pc in manchester. I actually got a speeding ticket that day because I was so excited to go buy this computer

06:26.240 --> 06:31.040
Right if anybody's in manchester right by the manchester city football stadium on that little duo carriageway

06:31.040 --> 06:36.800
Anyway, I went there and I bought this super cheap case because I hadn't really figured that the case was important yet

06:37.040 --> 06:40.880
I bought the absolute cheapest components. I could like I was I was a student

06:40.880 --> 06:47.200
So every absolutely every penny counted just to get a speeding ticket of like 60 quid was a bit annoying

06:48.080 --> 06:50.880
It was fine. It was hot. It was loud

06:51.680 --> 06:55.760
But it meant that my student laptop was no longer pulling double duty as my main

06:55.760 --> 07:02.000
Media playback device. And so finally I had two devices. Was it a pizza box style case, you know that

07:02.480 --> 07:07.360
That more horizontal style pc case because I that went around that era is when I built one too that

07:07.600 --> 07:11.600
It wasn't a high-end media center pc case, but I seem to recall

07:12.080 --> 07:17.840
It was essentially a pizza box style with a little window in the front for an ir blaster

07:17.840 --> 07:21.680
That was an add-on. It did not come with but it had the window in case you installed one

07:21.680 --> 07:26.000
Yeah, I I think it was an tech sure. Yeah and tech sounds right for me

07:26.320 --> 07:31.360
That was the second case that I bought after I realized the cheapest one was just going to have really bad thermals

07:31.760 --> 07:38.880
But it was the the first one was like a an amplifier. It was that kind of horizontal flat kind of sits underneath the crt

07:39.200 --> 07:45.360
Monitor style and there was a couple of hard drives in there probably had like 500 gigabytes of storage, which was a lot

07:46.720 --> 07:47.760
Back then

07:47.760 --> 07:52.000
back then but I think one of the most important things that came

07:52.400 --> 07:57.600
Came about around the time of the playstation 3 around the time of that kind of core 2 duo era

07:58.080 --> 08:02.480
Was the proliferation of hdmi? Do you remember that that didn't used to be a thing?

08:02.800 --> 08:03.520
Yeah

08:03.520 --> 08:09.520
I struggled to try to get component on as many things as I could but when the era of hd came out

08:09.920 --> 08:14.640
also the era of drm and hdcp and

08:14.640 --> 08:20.720
Needing to send higher resolution things to the television and they needed a standard and so hdmi came out

08:21.440 --> 08:23.680
And I had to upgrade

08:24.480 --> 08:28.800
My hardware or the television and the receiver both did not support hdmi

08:29.360 --> 08:36.080
Now I had you know for a while, of course started with coax then went to rca and then went to um

08:36.880 --> 08:38.160
component

08:38.160 --> 08:45.440
component road component as long as I could because you could technically get hd over component 720 at least and it was

08:46.380 --> 08:51.600
Unencrypted so it was easy to copy and capture. Well my fancy pants 4k tv still has a component input

08:51.760 --> 08:55.600
So really I mean technically you could have ridden that train until today

08:57.200 --> 08:59.700
Yeah, yeah, especially if I could avoid hdcp

08:59.700 --> 09:07.780
Dcp. Yeah, but I pretty quickly started getting hardware that had hdmi. The adoption was quick with that one and um,

09:08.500 --> 09:09.620
my my

09:09.620 --> 09:13.620
later devices that followed my vlc prototype

09:14.260 --> 09:19.540
Then gave way to a pc. I think I reloaded that pc that had kde plasma

09:20.500 --> 09:22.420
and uh vlc

09:22.420 --> 09:28.020
I just I used that same hardware and then I put windows xp media center edition and then pretty quickly after that ended up going

09:28.020 --> 09:33.460
Straight to windows 7. Do you remember that they had the windows media center remotes with a little icon in the middle?

09:33.540 --> 09:40.420
Did you have those had one? Yeah. Yeah, of course you did. Well, I I got something special that didn't last very long

09:40.500 --> 09:42.500
This is 2007

09:42.720 --> 09:49.700
Linksys came out with extenders and this was a big deal. I remember those yes

09:50.420 --> 09:56.660
Yes, I never bought one but they were just essentially appliance media center clients

09:56.660 --> 10:03.700
And there were a couple of different types a couple of different vendors, but I thought linksys had the best and I had the dma

10:04.480 --> 10:10.020
2200 which was a bad mama jamma because it was a dvd player

10:10.740 --> 10:12.180
And a windows media extender

10:12.180 --> 10:17.380
So I look at me right like i'll put that in the bedroom and i'll have a dvd player and a media player extender

10:17.540 --> 10:19.540
That thing is huge. Yeah

10:21.380 --> 10:23.860
But the other thing that was incredible about it back then

10:23.860 --> 10:28.820
Is that it was one of the first devices of its kind that had 802 11n support

10:29.140 --> 10:35.220
That was a big deal for streaming the hd. They had a smaller one too the dma 2100. I had one of those as well

10:35.940 --> 10:42.340
But boy, did they just run unreliably they were poor performance and they disconnected frequently

10:42.740 --> 10:48.980
I think it was one of my shorter lived experiments. I had a bad experience with the media center extenders as well

10:48.980 --> 10:52.260
So the promise of a media center extender was you had this core

10:52.260 --> 10:58.500
Windows media center running somewhere probably under your main tv in the lounge or wherever. Yep

10:58.580 --> 11:00.580
I was even doing live tv capture to it as well

11:00.580 --> 11:07.300
which the idea was then you could watch that live tv on these media extenders and then you have these extenders in your

11:07.860 --> 11:11.220
Satellite rooms whatever they are, you know bedroom kitchen wherever

11:12.020 --> 11:14.660
And it was supposedly a full-blown

11:14.660 --> 11:21.700
Media center experience, you know, like you had on your primary system, but yeah, ask my wife. They uh, they weren't very good

11:22.180 --> 11:28.340
No, they weren't very reliable. I use an xbox 360 in the bedroom to do that for quite some time, right?

11:28.820 --> 11:33.300
It worked. That was the best media extender. I recall the xbox, but then you had to buy

11:34.980 --> 11:39.620
Like a 300 xbox, yep, and it just was silly it was just silly

11:40.100 --> 11:42.900
Around that same era. Do you know do you know what I replaced these with?

11:42.900 --> 11:47.300
Because i'm not sure if you ever saw this box the boxy box. Did you ever see the boxy box?

11:47.380 --> 11:49.380
I have that on my list. Yes

11:50.020 --> 11:58.040
That was the box man. Oh boxy was so great boxy was a cross-platform home theater pc software with a 10 foot user interface

11:58.660 --> 12:05.380
And it had a very big feature that nothing before it really had if I recall and it was automatic

12:06.240 --> 12:10.180
Organization of your videos based on the metadata it could associate with them

12:10.180 --> 12:16.680
And then it would build your library for you and it integrated in a bunch of online services

12:17.780 --> 12:21.380
And it came with a pretty neat keyboard that I don't know if you recall had a you flipped it over

12:21.380 --> 12:24.980
It had a full qwerty keyboard on the back of it and then you flip it to the other side

12:25.060 --> 12:29.220
It was just kind of a simple keyboard. I think the boxy box was just five years too early

12:29.380 --> 12:35.380
I don't think enough people really understood what it was capable of. I mean it was the first one that had a proper 1080p

12:36.100 --> 12:38.100
10 foot user interface like you said

12:38.100 --> 12:44.580
It scored all the goals that windows media center missed you could integrate internet television, you know

12:44.580 --> 12:48.420
Like revision 3 and stuff like that. You could stream that directly into

12:49.060 --> 12:52.340
The interface and it was it was great. Uh, the performance was

12:52.900 --> 12:58.420
Yeah, the price was a little much but you know a lot of things we take for granted now like

12:58.980 --> 13:01.220
Having only three or four buttons on our remotes

13:01.300 --> 13:06.500
The boxy box was probably one of the first devices to do that because until then

13:06.500 --> 13:11.700
You know, if you look at this linksys, uh box you mentioned a moment ago that had thing has like 50 buttons on it

13:12.180 --> 13:17.780
And just having a d-pad enter and menu that that was crazy talk back then. Yeah

13:18.260 --> 13:23.220
It made it until october 16th 2012 and then d-link discontinued it

13:23.700 --> 13:29.860
But I loved it. It supported five one surround sound which a lot of boxes back then didn't it had a ton of codec support

13:30.500 --> 13:35.620
You know, the thing was intel based. It had an atom cpu in it. Really? Yeah interesting. Yeah

13:35.620 --> 13:39.700
It was clearly just ahead of its time, you know, there was the boxy software as well

13:39.700 --> 13:44.660
But the boxy box really brought it all together. Yeah, it was really quite a beautiful thing

13:44.740 --> 13:47.860
you know, most of these things look like a an amplifier or a

13:48.500 --> 13:51.460
A vhs player whereas this thing was like a spaceship

13:51.540 --> 13:57.460
The other first that I think the boxy box and boxy did was mobile remote control

13:57.460 --> 13:59.460
So you not only had the nice simple remote control

13:59.460 --> 14:06.500
But they had a first party ios app and tons of third-party android apps that were just remotes for your boxy box

14:06.580 --> 14:12.500
That controlled it over wi-fi. That's table stakes now, but wasn't it iphone os back then probably. Yeah

14:14.180 --> 14:20.900
I seem to recall so in this period it was it was just around the major recession. So like 2009. I just got made redundant

14:21.220 --> 14:26.180
And I went to a charity store and I bought um the original xbox

14:26.180 --> 14:32.660
This is when 20 quid was my entire like pocket money because I was unemployed. So I I mean

14:33.460 --> 14:37.060
20 quid from the benefit people, you know, it was a rough time

14:37.460 --> 14:41.620
Anyway, I bought this xbox thinking right i'm going to put xbmc on it

14:41.700 --> 14:47.220
I'm going to be elite super hacker, you know, because I wasn't I wasn't a linux guy for several years after this still so

14:47.700 --> 14:52.020
For me, this was following guides on forums and this this was how you did stuff back then

14:52.020 --> 14:57.860
There weren't youtube tutorials really and there were several options on how you would mod or hack the xbox

14:58.180 --> 15:02.660
Some of which included soldering some of which didn't and you had to pick which route you wanted to take

15:02.900 --> 15:07.460
yeah, so I went to sold a free route and I cracked the case open and i'm sat there on my

15:07.860 --> 15:13.700
Living room floor and I have they had these big long bolts that went they must have been about three or four inches

15:14.100 --> 15:16.980
Because it was a big thick boy this this original xbox

15:16.980 --> 15:21.940
And uh, the exposed power supplies inside and all the guides are like do not touch the capacitors. You will die

15:22.260 --> 15:25.700
So I didn't touch the capacitors and I didn't die clearly because i'm talking to you now

15:26.100 --> 15:29.380
And what I did do though was I dropped one of those screws. Oh, no

15:31.540 --> 15:33.940
Into the power supply and it went

15:37.460 --> 15:43.460
There goes your uh hard-earned hard-earned dollars boom right there just gone. So did you have to start over?

15:43.460 --> 15:48.580
That was my weeks or months entertainment. No, I was it was that was toast. It was done. Which one in the bin

15:48.660 --> 15:53.860
Yeah, you had to get a whole new one. Well, I couldn't afford to so I just stuck with what I had. Oh shoot

15:53.860 --> 15:56.500
Oh, you were so close to a to a utopia

15:56.580 --> 16:01.140
That was going to be my first time with xbmc as well. But alas I had to wait

16:01.220 --> 16:04.340
Sometimes a guy never changes alex. This won't surprise you to learn that

16:04.900 --> 16:10.100
I too attempted to mod it. I bailed and then went on ebay and just bought one that was pre-modded

16:10.100 --> 16:16.260
Of course, you haven't changed a bit boy. Nope, I know I know, uh, but I loved it because not only could I save

16:16.580 --> 16:20.740
All my games all my xbox games to the hard drive because I got one with a bigger hard drive

16:20.820 --> 16:26.980
Which was great because they loaded way faster, but then it was just a menu option to launch the media center. So for a brief

16:27.700 --> 16:29.140
period of time

16:29.140 --> 16:31.140
I had like the perfect

16:31.460 --> 16:36.580
Media center game box because it was legit actual xbox games and a very

16:36.580 --> 16:43.940
Compelling media center interface, but I moved on because the xbox hardware really couldn't handle much beyond 480

16:44.740 --> 16:47.300
And you could squeeze a little bit more but not much

16:48.100 --> 16:54.740
And xbmc started moving to other platforms and then later became known as cody obviously. Yeah, it did so in 2011

16:54.820 --> 16:59.300
That was the first time that I really remember loading up xbmc and it's sticking

16:59.380 --> 17:03.460
I started playing around with all the skins like a on nox that was the first game that I played

17:03.460 --> 17:06.980
I started playing around with all the skins like a on nox that was there

17:08.320 --> 17:10.500
Experience 1080 I think was another one

17:11.060 --> 17:15.060
And I was running this on my primary desktop by this point. I'd amalgamated, you know

17:15.060 --> 17:17.940
I'd been very redundant. I had to sell some stuff to pay rent

17:18.420 --> 17:20.660
I'd amalgamated everything back to one box again

17:20.820 --> 17:22.980
And so that meant whenever I wanted to watch tv

17:23.460 --> 17:27.940
I couldn't use my desktop and I didn't have a laptop either at that point another thing that I remember

17:27.940 --> 17:34.820
Uh in roughly 2012 I found a project called vox commando and this let me use the xbox 360 connect

17:35.380 --> 17:39.080
As a voice interface to do voice recognition to control xbmc

17:39.860 --> 17:42.660
I've got a video on youtube which we'll put in the show notes. It's uh

17:43.620 --> 17:46.580
I mean for 2012. I mean that's pretty cool. It's

17:47.140 --> 17:54.100
It's a bit basic now, but yeah, it's it's not uncommon now, but that is a good point 2012. That was actually pretty impressive

17:54.100 --> 17:59.140
speaking of old embarrassing videos i'll link a couple in the show notes because

17:59.620 --> 18:07.380
What we're talking about right now was really a sweet spot that I entered where I discovered the joys of over the air hd television

18:08.180 --> 18:09.140
and

18:09.140 --> 18:12.260
Myth tv at the same time. Oh, yeah myth tv

18:12.580 --> 18:19.780
Yes, and myth tv was a great application that could pull down all the tv listings and it just acted as a centralized

18:19.780 --> 18:23.460
Pvr or a dvr I should say a digital video recorder

18:23.460 --> 18:27.540
Well, that was one of the things that windows media center in particular was actually pretty good at yes

18:27.940 --> 18:31.620
I had an external cable box. It had an infrared blaster with a little you know

18:32.320 --> 18:35.300
3.5 mil jack on the end of it and it was pretty good

18:35.300 --> 18:37.460
But myth tv was a linux thing

18:37.460 --> 18:40.900
So obviously you were going to be all over that right and then what I would do

18:41.380 --> 18:48.100
On the other end of that is by various means I would have xbmc around the house and then xbmc over the network would access

18:48.100 --> 18:50.100
the myth recording centrally

18:50.740 --> 18:55.140
And that's pretty much how I distributed my my live television for quite a while

18:55.700 --> 19:00.660
Until I was just done with live tv over the next sort of five to seven years or so

19:00.980 --> 19:07.860
There was this kind of graph where live tv suddenly became irrelevant and all that you cared about was streaming and youtube and your pre

19:08.580 --> 19:10.180
cached content

19:10.180 --> 19:14.820
Um was an interesting an interesting time now. I had this kind of

19:15.540 --> 19:17.060
It was a bit of a hack

19:17.060 --> 19:23.860
Because I was allergic to noise. I had my server under the stairs my desktop under the stairs. I had these cat 5

19:24.580 --> 19:25.780
usb

19:25.780 --> 19:32.040
Ethernet things that got my usb 2 keyboard and mouse inputs from upstairs to downstairs

19:32.660 --> 19:40.740
And a 20 meter which is like 60 feet hdmi cable running up the side of the stairs with a two-way splitter so I could have

19:41.460 --> 19:45.460
You know everything plugged in and still you and still play and everything in a remote room

19:45.460 --> 19:50.740
So literally all I had in the in the room where my screen was was screen keyboard mouse

19:50.980 --> 19:53.300
And that was it everything all the processing was done elsewhere

19:53.460 --> 19:58.820
Were those cords through the wall or were they like running along the baseboard? Oh, I mean they were tacked along the

19:59.380 --> 20:02.500
The skirting boards, of course the baseboards. Yeah. Yep

20:03.220 --> 20:10.820
Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, one of the things legitimately when uh, I moved into a house around this time is um,

20:10.820 --> 20:15.700
I had them run conduit so I could run hdmi and stuff like that through the walls

20:15.780 --> 20:18.520
It was it was a priority based on that experience

20:19.220 --> 20:26.500
Very much. So this time too, it's tricky to remember but flash video was still really relevant for online services

20:27.140 --> 20:34.900
Where are we with the iphones in 2012? What version was that like iphone 3gs or something probably? Yeah, and the flash battle was still raging

20:35.460 --> 20:38.740
You know, I don't know if the famous steve jobs memo and flash had been written yet

20:38.740 --> 20:45.300
And this was one of the issues the boxy box even struggled with the boxy box lacked flash support which made it

20:46.020 --> 20:52.340
Ironically, not a very good online media machine 2012 was the iphone 4 by the way, just uh, just to clarify

20:52.500 --> 20:58.260
Okay, okay, but also in 2012 the raspberry pi 1 was released. Wow

20:58.980 --> 21:03.940
Did you ever use that? I really didn't seriously use the raspberry pies until the raspberry pi 3

21:03.940 --> 21:10.020
Just not in the force power. I bought the mpeg 2 codec and I did a bit of work with sam nazarco who is the

21:10.720 --> 21:16.180
Osmc which I think turned into open elec which I think is related to libre elec

21:16.260 --> 21:18.260
I'm, not totally sure on the history there

21:18.900 --> 21:26.520
All I know is that I was able to play on a 35 computer the genuine first one 1080p rips in xbmc

21:27.920 --> 21:32.740
Mostly flawlessly. I mean it wasn't it wasn't totally perfect. There were some stutters but

21:32.740 --> 21:40.660
But for that price, it was amazing. Really, you know speaking of um, these single board computers that we use today

21:41.300 --> 21:45.620
I later after I moved on from the boxy box and the windows extenders

21:45.700 --> 21:51.060
I ended up with a device that actually has heritage with the pine 64 today

21:51.380 --> 21:56.580
Really? Yeah, and that's the popcorn hour media tank. Oh my god. I'd forgotten about popcorn hours

21:56.580 --> 22:00.100
Yeah, totally. I never I never use one, but they they always looked super cool

22:00.100 --> 22:05.220
Super cool. This is one of the devices. I just ended up cleaning out. Um, just a few weeks ago

22:05.700 --> 22:07.720
So the popcorn hour a 100

22:08.660 --> 22:10.660
Was just under 200

22:11.380 --> 22:16.100
Very competitive price point for back then it was a small flat box

22:16.820 --> 22:18.580
That would play

22:18.580 --> 22:21.300
Every codec that had ever been invented

22:22.100 --> 22:23.860
All the way up to 1080p

22:23.860 --> 22:27.540
You would open up the top the top would use four screws the thumb screws would come off

22:27.540 --> 22:31.080
The top lid would come off and it would fit a 3.5

22:31.540 --> 22:37.780
Spinning rest hard drive inside of it that you could use for local media if you wanted to didn't have wi-fi

22:37.780 --> 22:39.780
but it had ethernet had

22:40.020 --> 22:45.620
Optical out hdmi out a couple of usb ports. You could have external storage as well if you'd like

22:46.180 --> 22:48.180
And with the codec support

22:48.260 --> 22:54.580
And the high res video support that it had and high bitrate support as well. So you could actually play blu-rays

22:54.580 --> 22:58.020
Blu-rays it was probably my favorite

22:58.580 --> 23:02.340
Box, like if I were to go back in time and I could only have one from my past

23:02.660 --> 23:04.660
It would be the popcorn hour now

23:04.980 --> 23:09.960
The creator of the popcorn hour that gentleman has gone on to do a bunch of other things including

23:10.340 --> 23:14.500
he makes tiny little retro consoles that you can get to play nintendo games, but he also

23:15.140 --> 23:18.180
Is um, I probably get the I didn't look it up for the show

23:18.180 --> 23:23.780
But he's he's either the founder or the investor behind pine 64. Wow. It's a small world, isn't it?

23:23.780 --> 23:29.700
Yeah, and it was it was wild to learn that because I love the popcorn hours and it gave me a little bit of understanding

23:29.780 --> 23:35.540
Of why the pine folks perhaps have been as good as they are because they've got some real experience with small devices like this

23:35.940 --> 23:38.020
You know these little popcorn hour media tanks

23:38.420 --> 23:43.780
Also ran linux like a lot of these devices with the exception of the windows media extender stuff was all linux back then

23:43.860 --> 23:46.820
So it was just tons of stuff for me to just dig into

23:47.300 --> 23:50.180
And I ended up putting a couple of these popcorn hours around the house

23:50.180 --> 23:55.620
And uh played off my central server as well as did some local media and they serve their purpose for a really long time

23:55.700 --> 23:57.220
That's super cool

23:57.220 --> 24:02.820
So my server at this point had moved from being just a a windows box

24:02.820 --> 24:08.020
I i'd finally been able to have a linux server which was running unraid. I'd bought the sinology

24:08.340 --> 24:10.660
Done that and sold it because it wasn't flexible enough

24:11.300 --> 24:14.420
uh, and so I was running unraid on the server and um,

24:15.060 --> 24:19.460
I read a post on the unraid forums about gpu pass-through and I was like

24:19.460 --> 24:21.460
And I was like, oh

24:21.540 --> 24:23.140
This sounds interesting

24:23.140 --> 24:29.000
I could buy just a 50 pound graphics card shove it in my existing server and then have another instance of xbmc

24:29.700 --> 24:32.740
Cool. I'll just run another 20 meter hdmi cable. Perfect job done

24:33.620 --> 24:37.940
Except pci pass-through was a little more complicated than this guy made it seem

24:38.740 --> 24:44.660
I would largely chalk the fact that i'm sat here talking to you now up to the fact that I wanted to do pci pass-through

24:44.980 --> 24:48.420
Because I had to learn how to compile kernels and all sorts of crap. So

24:48.420 --> 24:50.420
It was a bit complicated

24:50.420 --> 24:55.460
But it worked, uh eventually anyway after probably about six months of trying

24:55.860 --> 25:02.260
I ended up switching from unraid, uh, well not from unraid, but unraid was no longer the hypervisor. I had

25:02.900 --> 25:05.940
Unraid virtualized under zen and then I was doing

25:06.260 --> 25:13.140
Pci pass-through of an arch vm that I created that just booted straight into x and then that loaded xbmc

25:13.540 --> 25:15.620
Immediately so there was no other graphical interface

25:15.620 --> 25:18.420
And it worked pretty well for six months a year, whatever

25:18.420 --> 25:21.940
But eventually it broke because it was a it was a bit of a hacky thing

25:22.420 --> 25:27.460
And I kind of jumped on board with the xbox one train for a little while trying to think that that was going to be

25:27.620 --> 25:30.180
The panacea, you know, it was a hypervisor based

25:31.060 --> 25:35.700
Multi os box that was supposed to be the the savior, but it wasn't

25:36.900 --> 25:38.260
Yeah

25:38.260 --> 25:43.380
Yeah, I was I recall I I just hadn't really thought a lot about the server side of it

25:43.380 --> 25:49.700
But it was hard to get really current packages that would support gpu decoding early on now. It's simple

25:50.020 --> 25:52.980
You can do it on any os but back in the day

25:53.300 --> 25:56.180
It was one of the reasons I ended up on arch was so that way I could install

25:56.340 --> 26:01.300
Versions of server software that would have special gpu support and whatnot because you had to have the latest. Yeah

26:01.860 --> 26:07.060
Totally. I mean docker's now largely made the base os irrelevant stuff like the plex container

26:07.060 --> 26:13.460
Particularly the one from the linux server team supports gpu acceleration out of the box even in a linux linux container

26:13.460 --> 26:17.220
So yeah, like like you say nowadays these kids don't even know they're born

26:17.780 --> 26:22.580
It's so easy now. They're born with gpu acceleration in their hands. Yeah, no kidding

26:22.580 --> 26:28.500
Did you ever jump on the chromecast train? I had a couple of chromecasts. I've never been a huge

26:29.140 --> 26:30.420
fan of it

26:30.420 --> 26:32.420
because I don't like

26:32.660 --> 26:34.180
sending my video

26:34.180 --> 26:39.860
Through a third party to then have it show up on my screen. Like I don't like having anything outside my land involved with it

26:40.100 --> 26:41.860
but I honestly

26:41.860 --> 26:43.140
Probably end up using it, you know

26:43.140 --> 26:48.580
even still about once a month because sometimes it's just the simplest route to go and now that so many apps support it

26:48.740 --> 26:54.340
Like plaques and whatnot. I can't help it. I can't help it. It's come to build into stuff now, but um

26:54.660 --> 27:01.460
Early on I was a bit skeptical. I'll admit it. I was a bit skeptical of chromecast still here though still works still does a job

27:01.460 --> 27:06.340
If you look at google products and things they support they really have done a good job

27:06.500 --> 27:08.980
They've been good stewards of chromecast. They really have

27:09.460 --> 27:13.380
I ended up discovering plex really early on

27:14.100 --> 27:16.100
because I had a

27:16.260 --> 27:23.000
Mac in my studio that ran final cut and I remember the developer emailed into the show saying hey i'm porting xbmc

27:23.540 --> 27:25.540
To this thing. You should check it out

27:25.540 --> 27:27.460
And I was like it's mac only. All right

27:27.460 --> 27:32.100
I'll check it out because if I if I I might be wrong, but my it was mac only early on and then

27:32.580 --> 27:38.020
It was a mac desktop app competing with apple's front row. Oh, wow. I

27:38.740 --> 27:45.300
Totally forgotten front row. Jeez. Yeah, that thing was awful front row was really limited. Yeah, it was no good

27:46.580 --> 27:50.500
So I was like, all right, let's see what you got here and then pretty soon it took off from there

27:51.220 --> 27:54.980
you know, I I sort of followed it from the very very early days and

27:54.980 --> 28:00.900
Over time it became everything that the boxy software was on my hardware

28:00.900 --> 28:06.820
whatever hardware I wanted to run it on and that's I think what got me in the mindset of

28:07.620 --> 28:11.220
Something like the nvidia shield something that would be a first class

28:11.620 --> 28:18.420
Hardware plex player like the popcorn hours were but just one job run plex that leads us nicely up to 2015

28:18.420 --> 28:20.420
which is when I purchased my

28:21.220 --> 28:23.220
first nvidia shield

28:23.220 --> 28:30.420
First nvidia shield that one is actually still in service in my lounge. It's still used today, you know five years later

28:30.420 --> 28:32.420
It's still my primary

28:32.740 --> 28:38.500
Device for playing back media. I mean given the timescales we've just talked about, you know, if we go from 2010

28:38.580 --> 28:40.580
What was I using in 2010? Let's have a look

28:40.900 --> 28:43.460
Media browser on top of windows media center

28:44.180 --> 28:47.460
To 2015 where I buy the shield that's the same length of time

28:48.340 --> 28:50.100
It's amazing. It's still in service

28:50.100 --> 28:55.700
Well nvidia did the right thing by putting more cpu in it than it was necessary at the time way more

28:55.940 --> 29:01.460
Yeah, yeah and putting fast disk in there and putting ethernet in there and wi-fi in there

29:02.020 --> 29:08.580
they really just overbuilt it and then they must have had some sort of conversation with google about supporting it because

29:09.300 --> 29:11.300
uh, it's still getting updates which

29:11.620 --> 29:15.620
Not even tablets or phones get that on the android side. Well, I think it's because it was aimed as

29:15.620 --> 29:20.100
As a media device second and a gaming device first

29:20.500 --> 29:22.500
So they had to put beefy specs in there

29:22.500 --> 29:24.500
They had to put the tegra gpu

29:24.580 --> 29:29.540
And you know decent amount of ram and storage and all that and the fact that it played media at the beginning

29:30.180 --> 29:33.300
Of android tv's existence was just sort of a nice to have

29:33.780 --> 29:38.660
They wanted you to be able to play mobile games because it shipped with a a game controller a controller

29:38.980 --> 29:43.940
Yeah, yeah, I forgot about that. What a joke because I never ever I mean, I probably played games on there

29:43.940 --> 29:50.500
Three times ever four times ever in the entire lifetime of the thing. How many shields total? Have you bought over the years only two?

29:50.820 --> 29:55.140
Ah, okay. Um, so the one that's in my lounge, uh is the original 2015 one

29:55.620 --> 29:56.820
nvidia

29:56.820 --> 29:59.860
Replaced the power supply for free last year when it crapped out on me

30:00.340 --> 30:06.820
After like four years amazing. Absolutely amazing. That's great because it's like a proprietary power supply. So that's good. Yeah

30:07.380 --> 30:10.900
It turns out it's exactly the same as the one that ships with the current shield. So if

30:11.300 --> 30:13.300
If you ever need to know that now you do

30:13.300 --> 30:19.380
I bought about a month ago the 2019 ai upscaling shield pro

30:19.940 --> 30:24.580
Which is slightly smaller. It looks the same. I thought it was the same from looking at the pictures, but it's

30:25.360 --> 30:27.360
25 smaller like physically

30:28.020 --> 30:31.380
Um, but it does ai 4k upscaling which is pretty cool

30:32.020 --> 30:34.180
but uh, I think the thing for me that's

30:34.820 --> 30:41.300
Really meant that the shield has stuck around for so long is it changes as I do, right if I decide i'm using

30:41.300 --> 30:46.100
Kodi this month. I can use kodi if i'm a plex guy this month

30:46.260 --> 30:48.260
I could either load up the plex for kodi

30:48.660 --> 30:53.160
Or I could run the native plex app or if I want to run iplayer

30:53.460 --> 30:57.780
But it also supports all the big boys like amazon netflix hulu

30:58.580 --> 30:59.620
hbo

30:59.620 --> 31:01.060
yeah, and um

31:01.060 --> 31:06.020
the platforms because it's android like when disney plus launched there was an app for it and

31:06.500 --> 31:08.980
You can just rely on that stuff working where you can't

31:08.980 --> 31:11.400
Necessarily when you roll it yourself if you want a great

31:12.120 --> 31:16.040
4k netflix experience it's tricky if you roll something yourself

31:16.040 --> 31:18.040
Whereas if you just use an app for that

31:18.040 --> 31:21.400
it's not so bad and i'm really glad you mentioned the kodi thing because

31:22.200 --> 31:28.120
I talk about plex a lot, but I heavily use kodi still especially especially when i'm on the road

31:28.520 --> 31:33.480
And I don't want to bother with any kind of account signing crap when I don't have signal and i'm totally off grid

31:33.480 --> 31:39.800
Kodi all the time all the way. I love kodi for that and the nvidia shield makes a great kodi box

31:40.200 --> 31:43.240
And i've bought like four of these things because I bought two for the rv

31:43.560 --> 31:48.360
And I bought two for the studio because I really like them and I wanted to outfit my tvs with them

31:48.840 --> 31:51.080
That said for about the last

31:51.880 --> 31:53.480
nine months

31:53.480 --> 31:56.120
I have been experimenting brace yourself

31:56.760 --> 31:59.960
With an apple tv on my primary television. I thought it was funny

31:59.960 --> 32:04.040
We'd made it all the way through and you hadn't mentioned an apple tv. Well, they were just such jokes

32:04.280 --> 32:07.480
For so long and I don't mean to be rude anybody who really likes the apple tv

32:07.560 --> 32:13.320
But they were just they were so limited in their codec support their app ecosystem, etc, etc

32:13.640 --> 32:15.640
That's changed with plex

32:15.720 --> 32:19.000
And um, there is oh i'm drawing a blank on the name

32:19.000 --> 32:23.240
But there's a kodi-like app for the apple tv. I think it might be called infuse

32:23.880 --> 32:28.760
And those two apps really have changed the game the performance. I know this is going to sound crazy

32:28.760 --> 32:32.520
Is slightly better on the apple tv than it is on the nvidia shield

32:32.600 --> 32:35.800
I got no complaints really until I use something even faster

32:36.120 --> 32:40.040
But where the apple tv kind of caught my attention and it was a total lark. I was like, well

32:40.040 --> 32:42.440
Let's just plug it in and see because I had one

32:43.160 --> 32:44.200
It's not even the latest app

32:44.200 --> 32:48.920
It's like one generation behind and my dad got it for me for christmas one year and I just left it in the box

32:49.800 --> 32:54.360
Like you know, I was happy with the nvidia shield like i'm like, well, I should try it right? I should try it

32:54.680 --> 32:56.680
I didn't appreciate

32:56.680 --> 32:59.260
Um, and this is kind of cliche the ecosystem

33:00.120 --> 33:02.040
So when you have an apple tv

33:02.040 --> 33:04.040
all of your ios devices

33:04.200 --> 33:06.200
Become aware of its existence

33:06.440 --> 33:12.760
And that turns my watch into a remote control without me having to fuss with it. That makes my home pods

33:13.240 --> 33:15.240
a voice controlled playback

33:15.800 --> 33:21.960
Speaker for my television that means with one tap I can send my television audio to my home pods

33:21.960 --> 33:27.160
I can also just include the apple tv as part of an airplay destination with airplay 2 or whatever it is

33:27.400 --> 33:34.200
And so all of the home pods and the apple tv can all have synchronized audio with just a tap and my phone

33:34.680 --> 33:42.440
has a pull down remote that I just pull down the corner tap it and now I can pause rewind and when you have kids and

33:43.080 --> 33:47.720
Other folks. I won't name names wife in the house that lose the remote constantly

33:47.720 --> 33:53.080
Well, I mean the apple tv remote is like a bar of soap. Yes. Yes, and it's symmetrical

33:53.080 --> 33:55.560
So you don't know which way up it is when you're holding it without looking at it

33:55.720 --> 34:01.720
I hate the remote but I do like how easy it is to control the apple tv from all the other devices in the home

34:02.200 --> 34:05.480
If I was all in on the android ecosystem, they may be different

34:05.640 --> 34:09.080
But because we have ipads and iphones in the house and apple watches

34:09.720 --> 34:16.760
It's exceptionally nice how all of that just works and then last but not least i've always preferred

34:16.760 --> 34:24.620
Apple's airplay over the chromecast because airplay is over the land and it's just device to device no internet connection

34:25.160 --> 34:29.800
No, nothing and that's always been my preferred method and the apple tv obviously supports that

34:30.200 --> 34:35.640
I have not pulled any of my three other nvidia shields out and don't plan to replace them with apple tvs

34:35.720 --> 34:40.520
I just like it for this one television and I don't recommend it to other people

34:40.520 --> 34:43.720
I always tell people get the nvidia shield don't do like chris does

34:43.720 --> 34:47.800
I think the remote's something that we often overlook and if I think back over the years

34:47.800 --> 34:52.280
I mean we talked a little bit about the boxy remote the windows media center remotes

34:52.840 --> 34:56.040
We should probably throw the harmony products in there at some point. I had to

34:56.600 --> 34:59.800
You know at one point I was talking this through with katherine earlier. She said oh

34:59.800 --> 35:03.000
Do you remember that time when you had like nine remotes on the coffee table?

35:03.720 --> 35:08.040
And I was like, yeah, and we bought a harmony remote for like 300 pounds to solve that problem

35:08.520 --> 35:11.560
And we used it for you know, a good three four five years something like that

35:11.560 --> 35:15.880
You know a good three four five years something like that and it was only a couple of years ago

35:16.600 --> 35:17.880
that I

35:17.880 --> 35:19.880
Stopped using the harmony hub thing

35:20.200 --> 35:22.360
Which kind of replaced that for me in a lot of ways

35:23.160 --> 35:28.600
but when you start thinking about using the pie as a media center or anything that is you know

35:29.400 --> 35:32.840
Self-built an angle that is often overlooked is the remote now

35:33.000 --> 35:39.240
You could argue that your smartphone makes up for a lot of the shortcomings of not having a physical

35:39.240 --> 35:46.380
Hardware, you know a decent quality remote but the uh, the brand new shield comes with a new toblerone

35:46.900 --> 35:51.720
Triangular shaped remote thing. How do you like that? I love it

35:51.880 --> 35:54.280
Can you buy just a remote because I don't need a whole new shield

35:54.360 --> 35:57.000
But I like that idea of that new shaped remote 50

35:57.720 --> 36:01.720
That i'll tell you the nice thing is because it's a triangle shape it kind of lies on its side

36:02.200 --> 36:03.320
And so whenever you want to pick it up

36:03.320 --> 36:07.800
It's already the right way up and it's got a little netflix button on it that you can download an app

36:07.800 --> 36:13.480
I think called button remapper or something on the shield and you can remap the netflix button to plex so

36:13.800 --> 36:19.240
Oh fantastic. I really don't need a netflix button. I don't I don't need that. No, no who does no

36:19.400 --> 36:24.280
That's such a big deal for them too for those companies to get buttons on the remotes. I don't want any of it

36:24.840 --> 36:27.240
I really don't know how i'll adapt to

36:28.120 --> 36:34.920
A quote unquote smart tv when I do buy one i'm very very fortunate that all of my tvs are still dumb tvs

36:34.920 --> 36:36.680
They're just displays

36:36.680 --> 36:41.400
You've had some luck with smarter tvs and I wonder if maybe it's something I should

36:42.020 --> 36:47.800
Reconsider well, I mean in one of the earlier episodes this year I talked about the uh, lg 4k tv

36:47.800 --> 36:50.040
The oled that I bought and that has web os in it

36:50.840 --> 36:54.360
And the the only time I found it useful is when I want to play

36:55.160 --> 36:57.160
super high bit rate

36:57.160 --> 36:58.120
you know

36:58.120 --> 37:00.120
the best possible quality

37:00.280 --> 37:01.720
because

37:01.720 --> 37:04.360
When the playback client is built into the same

37:04.360 --> 37:06.360
System as the screen

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
All the hdr stuff just works all the dolby pass-through stuff just works

37:11.480 --> 37:16.280
It's no problem. Whereas when it goes through a receiver or through some kind of other audio device

37:16.280 --> 37:21.240
You have to you have to think about the signal path and that's fine if it's me, but if it's wifey then

37:22.040 --> 37:23.560
sometimes

37:23.560 --> 37:27.880
Uh, I mean to be honest does she care if it's surround sound or stereo probably not but I care

37:27.880 --> 37:33.160
Yeah, if she gets something started and you sit down and you realize 15 minutes into it that it's in stereo and not surround sound

37:33.160 --> 37:35.960
It's like, okay. Well now I got to stop we got to switch

37:36.760 --> 37:44.280
Yeah, yeah, and it's transcoding the audio from you know, dolby dts to you know stereo i'm like, what are you doing you animal?

37:45.000 --> 37:50.920
Yeah, i've heard good things about web os, uh, and i've heard good things about the roku televisions. Yeah

37:51.480 --> 37:57.560
There's three tvs in this house. One is the lg and the other two are the roku tcl 55 inch guys

37:57.960 --> 38:00.760
And they're just great. I mean roku is a super solid option

38:00.760 --> 38:05.400
It sort of became popular around the same sort of time as the shield

38:06.040 --> 38:12.600
Purchase for me. So I never bought one same with the fire stick the fire tvs amazon make I know they're popular as well

38:12.760 --> 38:19.560
Oh, I have tried those and nowhere near the shield. They're fine, but they're nowhere near the shield, but they're in the same

38:20.520 --> 38:25.560
Price point as a chromecast and the difference with a chromecast is it's a cast

38:25.560 --> 38:31.800
A cast obviously device whereas the fire tv is a remote kind of 10 foot interface type thing

38:32.200 --> 38:38.360
Yeah, and the fire tv has a couple of nice options if you're traveling including it supports

38:38.840 --> 38:40.840
Wi-fi captures in hotels

38:41.800 --> 38:44.360
So that's why i've i've bought a couple of fire sticks

38:44.840 --> 38:48.920
Over the years is that's just a really nice trick to have built into a portable media device like that

38:48.920 --> 38:56.200
So the roku's I have some indirect experience because i've helped some family members get them going and i've always thought

38:56.200 --> 38:58.200
they've seemed like pretty good devices and

38:58.920 --> 39:03.160
It may be in a parallel universe. I would have gone the roku route

39:03.800 --> 39:06.120
however, I think you and I both sort of

39:06.760 --> 39:14.120
Want something that's high performance and performs sort of reliably when we're using the television and it's not that the roku's don't

39:14.120 --> 39:18.760
But when you get into more complicated apps, you can kind of see the walls

39:18.760 --> 39:24.280
You can see the edges of the holodeck if you will. A great example is this weekend formula one is back. Hooray

39:25.000 --> 39:30.920
Turns out there is a kodi plugin for f1 tv. It's all legal. So far as i'm aware. I paid for the subscription

39:30.920 --> 39:33.960
I'm using my api key and password and stuff. So

39:34.440 --> 39:39.480
Maybe kodi isn't one of their sanctioned playback platforms, but whatever it worked and I thought cool

39:39.480 --> 39:42.280
I'm going to install this plugin in kodi and off we go, you know

39:42.280 --> 39:47.560
So just having that flexibility of being able to do whatever I want is why the shield wins for me

39:47.880 --> 39:52.040
Yeah for me, I have to have a machine in the house that can run kodi on the television

39:52.040 --> 39:55.880
that's like a mandatory because when I say house, I mean the rv obviously because

39:56.440 --> 39:58.440
the problem with plex god bless it is

39:59.080 --> 40:04.520
Over the years it's becoming more and more dependent on the online experience between the streaming offerings

40:04.520 --> 40:09.960
But also if you set up multiple profiles so that way you could have like a dad profile a kid's profile

40:09.960 --> 40:13.640
In order to select that user you have to have an internet connection

40:13.640 --> 40:18.600
It has to be able to authenticate through their server and then you can then choose the user account

40:19.080 --> 40:22.600
Which really stinks and kodi doesn't have any of that and yeah

40:22.600 --> 40:27.560
It takes a little extra work to make a centralized database with kodi if you care about that kind of stuff

40:27.560 --> 40:32.860
But it's so nice having that option there. Yeah, geez. I remember the advanced settings.xml

40:33.480 --> 40:36.600
With a mysql database somewhere. Geez that's going back a bit

40:36.600 --> 40:41.720
But you know, it's not really necessary when you just want to watch an episode of voyager. It's not really a big deal

40:42.280 --> 40:46.200
So now you've heard how chris and I both arrived at completely separate

40:46.760 --> 40:53.480
Lives at the same the same point. I'm super curious to know how you all arrived at the points that you're at with your media

40:53.480 --> 40:56.040
Servers over the last decade or or more

40:56.840 --> 41:03.640
Uh, so right in to self hosted dot show slash contact. Yeah, let us know your journey and um, what works for you

41:03.640 --> 41:07.560
I'm, always still curious. I would consider changing it up

41:07.560 --> 41:11.320
If somebody had a really good recommendation that came in and then report back on the show

41:11.320 --> 41:14.760
So join the discord and chat about in there self-hosted dot show slash discord

41:14.840 --> 41:20.760
You know, someone's going to write in with that kaleidoscope dvd changer. I remember that my dad had one of those

41:21.720 --> 41:27.240
My dad also had laserdisc which that was a big deal. That was pretty awesome

41:27.400 --> 41:31.080
My dad did a lot of the old versions of that. My dad had a

41:31.080 --> 41:38.200
had a betamax player a vhs player a laserdisc player and then a blu-ray player, um, you know

41:38.200 --> 41:42.200
And he's always kind of done the traditional route and when I got my own place

41:42.200 --> 41:46.200
I just realized it did a very similar journey, but with just more modern stuff

41:46.280 --> 41:52.040
I remember in the back of my dad's volvo when I was a kid. He had a six cd sony auto changer

41:52.600 --> 41:57.240
And for the for six months, we had the same six cds and then he changed them all out

41:57.240 --> 42:01.080
And we'd get tina terno replaced with diastrates and it was magical

42:01.720 --> 42:06.920
Well, we really took that those six cd changers to the next level is when you can start burning your own cds

42:07.000 --> 42:09.880
You know, oh, yeah. Yeah, who needed anything else?

42:11.240 --> 42:17.880
And then bluetooth. Oh, I still hate bluetooth actually. It's the bane of my existence. It doesn't like you either. So that's fine

42:19.400 --> 42:23.320
So anyway, thank you very much for listening everyone. I hope you enjoyed that little journey down memory lane

42:23.320 --> 42:25.320
That was self-hosted 23
