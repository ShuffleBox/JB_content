WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Coming up on this week's show we discuss how listener Morgan was almost outsmarted by a not-so-smart doorbell

00:06.240 --> 00:09.480
jellyfin makes Alex's prediction dreams come true and

00:10.200 --> 00:12.500
I try out QO notes

00:13.160 --> 00:17.480
Again, I'm Chris and I'm Alex and this is episode 18

00:18.560 --> 00:23.720
Well, Chris I went and did it. I bought myself a smoker. My Americanization is complete

00:23.720 --> 00:32.320
This truly is the completion of a journey that has been a multi-year journey. I'm so so proud of you Alex the

00:33.000 --> 00:37.080
Culmination reminds me that American Pie moment. You remember where the coach is on the field? I

00:37.960 --> 00:41.080
Don't want to take this from you, but Alex, you know, you got to automate this

00:41.080 --> 00:45.960
We got it. We got to integrate this somehow into Grafana. I got expectations, you know, it's coming

00:45.960 --> 00:53.600
I want to see average cook time built into graph on it something like that. What about average temperatures that you use?

00:53.600 --> 01:00.020
I want all the data average temperature per probe. I think is really the sweet spot per probe

01:00.020 --> 01:04.760
How many how many probes are we talking about? I don't know. This sounds like an episode of South Park

01:04.760 --> 01:07.780
Doesn't it where Cartman's getting probed or something?

01:07.780 --> 01:11.840
But I don't know you like for four probes is a good number of probes

01:11.840 --> 01:16.160
Have you looked into it though the possibilities what I have and actually joining us on the show

01:16.160 --> 01:20.440
This week is a friend and colleague of mine Morgan Peterman. He works with me at Red Hat

01:20.880 --> 01:26.560
he's a technical account manager working on OpenShift and he has an extensive home lab and

01:27.520 --> 01:32.240
He was the benefactor of a certain doorbell that you ordered Chris without researching it properly

01:32.720 --> 01:38.920
Yeah during the show actually I ordered a smart doorbell. So Morgan, it's great to have you here and how is my doorbell turned out?

01:38.920 --> 01:42.600
Thank you so much for having me. Yeah, the doorbell actually worked out pretty good

01:42.600 --> 01:47.900
Once I finally got it set up wired properly and connected running on Shinobi

01:48.400 --> 01:49.360
It's a little difficult

01:49.360 --> 01:55.320
especially if you watch their YouTube video and then you see that they use one application and then you go to their website and

01:55.420 --> 02:00.240
They recommend a completely different application. So that was a lot of the hassles that I went through

02:00.240 --> 02:04.620
I I spent quite a bit of time using the easy viz app, you know

02:04.620 --> 02:11.720
It's standard scan the QR code it connects to the Wi-Fi and ad hoc mode and it's supposed to work connect

02:12.240 --> 02:15.880
Configure Wi-Fi and then you get your video and it didn't do that

02:15.880 --> 02:21.440
I had a series of texts that were getting progressively more and more frustrated over the course of what six hours

02:21.440 --> 02:25.160
You were installing this thing. Yes. It took a couple hours to get it working. I

02:25.960 --> 02:28.600
Replaced the transformer because I didn't know if it was a power issue

02:28.600 --> 02:32.720
I changed the wiring cleaned up some terminals and in the end

02:32.720 --> 02:40.120
It just came down to the fact that the application was just awful. So I went to the website I found out

02:40.640 --> 02:43.160
That they offer a batch configuration tool

02:43.160 --> 02:48.940
So I downloaded the batch configuration tool put it on the Mac loaded it up found the you know

02:48.940 --> 02:51.000
The camera and I couldn't configure it

02:51.000 --> 02:54.580
So then became the hunt to find a Windows machine in my house

02:55.040 --> 03:01.760
That I could actually tolerate long enough to get the batch tool on. Oh my goodness. That was the easiest for me

03:01.760 --> 03:03.680
you know again, there's

03:03.680 --> 03:09.320
Easy viz guardian vision and then there's their actual batch tool the easy viz

03:10.040 --> 03:16.840
Did not work at all. They just could not connect couldn't configure and this is after I created a new SS ID

03:17.680 --> 03:21.760
Just something simple. I called it IOT with a password a password still couldn't connect

03:22.440 --> 03:27.440
Guardian vision wasn't working at all for me and ended up using the batch tool. The batch tool was great. I found it

03:27.440 --> 03:35.200
It's gooey based, you know on Windows. You configure the SS ID in the password and it connected instantly and I was up and running

03:35.760 --> 03:40.760
And then I found out that my doorbell didn't work had to go over to Home Depot stood in line for about an hour to get

03:40.760 --> 03:41.840
into Home Depot

03:41.840 --> 03:46.920
Came home hooked up the doorbell and then it was a fun game of picking which one of the 16 songs

03:46.920 --> 03:52.320
We wanted to hear whenever the doorbell rang. Does this thing trigger a built-in doorbell that's in the house already

03:52.320 --> 03:54.240
So if you had something installed it'll trigger that

03:54.240 --> 03:57.960
Yeah, so what I found out was my old mechanical doorbell was actually broken

03:58.120 --> 04:03.640
One of the springs had popped and it just wasn't worth trying to repair it. So I had two options

04:03.640 --> 04:07.360
I had a regular mechanical style doorbell or that you know

04:07.360 --> 04:14.680
The 16 song doorbell is standard off-the-shelf from Home Depot came home wired it inside of the easy vis app

04:14.720 --> 04:19.440
Which is what you want to use after you get a configure this very important after you get it configured

04:19.440 --> 04:25.560
You want to keep the easy vis app because it is the best app of the two that they recommend you just go into the settings

04:25.720 --> 04:27.720
you configure it you tell it you have a

04:28.200 --> 04:29.960
You have an electronic

04:29.960 --> 04:31.600
Doorbell and then you're set

04:31.600 --> 04:37.360
So whenever you come up you push the button your doorbell rings and what's nice is you can configure it if you want it to

04:37.360 --> 04:41.280
Be two seconds or ten seconds. You have you have configuration options just to be clear

04:41.280 --> 04:44.280
Does it require like an account or a service?

04:44.280 --> 04:50.360
Any kind of any kind of login that you have to go into a service to get this thing to be configured or functional or?

04:50.360 --> 04:56.240
Anything you have to pay for so no you do not need to sign up for an account to get it to configure it

04:56.240 --> 05:00.680
You can download the batch program the batch tool off of their website and you can get it configured

05:01.040 --> 05:03.040
But if you want to use the easy vis app

05:03.240 --> 05:08.000
From my for what I found you you do have to log in so I use my standard Google account

05:08.000 --> 05:13.200
And if you're an iPhone user, which I am you definitely want it when somebody comes up and rings my doorbell

05:13.200 --> 05:19.080
I get a phone call. I answer the phone call and it's audio you hit the easy vis button and then it does

05:19.600 --> 05:23.720
Video so I can actually see them and I can talk to them and it's a great app

05:24.040 --> 05:26.120
It's not a hundred percent self-hosted

05:26.720 --> 05:29.040
But it's it's a good option that they give you

05:29.880 --> 05:31.440
so I

05:31.440 --> 05:37.800
Also configured shinobi. It's view only or watch only I configured my motion detection

05:37.800 --> 05:42.520
and I had to toggle a little bit with the audio detection because

05:42.520 --> 05:48.960
It was too low and crickets were setting off the recording and then obviously if you set it too high, it doesn't pick anything up

05:49.960 --> 05:53.880
So again, I used shinobi. I got it set up. I got it recording. I

05:54.480 --> 05:58.080
Caught myself mowing the lawn picking up the grass, you know

05:58.080 --> 06:04.680
My neighbor at 830 in the morning revving his motorcycle wanting to wake everybody else up. So it works great with shinobi

06:04.680 --> 06:08.760
I was really happy with it and that actually didn't take very long to get set up

06:08.760 --> 06:16.000
All right, and to be clear, we're talking about the Nellie's security camera that was on Amazon for around $130

06:16.000 --> 06:18.560
It's currently not available, but there's different iterations of it

06:18.560 --> 06:23.240
I bought this back in January while we were recording the show and I had a sense

06:23.240 --> 06:28.160
It was a project and so I never I just kept putting it off and then I realized I didn't have the proper wiring

06:28.280 --> 06:33.320
So Alex suggested we ship it to Morgan and so Morgan did all of this testing did the whole install

06:33.320 --> 06:37.120
but the one thing we haven't asked you about on this Nellie security camera is

06:37.120 --> 06:43.800
How's the picture quality? Does it actually do the job and give you a clear picture of what's going on around your porch?

06:43.880 --> 06:45.560
So the picture is actually really nice

06:45.560 --> 06:49.440
I took some videos and I sent it to Alex so he could see and it was super clear

06:49.880 --> 06:51.960
one of the issues I did have with it is

06:52.600 --> 06:57.120
It's more of a fisheye style lens and they advertise this as a feature

06:57.120 --> 07:00.360
So you get the full height of the individual standing in front of the camera

07:00.640 --> 07:03.420
But that also distorts the image just a little bit

07:03.420 --> 07:08.120
So for example, if you're a little little big around the belly, you're gonna look a lot bigger in the video

07:08.160 --> 07:12.140
But the the picture is crystal clear. The audio is actually really amazing

07:12.140 --> 07:14.140
I was quite surprised how well it picks up audio

07:14.420 --> 07:20.260
Especially for conversations if you're if you're not standing directly in front of the camera for $139

07:20.260 --> 07:27.000
I would definitely recommend it to any individual who's looking for a good camera and you want to get out of the ring

07:27.260 --> 07:31.000
You know or one of the ones that maybe comes with Comcast, etc

07:31.000 --> 07:34.460
Have you tried the ring doorbell? How does it compare to that?

07:34.460 --> 07:40.140
So I had the ring doorbell when I purchased this house and it was transferred over to me

07:40.700 --> 07:43.560
My big issue was the fact that I was paying monthly for it

07:43.780 --> 07:46.420
You know, there are some features that ring has is really nice

07:46.780 --> 07:49.820
But I didn't like the idea of a reoccurring monthly payment

07:49.820 --> 07:53.460
And as you guys know monthly payments always go up every year

07:53.460 --> 07:58.860
They adjust it and the total cost of ownership for these doorbells just skyrocket on top of that

07:58.860 --> 08:05.220
It didn't look very good. That's such a 2020 sentence the total cost of ownership of this doorbell

08:09.340 --> 08:10.340
Yeah

08:10.340 --> 08:15.880
Unfortunately, you're right and and the fact that we're even considering does does your doorbell have a subscription service?

08:16.120 --> 08:19.640
one of the upsides that I really liked about the Nelly was

08:20.300 --> 08:25.280
The fact that it's hardwired. You don't have to worry about a battery, you know, I know people that bought

08:25.280 --> 08:31.360
rings and then they were charging their doorbell battery every couple of days, which is ridiculous, you know

08:31.360 --> 08:35.180
The Nelly is hardwired, which is nice. It doesn't offer a battery as Chris, you know

08:35.880 --> 08:39.800
The downside to it though, and this is something I mentioned to Alex. It does get very hot

08:40.440 --> 08:43.240
Whenever I was just plugging it in just to test it

08:43.240 --> 08:47.520
It got to the point where I couldn't hold it for more than a couple seconds to the point where it could burn me

08:47.520 --> 08:53.700
I don't know if this is gonna affect overall longevity of the device, but you definitely don't feel it if you touch it

08:53.700 --> 08:58.440
It's only the back where the camera and the electronics are but that is something to consider obviously

08:59.160 --> 09:04.280
You know as longevity is how is the heat going to affect this device over multiple years?

09:04.720 --> 09:07.640
Particularly for you down in Florida where it's you know hot

09:08.220 --> 09:12.360
Always so you now have it going into shinobi and then in there you're using

09:13.160 --> 09:14.320
the

09:14.320 --> 09:20.720
Plugin system to do motion capture. So it's only it's always streaming but it's only recording when there's motion capture

09:20.720 --> 09:23.840
That's correct. And then what's really great since it uses

09:24.600 --> 09:30.480
RTSP I have VLC running at all times, especially when I'm expecting an Amazon package

09:30.780 --> 09:33.320
Because what I've noticed is shinobi doesn't pick up

09:33.800 --> 09:40.020
The real quick toss of the box that most Amazon deliveries do, you know, ups and FedEx are really nice

09:40.020 --> 09:41.780
They seem to always ring my doorbell

09:41.780 --> 09:47.060
but I get Amazon who stands just outside of the view of the camera and they toss it on my on my

09:47.060 --> 09:51.540
On my porch so with VLC having it streaming at all time

09:51.540 --> 09:54.860
I can see that nice camera land the same thing with Amazon

09:54.860 --> 10:00.020
I can see the Amazon truck drive by and the video stays connected. It doesn't drop. Yeah, I haven't had any issues

10:00.020 --> 10:05.780
I've actually had it running for two days straight without even realizing I had it connected and it doesn't use a lot of video

10:05.780 --> 10:10.780
I use unified to track how much data it uses and it's not very high cool

10:10.780 --> 10:12.040
I mean

10:12.040 --> 10:18.180
so it sounds like if you're willing to wire it and you're willing to deal with some half-baked apps for some of the initial setup and

10:18.900 --> 10:24.780
configuration changes which can be sounds like a little frustrating the end result is you still have something you can

10:25.300 --> 10:30.100
RTSP stream on your LAN without any cloud service required and what happens if

10:30.740 --> 10:36.020
Nelly go away because you found some you know generic clones of this thing, right?

10:36.020 --> 10:41.020
The only difference between every other one of these clones and Nelly is the fact that Nelly sells it

10:41.020 --> 10:45.420
There are some comments on the internet that they run different firmware

10:45.940 --> 10:51.300
But from what I can tell all it is is a clone of the easy vis camera

10:51.300 --> 10:56.660
And that's why you use the easy vis application. So if Nelly goes away, the only thing you lose is support

10:57.300 --> 11:00.180
What's great is it's not necessarily connected to a cloud

11:00.180 --> 11:03.220
They give you instructions how to remove it from being connected to the cloud

11:03.700 --> 11:09.820
So you can set this up with the batch tool never connected to the cloud and use home assistant

11:09.820 --> 11:11.540
You can use shinobi

11:11.540 --> 11:18.260
I'm sure blue iris would work as well. And that's what's great and it stores everything right on that SD card

11:18.260 --> 11:20.580
so if you're not streaming it to a

11:22.340 --> 11:26.100
You know a DVR or an NVR you can still pull out

11:26.300 --> 11:31.660
You know the guardian vision app and view the data without ever logging into anything

11:32.180 --> 11:36.140
Morgan I'm sure you didn't do a full penetration test analysis

11:36.140 --> 11:39.820
But did you get a sense of what the security is like on this thing if you're comfortable with it?

11:39.820 --> 11:43.480
So one of the things I actually did do was I completely disabled it

11:43.820 --> 11:47.020
Internet access so it could not go out. I set it up

11:47.020 --> 11:51.780
So it had no internet access and it still worked great internally in my land now

11:51.780 --> 11:56.440
Obviously the phone home version of the easy vis application wasn't working

11:56.980 --> 12:01.540
But shinobi still works RTSP still works. I was still getting alerts

12:01.540 --> 12:07.700
Through those applications, but the easy vis application wasn't working, right?

12:07.700 --> 12:13.140
So then I guess that would mean you wouldn't get the push notification video sent to your phone if somebody was at the door

12:13.420 --> 12:15.100
Correct, correct

12:15.100 --> 12:19.980
But you could still have the VLC stream up watching the door all the time and it could be over your land

12:19.980 --> 12:24.340
No cloud service required. So that checks my box. One of the other options is

12:24.980 --> 12:31.220
Motion eye and home assistant which was shared with me by Alex. I did not get a chance to set it up yet

12:31.220 --> 12:32.580
That's my next project

12:32.580 --> 12:37.260
But to get alerts via telegram bot and or a discord bot

12:37.260 --> 12:41.380
So there are options out there where you can set up an alerting service

12:42.500 --> 12:47.900
Again, since this is a doorbell app, I would keep it available to the internet just for the easy vis

12:48.580 --> 12:54.700
Application because I want to be able to answer the phone from my couch or from my bed and see who's there

12:54.700 --> 12:58.220
All right. I don't want to get a video sent to me that may be delayed

12:58.220 --> 13:03.820
it's nice to have a communication and we actually use that on Sunday morning whenever a

13:04.180 --> 13:08.500
You know the Jehovah Witnesses came by thanks, but no, thanks. Have a great time

13:08.500 --> 13:13.540
It was a lot better than waiting for a notification on the phone then viewing the video to see who it was

13:13.860 --> 13:14.620
Yeah, absolutely

13:14.620 --> 13:15.140
Yeah

13:15.140 --> 13:20.340
the real time when someone's at the door like that really makes a difference and that does seem like a great way to

13:20.340 --> 13:28.860
Politely say thank you, but no, thank you and not get stuck in a conversation. I just blame coronavirus these days. That's the general go-to

13:31.020 --> 13:32.020
Well Morgan

13:32.020 --> 13:37.300
I'm really glad that we sent it your way so that way you could give us the full test on it and it it sounds

13:37.300 --> 13:40.580
Like if I had if I could have wired it in which I couldn't do in lady tubes

13:40.580 --> 13:44.300
But I could have essentially gotten the functionality I was looking for

13:44.340 --> 13:47.900
So I'm gonna keep an eye on this category because if they make one with a battery

13:47.900 --> 13:52.980
That could be the route I would go. Yeah, I agree. It's like I said, it's great application. Thank you

13:52.980 --> 13:56.700
I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity to test it out for you

13:57.300 --> 13:59.560
Now before we let you go Morgan

14:00.540 --> 14:06.620
You have an embarrassing data loss story. You want to share with the class, don't you? Oh, no as Alex mentioned

14:06.620 --> 14:11.140
I am a Red Hatter and one of the great options that Red Hat gives you is the ability to

14:11.140 --> 14:19.340
To install the full stack and I love home labbing and as a home labber, you should really practice good backups

14:19.900 --> 14:23.780
Because if you're supposed to be replicating what you do at home for your what you do at work

14:24.060 --> 14:31.500
You should practice what you preach. I unfortunately ran afoul of that this weekend installing some new SSD drives. Oh

14:31.500 --> 14:40.100
Oh popped open the the home lab install some SSD drives configured the raid and I initialized the long

14:40.100 --> 14:41.940
raid array

14:41.940 --> 14:43.660
system reboots

14:43.660 --> 14:47.060
Can't connect a vCenter can't connect to my VMs

14:48.260 --> 14:54.620
Login to the ESXi hosts and all my VMs just have VM dash number and they're all gone

14:54.620 --> 15:00.620
Oh, no, and then I realized instantly what I did that I just wiped out all of my data

15:00.620 --> 15:07.020
How awful did that feel cheese, but it's okay Morgan because you and I were talking and you wrote

15:07.500 --> 15:12.100
loads of automation to rebuild this stuff right and you put it in git was fine, right

15:13.740 --> 15:20.660
Alex has been hounding me to document the entire process to automate everything and I took his word for it

15:20.660 --> 15:24.240
I love ansible ansible is a great tool and I wrote

15:24.240 --> 15:31.920
Thousands of lines of ansible playbooks to replicate my entire environment outside of ESXi in vCenter

15:32.240 --> 15:36.040
To the point where I actually deleted a bunch of my VMs and I redeployed them

15:37.440 --> 15:42.040
Unfortunately that was in my git lab server, which was on my home lab that I erased

15:42.840 --> 15:48.720
Right. I mean, I'll be honest. I laughed pretty hard when he told me the story the first time. Yeah, cuz it's not you

15:48.720 --> 15:52.660
Yeah, I mean I've done that. I've wiped out three terabytes worth of stuff

15:52.660 --> 15:57.820
Numerous times probably but wiping out data and the VMs is like a double blow

15:57.880 --> 16:04.420
But I've never not had my configuration in github as opposed to it local git lab. So yes, I learned

16:04.420 --> 16:09.000
So once I redo all that work, it'll all be stored externally

16:09.180 --> 16:15.500
So a nice little tip for you if you've heard of git t that is a self-hosted local

16:16.660 --> 16:19.180
github server clone thing and

16:19.180 --> 16:26.220
Git T will automatically clone any commits you make to github

16:26.500 --> 16:32.380
So I have a local copy of all of my github stuff is locally saved by git T

16:32.380 --> 16:38.360
Now the motivation for that was what if they get bought out by some evil company? Oh wait, they maybe did

16:39.060 --> 16:41.060
What if they did something crazy with my data?

16:41.060 --> 16:47.280
but obviously the same is true in both directions if if I accidentally initialized the wrong SSD array and

16:47.280 --> 16:49.280
Wipe my local

16:49.440 --> 16:55.840
Git server, it's all in github too. So yeah, so I spent Saturday night rebuilding the most important VMs

16:55.840 --> 16:59.840
And I'm sure sadly it won't be the last time I accidentally delete everything

17:00.120 --> 17:04.400
But I'll make sure that this will be the last time I delete everything without proper backups

17:04.480 --> 17:11.540
So your post-mortem is off-site off-site off-site. Do you know what you're gonna use? I have not looked into it yet

17:11.540 --> 17:19.520
Back please is obviously one that I do like, you know unlimited storage the downside of I've used it before and it does take

17:19.520 --> 17:23.560
A long time to pull everything down. We've got gigabit symmetrical internet though

17:23.560 --> 17:29.480
So, you know the actual upload part, which is normally the problem. You've got that licked. Yeah, I have symmetrical one gig

17:29.480 --> 17:36.840
So it's pretty nice. But most likely what I'm gonna do is write some scripts using PowerShell that'll export the VMT case

17:36.840 --> 17:41.480
Except for you know, the things that I can easily download quickly

17:42.120 --> 17:49.160
And then I'll just zip those up and set them up to back place and just have that like on a 24 every 24 hours

17:49.160 --> 17:53.680
That'll go that's what I actually used to do in my previous job is a site consultant

17:53.680 --> 17:54.320
But you know

17:54.320 --> 18:00.000
As I said, you're supposed to practice what you preach and very rarely do we practice what we preach and we end up

18:00.120 --> 18:04.680
You know with egg on our face. Amen to that. Well, thanks for joining us Morgan

18:04.680 --> 18:08.240
It was a lot of fun and I'll see what other free stuff I can get you in the future

18:08.880 --> 18:14.080
Pleasure. Thanks a lot guys. Have a good one. Thanks Morgan. I have a data loss story of my own this week

18:14.080 --> 18:18.200
It's not quite my fault. Although it could be I'm not sure it is though

18:18.200 --> 18:23.960
I was using Joplin and I've started work on the 2020 version of perfect media server

18:24.640 --> 18:29.480
And I was writing away one evening for about three or four hours and I went to bed

18:29.480 --> 18:34.600
I just finished a huge section which I was really pleased with and I thought I'd gone through it

18:34.600 --> 18:39.040
I'd proofread it and I'd edited it and I'd tweaked it and it was I was really happy with it

18:39.040 --> 18:43.480
And I came back in the morning to my desktop and it was gone gone

18:43.480 --> 18:47.160
I was just like what the hell has happened here?

18:47.800 --> 18:53.520
And it turns out that Joplin had decided that the version of the note that was on the server

18:53.880 --> 18:58.520
Was more important than the version of the note that I just edited and I overwrote it

18:58.520 --> 19:04.640
mm-hmm, then I started going to try and look through the SQLite database that Joplin has and

19:05.760 --> 19:08.360
It's gone. It's too late. It's dead Wow

19:08.520 --> 19:14.440
So you and I were talking about notes and I think Joplin unfortunately was so close

19:14.440 --> 19:16.600
It was really good. It's been working well for about a month

19:17.200 --> 19:22.280
But you found an alternative for me. Yeah, you know funny enough. It's one that you and I have used before

19:22.280 --> 19:28.280
But I just I kept coming back to it. And so I wanted to share it with the class

19:28.480 --> 19:30.120
It's it's a classic

19:30.120 --> 19:35.440
It's Q own notes and I think it holds up to be the biggest and best

19:35.760 --> 19:40.920
Contender to Evernote that I can find there's a couple of fundamentals that I really like about it

19:41.680 --> 19:49.060
Number one all of the notes are stored in plain text files markdown files. You can just go cap them on the command line

19:49.060 --> 19:52.340
You can also you can put notes in multiple folders

19:52.340 --> 19:56.260
You can have them one in Dropbox one on your local file system one on

19:56.860 --> 19:58.620
Same thing another one in next cloud

19:58.620 --> 20:05.540
It also will use the own cloud next cloud API to actually take advantage of the notes in next cloud if you have that and then

20:05.540 --> 20:08.700
That gives you a web viewer for your notes, which is really nice

20:08.700 --> 20:12.660
It can also integrate with some of the calendar stuff there. And then the one that you

20:12.660 --> 20:18.700
Sounded like you were kind of excited about this isn't something I've played with before but I think I'm going to now is I

20:19.020 --> 20:24.260
Realized it also supports get versioning. Yeah, that's a game changer. I mean I use get

20:25.220 --> 20:28.820
Version manage all of my code. So why not version manage all of my notes and

20:29.500 --> 20:35.060
normally the process of doing a you know a git add git commit or whatever every time I get to

20:35.220 --> 20:37.980
You know a new paragraph would be a bit too cumbersome

20:37.980 --> 20:45.260
Sure, but QO notes seems to handle that for you on on the most part and I've kind of written it off as being a bit

20:45.260 --> 20:50.900
Ugly and a bit clunky, but I really started to dig through some of the menu settings today, you know, I was wrong

20:50.900 --> 20:57.100
I think honestly, it's it's a really great looking app and this speaks to a larger principle

20:57.100 --> 21:01.520
I think you and I have been kind of circling around with notes for quite a while really

21:02.340 --> 21:06.660
We're going to use next cloud to actually sync the notes between devices

21:06.660 --> 21:12.740
So, you know between an iPad and a Linux server and a MacBook and a you know an XPS whatever running

21:13.500 --> 21:19.660
Whatever flavor of Linux this week. We're using we use next cloud to handle the sync and then on each

21:20.300 --> 21:26.060
System, I mean QO notes runs on Mac Windows and Linux but on mobile we can use whatever apps

21:26.060 --> 21:32.740
We want to edit those files where QO notes doesn't exist. And I think that's the key really is it's a bit like Wi-Fi

21:32.740 --> 21:34.860
Really you're separating your firewall from your

21:34.860 --> 21:40.260
Wi-Fi you're separating the sync of the notes from the editing of the notes and I think hopefully

21:41.460 --> 21:46.540
Hopefully that's going to result in a really reliable robust solution. I've been playing around with it. I have

21:47.340 --> 21:53.720
I a writer on iOS on the iPad with the new keyboard and I use that to edit some notes

21:53.720 --> 21:59.340
And then I go back to my desktop and it's right there in QO notes. I really like that so far. It's worked really well

21:59.340 --> 22:03.540
I do think maybe eventually I could see some sort of conflict, you know

22:03.540 --> 22:08.900
Maybe I have QO notes open and I added a Dropbox directly. So I'm gonna wait and see how that plays

22:08.900 --> 22:14.260
We'll see eventually if I create my own problem with that one or not, but so far

22:14.820 --> 22:20.100
It's it's worked and QO notes also has support for adding an external editor

22:20.100 --> 22:26.020
So you can double click a note and now it opens in VS code, which is my preferred markdown editor. Really? Oh

22:26.700 --> 22:28.140
Didn't know that. Mm-hmm

22:28.140 --> 22:34.340
Yeah, and it's pretty nice because then if you have some more complex stuff or some just things the VS code does that you want

22:34.340 --> 22:38.020
To do in your notes really simple to do that now and then the other little tip

22:38.020 --> 22:45.940
I'll pass along is if you rock a dark theme like I do if you play around in the settings for QO notes

22:45.940 --> 22:47.180
It's not enabled by default

22:47.180 --> 22:52.780
But they have a dark mode that they call it and you can turn that on and it just looks a lot better

22:52.780 --> 22:54.540
It just simply it just looks a lot better

22:54.540 --> 22:59.700
But also if you're running a dark theme, it's more usable. Some of the stuff won't show up unless you turn that on

22:59.740 --> 23:03.940
Yeah, it's it's much better than I remember. I used it maybe

23:04.580 --> 23:05.940
Was around the time I was emigrating

23:05.940 --> 23:09.140
I think because that's when I was getting into next cloud big time for the first time and

23:09.380 --> 23:12.500
Then it just sort of faded away and I stopped using it for some reason

23:12.500 --> 23:18.020
Yeah, all of the kind of controversy surrounding snaps at the moment. Like I can't quite put my finger on

23:18.020 --> 23:24.340
What it is. I don't fully like about them, but I never end up sticking with them

23:24.340 --> 23:30.900
I couldn't give you a concrete reason why but it just sort of happens and the same thing happened with QO notes before

23:31.540 --> 23:34.780
so hopefully this time is different now I've dug into the settings a little bit and

23:35.820 --> 23:40.460
We'll see I guess, you know, what I think it might be for me is I changed

23:41.100 --> 23:47.180
next cloud servers a couple of times and I sort of hit the reset button on my notes and I wanted something that was

23:47.180 --> 23:53.500
Separate from that and not really wrapped up and I didn't really appreciate the QO notes

23:53.580 --> 24:00.220
Doesn't even need next cloud at all to function using what like sync thing or something like that. That's what I'm thinking

24:00.220 --> 24:03.780
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean I actually have next cloud now, so I'm just using that

24:03.780 --> 24:07.580
Yeah without without the API and just using the file sync right now

24:07.580 --> 24:12.780
and then I have another folder that I think I'm gonna keep as like a backup copy and then

24:12.780 --> 24:16.060
Maybe I might eventually throw sync thing at that

24:16.060 --> 24:20.420
I want to do an episode where you and I talk about sync thing a little more because I'm using that for a lot

24:20.420 --> 24:27.540
Of things I never really expected. It's kind of in a way. It's become like a global file system for me. It's it's really cool

24:27.540 --> 24:29.620
Oh, that's interesting. I'll look forward to that one

24:29.780 --> 24:37.040
I've used bit torrent sync since you were using it on the young filter show years ago now called Brazilio sync

24:37.040 --> 24:41.380
But I'll be interested to hear about sync thing. Yeah, it's different definitely different

24:41.380 --> 24:45.740
It's and it's not like a torrent like protocol. It's its own protocol. I was just the other day

24:45.740 --> 24:47.740
I was reading their comparison of the two and

24:48.180 --> 24:54.660
They assert that their security is superior sync thing does and they also point out that all of their code is open source

24:55.140 --> 24:57.140
Yes, well, we can't argue that one

24:57.460 --> 25:00.100
The open source angle. Anyway, that's just a fact

25:02.620 --> 25:08.660
All right, so last episode we talked a little bit about Plex amp and I gave it a bit of a rough review

25:08.660 --> 25:14.860
I'd like to change my assessment slightly. I had a lot more time to play with it over the last week or two and

25:16.220 --> 25:21.940
Fixed some issues with my Plex library that were causing it to act out if you remember from last episode

25:21.940 --> 25:25.820
I I put on heavy metal radio and it played tool and then M&M

25:26.300 --> 25:34.180
One after another which was not right and it turned out that actually the slash temp directory for my Plex media server container

25:34.180 --> 25:40.900
Was not writable and that is why I was having these issues. So if you're having lots of

25:41.500 --> 25:45.780
Random weirdness when you're scanning your library, for example when I was going to do

25:46.580 --> 25:51.220
You know fixed match for you know, a really mainstream album like Green Day American Idiot

25:51.940 --> 25:54.140
It tried to tell me it was by the Beastie Boys

25:57.060 --> 26:00.740
And you're telling me this is because your slash temp wasn't writable correct

26:00.740 --> 26:06.660
What after we talked to Elan in one of the earlier episodes of self hosted from Plex

26:06.660 --> 26:12.940
he invited me to one of their internal slack channels where they've been doing the development of Plex amp for the last six months and

26:13.420 --> 26:16.740
So I reached out to him on there and said hey, I've got this really strange issue

26:16.740 --> 26:21.420
That's preventing me from using Plex amp. So he and I spent a couple of hours going back and forth on slack

26:21.980 --> 26:26.700
Trying to debug this thing and I learned a lot about all the different log files that Plex keeps

26:26.700 --> 26:33.580
When Plex does a scan for a media file it writes something to temp very very briefly for less than a second

26:33.820 --> 26:39.020
And so he was asking me to try and capture that file and in the process. I just tried to do a touch test

26:39.620 --> 26:45.140
File in that directory when I was exacting to the container and it wouldn't work and I'm like, well, there we go

26:45.140 --> 26:46.540
Temps not writable

26:46.540 --> 26:51.540
Did a change mod and then it was fine. So I just removed the mapping altogether

26:51.540 --> 26:55.380
I don't even remember really why I had that volume mapping in my container, but

26:55.380 --> 27:02.020
Anyway, I removed it and it worked and I've just been in love with Plex amp. It's great. It's beautiful

27:02.220 --> 27:04.220
It works really really well it

27:04.980 --> 27:09.860
You know handles the caching of the tracks ahead really well. I found the recommendations now

27:09.860 --> 27:13.460
I've got temp working to be really quite good, you know, so

27:14.100 --> 27:16.500
I'm sorry Plex amp. I was rude about you to start with

27:17.300 --> 27:20.660
But I kind of love you now. So a little more time within you're liking it, huh?

27:20.660 --> 27:25.860
Isn't it interesting that the recommendations aspect of it seems to play a pretty central role for you

27:25.860 --> 27:27.860
Yeah, I mean that's what kind of what I use

27:28.180 --> 27:33.300
Spotify for really is I I go to a particular artist and I'll search and I'll just play the top tracks or whatever

27:34.260 --> 27:40.340
Most of the time and then I look for you know recommended artists or a discover weekly playlist that uses like machine learning to generate

27:40.340 --> 27:43.700
Who it thinks I'm gonna like but of course with your own music library

27:44.340 --> 27:49.300
Most of the time, you know, what's in there? You've generally curated it to the point where you know

27:49.300 --> 27:52.100
Most of the tracks on an album because you've listened to it at least two or three times

27:53.380 --> 27:56.820
And so what I found the most interesting was when I was scanning the

27:57.940 --> 27:59.460
albums to

27:59.460 --> 28:00.980
Plex in the first place

28:00.980 --> 28:06.420
I was going through metadata madness trying to fix it trying to make sure that that green day American Idiot album was absolutely

28:06.740 --> 28:09.860
Pristine it had the correct cover. It had the correct tags

28:09.860 --> 28:14.660
It had everything was perfect in the metadata of the files and it still thought it was the beastie boys

28:14.660 --> 28:20.340
So I started looking at ways to make sure the metadata was correct and I used a program called beats to do that

28:20.420 --> 28:23.700
Now there's a post over on the linux server blog written by josh stark

28:24.420 --> 28:29.220
And he covers a bunch of interesting stuff about beats in there, which is a it's a command line

28:29.860 --> 28:31.860
music metadata management tool

28:32.420 --> 28:37.620
And that's it. I mean it can import music from a download directory or a ripped cd directory or whatever

28:37.860 --> 28:40.980
and then goes through and tags it against a whole bunch of databases and

28:40.980 --> 28:46.820
It's very command line driven, which means it's scriptable. So if you want to do some automation around the imports of your

28:47.380 --> 28:49.380
Music you can do it that way

28:49.380 --> 28:51.380
But that led me on to another

28:52.020 --> 28:57.140
Uh problem I was hitting api rate limits of one a second on the music brains api

28:57.620 --> 29:01.060
Which meant that beats was running really really really slowly

29:01.780 --> 29:03.380
I'm talking

29:03.380 --> 29:06.500
It would have probably taken several days to import my entire library

29:06.500 --> 29:11.380
So linux server also make a self-hosted music brains mirror

29:12.020 --> 29:17.220
So i'm now running on my server a local mirror of music brains, which is kind of cool

29:17.300 --> 29:19.460
So then you just point beats to that local mirror

29:20.020 --> 29:25.380
And you can rate limit to you know, 100 requests a second instead of one so it goes much much faster

29:25.540 --> 29:30.660
Oh, that's really cool. I didn't even know you could host that that is a rad little discovery alex

29:30.820 --> 29:32.820
Isn't it interesting that you can do that?

29:32.820 --> 29:38.580
That is a rad little discovery alex. Isn't it interesting the rabbit hole you ended up going down for this?

29:38.740 --> 29:41.460
Just trying to fix metadata to get plexam working

29:42.100 --> 29:45.620
anyway, it turned out it was slash temp and all the metadata was fine anyway, so

29:46.420 --> 29:48.180
There you go

29:48.180 --> 29:52.900
I wonder why people use spotify. I wonder hey while we're talking about you going down rabbit holes

29:53.380 --> 29:55.380
traffic 2.2 came out back in march

29:55.860 --> 29:58.420
And I think you just recently had a chance to deep dive

29:58.420 --> 30:04.020
But I didn't hear how that went the reverse proxy of choice in the kretschmar household for the last

30:04.660 --> 30:06.660
Several years has been nginx

30:07.540 --> 30:12.260
Um, I don't know sometimes I get itchy feet and I think to myself. Oh the grass is greener over there

30:12.260 --> 30:14.820
What if I just use traffic with its super cool?

30:15.380 --> 30:21.060
Labels and and I could just define everything in my docker compose file and not have to worry about nginx configs

30:21.380 --> 30:26.420
It works great in the studio and it was it was working really really well. I was having a great time until

30:26.420 --> 30:31.780
Until and i'm afraid to say until because this is going to be a showstopper for me

30:32.660 --> 30:36.340
Until I went to use any container that was in host mode

30:36.980 --> 30:38.420
Soon as I did that

30:38.420 --> 30:45.140
The container is no longer on the docker network, which is what traffic uses for internal, you know dns

30:45.380 --> 30:47.380
It's what it uses for internal communications

30:48.180 --> 30:50.180
It's actually on the host

30:50.580 --> 30:52.980
Network so hence host mode

30:52.980 --> 30:59.780
So docker basically can't see it anymore. And as such you can't route any traffic through traffic to the container

31:00.660 --> 31:06.260
Which unfortunately means it's no good to me. How many containers are you running in host mode networking plex being one

31:06.900 --> 31:10.100
Mostly for some of the upnp stuff it does around the hd home run

31:10.180 --> 31:16.100
Yeah, I mean when possible I suppose it's best not to use host networking, but I guess on your lan media box

31:16.180 --> 31:20.100
It's not really the end of the world. No, I thought I had more than that. The only one is plex apparently

31:20.100 --> 31:24.580
so maybe I should just expose a bunch of individual ports instead of

31:25.300 --> 31:30.340
relying on host mode it might not be worth it, but there are a lot of nice advantages to using traffic and

31:31.140 --> 31:33.620
If that's all it took I did really like it

31:33.700 --> 31:38.580
it took quite a bit to get my head around the kind of concepts of their front ends and back ends and

31:39.140 --> 31:41.480
How to get the labels just right specifically

31:42.180 --> 31:46.740
An issue I ran into was because v2 only came out in autumn last year

31:46.740 --> 31:52.820
An issue I ran into was a lot of the documentation is around v1 and when you're googling for stuff you find syntax

31:52.980 --> 31:54.980
for v1 rather than v2

31:55.700 --> 32:00.340
That's obviously going to improve with time and it's not really a fair criticism of a project that it's you know

32:00.900 --> 32:02.900
developing and changing and improving but

32:03.620 --> 32:05.620
what really drew me to traffic was the

32:06.100 --> 32:07.940
kubernetes kind of

32:07.940 --> 32:15.220
Cloud router of the future type sales pitch that they're going for at the moment, but I must say it's it's pretty cool

32:15.220 --> 32:19.460
you know five or six labels in the compose file that define how the traffic gets routed and

32:20.100 --> 32:24.740
It's all in one place and you know from a quick scan. I can see exactly what's going on and

32:25.620 --> 32:27.620
I really like that concept. It's just

32:28.500 --> 32:30.980
Don't know. Maybe I should try to give a bit more of a try chris

32:31.300 --> 32:38.260
I'd be curious to hear what you think. I think it'd be interesting to follow up on it. It's also sort of I think good

32:38.820 --> 32:41.700
Market research for a guy in your day job position

32:41.700 --> 32:45.780
I did see that caddy v2 had a release today as well. So I might go check that out this week

32:46.180 --> 32:51.300
Maybe i'll do a little reverse proxy round up next week. Okay. Yeah, that would be great. Totally

32:51.300 --> 32:54.500
I would I would be I mean, it's we're nerds, but I'm totally down for that

32:54.980 --> 32:58.740
But before we go speaking of new releases pretty excited to see that a roku app

32:59.300 --> 33:02.340
Has landed for jellyfin. We'll have a link to that in the show notes

33:02.340 --> 33:06.900
I'm super duper excited because this is my second jb prediction that's come true this year

33:06.900 --> 33:10.500
I predicted number one that wire guard would be back ported to the

33:10.900 --> 33:15.140
Colonel that released with uh, ubuntu 2004. Yep. You did indeed

33:15.220 --> 33:21.300
I predicted that jellyfin and mb would start upping their app game and start shipping on some major platforms

33:21.380 --> 33:23.540
And I think this is evidence of that so

33:24.900 --> 33:29.300
It's down to the referee, you know, i'm not saying i've won the race yet, but it's looking good

33:29.380 --> 33:31.700

Pictures of my delicious barbecue meat smoking adventures. I'm on twitter at ironic badger. Yeah, and they are

34:09.060 --> 34:11.540
Very tasty looking I am at chris las

34:11.940 --> 34:16.100
Oh, I didn't mention it in the show, but this entire episode is solar powered completely off grid

34:16.420 --> 34:20.500
I have a little bit of just enough cell connection to do this

34:20.500 --> 34:24.900
And we're watching all of our offline media on my local raspberry pies

34:25.700 --> 34:30.020
It's happened gretta thunberg somewhere is is really happy with you. Good job

34:30.100 --> 34:34.980
I know project off grid is a resounding success even with an overcast sky

34:35.540 --> 34:41.140
We're generating enough solar to top off our battery bank by the end of the day. So no generator

34:41.940 --> 34:46.020
Just solar 100 percent. It's so awesome. So i'll have to maybe i'll post a picture

34:46.020 --> 34:49.940
Up on twitter. That is really cool. I want to buy solar so bad

34:50.500 --> 34:57.540
It's just expensive, you know solar powered self-hosted. So I am at chris las and the show is at self-hosted show

34:57.540 --> 35:15.640
On twitter. Thanks for listening everyone. That was self-hosted 18
