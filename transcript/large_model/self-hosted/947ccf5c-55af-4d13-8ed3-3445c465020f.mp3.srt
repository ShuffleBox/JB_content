1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Coming up on the show with rage in our hearts. We proclaim a self-hosted Google Photos replacement and

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:14,260
The only way to conceivably self-host your own email with a caveat. I'm Chris and I'm Alex and this is self-hosted

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,920
I've been looking at buying my wife a Nintendo switch now

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,400
I know that you've got one

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,080
But I can't find them in stock anywhere and I'm trying to decide between the switch light and the switch like full

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:34,760
Version talk me through these options. This is perpetually the problem with Nintendo. I can't believe they still are having stock issues

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,720
I know they sell very well

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,200
But I always wonder if this is like part of Nintendo's marketing strategy to intentionally always leave high demand

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,360
so yeah, we own a few switches in the family because

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,720
You know, sometimes it's more fun when you have multiple switches

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,780
It really comes down to this if she's gonna have a dock most the time

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,440
I don't think it matters if she's gonna carry it around and use it and actually play on the screen. The light looks kind of nice

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,160
I don't have the light. I have the regular sized one because I wanted to install Linux on it

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,880
Of course

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,160
So do that, I think you can with the older ones

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,600
I so there was a hardware fix that Nintendo had to issue so I bought right before the hardware fix made it out

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,400
You know, like I was watching the news and this hardware vulnerability was discovered and I knew it would be a matter of months

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
and so I ordered one and then

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,160
Surely like that that week almost they had had announced that a new

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,880
revised model

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,440
How's that going? Is it your portable Linux system your go-to? Oh, yeah all the time

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,320
No, never even tried because the games are great

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,680
You're so funny

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,880
Yeah, it turns out so I say whichever one you can get your hands on you're gonna be happy with you may try eBay, man

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,160
Maybe I'm sure somebody's got it on eBay. Yeah, there's a lot of scalpers though. I don't want to pay above retail

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,160
Maybe a listener has a used one. They'd sell you for a good price. Sure

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,480
Get in touch ironic badger on Twitter. Yeah, or you can hit the contact page or something

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,920
I want to mention that this episode is brought to you by the all-new a cloud guru the leader in learning for cloud Linux and other

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,400
Modern tech skills, you can get hundreds of courses thousands of hands-on labs. You can get certified get hired and get learning

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,520
You just have to go to a cloud guru calm

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,200
Well Alex, we have several cool topics to talk about cool

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,480
I'm dating myself there when I say that we have some some cool topics Alex. Um, we thought maybe we'd discuss two big

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
areas of self-hosting for the home and

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,880
Photos being one of them, especially with the news about Google photos

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,920
which we'll get in get into later and Audiobooks which you and I are both pretty passionate about and there's a couple of different options a

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,360
couple of different self-hosted solutions you can throw at these problems and

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,960
It kind of I think maybe is best to start with like the awkward

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,160
Elephant in the room that we just kind of have to address getting hold of the audiobooks now

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
one of the goals of this show was to

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,640
Showcase all the things you can do a self-hosting and avoid piracy. Obviously, that's a hot topic

41
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,840
and it's it's not something that I really condone or anything like that, but you know

42
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
for me, I think audiobooks are

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
straddling a fine line because

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,880
Let's say we're using audible and I certainly think that's what you and I both are using

45
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,080
You pay for credits every month. I think they're about 10 bucks or 15 bucks a month

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,520
for a credit that credit allows you to buy in their terminology buy a book

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,320
Except for the fact that that book is locked into the Amazon audible ecosystem

48
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,360
Until the end of time and we've actually had this happen

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
that

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,680
Audible have decided to remove a book from our account because the publisher has changed

51
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,560
The terms of the agreement or something and you know, this is fairly common and pervasive among streaming providers with

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,880
Licensing deals changing all the time and stuff like that. So this isn't you know, it's not a new problem

53
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,240
But one of the things I really like to do is download the book from audible that I've purchased

54
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:08,880
And strip the DRM from it and then I own it forever. And um, i've been an audible customer for I think 13 years

55
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,460
It was something like that. It's been a long time. I still have an active subscription

56
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,160
And about once a quarter I just download my latest purchased books and I store them offline myself

57
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,680
And I use a tool called open audible to do that open audible is a 12 shareware

58
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
product and

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,760
It requires that you have an audible sign-in a valid audible account that you log in you sync your library down

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,680
And then it will identify each of the books. It'll pull down the information about the title the description

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,560
Album art and if that's what you call it on a book cover art, I suppose and then it it begins the cpc

62
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,880
You intensive process of removing the DRM and saving you a playable

63
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,720
Audiobook that you can use in anything that that plays back essentially m4a's or mp3s

64
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,500
I use another option and this is a windows option called inaudible

65
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,860
And this one lets you divide things up into you know, separate files per chapter

66
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,920
as well as embedding cover art and stuff like that, uh removing the

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,200
This is audible in the first place

68
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,280
removing the this is audible, you know intro

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,080
Uh and that kind of thing. It's pretty nice. Um, I don't know where I got it from

70
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,080
I think a friend on discord somewhere a few years ago, but it works pretty well

71
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,440
That's like the modern version of in an alley from a shady dude with a van. Yeah, it is but uh, you know

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,760
laws will differ

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:41,680
Based on where you live as to as to the legality of doing this and I think there's there is um, other

74
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,920
Outlets besides audible where you can get audiobooks. In fact, I have a batch from core doctora that I just bought directly from him

75
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,500
So there's multiple ways of course to get audiobooks. So once you have these audiobooks

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
you have to be able to play them back and

77
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,560
Playing back an audiobook is it's a special beast

78
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,780
It's not like playing back music you want to be able to play back and resume your position. You maybe want something that supports chapters

79
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,800
Perhaps you'd even like something that has a sleep timer

80
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,360
If you have some books you go to sleep with like I do I like all these features to be built in

81
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,680
Uh to my to my audiobook player and i've managed to get that to some degree of success

82
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm curious what you've employed in this area for playing your own self-hosted audiobooks

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,520
Well, the primary consumer of audiobooks in this house is my wife. She is a vociferous reader

84
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,800
And that extends to listening to books as well because obviously you can

85
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,640
Listen to audiobooks whilst you're doing the washing up or or anything else, you know

86
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,160
And she uh has been using now for several years book sonic

87
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:50,400
So I I host a book sonic server out of a docker container and this is based around the old subsonic

88
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,780
code base, but there have been some tweaks as you say, you know to provide support for

89
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,500
Remembering last playback position also supporting the chapters and that kind of thing and and the offline caching

90
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,300
Aspect of audiobooks, which is which is really important particularly on mobile devices

91
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,660
So my wife is a google fi subscriber. So every gigabyte she uses when she's out and about she has to pay for

92
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,140
So it makes a lot of sense for her to cash an entire book at once listen to the book

93
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,540
And then no matter what wi-fi network she's on when she's driving or or anything like that

94
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,580
There's no data cost associated with that. So there are book sonic apps available for android and ios

95
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,340
They're a little bit basic in terms of the ui, but their functionality is is top notch and very reliable

96
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,220
and uh being based on subsonic

97
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,700
there is a

98
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,780
Web ui to the container as well, which you just access in a browser and you can play your books back that way as well

99
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,820
Well, that sounds like a winner book sonic right there

100
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,020
Um, i'd say a low hanging but not ideal

101
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,180
Approach might be to integrate it into plex if you already have something like plex set up. I don't like it a lot

102
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:07,380
It doesn't have a sleep timer for one thing. There's other issues along with playback, but it does does remember the position

103
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,220
And it is nice to have all of my books displayed up on the tv. I do enjoy that

104
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,620
I voted for audiobook support in plex as a plex pass subscriber

105
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,700
The best part of a decade ago on their forums and it's just gone nowhere

106
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:28,740
There are some threads, uh on reddit, which if I can find them i'll put them in the show notes, but

107
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,740
There are threads of people that have gone to a lot of effort to shoehorn audiobook support

108
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,580
Uh into plex which includes stuff like a metadata agent

109
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,540
The nuances come in when you want to start marking chapters as played

110
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,940
That sounds a really simple thing, but the way plex marks things as played is once you get over a certain percentage

111
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,740
I think it's like 90 or 95 percent. It marks the episode

112
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:02,500
Or track as played which if you are, you know watching a tv show and you just turn it off before the credits are done

113
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,580
Or a movie, you know that five percent is is within the margin of error where most of the time that just works

114
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:15,700
So you've got a few different ways to slice up an audiobook. You can have one monolithic file. That could be 20

115
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,180
30 hours long

116
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,340
Or the chapters could be a few minutes long

117
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:27,860
And so that margin of error suddenly goes from being you know on a multi-hour file from being a big margin to being

118
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,780
You know 30 seconds, which if you pause your your playback within that percentage

119
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:40,180
Plex will mark that chapter as played and you'll miss that percentage of that chapter and it'll take you straight to the next one. So

120
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,740
It's not perfect. Nope, not so much

121
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,340
Um, you can you can do it you can get by but I don't think either one of us really recommend it

122
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:54,900
But staying on the topic of mobile just for a moment on the ios side. I really like and recommend book player

123
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,620
It plays most audiobook formats and mp3 audiobooks, obviously

124
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,820
It's an ios app that has multiple ways to import the audio files into the app

125
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,620
It has some basic functionality like you'd expect like changing the playback speed

126
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:16,740
Sleep timer then it has some quality of life features, too that I like it has volume boost. It has smart rewind

127
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,980
And it has carplay support and I really appreciate that

128
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,980
It's just called book player one word on ios and something else that I think is really great about it is it is gpl3

129
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,060
So it's open source. It's on github

130
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,220
And um, I think that's just nice to see on the ios platform as well book player

131
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,660
one word and um, geez, it's got a pretty

132
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,420
Pretty good for 4.8 rating. I hadn't really uh to pay attention to I was looking at it for the show

133
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,780
But that's pretty good almost a five-star rating for an app is pretty rare book player if you're on ios check that one out

134
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,980
I'm, looking at another one and this one does plug into plex and it's called prologue. Oh, yeah, which

135
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,660
Advertises itself and this is ios only unfortunately for me being an android kiddie

136
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,460
Uh, this one advertises itself as the ultimate audiobook player for plex on uh on ios

137
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,260
So a couple of options. Yeah, and I have this one

138
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,420
Um, actually haven't used it very much because I kind of just cooled on the old

139
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:19,380
Uh using plex for audiobooks approach anyways, but I I think uh, you know, maybe after the show i'll give prologue a

140
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,280
Another shot because I actually have the app already installed

141
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,980
Just hadn't really given it a shot yet, but it looks really good. The ui is pretty tight

142
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,060
um, and it

143
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,020
Claims and this is why I got it alex is it claims to solve that playback percentage issue that you were talking about?

144
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,180
Yeah, that's good. It's if it solves that problem. That is the biggest problem with plex and uh,

145
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:44,260
an audiobook playback, but what about on the linux desktop? Is there anything there? I like cozy

146
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,780
I'll link to the flathub installer if you want to give it a try. It's a minimal modern looking

147
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,780
Audiobook player so go in with expectations set to

148
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,940
minimal

149
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,260
But it does the basics right it listens to your drm free books. It has a sleep timer

150
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,020
It has playback controls for each book so you can set them per book. I like that

151
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,460
And uh, oh, it also allows you to do multiple storage location support. That's kind of nice

152
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,660
I have had scenarios where i've needed that before and you know, I like this offline mode

153
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:22,580
So you can just store something on internal storage this I think will also be a good mobile app for like the future

154
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
convergence where you have

155
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,940
posh

156
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,820
driven

157
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,300
pine 64 mobile devices, I think this is going to be a really good

158
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,700
pine 64 mobile devices. I think this may actually end up being a

159
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,300
A mobile audiobook player in the future as well. I'm sure those three people that do that will be really happy

160
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,700
Yeah, well

161
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,700
Yeah, and then their audiobook player will work on their desktop and their phone because it's the same one

162
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,180
Oh, i'm sorry to those three people if i've upset you

163
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,380
Linode.com

164
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:03,140
Ssh go there to get a 100 68 credit towards a new account at linode and you support your boys here at the self-hosted podcast

165
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,380
Linode is our cloud hosting provider

166
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,220
We spin infrastructure up to test on the show

167
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:13,860
But it also runs the back end cloud infrastructure of jupiter broadcasting and all my personal stuff is on linode

168
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,460
I started using them just over two years ago. And when it was time to take jupiter broadcasting independent

169
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,060
I said let's build it on linode and it's been fantastic

170
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,780
And you know, one of the things I love about them is they're independently owned

171
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,580
They were founded on a love for linux and open source technologies back then it was user mode linux

172
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:36,580
But of course they've evolved their system over the years to take advantage of the latest virtualization and container technologies in linux

173
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,020
They give you full back end access to your linodes when you spin something up

174
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:47,300
I used that recently to actually re-image the os drive of one of my linux linodes using their official how-to guide

175
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,540
And they have the tools that make all of that possible

176
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,060
I love that kind of stuff on top of the virtual servers though

177
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,700
They have object storage now if you're thinking about building yourself a super fast static website

178
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,580
Maybe for a resume for yourself for family for the holidays check out their object storage

179
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,460
I use their s3 compatible object storage to host the clips that I play on shows

180
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:13,140
So we will integrate the clips right into our show notes because our show notes are all written in markdown

181
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:19,700
I can embed audio files in line that actually are hosted on the node's object storage

182
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:25,300
You can use that for website assets. You could even use it as a quick cdn for your for your projects

183
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,540
Distribution. I mean think about it

184
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,260
There's a lot you can do with s3 compatible object storage when you're not paying amazon's prices

185
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,740
Linode costs 30 to 50 less than major cloud providers like aws

186
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,460
So there's a lot of advantage to going over to linode plus when you go to linode.com

187
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,460
Go to linode.com slash ssh you get that one hundred dollar credit

188
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,660
One hundred dollars and you also support the show. I mean it's like a win-win so check them out

189
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,140
Linode is dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing if it runs on linux

190
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,780
It runs on linode and there's a lot you can do with that

191
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,580
You know, you know just go check it out and then tell me what you do

192
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,660
I've been asking people to tweet me at chris las or you can hit me up on the telegram

193
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,380
What are you doing with your linode once you spin it up linode.com slash ssh

194
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,520
Thanks to everybody who supports the show and supports our sponsor by going to linode.com slash ssh

195
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,140
Time for some feedback. Don't forget you can send in yours at selfosted.show slash contact

196
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,260
Our first one comes from jeff. Yeah friend of the show jeff

197
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:32,500
He writes and he says I have an ubuntu machine serving dual purposes as my home server and htpc

198
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,980
This is a chris side note. This seems to be a really super common setup

199
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,060
And if you think about it, if you really only have budget or space or whatever for one computer, why not make it?

200
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,540
Like a cody playback or a plex playback machine and a server or he lives in california where electricity isn't cheap

201
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,860
Yeah, although he does mess around with some solar so he might be able to figure that out

202
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,220
Uh, but uh

203
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,500
He goes on to say i'm running the next cloud snap in the background with plasma 5 as my tv front end

204
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,780
Since ubuntu's app completely breaks on me every time I use

205
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
use ubuntu seriously

206
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:14,020
Is i'm looking to rebase my system on something else I would like to move to next cloud to a containerized setup

207
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,420
But I failed to properly even set up the most basic docker images in the past

208
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:25,780
My biggest hurdle is understanding the database stuff and how they can connect not being able to just navigate file structure and see the files

209
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,780
Well, it breaks my brain and plus i'm using the next cloud snap

210
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:35,140
I'm going to have issues moving the files out of the bear of the database buried in the snap itself

211
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,460
Well by default next cloud does use sql lite for data storage. So that's kind of built into the container

212
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,820
You can also link a database of mysql as well. So maybe that's what you're thinking of

213
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,980
I I wonder if it's only him and a couple of family members like he says here in the email

214
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,540
Does he need to have a more robust database? I appreciate there's a performance difference

215
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,420
But there's also the simplicity. I mean this must be what the snap is using already now that I think about it

216
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,900
Yeah, it must be and and to be honest with you. This is uh,

217
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,380
This is one of my issues with snaps as a whole on the server

218
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,740
Right. I appreciate that snap install next cloud is very easy, but it's also

219
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:20,660
Dare I say I don't want to sound like gatekeeper here, but it's almost too easy. But couldn't you make that argument for docker? Well, uh,

220
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,700
Maybe maybe you could um

221
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,660
But I think there is a difference right with a with a snap. The the data is kind of

222
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,340
Baked in and it's a it's a not as much of an industry standard as docker is

223
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,340
Oh and with docker you have the data external of the image

224
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:45,780
And so you could blow away the container, but the data remains and also there is an official next cloud docker image with decent

225
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,820
Documentation that talks about volumes right from the get-go

226
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,700
whereas a snap is this kind of

227
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,380
And I i'm really reluctant to to to bash on snaps so hard

228
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:01,620
But they're just a black box and i've had to help several people extract data from snaps that got things up and running

229
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,460
That they didn't really understand what was going on under the hood, which is great

230
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:11,540
And I think in terms of enabling people to to do stuff that they wouldn't otherwise do is is a good thing

231
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:18,500
But the flip side of that is that you don't necessarily plan well enough to you know a data storage strategy

232
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,660
Which volume is going to go explicitly where all that kind of stuff. Yeah, and with docker compose you kind of have this

233
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,820
Reference guide you can go back to to see how you built things and where you specified the that the data volume was

234
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,180
And if you build a snap and you create the yaml file that does all that you would have that those same insights

235
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
But it's just a different workflow

236
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,580
He goes on to ask a question that I think maybe we could we could kind of help him with here. He says

237
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,700
Do you guys have any tips or resources to learn about this stuff as a home user level? I am no sysadmin

238
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,300
He doesn't do it for his day job

239
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,220
And he doesn't have a lot of database and container experience. A lot of it goes over his head

240
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:58,760
He's wondering if we have any tips to migrate his snap next cloud to a proper database

241
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,020
and

242
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,700
I kind of felt like the solution here would be to keep it simple

243
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,140
And start fresh with a next cloud container that uses an internal sqlite database

244
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,940
And manually migrate your data over because a lot of the like if you think about it the cal dev stuff

245
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,420
The the ical stuff all of that will just export just fine if you can do that

246
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Just export it set it up fresh

247
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:27,300
In the container and then when you're ready move to a to a separate database as a separate project

248
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,420
Another option is to install an xcal client on a system

249
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,140
Sync sync down all your data

250
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:41,620
sign out of server a the snap server and then sign into server b and point server b at that directory and

251
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,180
It will just re-upload the stuff to the new instance

252
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,780
yeah, absolutely and the next cloud cli client is

253
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,500
The trick that i've used before to move next cloud server. So that is a good way to go and that's

254
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,180
Not bad jeff, and I don't think you need to solve it all in one go either. Uh, if you're talking

255
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,500
10 users or less you may find that the server is not going to be able to do that

256
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,180
10 users or less you may find that the sql light

257
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
performance is

258
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,780
perfectly adequate especially because he talks in here about maybe

259
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,500
Using a linode credit to build something and maybe set it up there

260
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,760
That instance is probably going to be so much faster than your htpc

261
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,340
That you'll never run into performance issues with the sql light database. It's super handy to have a uh

262
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,140
a next cloud instance running in the cloud on a linode or something like that because

263
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,340
it

264
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,980
It means if your power goes out at your house

265
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,660
It's still up if you don't want to punch holes in your firewall. It's available nice and easily

266
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,500
Outside the downside of that is it means it's outside your firewall, which means that people might be

267
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,900
You know port scanning you and bashing on it and trying to break into it. So

268
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,860
Linode has this kind of firewall feature where you can disable and enable certain ports and stuff like that

269
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,940
You know like you would in your home firewall

270
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:06,180
Um, so i'd recommend using that if you're going to put it in linode just to lock down the attack surface as much as possible

271
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,740
and then also consider from a data strategy standpoint now now you have

272
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,860
Your home system and you'll have an offsite system and now you can sync between them

273
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,840
So you could you could back up your next cloud linode instance locally to your htpc

274
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,060
And if you have some really valuable stuff on that htpc like configs or whatever

275
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,220
You could now back that up offsite to linode

276
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,500
So there's some data security advantages you could now also employ. So that's a probably not a bad way to go

277
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:40,420
Speaking of self-hosting. Do you want to take our next email do jit code is am I i'm butchering that do guys go?

278
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:48,180
Do you get code writes in I was listening to episode 31 and I want to disagree whilst still agreeing

279
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,860
With your opinion on the difficulty of self-hosting an email server

280
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:57,540
Uh too long didn't read you can still partially hybrid self-host your emails and gain benefit

281
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,300
Emails a wonderful stack of tech that's often built with the unix mindset of do one thing and do it

282
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,500
Well, and this is why I often encourage people to at least self-host a receiving email server

283
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:15,460
Whilst farming out the sending portion to an smtp relay like mailgun or amazon's ses

284
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:21,620
Yes, you know, this is why I actually did contact mail route and I said you guys should become sponsors of our shows

285
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,660
Because I really believe this setup is actually solid and every time we fail to mention it

286
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,460
I think about it after the show because if I was going to host my email and i've been thinking about it

287
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,260
Sometimes I would do it exactly like this. I would have mail route

288
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,300
sponsor our show guys right in front of

289
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:45,780
My email server and that would do all of the nitty-gritty sending and receiving and the spam checking and all of that

290
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,980
It would be up when my home system is down. It could do a queue

291
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,340
It would deal with all of the domain blacklist issues. And of course, they're a known good provider at this point

292
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,860
So they've been around forever

293
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,180
So if I were going to build email today

294
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,940
I would set up a LAN server that only receives email from the mail route service

295
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,860
Let's see. It doesn't receive email and the LAN it could receive email from the LAN

296
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,540
You've got to wonder how long it is before google cancelled gmail, don't you? No

297
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,500
Never never going to happen from an advertising perspective. I I know that but no, you know what?

298
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,020
You know what? I've been thinking about gmail

299
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:25,860
It's really about it's about the mining because you who doesn't have their receipt sent to their gmail account everything you purchase

300
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,100
That even if it's not through a google pay app or anything like that if your email

301
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,460
Goes to your inbox google knows what you've been buying

302
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,220
That's so valuable. There's no way they'll ever turn that off

303
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,060
It's true. I'll tell you what my mother-in-law's computer broke last week and I

304
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,620
Reconstructed what computer I built for her four years ago through my gmail inbox. So

305
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:54,440
It's useful. Yeah, so, uh, I I really like this hybrid email approach and I actually feel like maybe I may start adjusting

306
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,820
My future answer about self-hosting email is do it but just don't

307
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,580
don't be responsible for directly sending and receiving email and I

308
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,380
I I can't believe I didn't think of saying this the last couple times has come up on the show because

309
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,420
This is how I have built it for my clients in the past

310
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,260
This is just it's it's how I would it's it's how I would do it

311
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:20,420
And if you're willing to self-host your email, then you need to consider a good intermediary. There's mail routes one of them

312
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,260
There's other of there's like postini used to be one but google bought them

313
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:31,240
There's these that these intermediary services that become trusted well-established players in the email ecosystem

314
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:37,480
And they provide the sending and receiving they provide the queuing and it's it's wonderful

315
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,480
That's why they should sponsor because you could you could very successfully set up a system like he's talking about at the end of the

316
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,520
day though

317
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,760
You still have users that are relying on a service that really becomes integrated with their life

318
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,960
You know when they're emailing attorneys or they're emailing people at their church or they're figuring out stuff for their kids school

319
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,800
It's all happening on email

320
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,640
So even if it's just a few family members when you start hosting their email you

321
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:07,960
You really discover how much email matters when it goes out and that's a responsibility that you really have to take seriously

322
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,920
Yeah, it's a bit more serious than I can't watch plex

323
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,560
yeah, or even a chat system being down right because you can still pick up the phone and call but

324
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:22,360
The thing about email is it is a box of expectations and people can just drop an expectation in there

325
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,880
And so you can have people outside of your world that are sending an expectation into that inbox

326
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,200
And if your email is down and you didn't receive it

327
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,120
They still expected you that you got it and that you're going to be taking action on it and it has domino effects

328
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,560
Very true and now brian writes in saying hey guys

329
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,600
I've been using home assistant for about a year now and I really enjoy the home assistant segments on the show

330
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:51,800
I've heard you mention mqtt a few times and was wondering if you could tell me more about it and its benefits with home assistant

331
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:59,560
So chris, do you use mqtt for anything? No, that's why I really like this question from brian because uh, I have like

332
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,360
Uh home assistant fomo a little bit, but i'm well, I mean i'm almost

333
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,120
Two years into using home assistant now. I can't keep track anymore. I've never actually had the need i've gotten close to setting it up

334
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,800
But i've never pulled the trigger. So I I know you use it quite extensively

335
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,240
So I thought maybe you could kind of explain it to us since i'm obviously not

336
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:27,800
As hands-on experienced I understand in the abstract, but i'd like to hear from you. I use mqtt for my tasmota devices

337
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,280
However, more recently I found that it's becoming less and less necessary in the home assistant world

338
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,960
Simply because the native home assistant api integration is becoming that much more mature

339
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:47,480
So if you know a couple of years ago when I gave that first talk at linux fest northwest about home assistant and mqtt

340
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,920
And that kind of thing

341
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:55,320
There weren't as many native home assistant api integrations. And so it was a it was a lot more necessary back then

342
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,520
And so the thing that I use it for the most is for I think my tasmota smart plugs

343
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,160
Whenever they are doing something

344
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:11,240
They publish, you know, they're the amount of current going through the plug their current state, you know

345
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:17,800
The the last time they were rebooted all of these things get sent to specific topics as messages

346
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:25,640
What other mqtt clients can do of which home assistant is one of them is they can subscribe to those topics?

347
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:32,200
And react when certain types of messages come in so think of it rather than you know

348
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,600
Like the infrared remote kind of model where you you blast out information in the hopes that somebody's going to be receiving it

349
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,120
mqtt is doing the blasting of

350
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,520
Information but it's also able to contextually figure out whether that message was received

351
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,360
When it gets a certain response on a different topic, so you could have different states of things

352
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,600
Being received like a garage door. It could say garage door is currently open by publishing to a specific topic

353
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:07,720
A certain message that kind of thing. So it's it's useful when your iot devices need a two-way

354
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
kind of contextual

355
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,240
Awareness of each other and I think the other nice aspect of it is it's essentially

356
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,920
As lightweight as it gets and it's not necessarily dependent to run over tcp

357
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:26,440
But it most commonly does and that that subscribe model means that a low-powered device

358
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:33,400
Could only subscribe to the things that the topics that it absolutely needs to and so it doesn't have to maybe check in as often

359
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,280
And run the cpu as much which saves battery life. Yeah, and a nice example would be something

360
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,440
In the connected world where like my car tells my house to open my garage door

361
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,400
And start my coffee maker or something like that. That's that series of events needs to send a bunch of messages

362
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,280
Across a various different number of apis and and the idea behind mqtt

363
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,320
Was to unify those apis behind what's called a broker

364
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:07,080
So each of those devices the car would publish a message to the broker

365
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,880
Under a specific topic and then another device would be subscribed to that topic and react based on that message

366
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,240
And the nice thing is is the car doesn't have to remain online because the broker holds that message

367
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,840
Correct. Yep. Mm-hmm. Also another way to save battery life. It's nice. If you have some leds, for example

368
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,720
You want to know what color they are, you know home assistant

369
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
And others, you know, um

370
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,840
Smart lighting systems are only as smart as the last message they receive

371
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,160
because these

372
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,600
Devices are publishing to the topic all the time

373
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,760
They can say my current rgb value is this so home assistant without having to constantly publish

374
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,960
So home assistant without having to constantly poll the device

375
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,800
Is also aware of what's happening on that device just by listening

376
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,960
But like you were saying at the beginning with the amount of integrations that are available now

377
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,600
And a lot of the devices you buy today you can buy with home assistant integration in mind

378
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,320
I actually haven't been compelled to set this up yet

379
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:11,500
But I I imagine there will be a future some device something I want to do that just simply works better using mqtt

380
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:17,340
Uh, maybe it's maybe it's a tasmota plug. Maybe it's a shelly something like that

381
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,540
I could see pushing me into using it if you need it, you'll know

382
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,620
Our next question is about dns. Do you want to take this one? Yeah, and uh, this is kind of this is kind of a good

383
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:33,020
Tie-in because everything on a network always runs a lot better when your dns is in good shape ben writes in and he

384
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:38,780
He says he listens religiously, but he says we mentioned in our last show about hosting our own dns

385
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:44,460
I'm wondering what you run and why so, um, I generally will I mentioned it briefly

386
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:52,540
I'll generally self-host dns on any land that I run anywhere for performance reasons mostly because local dns lookups

387
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,860
That happen over your lan are faster than going out to your isp or even all the way out to google or open dns

388
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,380
It's just a simpler

389
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,940
Straighter shot doesn't even have to go out through a router

390
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,100
So that's one reason is performance

391
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,500
The other aspect of that of course is is everything caches that means that it has a lot of records

392
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:15,020
So if I go to a lot of the same places on my machines once one machine's gone there. I have those records locally

393
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,540
which also improves performance and

394
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,780
Additionally, I like to be able to resolve all of my uh machines by name if possible

395
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,500
So a lot of times i'll use whatever solution ties and integrates in with dhcp

396
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,540
So that way when the dhcp server issues a lease

397
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:37,580
It also then dynamically updates my dns server with that new client's

398
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,420
host name

399
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,020
Not all dhcp and dns

400
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,340
So systems do this but if there's like a if there's an option in the land i'm using that's straightforward

401
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,700
I go that route

402
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,100
There's a lot of ways you can do this. Sometimes it's dns mass

403
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,500
Sometimes it's just something built into a router. It sort of depends on the hardware and equipment you're using

404
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,940
I don't have any religious like devotion to bind or

405
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:04,220
Or anything like that alex. Do you have a specific like dns religion on your lands? I wouldn't go as far as a religion

406
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,820
I mean I I run

407
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,780
Open sense, uh, and I run pf sense for a long time

408
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,540
Open sense uses unbound as its built-in dns server

409
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,260
But to complicate matters, I also run

410
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,340
ad guard home

411
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,020
Which does dns level ad filtering across my entire network

412
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,820
So the way I handle this is my dhcp leases

413
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:31,740
Is hand out the ip address of the vm that's running ad guard home

414
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,380
ad guard home is then

415
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:41,500
Asked to forward any queries that it doesn't know the answer to to open sense and then open sense forwards any queries

416
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,500
It doesn't know the answer to

417
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,300
to

418
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,300
Cloudflare or google or whoever

419
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:52,300
And the reason I have to do that is because i'm running open shift and kubernetes clusters on my lan and I want to configure

420
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,020
the dns overrides in

421
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,400
unbound because they know because the router has the

422
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,840
The firewall has the knowledge of which ip address is belonging to which vm and mac address and that kind of stuff

423
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,160
But I also want the ad blocking capabilities of ad guard as well because mobile browsing is just a dumpster fire without it

424
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,760
so

425
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,600
There's lots of different ways. There's no right or wrong way to skin this particular cat. I actually wrote a blog post

426
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
on how to do this with

427
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,480
Unbound and pie hole a little while ago, which i'll put a link to in the show notes

428
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,320
Yeah, and to directly answer your question ben I at home am presently using pie hole and have been

429
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,280
Very happy with it. If you use it as your ghcp server. It also does that handy update of the dynamic dns

430
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,680
Datadog.com slash self hosted today's episode of self hosted is sponsored by datadog

431
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:50,800
They're the unified monitoring platform that gives you real-time observability and detailed insights into your docker performance as well

432
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:58,320
Why not enhance your visibility into container orchestration with a live container view and you can easily detect clusters that are consuming excessive

433
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:06,400
Resources and you get an auto generated map that shows you how everything connects together out of the box datadog collects critical metrics from each

434
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:12,080
Of your containers so you get immediate visibility into aggregated and even disaggregated service level traffic

435
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,920
This is beautiful insights when you're developing an application or when you need to troubleshoot something and it all gets displayed elegantly

436

If you're a sys admin or your developer

440
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:40,240
I think you're going to be really drawn to datadog because it was created initially to solve that problem between communicating between sys admins

441
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,760
And developers but now it's really grown over the years into quite the unified metrics platform

442
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,520
And just a couple of years ago, they rewrote their agent into go that makes it really efficient and easy to get an agent

443
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,320
Running on a machine that needs it. So get started go to datadog.com slash self hosted get that 14-day free trial and

445
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,480
We may as well call this episode google turning the screw hey, yeah, really? Yeah and google photos

446
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,000
This one hurts because I got sucked into google photos. I tried to divorce google photos

447
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,040
And then I was pulled right back in and I was promised

448
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,040
Free storage forever. Well, don't you still get it because you've got a pixel, right?

449
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,560
Does that only count if you take photos on the pixel because that's probably the phone I use the least these days to take photos

450
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,720
Yeah, nothing really changes for me though alex because I paid for two terabytes of google drive storage

451
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,800
And then they're emailed to me telling me that they're discontinuing the unlimited storage

452
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,320
They said but by our estimations you're gonna have four years before you have to worry about it

453
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,640
And nothing's changing until june the 1st 2021. It's worth saying so

454
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,420
Google photos will end its free unlimited storage

455
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,720
in 2021

456
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,320
And the verge writes that you will have to start paying after you hit the 15 gigabyte cap

457
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,560
Google already counts original quality photo uploads against the storage cap

458
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,880
But by taking away unlimited backup for high quality photos and video

459
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,060
Which by the way are horribly compressed if you've ever gone back and looked at any of those high quality

460
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,960
Pictures they are like youtube bad compressed. They they can be really bad sometimes

461
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
But I think they're taking away

462
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,200
One of the service's single biggest selling points, honestly

463
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:32,000
There is one law that seems to be true on the internet is unlimited storage never lasts never lasts. How can it?

464
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,760
It's not sustainable, is it?

465
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,680
I mean if you think about how much just a single 10 terabyte drive costs you or me

466
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,720
okay, we're not buying it anywhere near the scale google are so they're not paying what we're paying but

467
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,600
I've got three or four terabytes up in the cloud and I expect that to be highly available

468
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,300
replicated across multiple regions and

469
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,160
I mean that's all transparent to me

470
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,080
But these are the assumptions i'm making about what google are doing on the back end with the storage

471
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,080
It's not just one disk that I have to pay for the lifespan of

472
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:07,200
And so there'll be some people that are using way way way more than that 15 gig. Some people will be using

473
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:15,200
Terabytes video production studios that kind of stuff. Yeah, I have I have a two terabyte google disk myself

474
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,720
Just for that, you know a little extra space on you know, and I don't want to worry about it for a while

475
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,200
but seeing this news and

476
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Just always kind of staying

477
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,320
Google aware, you know, like you have to stay bear aware when you're in the woods

478
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,920
Well when you're on the internet you have to you need to stay google aware and it has this issue coming up again has reminded

479
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,080
Me that I should probably start planning an exit strategy from google photos

480
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,480
Yeah

481
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,600
But you know in some point in the future you're going to want to just open a photos app and type the word mountain

482
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:49,200
And just get all the mountain machine learning pictures that they found or let's be real. I want to find pictures of levi really quick

483
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,280
He's a cute dog, I think it would be quicker for you to find pictures that aren't at levi probably

484
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Fair play to you. Yeah, it's very true

485
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,460
That's the holy grail of self-hosting photo managers is can you have search and object recognition?

486
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,960
That's competitive with google photos. That's something we've been asked with the from the audience

487
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:17,280
It's something we've asked ourselves and it appears that a project called photo prism is promising to deliver just that

488
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,200
Actual object recognition automatically tagged and then available via search in a web ui

489
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,440
Similar but maybe even superior to the google photos web ui and alexander you had a chance to try it out

490
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,360
so it does machine learning based on the tensorflow library and uh, I don't know it's

491
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,240
It's fine. It's it's no google photos, but it's certainly promising

492
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,280
They have a demo available if people want to try it out

493
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,380
I'll see if I can't get that linked in the show notes, but it's demo.photoprism.org

494
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,240
And you could go get a sense of how usable this thing is and it worked

495
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,800
You can search for mountain and it will find all of the pictures of mountain or you can search for dog

496
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
And it will find all the pictures of dog

497
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,560
Does this I assume just sit on top of a directory that you have passed through in docker compose?

498
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Yeah, so the first time you add a directory in through docker compose

499
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,920
You have to put it in a very specific place in order for photoprism to pick it up

500
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
so

501
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,820
Photoprism expects it to be in slash photoprism

502
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,520
slash originals

503
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,240
And once it's given that path so through a volume by matt in a container

504
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,640
you can obviously make that any host path on your

505
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,020
Pi or whatever else is is running this but you're going to need some horsepower

506
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:40,020
I've got a dual socket zeon system running my server and i've been importing my

507
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,260
50 000 images

508
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:48,100
All morning and it's now mid afternoon. We're still going and we're only about 20 of the way through

509
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,180
Wow, it's pegged every single cpu core

510
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:58,660
So my I have 16 cpu cores passed through to this vm. My load average is at 18

511
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,660
I thought it would be on the gpu to tell you the truth. This is going to take quite a while on the cpu

512
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,460
I don't have a gpu in that system. So maybe that's the problem. Okay, okay, huh?

513
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,940
So you throw a box with a lot of resources at it if you want to try out photoprism

514
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,740
But you know, this is what you're paying google photos for right or what you're paying the storage

515
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,340
You're not even having to pay for this aspect, but you know google's doing something very similar

516
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,820
Of course, they're also collecting the data

517
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,940
What kind of appeals to me about photoprism is it means but in a good way I go back to

518
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:35,960
To like the early aughts where I self-managed my photo library and I self-organized it in what's called a directory

519
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:42,100
and and then I just then I just throw something on top of it that does the image recognition and

520
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,820
I'll tell you why i'm kind of burned about the google photos pricing change

521
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:53,300
Google photos came along and it was really good at the object recognition and the search

522
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:59,780
But alex, it was not the only game in the town. I was paying for a commercial service

523
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,260
Where this small team of developers who I knew them?

524
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:09,140
So I was I was comfortable with it. They had created a product that took your photos and created the search index for you

525
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,940
And they were put out of business by google photos because google photos was free

526
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:20,260
And they could not charge eight dollars a month for what google photos did for free and they had to shut down

527
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
And they weren't the only shop that had to do that

528
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:29,140
So google came along and they dumped their google photos product on the market and then after they killed all of the competition

529
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,740
They're now charging for the storage after telling you you'd have a lifetime of storage. It's the walmart effect, isn't it?

530
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,140
And so that's why I think it is maybe worth

531
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:43,140
A few steps back in features and functionality. Like I don't think photoprism is going to like automatically generate

532
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,460
Those movies for you and suggest a book for you like google photos does

533
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,980
But it will give you a ui that sits on top of a directory of photos and searches and tags them

534
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:58,740
And of course your mileage will vary depending on what computational method you use and how many photos are involved

535
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:05,860
Nice thing is is that we've got both options available to us. One is we pay for it with our privacy and

536
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:12,340
You know that that kind of thing and the other one is a completely free and open freedom respecting solution

537
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:20,180
So I really hope that this project continues to improve and i'm going to see if I can contribute to it because photos really is

538
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,180
one of the biggest

539
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,180
pieces of of uh

540
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,820
Our digital lives and um, and it's about you know, it's it's about really capturing your memories

541
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:35,700
It's about capturing some of the most important moments of your life. So as life goes on you you you value those photos even more

542
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,580
Right, so they become more precious over time not less very true. Yeah, so, you know alex

543
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:46,660
so, you know alex, I could see a future blog post and then a segment on the show where you or I have combined a

544
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,580
auto backup from our phone to the file server that then

545
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:56,580
Goes into photoprism that then also does a secure offsite backup. Like I could see a whole photo workflow

546
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,420
future

547
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,220
And so if anybody has any insights if they're doing something like this

548
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:06,020
Why not start collecting intel from the audience go to self-hosted dot show slash contact

549
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,980
What's really interesting is i'm just watching the the processes in htop running running around

550
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,920
photoprism is

551
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,900
Multi-threaded and it's taking up most of the space but every so often I see dark table cli applying custom presets coming through

552
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:28,180
So I think it's using other open source software under the hood dark table to render the previews and stuff like that

553
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:34,580
So it's I think that's pretty cool. That is really cool. That would be a combo. I would use that's so awesome

554
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,500
All right. I think i'm going to try it out. So the only reason I didn't try it before the show

555
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:45,860
is docker sucks at packaging up for the latest linux distributions and so i'm in this no man's zone right now where

556
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,500
Docker hasn't been officially packaged for the distribution i'm using and it drives me crazy and it's

557
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,340
Actually making me want to switch to podman but that is a topic for another show

558
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,620
that's a hangover from several years ago when uh

559
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:03,060
Docker changed their semantic versioning to be monthly based instead

560
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:08,100
And then they decided oh, we're going to create our own yum or apt repos

561
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,620
And then we're going to maintain them except for the fact that new distros come out every six months

562
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,620
And then you need to create a whole new repo

563
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:21,220
For that distro and it's it's a perennial problem with ubuntu and fedora that uh, yes

564
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:28,340
They just don't solve and it really annoys me and I thought you know, I could I could use the the distributions packages

565
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:32,340
But I don't really like doing that. Um, I could swat I could try switching to podman

566
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:37,700
But I decided you know what? I'm just i'm just gonna wait. I'll just wait, you know, Chris

567
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,220
Have you uh, have you have you heard of this thing called, uh arch?

568
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:49,060
By the way, alex runs arch it's just not a problem on arch, you know, no, you're right you're right

569
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:55,640
You're right. You're absolutely right. The funny thing is is I i'm using the distribution of your employer and you're using some hippie distribution

570
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,300
Because i'm on fedora 33 hey now

571
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,860
Hey now my server's ubuntu. My desktop is arch. Yep. My laptop is fedora

572
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,780
so

573
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,540
I don't care. You're not only a multi distro guy. You're a multi os guy

574
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:13,460
You you really hold no platform allegiance as you just use what's best and that's what I like about you

575
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:20,100
I I try to uh, I want to mention our sponsor a cloud guru has a python 3 scripting course for system administrators

576
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,020
If you need to develop some skills to write effective and powerful python scripts

577
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:29,060
A cloud guru has a course that will have you completely covered and beyond just the language itself

578
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:36,100
You'll go through full development processes including project setup planning and automated testing to build different command line tools

579
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,660
all with python 3

580
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,820
So go check out a cloud guru for that

581
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:46,020
We have a link in the show notes if you want to go directly to this python 3 scripting for system administrator courses

582
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,100
I think you're gonna like it. So we'll have a link in the show notes over at a cloud guru

583
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:55,620
It's python 3 scripting for system administrators definitely worth checking out if you're getting in the python game

584
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,660
Also, I want to mention our members self-hosted dot show slash sre

585
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:06,980
That is our site reliability engineers that support the show and keep us on there. You get a limited ad feed. So it's

586
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,700
Just limited ads just the ones we're contractually obligated to include but you also get extra content

587
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,700
You get the post show

588
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,700
And uh, it's a great way to support the show self-hosted dot show slash sre

589
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,700
I think we're going to be talking about your new smoker this week. Can we oh, are we okay?

590
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:28,260
I'm, totally down and it actually has a self-hosted component to it as well. So that's perfect. Yeah, very good

591
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,380
Well, uh, we've mentioned it earlier in the show, but it's worth mentioning again

592
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,340
There is a way to get get a hold of the of this here humble podcast

593
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,420
Self-hosted dot show slash contact is the place to go to get in touch with us

594
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:44,820
And you can find me on twitter at ironic badger. Yeah, i'm there too at chris las and the show is at self-hosted show

595
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:48,440
Thanks for listening everyone. That was self-hosted dot show slash 32
