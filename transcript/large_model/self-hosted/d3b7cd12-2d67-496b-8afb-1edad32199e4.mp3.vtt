WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
Coming up on the show, I review Home Assistant's new dedicated hardware, Alex is literally buried

00:06.240 --> 00:10.880
in computers, and our favorite Google Docs killer has a big update. I'm Chris.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.040
And I'm Alex, and this is Self Hosted.

00:14.560 --> 00:21.040
Oh, Chris, I am surrounded by computer parts. I mean, literally, I could open a shop right now.

00:21.040 --> 00:25.360
I've got every single computer I own in pieces right now.

00:25.360 --> 00:30.240
I feel your pain. I am surrounded in laptop parts at the moment.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.320
Is that because of the XPS reviews you're doing?

00:32.320 --> 00:36.080
Yeah, I have a couple of machines in for review at the moment, plus a personal server project that

00:36.080 --> 00:40.640
I'm working on. And then I was moving offices, and I had all of the different screws neatly

00:40.640 --> 00:47.520
organized for each laptop case. And my daughter came in and said, what are these, daddy? And

00:47.520 --> 00:48.160
mixed them.

00:48.160 --> 00:48.800
Oh, no.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.040
Mixed them all.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.320
Screws to the worst as well.

00:54.320 --> 00:54.960
Yeah.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.960
Particularly laptop-sized ones.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.840
What are you deep in projects over there, several at a time?

00:59.840 --> 01:05.520
Yeah, that's just it. So I built a system around the UNAZ and QuickSync a little while ago,

01:06.080 --> 01:10.800
but I decided that I wanted something that was a little more future-proof in terms of expansion

01:10.800 --> 01:16.560
and stuff like that. And the ITX board that the UNAZ case can fit only has one PCI port,

01:16.560 --> 01:21.520
which is taken up with the HBA disk expansion card that I have.

01:21.520 --> 01:22.240
Right.

01:22.240 --> 01:28.240
Right. And so if I wanted to put, say, OpenCent as a VM on top of Proxmox, I don't have any

01:28.240 --> 01:34.640
PCI ports to add an extra NIC to the motherboard. So anyway, I decided to take my desktop motherboard

01:34.640 --> 01:40.720
and put it into my Rosewill server case that was housing my dual Xeon system. Basically,

01:40.720 --> 01:46.880
all this comes as a result of me finally deciding to break up with my dual Xeon system and go

01:46.880 --> 01:51.040
all in on QuickSync. It's worked really well for the last month or so as I've been testing

01:51.040 --> 01:56.480
it in the UNAZ build. So I'm going all in. My Home Lab is going to be an i5-8500,

01:56.480 --> 02:02.960
and my NAS is going to be also an i5-8500. So yeah, I'll have two of those QuickSync-capable

02:02.960 --> 02:08.080
systems in the house. And the idea is that I've got one system that is just sort of

02:08.800 --> 02:15.520
always on, bulletproof, and is running Blueiris and Home Assistant and DNS, separate from the

02:15.520 --> 02:21.440
storage, which will be running on the other system, which is housing Plex and media apps

02:21.440 --> 02:25.840
and that kind of stuff. Because the one you take offline most of all is the one with the hard

02:25.840 --> 02:30.800
drives in it. And it's not like I take it offline a lot, but when I do, it takes everything out

02:30.800 --> 02:36.880
because I've got, you know, all of my services running on one box. So it's been a pain because

02:36.880 --> 02:43.440
I've had to move all of my desktop out of its case and my server out of its case and my...

02:43.440 --> 02:47.360
It's just, I've got literally four or five computers worth of parts around me and I'm

02:47.360 --> 02:52.960
selling stuff off to people and it's, it's nuts. And doing the day job all off a laptop

02:52.960 --> 02:58.560
in the meantime, I suppose. Yes. Yeah. And the worst part is my IRC bouncer for Red Hat is

02:58.560 --> 03:02.960
currently in pieces on the table behind me. So I haven't been on IRC all day, which has been a bit bad.

03:04.720 --> 03:10.480
I was moving offices recently and like literally like my priority was get the desktop reset up,

03:10.480 --> 03:15.280
get everything connected, get it powered on. It's gotta be online. The best part was as well that

03:15.280 --> 03:19.200
my laptop decided it was going to screw up and I had to reinstall that today as well. So I've,

03:19.200 --> 03:23.280
I've completely nuked and paved seemingly everything in this house and I'm starting from

03:23.280 --> 03:28.640
scratch. So that's going to be fun. I haven't yet found out what I've forgotten to back up yet,

03:28.640 --> 03:33.520
but I'm sure there'll be something. And days of setting small little things up as it always goes.

03:33.520 --> 03:38.320
Yeah. Just before we were recorded, for example, I'd turn off turbo boost on my Mac so that the

03:38.320 --> 03:44.480
fans weren't spinning up. Oh, Max. Well, let's take a moment and say that this episode is brought to

03:44.480 --> 03:48.880
you by the all new cloud guru, the leader in learning for the cloud for Linux and other modern

03:48.880 --> 03:53.040
tech skills. They have hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs. So get certified,

03:53.040 --> 04:00.400
get hired and get learning at a cloud guru.com. One of the things I have in my new office is a

04:00.400 --> 04:05.600
bench for projects and I have the new home assistant blue hardware on there, which I'm

04:05.600 --> 04:10.480
going to be talking about in a little bit in the show. But in the meantime, before we get there,

04:10.480 --> 04:17.280
Alex and I kind of wanted to do a PSA on the show and talk a moment about hedge doc, which might be

04:17.280 --> 04:22.480
a solution for anyone out there who wants a really modern Google docs alternative that you can self

04:22.480 --> 04:28.960
host. And it happens to be an excellent Markdown editor. Real-time collaborative editing for

04:28.960 --> 04:34.640
Markdown documents. It's great. You know, we've used it at JB now for how long? Two years?

04:34.640 --> 04:40.160
Three? Yeah. So it's, it's stood the test of time, battle tested in, in production, air quotes.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.200
You use it for all the LUP show notes as well and stuff like that. And you and Wes use it and

04:45.200 --> 04:50.160
we use it for all the shows. And now I use it for a lot of my notes, just for JB stuff in general.

04:50.160 --> 04:56.800
It's the project for formerly known as Cody MD. They went through a name change, uh, to annoy,

04:56.800 --> 05:00.880
just to avoid, um, like naming conflicts out there. Cause I guess there was another project

05:00.880 --> 05:06.240
that's had a similar name. And so now it's called hedge doc and it lets you just easily collaborate

05:06.240 --> 05:10.560
on Markdown documents. And all you really have to do is get started and you just share a link

05:10.560 --> 05:15.280
with somebody and now they're in and they can start editing. And then if you create an account,

05:15.280 --> 05:19.920
you get kind of like a document library and it'll, it supports things like tags, which we don't use

05:19.920 --> 05:25.280
a lot, but it supports things that allow you to recall documents pretty quickly or categorize

05:25.280 --> 05:31.040
documents. It also does real time rendering of that Markdown so you can see what you're writing in

05:31.040 --> 05:35.680
real time. And then it gives you a bunch of a shortcuts. So maybe you don't remember how to do

05:35.680 --> 05:40.480
a table in Markdown or embed an image. It's got a button for that as well. It does. Yeah. I didn't

05:40.480 --> 05:47.520
know that right along, right along the top there. Yeah. And, uh, Alex, you recently reset it up for

05:47.520 --> 05:52.080
us cause we were on an older Cody MD instance. Yeah, that's right. There's nothing more permanent

05:52.080 --> 05:56.880
than a temporary solution, right? Yeah. Wes threw it up on a, was it a droplet or something a couple

05:56.880 --> 06:01.680
of years ago? We wanted to test it for an episode of Linux unplugged or something like that. And

06:01.680 --> 06:07.120
then we liked it so much, we just kept using it. That's right. And it was, uh, it was just hanging

06:07.120 --> 06:11.920
out on an open port with no TLS or anything. So I've been wanting to fix that for a while. So when

06:11.920 --> 06:18.800
I saw the renaming come through on the Linux server image, I was just like, yes, here's my excuse to

06:18.800 --> 06:26.320
push it to Chris and say, I can do it. Yep. So, uh, yeah, Wes sent me the database. He, uh, zipped

06:26.320 --> 06:32.960
up the, uh, the Docker app data volume that stores, you know, the database and stuff like that, uh,

06:32.960 --> 06:40.480
span it up in a container on Linode, uh, with, you know, just SCP the tar.gz file across, unzipped

06:40.480 --> 06:47.040
it, pointed the container at the correct directory. And, uh, I think it uses Postgres on the backend

06:47.040 --> 06:53.680
our setup, uh, all the infrastructure by the way is open sourced on the, uh, self-hosted infra wiki,

06:53.680 --> 07:00.480
not wiki, uh, GitHub, GitHub repo. Um, but yeah, it just came straight up, you know, there was,

07:00.480 --> 07:05.200
there was no drama. The only slightly tricky bit was that you own the domain name and we had to

07:05.200 --> 07:10.080
point the name service for the domain name at my Cloudflare account so that we could get TLS

07:10.080 --> 07:16.720
through traffic working with, uh, the DNS challenge. Yeah, but I love what we ended up with. Um, it's

07:16.720 --> 07:21.920
a cute little URL. That's easy for the team to remember and it makes it possible to share easily

07:21.920 --> 07:26.960
with anybody and they'll, they'll remember it as well. So I think it turned out to be a pretty nice

07:26.960 --> 07:32.960
setup and maybe the perfect time to migrate. I mean, it seems like it was nearly flawless

07:32.960 --> 07:38.400
to import a somewhat stale Kodi MD database right into HedgeDog.

07:38.400 --> 07:43.680
So if you're, if you're using Kodi MD today, it's probably a good time to upgrade because that,

07:43.680 --> 07:47.920
that migration is pretty simple right now. Easy peasy. Yeah. There's a couple of options for

07:47.920 --> 07:53.280
containers that you could use. Linux server, of course, make a container for this one. Um,

07:53.280 --> 07:59.920
they've migrated over from Kodi MD to HedgeDog, but I actually ended up for our installation here

07:59.920 --> 08:04.160
using the one that the development team now provide. This is the thing about Linux server is

08:04.160 --> 08:08.480
a lot of their images make projects popular enough that the devs go, Oh, we've got lots of people

08:08.480 --> 08:13.120
using it in Docker. And then the projects themselves start providing an image. And

08:13.120 --> 08:18.400
generally speaking, I will keep using the Linux server image until I have good reason to switch.

08:18.400 --> 08:24.080
And the, uh, the migration seemed like the, like a perfect excuse, as you say. So, yeah,

08:24.080 --> 08:29.360
we're running out of the official HedgeDog image and yeah, it just works and there's nothing more

08:29.360 --> 08:35.520
really to say about that. It's the best kind of tool because admittedly, it takes a little more

08:35.520 --> 08:40.720
skillset and a little more effort than just going and signing up for a Google doc for, you know,

08:40.720 --> 08:44.560
signing into a Google docs account and using Google docs. Like it takes a little more effort

08:44.560 --> 08:51.120
than that, but we own this it's self-hosted and we get to have fun with the domain because of that.

08:51.120 --> 08:57.360
We get to, we get to just sort of own the entire stack and that's great because it's

08:57.360 --> 09:02.640
a tool we use every single day, six days a week to produce the shows.

09:02.640 --> 09:09.440
And replicate the data from the backend to a local endpoint that so it's, it's completely

09:09.440 --> 09:15.520
backed up offline so that if for any reason that Linode ever had a problem, we're good to go.

09:15.520 --> 09:23.680
Linode.com slash SSH go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account and support the show.

09:23.680 --> 09:28.400
Like Alex was saying, they are our cloud server provider. We have the wiki on there.

09:28.400 --> 09:33.040
PerfectMediaServer.com is on their hedge docs on there and a lot more. We have the matrix server

09:33.040 --> 09:38.800
on there. We have our casting coding server, next cloud, a lot of our backend infrastructure

09:38.800 --> 09:42.640
and new things that we're working on that we haven't even announced. We're hosting them all

09:42.640 --> 09:46.880
on Linode. And personally, one of the things that I think is great about Linode is all the

09:46.880 --> 09:50.400
distributions they support. So whatever environment you're comfortable working in,

09:50.400 --> 09:57.040
even the Alpines, Arch, recent CentOS releases, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, several versions of

09:57.040 --> 10:03.360
Ubuntu, on and on and on. But what I really like about Linode is you can tell when a company is

10:03.360 --> 10:08.400
passionate about the actual technology. And I think people listening to the show probably get

10:08.400 --> 10:12.080
that when you, when you're passionate about the technology, you have the insight into what it's

10:12.080 --> 10:19.040
capable of. And that's why Linode started in 2003 as one of the very first companies to

10:19.040 --> 10:23.840
as one of the very first companies in something we weren't even really calling cloud computing yet.

10:23.840 --> 10:30.560
That was three years before AWS even started. And now they're the largest independent cloud provider

10:30.560 --> 10:37.280
and you can get a $100 credit and play with infrastructure that's professional grade with

10:37.280 --> 10:42.400
native SSDs, 40 gigabit connections to the hypervisors, 11 data centers around the world,

10:42.400 --> 10:49.920
object storage, node balancers, a really nice clean dashboard. You can get started

10:49.920 --> 10:54.960
at linode.com slash SSH. You go there, get that $100, 60 day credit towards a new account

10:54.960 --> 10:59.520
and support the show. It's linode.com slash SSH.

11:01.680 --> 11:05.600
Alright then, why don't you tell me about this Home Assistant Blue Box. I've been pretty jealous,

11:05.600 --> 11:07.280
honestly, since I heard you got yours.

11:07.280 --> 11:12.560
You know, it's real. I was watching the Home Assistant conference when they announced it and

11:12.560 --> 11:17.760
I ordered one as fast as I could. A lot of other people did too because the order page was having

11:17.760 --> 11:25.040
issues. But it is a small, tiny, I mean, it's not as small as a Raspberry Pi, but it's smaller than

11:25.040 --> 11:31.360
a NUC or any kind of desktop PC. And it is a dedicated Home Assistant box and it's called

11:31.360 --> 11:37.600
the Home Assistant Blue. It's a six core ARM processor system. It has four gigs of DDR4 RAM

11:38.160 --> 11:45.600
and a big upgrade over the Raspberry Pi 4 is it comes with 128 gigabytes of eMMC storage.

11:45.600 --> 11:51.440
Plus, of course, there's other ways to expand that like through USB because it has four USB 3.0

11:51.440 --> 12:00.720
ports on the sucker, as well as an Ethernet and full HDMI out. And it's really well built, Alex.

12:00.720 --> 12:06.960
It's very, very solid. I would feel comfortable with this strapped to the RV going down the road

12:06.960 --> 12:14.720
for years. On the inside or the outside? Definitely the inside. But the top is a nice blue aluminum.

12:14.720 --> 12:19.520
They've made it look really nice with a classy white version of the Home Assistant logo.

12:19.520 --> 12:25.520
And the bottom is an integrated heat sink system. Oh, neat. How big is it? It's about four inches

12:25.520 --> 12:34.160
wide and about I'd say about an inch and a half high at its peak, maybe because it's kind of got

12:34.160 --> 12:40.560
an arched shape to the case. And it's about half a pound in weight. So it's just over half a pound.

12:40.560 --> 12:45.600
So it's got a really solid, hefty feel to it. So it's like what, a couple of CD cases stacked

12:45.600 --> 12:50.720
on top of each other? Yeah, with a little bit of an arch at the top of it. And what's really

12:50.720 --> 12:57.040
at the heart of this thing is an Odroid N2 Plus. That's really what this is. I've noted that the

12:57.040 --> 13:02.640
Home Assistant team has mentioned the Odroid N2 Plus a few times, and it seemed to be one of the

13:02.640 --> 13:08.320
favorite devices of one of the primary Home Assistant developers. So I think this box is kind

13:08.320 --> 13:14.800
of like their favorite experience. It's the one that they personally test on. And so to say it's

13:14.800 --> 13:19.920
well supported is an understatement. And so I think it was a natural fit for them to just bundle it

13:19.920 --> 13:23.520
when they partnered up with a hardware provider. In terms of a smart home hub,

13:24.240 --> 13:30.880
it's lacking a couple of things. So you need to add Z-Wave or Zigbee via USB, right? Yep. Although

13:30.880 --> 13:35.040
that's the same kind of trade off you have with any of these other kind of arm boards, because

13:35.040 --> 13:41.520
it's kind of competing, it's between something like a SmartThings Home Hub and a Raspberry Pi

13:41.520 --> 13:46.240
DIY kit. It's like trying to live in that middle ground there. So remind me of the price then,

13:46.240 --> 13:53.440
how much was it? It's listed for $140, but after all in for me with $21 and change of shipping,

13:54.000 --> 14:00.720
it was $180 total to get this device. Oh, okay. I had a hundred in my mind for some reason,

14:00.720 --> 14:06.640
but 180. Wow. Okay. That's getting up there. Well, okay. So I'll get to the value. So I'll,

14:06.640 --> 14:10.480
you know, the first boot experience, they're trying to make it very out of the box friendly,

14:10.480 --> 14:15.120
two steps to set up. You plug it in to your network and then go to your browser and you

14:15.120 --> 14:19.760
type in homeassistant.local and it's supposed to just come up. But of course, that's not how it

14:19.760 --> 14:24.080
works on my network. I already have a DNS and DHCP server set up and my system isn't going to start

14:24.080 --> 14:29.680
resolving some new machine, but I was able to get the IP out of the DHCP log, pretty simple.

14:29.680 --> 14:35.680
Put that in, went to port 8123. And it's really at this point, it's a basic home assistant install.

14:35.680 --> 14:39.440
It's really kind of just what you'd expect if you'd set up the home assistant suite with

14:39.440 --> 14:47.360
supervisor and everything you create the first time account. But Alex, it feels fast. It definitely

14:47.360 --> 14:54.000
feels noticeably faster in the UI than my raspberry PI for granted. It's a new, happy,

14:54.000 --> 14:58.320
fresh install, but I've set up home assistant enough times on the PI to know what it feels

14:58.320 --> 15:01.920
like. And I can tell you with confidence, this thing absolutely feels faster.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.480
Are you SD card based in the PI then?

15:04.480 --> 15:06.000
USB. So it is on a disc.

15:06.000 --> 15:06.800
Oh really?

15:06.800 --> 15:07.040
Yeah.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.080
That's interesting then.

15:08.080 --> 15:12.400
I think it's just got a little more horsepower and I think the developers are optimizing for

15:12.400 --> 15:17.200
this thing. That's why when we talk about the value, so I'd say rounded off to $200

15:17.200 --> 15:25.760
or just under $200 just as a concept price point. Well, what is a totally local,

15:26.640 --> 15:32.960
merges all the different vendors together with no subscription and is completely under your control

15:32.960 --> 15:40.880
standalone box worth. See to me, home assistant is one of the few open source projects that has

15:40.880 --> 15:48.240
changed my life at the level that like say Linux has. Where it has changed the quality of life

15:49.040 --> 15:56.160
for my entire family. And I also use it here at the studio to help with remote presence and other

15:56.160 --> 16:00.480
like, you know, just light management in the studio. And so it also helps in a professional

16:00.480 --> 16:06.160
capacity. So $200 for a dedicated box. It's really fast. It feels very well built. I mean,

16:06.160 --> 16:12.640
it feels like a polished product. That is also supporting home assistant development at the same

16:12.640 --> 16:18.880
time when I buy it. I feel like that's, you know, under $200. It is a good value for this. And I

16:18.880 --> 16:22.240
think I'm actually going to buy another one. I'm going to buy one for the studio. Cause this is

16:22.240 --> 16:26.720
what I set this one up for. I wasn't sure if I was ready to deploy my serious, serious home

16:26.720 --> 16:30.880
assistant set up yet. So I put it in production here at the studio where it's, it's kind of

16:30.880 --> 16:35.920
important, but honestly, like I could recreate it in a day. You know what I mean? It's that level of,

16:35.920 --> 16:43.040
but at home, like I just, I mean, I would take a snapshot and I would restore the snapshot,

16:43.040 --> 16:48.320
but it just has to be perfect at home because it literally impacts our quality of life. So I wanted

16:48.320 --> 16:53.760
to take it slow and I wasn't sure if I was ready to replace my raspberry pie. But I am a believer

16:53.760 --> 16:59.760
in having home assistant on its own dedicated host, either being a VM or on hardware. And I

16:59.760 --> 17:05.360
don't necessarily think having it live alongside a lot of my other services in Docker while trying

17:05.360 --> 17:10.720
to also use the supervisor is a good long-term strategy. Like in there, it gives me errors about

17:10.720 --> 17:15.760
being on an unsupported OS all the time. And I look at the development trajectory and I think

17:15.760 --> 17:20.160
if they're selling these machines and they are themselves are developing, like you have to

17:20.160 --> 17:24.480
imagine the developers all have these or will all have these, that's likely where they're going to

17:24.480 --> 17:27.920
invest a lot of their time and energy. And they're going to be developing with a mindset that they're

17:27.920 --> 17:33.440
doing it on a dedicated host. When I look at the power draw for this thing and I look at the, you

17:33.440 --> 17:38.720
know, I got to always do that math. Like if I bring a box in, I really have to be aware of what it's

17:38.720 --> 17:44.560
going to take because I want to be able to go off grid. I want to be able to survive on solar power

17:44.560 --> 17:49.520
alone, which means I got to extend the life of my batteries as long as possible. And that's

17:49.520 --> 17:55.600
possible. And this thing under load, and I'm not, you know, I didn't, I didn't do extensive testing

17:55.600 --> 18:01.520
here, but it went, it was right in line with what their specs were six Watts. That's pretty

18:01.520 --> 18:08.000
remarkable. Six Watts. Wow. Yeah. And, and around idle, it was around two Watts, sometimes two and

18:08.000 --> 18:13.040
a half Watts. I only really started testing it today. So I want to do more extensive testing,

18:13.040 --> 18:17.440
like, because it's a pretty simple home assistant install, but I was monitoring it during the first

18:17.440 --> 18:21.600
load and getting all that stuff like first set up. And I monitored a little bit under, under just

18:21.600 --> 18:25.600
sitting there idle, you know, just like kind of just daily, just sitting there running. That's

18:25.600 --> 18:28.880
what I noted. And I went and checked and I looked up their specs for this, for this board. And that's

18:28.880 --> 18:34.080
exactly what it's in line with the specs. Pretty sure my garage door opener uses more than six

18:34.080 --> 18:39.600
Watts just sat there doing nothing all day. I know there's power bricks that just sit there and

18:39.600 --> 18:44.320
plugged into the wall that use more than two Watts. Yeah. So we'll see, because that's the,

18:44.320 --> 18:50.800
that's the big deal breaker is if that ends up being a higher, higher load wattage that would be,

18:50.800 --> 18:55.360
that'd be a deal breaker. But at this point, I think plugging in a device that would be using

18:55.360 --> 19:00.480
around six Watts would be kind of just lost in the wash. I don't think I'm really going to notice

19:00.480 --> 19:04.400
that on my runtime. So I think it means from a power budget standpoint, I can put this thing

19:04.400 --> 19:09.280
in production. I think, I think I'm going to get another one. You do like highly available

19:09.280 --> 19:14.800
single board computers though, don't you? So there is something to this. You could,

19:14.800 --> 19:19.520
you know, if a guy really wanted, he could buy two of these. I'm not saying he should,

19:19.520 --> 19:25.040
but he could and just keep one in the drawer. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And keep a snapshot somewhere.

19:25.600 --> 19:31.520
And if one pops you in, in 35 seconds, you pull it out. All the plugs are all the same.

19:31.520 --> 19:35.920
You swap it in and you restore the snapshot and you're back in business.

19:35.920 --> 19:40.960
Well, if ever there is a use case for a literal plug and play appliance,

19:40.960 --> 19:46.800
it's your smart home hub. Yeah. And this is version one, right? And maybe even, and I'm not,

19:46.800 --> 19:51.120
I'm not knocking it when I say this, but maybe it's even version 0.5 because I have a sense

19:51.120 --> 19:56.320
this kind of came along during the year and it's, it's, it's a really good, it's a really good first,

19:56.320 --> 20:02.560
first start, but I could see future ones that maybe have things like Zigbee or Z-Wave or,

20:02.560 --> 20:06.960
or whatever this new conglomerate standard is that I can't remember.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.960
Makes me think of the XKCD comic.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.640
Yeah. Just one more standard, Alex. That's all we need.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.440
There are 12 standards. We should have one that unifies them all.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.360
Okay. Now we have 13 standards. Great.

20:18.400 --> 20:22.720
Also, like, you know, one that has wifi built in. I don't know how they would handle it with the,

20:22.720 --> 20:26.800
the metal housing, because I think the casing is providing some heat transfer.

20:26.800 --> 20:30.800
It's mostly cool to the touch. The bottom is warm, but that's, that's kind of expected.

20:30.800 --> 20:36.400
It's a heat sink. Is, is wifi the right kind of expectation to set for reliability for this type

20:36.400 --> 20:40.160
of device though? Probably in that light, it's probably a good thing. They at least didn't put

20:40.160 --> 20:46.400
it in 1.0. Right. I'll tell you one thing that I am just a little concerned about, and I'd be

20:46.400 --> 20:53.360
really curious to see how this actually plays out in the long-term for you, is eMMC write endurance

20:53.360 --> 21:00.400
is not famously very good. So I'd be curious to see how Home Assistant, which writes a lot of data

21:00.400 --> 21:06.160
to that database all the time will be, you know, in, in a year or two's time, whether it'll have

21:06.160 --> 21:12.080
burnt through that flash or not. Yeah. And I wouldn't be surprised if they have a way to

21:12.080 --> 21:16.320
switch it to USB storage. Cause I do remember there being some discussion about that during

21:16.320 --> 21:21.120
the product launch, but going through like the first time setup process, there's nothing that

21:21.120 --> 21:25.760
prompts you to store it anywhere else. You know, it's all on that eMMC. I got bitten with a PF

21:25.760 --> 21:32.480
sense box. Uh, this was, um, one of the APU 1D boxes, I think several years ago, I didn't move

21:32.480 --> 21:40.400
the logs off of the, uh, M SATA SSD. So obviously M SATA is different to eMMC, but just to, you

21:40.400 --> 21:46.320
know, a related comment really that if you don't move logs off of SSDs, they can wear out pretty

21:46.320 --> 21:52.480
quickly. Yeah. I had a free NAS box that had the eMMC finally die on it. It was a really old one.

21:52.480 --> 21:57.360
It was like an appliance version that somebody pre-built. And, um, that's when I learned that

21:57.360 --> 22:03.920
those things have a limit. Actually, that's when I learned that it was actually even using eMMC

22:06.160 --> 22:10.560
and then I learned they had a limit. So you're right. That's a good thing to keep an eye on.

22:10.560 --> 22:15.200
I'm also gonna, if I was going to put it in production, I would prefer to have all of the

22:15.200 --> 22:19.600
home assistant data and anything that needs a lot of read, write on external storage. I mean,

22:19.600 --> 22:26.240
the thing has plenty of USB ports. I want to take a moment and mention that a cloud guru has

22:26.240 --> 22:31.680
learn Docker by doing, which is a course that gives you a series of hands-on labs that are

22:31.680 --> 22:36.160
picked to showcase Docker and gain experience with it. You hear us talk about Docker all the time.

22:36.160 --> 22:39.760
If you want to learn Docker, you can learn it faster and better when you learn by doing. So

22:39.760 --> 22:45.600
check out the link in the show notes. They have a fundamentals course that features a 100% hands-on

22:45.600 --> 22:50.480
experience. Everything in the course is inside a real Linux environment provisioned with whatever

22:50.480 --> 22:55.920
you need through ACG's hands-on lab and cloud playground platform. There's no reason to wait.

22:55.920 --> 22:59.120
Learn by doing today. Get started at the cloud guru.com.

22:59.120 --> 23:15.760
Isn't that amazing? That's so good. That's exactly what I was thinking of when I was

23:15.760 --> 23:19.600
talking about it that who, do you know who sent that in? Because it's, it's pure amazement.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.120
I do. Yeah. Someone on the discord with the username. Oh yeah.

23:23.120 --> 23:28.960
Yeah. That's perfect. Actually. Wow. Yeah. I really liked that. Yeah. I could see it. Alex,

23:28.960 --> 23:33.760
you know, you and I, in another reality, we're just two morning am DJs talking about people's

23:33.760 --> 23:38.720
tech problems and telling people about the morning commute and the traffic. Yeah. Yes.

23:39.520 --> 23:44.960
Let's come to the chopper. We'd be good at it. I think though, you know, are we silly enough?

23:44.960 --> 23:48.720
Your whole bit would be like a silly face holding a coffee cup, right? And mine,

23:48.720 --> 23:54.560
my thing would be hats, but it's a radio show. So it only worked in the promotional material.

23:55.360 --> 24:01.040
We had a question from gone in a flash on Twitter and he asked, I'm thinking about retiring my

24:01.040 --> 24:06.960
Docker on rancher OS setup as it doesn't support Docker compose. What's the most supported and

24:06.960 --> 24:12.800
easy way to manage an alternative Docker system? Is it something on Ubuntu? Is that light and small

24:12.800 --> 24:18.800
as possible? Thanks. Gone in a flash. So he wants to move off of rancher OS and embrace the Docker

24:18.800 --> 24:24.720
composed lifestyle and is wondering what the simplest minimalist stack is. That's a hard

24:24.720 --> 24:28.720
question to answer because we don't know exactly what his use case is. What would you go though?

24:28.720 --> 24:33.920
What would you, what would be your go-to perfect media server.com? Yeah. That's an Ubuntu base,

24:33.920 --> 24:41.200
right? Yeah. So I, I, I based that off of Ubuntu 20, a four. I use an answerable role by Geeling

24:41.200 --> 24:46.720
guy, uh, to install Docker. Uh, although you could of course just install Docker, however you like,

24:47.440 --> 24:51.440
uh, install Docker compose and that's it. You done really isn't a lot to it.

24:51.440 --> 24:56.640
I think it's funny that this is coming from a Red Hat employee. If anybody ever needed proof that,

24:56.640 --> 25:02.080
uh, Alex is independent and speaks his mind, uh, there you have it. But I think that's a

25:02.080 --> 25:08.720
fantastic setup too, because the community support is huge. The free five-year patches from Canonical

25:08.720 --> 25:15.120
on an LTS are pretty tough to beat at this point. Um, there's other, there's other games in town,

25:15.120 --> 25:20.960
but yeah. Well, I've avoided commenting on the whole Centos thing quite deliberately because

25:20.960 --> 25:28.000
obviously Red Hat pay my mortgage, but you know, I feel somewhat vindicated in my choice of using

25:28.000 --> 25:33.520
Ubuntu for my personal systems and keeping that separation between work and pleasure, uh, with

25:33.520 --> 25:38.880
all this news. So, uh, it's, it's been an interesting time. I know this is what nobody wants

25:38.880 --> 25:44.400
to hear right now because it's just too damn reasonable and low key, but I will go on record

25:44.400 --> 25:51.440
right now in, in early 2021 and say that I bet you Centos stream makes for an excellent containers

25:51.440 --> 25:57.520
platform. If you wanted to run Docker or Podman, I, uh, uh, Centos could make a great host OS

25:57.520 --> 26:02.880
because I mean, what was the thing that people loved about core OS? It was essentially rolling

26:02.880 --> 26:09.120
updates at an enterprise scale for an enterprise distribution to run your containers. And what's

26:09.120 --> 26:15.280
Centos stream now? It's going to be a consistently updated, rolling enterprise grade distribution

26:15.280 --> 26:22.160
that can run your containers. I think it's worth considering going down that route, especially if

26:22.160 --> 26:28.160
you work with Red Hat systems, but otherwise I just really have to agree with Alex. I think the

26:28.160 --> 26:32.160
Ubuntu ecosystem makes for a fantastic home server because there's such a good community

26:32.160 --> 26:36.880
support system out there. Canonical really has their eye on the ball when it comes to their LTS

26:36.880 --> 26:42.400
releases and cloud support is just fantastic as well. You could, I mean, you could go with Debian

26:42.400 --> 26:47.280
without much penalty. The reason that I go with Ubuntu really is for a couple of reasons. The

26:47.280 --> 26:53.760
first is ZFS support baked right into the kernel that may or may not be important to you. The other

26:53.760 --> 26:58.000
one is WireGuard support baked right in as well. So for both of those things, you only have to

26:58.000 --> 27:03.200
install the user space tool. You don't have to do any DKMS modules or anything crazy like that.

27:03.920 --> 27:09.440
You could do the same thing on Debian and arguably, you know, if you're a freedom respecting

27:10.080 --> 27:16.480
person, like I purport to be, I should be running Debian everywhere, but I don't like DKMS. So I run

27:16.480 --> 27:22.880
Ubuntu everywhere. And having seen a bit behind the curtain for the Ubuntu development process,

27:22.880 --> 27:27.760
I am keenly aware of the kind of attention that Canonical puts into an LTS. It's not that they

27:27.760 --> 27:32.560
don't put a lot of work into their other releases, but they really want to make sure that thing is

27:32.560 --> 27:37.600
enterprise grade and supportable for the time that they're committed to support it. And that means it

27:37.600 --> 27:44.480
just gets a level of polish and pass that maybe Debian 9 doesn't. I just wish they'd stop pushing

27:44.480 --> 27:49.920
snaps. You know, it's such easy fodder for people when they come to me and say, Oh, you can't, you

27:49.920 --> 27:54.800
can't, you shouldn't use Ubuntu because snaps are horrible. And you know, when I want to install

27:54.800 --> 27:58.320
Docker, I don't want to install Docker as a snap. I just want it as a package and stuff. And I'm

27:58.320 --> 28:03.360
like, yeah, well, yeah. I mean, you can go and grab the Docker Deb file from wherever you like

28:03.360 --> 28:09.520
and install it, but the default is a snap. And as I always say, default is king. So yeah, I'm torn

28:09.520 --> 28:16.240
on that. I myself don't prefer it, but I've also heard from audience members who dip their toes in

28:16.240 --> 28:20.640
the next cloud for the first time because it was just a snap away and it was approachable for them.

28:20.640 --> 28:24.480
And, you know, like we got that email from that one guy who set it up on a snap first and then

28:24.480 --> 28:31.600
migrated it to a whole instance afterwards. I just don't like, I suppose, how a snap is

28:31.600 --> 28:37.840
an Ubuntu canonical thing. It's, I don't know, I can't really explain it or articulate it very

28:37.840 --> 28:42.320
well, but I feel like the packaging system should almost be vendor agnostic, which is kind of where

28:42.320 --> 28:45.520
Docker really wins or containers in general really win.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.400
containers do, yeah.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.840
They'll just run on any Linux kernel. It doesn't really matter which.

28:49.840 --> 28:54.400
Yeah, I think there is, there's some things that are always going to be vendor specific.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.760
You know, Debian is always going to have apt and that's unique to them, you know,

28:57.760 --> 29:04.560
Debian and Debian derivatives. But there's some things that people really want to be vendor neutral

29:04.560 --> 29:09.360
in the Linux ecosystem. And it seems software distribution at that level is one of them.

29:09.360 --> 29:13.280
And I also can appreciate that a lot of projects want to host their own repositories. And I think

29:13.280 --> 29:19.040
that's what's really been nice for Flatpaks is you could host your own Flatpak repository. And,

29:19.040 --> 29:22.240
you know, I think our audience understands why people might prefer that. You can't do that with

29:22.240 --> 29:22.800
snaps.

29:22.800 --> 29:27.840
I mean, they have their place, don't they? But then again, when I'm on my desktop, I'll run Arch.

29:28.400 --> 29:34.160
Everything is just in one place. There's no installing repos. It's just all in the AUR.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.520
Yeah.

29:35.520 --> 29:42.080
If we could somehow get the AUR for every Linux distro, then problem solved, right?

29:42.080 --> 29:48.800
It sounds silly, but I agree so much. It's so nice. Just, it's, I manage everything with Yay.

29:48.800 --> 29:53.920
It's Yay for anything. And there's never any math of, is this going to be isolated? Is this a

29:53.920 --> 29:58.720
Flatpak? Is this a snap? Is this an app image? Is this an out of date version? I never have any of

29:58.720 --> 29:59.520
those questions.

29:59.520 --> 30:03.200
And you don't even have to Google it. You just search in Yay first and not

30:03.200 --> 30:07.280
times out of 10, you'll find it. It's so nice on the workstation side. Now here's the thing,

30:07.280 --> 30:10.800
and I'll just wrap it up with this. Here's where I think snaps do play a role because I've seen

30:10.800 --> 30:15.840
this side of it too, is in the business world, it generally works. If you have something that's of

30:15.840 --> 30:19.520
a high value, like a piece of software, like Adobe might have or Blackmagic or whoever,

30:20.320 --> 30:24.880
you want to talk to another company. You want to work with another company and you want to have a

30:24.880 --> 30:29.360
legal relationship. And then you want to have like cross team relationships. So the packaging

30:29.360 --> 30:35.760
people at Plex, for example, interface with the snap people at Canonical, and they actually have

30:36.480 --> 30:41.600
a business to business relationship, Plex and Canonical. And there is a vendor relationship

30:41.600 --> 30:47.040
there where I think just for Plex, they package for everything. But I think a lot of companies

30:47.040 --> 30:53.760
like that kind of traditional relationship. And that's a role where snaps can really kind of be

30:53.760 --> 30:59.760
more appealing to the commercial software industry because they can have an agreement with Canonical,

30:59.760 --> 31:06.400
they can distribute via Canonical store. It works on most distributions and they are the ones that

31:06.400 --> 31:11.920
can publish. I think that's really appealing to that type of business, but it just doesn't seem to

31:11.920 --> 31:18.160
really be appealing to community use cases as much. Despite all that I just said about snaps,

31:18.160 --> 31:23.520
I still use Ubuntu everywhere. So yeah, and you really learn the tricks, you know, you, you know,

31:23.520 --> 31:27.120
you learn the tricks. I don't, I just, I follow the directions on the Docker site for getting

31:27.120 --> 31:31.200
Docker set up really. I don't even use it from the repos. Yeah. Get.docker.com and then pipe

31:31.200 --> 31:35.760
it to pseudo bash, right? You could do that. You definitely could. What could go wrong?

31:35.760 --> 31:39.760
I thought maybe I should summarize like several emails we've gotten over the last couple of weeks

31:39.760 --> 31:44.000
since we talked about power line networking, which just super brief follow up still working awesome.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.200
I haven't even had to reset any of like the adapters or anything. They're still working great.

31:49.760 --> 31:54.080
It's like having ethernet. It's so wonderful. It's just slightly slower. We have had a few people

31:54.080 --> 31:58.800
write in that have told me I'll actually had a whole range of concerns like from the, from my

31:58.800 --> 32:02.880
solar is going to generate too much interference, but of course they're separate systems to turning

32:02.880 --> 32:08.400
my RV into a radio broadcast system. I don't think we've had a topic that has been quite so

32:08.400 --> 32:14.240
feedback generating. Yeah, it's really, and a wide range of successes and failures, but there has been

32:14.240 --> 32:19.120
one consistent theme and that is you got to go to the next level if you really want this to work

32:19.120 --> 32:23.760
great. And that is checkout ethernet over coax. People have been writing that in for a couple of

32:23.760 --> 32:32.160
weeks straight now and the action tech MOCA network adapter for ethernet over coax two pack has been

32:32.160 --> 32:38.480
linked a couple of times and the word from these emails is it's night and day difference. Way

32:38.480 --> 32:43.360
better. If you, if you've got coax pre run in your place, it's a way better route to go than power

32:43.360 --> 32:50.320
over ethernet. Apparently haven't tested it myself. I do have a bit of coax, um, not in the areas where

32:50.320 --> 32:55.920
I would want to have servers, but I do have a bit of coax in the RV. So maybe at some point it could

32:55.920 --> 33:00.960
be useful. I could see maybe using it for like say a Nvidia shield hookup or something like that.

33:00.960 --> 33:05.120
Say a Nvidia shield hookup or something where the TV is already at and that's where coax connection

33:05.120 --> 33:09.520
is. I think that's a perfect use case. Something, I mean, a shield is not going to be using crazy

33:09.520 --> 33:14.160
amounts of bandwidth, but the other thing to consider as well is that coax is a lot cheaper

33:14.160 --> 33:19.440
than ethernet cable and it can be purchased a lot cheaper than weatherproof ethernet as well,

33:19.440 --> 33:24.560
which is also, you know, if you want to run it from the attic, say down to your basement,

33:25.440 --> 33:30.320
probably the easiest route is going to be out the side of the building and doing that with ethernet

33:30.320 --> 33:34.560
could get expensive. So it's a definitely an interesting thing and it's not something I

33:34.560 --> 33:39.600
considered before. So I don't know, maybe next house, I'll give it, I'll give it a whirl.

33:39.600 --> 33:43.360
I'm going to keep it in my back pocket for a future project. And it hasn't, it has a cool

33:43.360 --> 33:50.400
acronym too. MOCA, M O C A, MOCA, Moca Chino. So I kind of like it already. Sounds delicious.

33:50.400 --> 33:54.080
If the reports from the email are true, it's like, if they say it's a gigabit,

33:54.080 --> 33:59.040
it's a true gigabit. It's actually that fast or faster. I mean, people were saying you can get

33:59.040 --> 34:04.480
them in 2.5 gigabit speed varieties as well. That does sound interesting. A special thank you to our

34:04.480 --> 34:09.760
site reliability engineers who support the show. They keep us independent. They get a limited ad

34:09.760 --> 34:14.320
feed available to them as a member and they get a little bit of extra content, a post show. So if

34:14.320 --> 34:19.680
you'd like to support the show and become a member, go to selfhosted.show.sre. Yes. Big

34:19.680 --> 34:25.760
thank you to our site reliability engineers. You can go to selfhosted.show.contact to get in touch

34:25.760 --> 34:31.600
with us. And you can find me on Twitter at ironic badger. I'm there too. I'm at Chris LAS and the

34:31.600 --> 34:37.600
show is at self hosted show. Don't forget at Jupiter signal for the network. Thanks for listening.

34:37.600 --> 34:56.320
That was self hosted dot show slash 36.
