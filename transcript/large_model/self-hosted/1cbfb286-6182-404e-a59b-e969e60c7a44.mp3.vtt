00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
Well, I'm pleased to welcome back to the show. Mr. Chris Fisher. Welcome back, Chris.

00:03.760 --> 00:07.440
Thank you, Alex. I just got done drying everything off only a few moments ago.

00:07.440 --> 00:13.120
We missed you, man. So it's story time. I need to stay a while and listen.

00:13.120 --> 00:18.560
Yes. And first of all, thank you to Morgan for filling in. I, at the last minute,

00:18.560 --> 00:24.480
had to jump out when I realized that my laptop had got soaked and I didn't want to turn it on.

00:24.480 --> 00:29.200
And so I told Alex, you gotta find somebody to fill in for me.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.240
All right. So I was setting up to go camp out in the woods. Brief story.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.920
And I wanted to get out to the woods and get set up in time for the show.

00:35.920 --> 00:41.040
And so I was in a bit of a rush and I thought, because I'm an idiot, I thought, hey, you know,

00:41.040 --> 00:46.880
be a great idea is I'll do some updates on this laptop. And I've got this really old 2013 Mac

00:46.880 --> 00:52.000
book that runs Arch Linux, by the way. And so it's for me, it's like this thrill to boot it

00:52.000 --> 00:57.120
up about once every six months and see if when I do an update, if the installation explodes or not.

00:57.120 --> 01:01.280
Right. So I thought, well, I'm running around packing up the RV. I'll set this thing to do

01:01.280 --> 01:05.840
some updates just so I can, you know, have like a little thing to do for my ADD brain

01:06.640 --> 01:11.440
and check in on it. And so I'm packing up and I go around and I collect all of my electronics because

01:11.440 --> 01:15.760
I, my kids and I had been going through some stuff. And so we had the fire tablets were down

01:15.760 --> 01:20.720
off the wall that we use to control home assistant, our front end and some game controllers were out

01:20.720 --> 01:25.120
and we're going down the road and we want to get there quick. So I just took this basket and like

01:25.120 --> 01:28.960
a good little boy, I picked up everything and put it in my basket. And of course, I don't want that

01:28.960 --> 01:35.040
basket to spill. So I, I set it in the back in the bathroom and finished up my laptop and closed the

01:35.040 --> 01:42.080
lid and went about packing up the rest of the RV. I'm driving down the road for probably 20, 25

01:42.080 --> 01:46.800
minutes. And I realized I should probably get gas because I'm going to be off grid for a while. And

01:46.800 --> 01:50.400
if for some reason we don't get good solar, I'm going to need to be able to run my generator.

01:50.400 --> 01:56.160
So I, I, I pull up to a gas station and I start to pull in, which is a downhill kind of turn in.

01:56.160 --> 02:00.880
And as I pull into the gas station and begin to decline down into the parking lot, I hear like,

02:01.360 --> 02:06.720
like a wave sound behind me. Like, I'm like, is there a noisemaker on? And I, I turn around and

02:06.720 --> 02:12.000
look over my shoulder, Alex, and I see this wave of water coming down the middle of the hallway of

02:12.000 --> 02:17.600
my RV. It sloshes down into the, into the, into the step. Well, it's all over the place. It's

02:17.600 --> 02:22.240
coming down into my feet while I'm driving. It was everywhere. How tight did your asshole

02:22.240 --> 02:29.200
pocket when you saw that Alex in like one motion, I like grabbed the radio and I radioed to my wife

02:29.200 --> 02:33.360
because she's chasing me in the car behind there. You got to get in here quick. We got an emergency.

02:33.360 --> 02:40.400
I throw the radio down. I parked the RV stand up and I began just walking straight to the back. And

02:40.400 --> 02:52.080
as I approach the back of the RV, I hear a sound I immediately recognize it's my water pump and it's

02:52.080 --> 02:57.840
pumping and it's pumping and it's pumping. It shouldn't be on, but in our rush to leave, I had

02:57.840 --> 03:04.000
left it on and didn't notice. And so I flip it off as I opened the door and I look right at the sink

03:04.000 --> 03:09.840
where I just instinctively knew the problem was going to be somehow I knew, and I could immediately

03:09.840 --> 03:15.520
see the entire chain of events. I had left that big old heavy Mac book on the counter. And when I

03:15.520 --> 03:24.160
went down the road, it slid down the counter, slid just right and fell into the sink. And as it fell,

03:24.160 --> 03:30.720
it turned the faucet on, which is where my basket full of electronics was sitting. Oh, that be

03:30.720 --> 03:37.120
turned that that Alex, it turned into a bathtub. Alex, it was, it was so bad. Alex, it soaked

03:37.120 --> 03:42.560
everything and then proceeded to spill out from there into the rest of the RV in about about 17,

03:42.560 --> 03:48.880
17, 15, 20 gallons ish. It's hard to say. Yeah. Got the laptop, got all the fire tablets, got the

03:48.880 --> 03:56.960
game controllers, got all the charging bricks, everything, not to mention flooded the RV. I had

03:56.960 --> 04:02.240
to act quick. And so thankfully I was able to position the RV in such a way that it kind of

04:02.240 --> 04:07.440
tilted it. So I could just get all the water to pour out into one direction. And then I just spent

04:08.240 --> 04:12.400
like two hours drying it up. And then we moved out to our spot in the woods and spend another

04:12.400 --> 04:18.400
couple of hours trying to dry it all out. I lost a lot of devices. A lot of good devices died that

04:18.400 --> 04:26.400
day, Alex, but not that stupid old Mac book. It's still kicking even though it got water in the event

04:26.400 --> 04:32.000
in the vents and all of that, it's still kicking. So the device that caused the problem just ran

04:32.000 --> 04:37.440
away going tee, not today. It's doing great. Yep. Although its power adapter bit the dust. So I

04:37.440 --> 04:41.280
don't know exactly what its long-term plan was. That's like cutting your nose off to spite your

04:41.280 --> 04:46.480
face, isn't it? That's why you should plan and plan to learn. Visit our sponsor, Cloud Guru,

04:55.840 --> 05:01.440
You know, that story just hurts me so deeply because water and electronics, you just have

05:01.440 --> 05:08.800
this pathological thing that they don't go, they just don't mix. I've probably missed out on several

05:08.800 --> 05:13.200
experiences in my life because I had a phone in my pocket. I'm like, well, I'm not going to go and

05:14.080 --> 05:17.120
run in the ocean or whatever it is because I've got a phone in my pocket.

05:17.760 --> 05:22.400
And so many devices, obvious statement time, but I really was feeling this,

05:22.400 --> 05:26.800
so many devices have the battery built in. And so there's just nothing I can do.

05:26.800 --> 05:33.360
Yeah. Damn, man. I feel your pain. I really do. Yeah. It was rough. It was rough. And so now I

05:33.360 --> 05:36.800
have to selectively choose what I'm going to replace and what I'm just going to try to live

05:36.800 --> 05:42.720
without. Oh yeah. And you just missed Prime Day. I know! That crossed my mind because I had a couple

05:42.720 --> 05:49.920
of fire tablets in the mix. Gone. Womp womp. All right. So you got something to cheer me up?

05:49.920 --> 05:54.320
Well, I was watching YouTube the other day, as is often the case in my household, and I was

05:54.320 --> 06:00.480
watching a video by Techno Tim and he did an Orthalia introduction. This is a single sign-on

06:01.680 --> 06:08.080
service that basically allows you to have one login cookie get set, which then allows you to

06:08.080 --> 06:13.840
log into all of the services that you select through a set of rules that you configure to say,

06:13.840 --> 06:20.080
right, if I want to access Nextcloud, as long as I've got this token set, then I'm all good. And

06:20.080 --> 06:25.040
then you could do it for a wiki or any of the services that are running on your system.

06:26.080 --> 06:32.000
And the really nice thing is it's configured with a single line of Docker Compose configurations.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.160
So you just add a single line to declare that you want to use Orthalia as what's

06:36.160 --> 06:42.000
called a piece of middleware in the traffic configuration. And you're good to go. And that's

06:42.000 --> 06:48.160
it. I see. So it is, first of all, we should mention it's open source. And it essentially

06:48.160 --> 06:52.880
takes authentication requests using NGINX and provides the authorization for those

06:52.880 --> 06:58.080
authentication requests. Yeah, not just NGINX, it supports traffic as well as a bunch of others.

06:58.640 --> 07:05.440
And it actually more recently supports Kubernetes Ingress controllers, which is nice as well.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.480
All right, I'm checking it out right now. And it actually looks like it has a pretty good interface

07:08.480 --> 07:15.840
too. So this will have linked in the show notes or you can go to AUTHELIA.com. Yeah, you don't

07:15.840 --> 07:20.480
really need a whole bunch of interface for a login client. Essentially what happens when you

07:20.480 --> 07:26.480
have a service that's backed by this, let's say I go to wiki, my personal wiki, my tiddly wiki,

07:26.480 --> 07:31.040
traffic will detect that I've set that piece of middleware as part of the chain of traffic that

07:31.040 --> 07:35.920
it wants to go through. And so AUTHELIA will then pop up a standard web form. I'll type in

07:35.920 --> 07:41.280
my username and password. It does support two-factor authentication. So even for services

07:41.280 --> 07:49.200
that don't have 2FA natively, I can use AUTHELIA to add 2FA to those services as well. And then

07:49.200 --> 07:54.160
just transparently that token lasts for the length and duration of your session. You can

07:54.160 --> 07:58.960
figure how long it is. I think it's five minutes by default. Any other service that has the same

07:58.960 --> 08:03.840
rule on your system, it will reuse that authentication token. So if you're switching

08:03.840 --> 08:08.800
between a bunch of different services on your system, log in once and you're logged into all

08:08.800 --> 08:14.000
of them all at once automatically. Boy, that does seem nice. It has a lot of great features in here.

08:14.560 --> 08:19.040
All right. Well, it sounds like something to check out. We talk about this kind of stuff also

08:19.600 --> 08:23.920
when we talk about things like hosting your own password manager or hosting your own email.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.520
I wonder if there's an audience and I wonder if you out there too, I wonder if there's a portion

08:27.520 --> 08:34.400
of the audience that thinks I'd never want to host this. This crosses a line. This breaks and

08:34.400 --> 08:40.640
things get hosed. And so I wonder if there isn't a discussion to be had there, Alex, about where that

08:40.640 --> 08:44.640
line is for us and if we ever consider dropping something and saying, you know what, I'll just

08:44.640 --> 08:49.840
go with a commercial service for this. Is this grumpy old man Alex coming out here? But my

08:49.840 --> 08:58.880
tolerance for stuff breaking, be it an update, be it a dodgy power cable, whatever the reason,

08:58.880 --> 09:04.880
my tolerance is so low these days. And a couple of episodes ago I mentioned I had my server on

09:04.880 --> 09:10.240
the desk next to me because I was troubleshooting some issues with hard drives failing. Turns out

09:10.240 --> 09:15.120
it wasn't the hard drives failing and I wasted maybe three weeks on trying all sorts of different

09:15.680 --> 09:21.200
drives and cables and disk controllers. No, it was the power cable from the power supply to the

09:21.200 --> 09:27.280
drives. No kidding. I wasted three weeks on that damn thing. And that just left me with a huge

09:27.280 --> 09:32.960
bitter taste in my mouth. And I'm not going to stop self-hosting. Don't worry audience, we're okay.

09:34.240 --> 09:39.760
But there were just moments in that three week period I was like, screw this. I just want to

09:39.760 --> 09:45.840
throw the towel in and just be done and just pay Netflix or whoever it is. Wow. In that same period

09:45.840 --> 09:49.680
of time, I think you also had a certain home assistant update not go so well too. So you

09:49.680 --> 09:54.560
were really getting it from both ends. Yeah, that's the thing. And this week, another example is

09:54.560 --> 09:59.920
that Nextcloud just stopped working for some reason. I have no idea why. I've been sat on

09:59.920 --> 10:07.200
Nextcloud 19 for the last year plus. I haven't touched it. I pull in the regular updates that

10:07.200 --> 10:15.200
they provide to the 19 branch through Docker Hub tagging, but I don't update major versions on

10:15.200 --> 10:20.480
Nextcloud unless I have a good reason to because I don't want all of the new stuff. I just use it

10:20.480 --> 10:24.720
for documents. That's pretty much it. Right. I actually figured this out because I got a notification

10:24.720 --> 10:29.200
on my phone because photo upload had stopped working. It said this server is in maintenance

10:29.200 --> 10:35.680
mode. And I'm like, okay, yeah, I remember. I've had this before. So you Google it. First result

10:35.680 --> 10:41.360
says go into the config file and edit a single line that says change maintenance mode from true

10:41.360 --> 10:48.720
to false in the config.php file. So I did that. It was already set to maintenance mode false.

10:48.720 --> 10:54.400
So I'm like, okay, well, clearly something's going on here. So I then start looking into

10:54.400 --> 11:02.560
the Nextcloud container logs. And then it said something about character encoding, UTF-8 charsets.

11:02.560 --> 11:08.000
And I just, at that point I was like, oh no, here we go. This is going to be a long evening.

11:09.040 --> 11:15.840
Long story short, I ended up having to go into the MySQL container itself with a Docker exec command.

11:15.840 --> 11:22.960
Get into the MySQL nitty-gritty details, delete and change a couple of data types from

11:23.520 --> 11:29.040
varchar to text fields and all this, you know, stuff that's way over the head of most people

11:29.600 --> 11:35.840
doing self-hosting, unless this is your day job. And I just thought to myself, who is this stuff

11:35.840 --> 11:41.440
targeted at? If I was paying for Nextcloud as a hosted service, I mean, these things exist,

11:41.440 --> 11:49.040
like Google drive is similar, OneDrive, you know, all these different cloud file repositories.

11:49.040 --> 11:53.040
If these things broke and I had to jump through all these different hoops to fix them,

11:53.840 --> 12:00.800
I would just migrate to a different service. And yet, because I feel a certain sense of obligation,

12:01.440 --> 12:06.160
partly because of this show, but also partly because of my beliefs towards self-hosting in

12:06.160 --> 12:12.720
general, I power through it. But sometimes I just want to throw the towel in, you know?

12:12.720 --> 12:16.640
Did you ever get to the root of why that Nextcloud issue just cropped up?

12:16.640 --> 12:21.520
I think it was because of the character encoding. So what I ended up doing as part of the

12:21.520 --> 12:24.880
troubleshooting process was like, right, okay, well, I'm in the weeds here. I may as well go to

12:24.880 --> 12:28.720
Nextcloud 22 whilst I'm here. Yeah, that would be my line of thinking too.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.920
Yeah. And then I thought it didn't start because I thought, oh, it's some database

12:33.920 --> 12:39.120
schema changes have probably happened and it's just not tested properly on 19. Okay, fine.

12:39.120 --> 12:45.600
I'll go to the next major release that's stable. Yeah. And so like I said to you, I had to drop to

12:45.600 --> 12:52.640
the MySQL command line, delete a couple of tables that were failing the repair because there's an OCC

12:53.440 --> 12:59.440
command. So you can log into the Nextcloud container and run, there's like a shell,

12:59.440 --> 13:05.520
like a CLI tool built into it called OCC. Own Cloud Client, I would imagine is what it stands for.

13:05.520 --> 13:10.800
Don't quote me on that. And you can do a bunch of maintenance stuff. You can turn maintenance mode

13:10.800 --> 13:14.960
on and off. You can repair things, et cetera, et cetera. And it kept failing on this line item

13:14.960 --> 13:19.440
to do with news articles, which is a plugin I don't even use anymore. I think I enabled it

13:19.440 --> 13:24.800
for testing and then forgot about it. And much like my Home Assistant update, I probably missed

13:24.800 --> 13:30.000
it in the logs because I don't necessarily look at the logs every day because I've got other stuff

13:30.000 --> 13:37.040
to do. And yeah, once I deleted the news, once I'd gone into the correct database table and then

13:37.040 --> 13:42.800
deleted the three or four lines that were causing the schema migrations to fail, then the upgrade

13:42.800 --> 13:48.240
proceeded and it was all fine, but it took me a couple of hours. I've had those moments where I

13:48.240 --> 13:55.120
thought maybe a server was dead and gone. And I thought, I don't know if I ever want to rebuild

13:55.120 --> 14:00.160
this. And then thankfully, they came back and then I thought, okay, I better get my backup game.

14:01.680 --> 14:06.480
I better get my backup figured out. Yeah, because you really got it. You got a hardware failure in

14:06.480 --> 14:12.400
your server. You got a software failure in Nextcloud, a pretty dramatic Home Assistant

14:12.400 --> 14:18.560
failure based on some deprecation and changes. I mean, you got it one after another. I recently

14:18.560 --> 14:25.120
also had a Home Assistant update go south when the OS update didn't complete correctly, the system

14:25.120 --> 14:29.920
locked up and then rebooted and then it couldn't get an IP until I had fiddled with it for quite

14:29.920 --> 14:34.960
a while. And for a brief moment, I thought to myself, should I just bail on this and maybe just

14:34.960 --> 14:39.200
go back to a traditional server and Home Assistant core container and just keep it simple.

14:39.200 --> 14:43.280
And then it gets working again. And then I think, okay, no, this is better. And I like this.

14:43.280 --> 14:48.160
And I think to myself in the grand scheme of things, this is the cost of having full control

14:48.160 --> 14:54.800
over these services. And it does give me a better appreciation of the value that the cloud providers

14:54.800 --> 15:01.200
are offering. And it makes me also understand how valuable my data must be if they can pay for these

15:01.200 --> 15:06.080
services based on mining my information. Like, wow, there must be some real value there because

15:06.080 --> 15:13.600
it's not cheap. And to keep something reliable like file services for a 10-year streak actually

15:13.600 --> 15:18.320
takes an incredible amount of effort. Yeah, you're not wrong. I mean, these guys, they were entire

15:18.320 --> 15:25.120
jobs, site reliability engineers. That's the name of our supporters club that we have. And

15:25.840 --> 15:32.160
there's an entire job dedicated to keeping things up and stable and reliable. And these guys,

15:32.160 --> 15:36.880
they write software, they write scripts, they do all sorts of Ninja magic to keep these services

15:36.880 --> 15:41.760
online. I think part of it, Alex, is giving yourself, and you've done this, the ability

15:41.760 --> 15:48.800
to rebuild fairly quickly. You do that. If you adopt something, you make sure that you can redeploy

15:48.800 --> 15:55.520
it as necessary and those kinds of things, I think they help a lot. But I think this show

15:55.520 --> 16:00.560
should ask the question more often, is there a cloud service that could do that? And I think

16:00.560 --> 16:05.760
is there a cloud service that could do this? And if there is, why are we not choosing to use it?

16:06.320 --> 16:10.480
Because it is a big trade-off every time. And the more critical the service is to you,

16:10.480 --> 16:14.400
I think the more serious you have to consider that. Trying to think of a good example, I suppose

16:14.400 --> 16:20.560
Wiki would be a decent one because you can probably throw some stuff up on GitHub in a

16:20.560 --> 16:27.600
random repository with a bunch of text files and call that a Wiki if you want to. You could also

16:27.600 --> 16:34.720
go to some random website and buy probably Wiki capabilities, but there's nothing quite like

16:34.720 --> 16:40.400
hosting your own and keeping that kind of information in-house because the role of Wiki

16:40.400 --> 16:48.880
in particular fulfills often is to store proprietary custom information, maybe Wi-Fi

16:48.880 --> 16:54.160
passwords for your house or something, or the code to the safe so that your wife can open it

16:54.160 --> 17:00.960
when you're out or something. I don't know what people store in their Wikis, but there could be

17:00.960 --> 17:02.720
some sensitive information in there.

17:02.720 --> 17:06.160
It sounds like you have a code for a safe that if I was ever on your land,

17:06.160 --> 17:07.600
I should try to get that code.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.360
I've got to buy the safe first.

17:09.360 --> 17:14.400
I was like, he has a safe? Oh, okay. But it's a good example. You're right. I have been thinking,

17:14.400 --> 17:22.000
how could I leave my wife notes in a way that is fully secure? And there is this feeling that

17:22.000 --> 17:27.040
I think is actually pretty special and it's this total feel of control. And I feel this when I am

17:27.040 --> 17:33.520
off-grid and I'm generating my own power and I've brought my own food and I don't need anyone to

17:33.520 --> 17:40.720
do anything. For a brief moment, I feel like I'm truly in control. And I have that same sense when

17:40.720 --> 17:49.520
it comes to everything being offline in my RV and being self-contained to the RV and having gone

17:49.520 --> 17:53.280
through this project off-grid where I offloaded a bunch of services and got everything running

17:53.280 --> 18:02.160
locally. When I get access to that stuff, it's this feeling of confidence that we get so sparingly

18:02.160 --> 18:06.640
now with so many cloud services that are integrated with our mobile devices or integrated

18:06.640 --> 18:13.680
with commercial desktops, less and less consumers and technology users have control, less and less.

18:13.680 --> 18:18.240
They have less control than ever of modifying their devices, of controlling their devices,

18:18.240 --> 18:23.120
or even determining who has access to their data or if it can be scanned or any of that.

18:23.120 --> 18:28.640
And so when we have these areas, we can actually exercise that control. We have to keep doing it

18:29.360 --> 18:34.880
or else it will go away. If there's no users of these self-hosted services and if there's no

18:35.440 --> 18:43.440
market demand for this control, eventually the developers and the companies that serve that niche

18:43.440 --> 18:48.640
will dry up. And so it's like you have to always be looking like where can I exercise that control

18:48.640 --> 18:51.920
and where does it matter the most? And that's kind of where I've come down on it. It's like,

18:51.920 --> 18:58.240
okay, this information, like secret stuff I want to give my wife, that is always going to be on my

18:58.240 --> 19:03.280
land. I'm just never going to put it anywhere else. And thankfully, I've come up with a little system

19:03.280 --> 19:08.000
where it's just some markdown files. It's really simple. It's not a big effort to actually do it.

19:08.000 --> 19:14.640
You are right. There are an increasing number of companies doing stuff for this marketplace.

19:14.640 --> 19:20.480
Tuya, we talked about it last episode with Morgan, have announced a native home assistant

19:20.480 --> 19:25.120
integration as part of their product line. So these things are happening and you see,

19:26.160 --> 19:30.720
what's his name? Linus Sebastian has just bought a new house and he's talking about how he's going

19:30.720 --> 19:35.840
to implement smart dampers in every room so he's not air conditioning every room and how there is

19:35.840 --> 19:40.720
lots of proprietary services that could do this stuff and how it's just all so overwhelming. And

19:41.440 --> 19:45.440
I think that's largely what I'm feeling too. It's just a bit overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I

19:45.440 --> 19:51.920
could do. It's not even necessarily just when stuff breaks. It's that feeling of once I put my

19:51.920 --> 19:55.680
daughter to bed or something in the evening of, okay, I've got a couple of hours before I go to

19:55.680 --> 20:01.440
sleep now. I don't want to just sit and veg and watch cartoons necessarily. I'll do that

20:01.440 --> 20:06.080
whilst I'm doing something else. But what out of my huge long list of ideas that I've got,

20:06.080 --> 20:09.440
should I pick? And, oh, I can't be bothered. I'll just watch cartoons.

20:09.440 --> 20:16.880
You know what I've been doing is like the really simple stuff. I went through my home assistant

20:16.880 --> 20:22.960
dashboard and I made individual, I chose like individual icons for each entity. So each light

20:22.960 --> 20:29.200
bulb has like a unique light bulb icon, really just slow kind of paced work while I was watching

20:29.200 --> 20:36.240
Rick and Morty. So it's like not very high cognitive load, but I can sit there and fiddle

20:36.240 --> 20:40.800
with something. And then the other thing that I did recently, it was one of those moments where

20:40.800 --> 20:44.960
I was like, I don't need to build something complicated here. I could just get a couple

20:44.960 --> 20:50.400
of window fans off of Amazon that have manual controls, plug them into some smart plugs,

20:50.400 --> 20:55.760
and I could have some set to input and I could have some set to output. And then I could just

20:55.760 --> 20:59.360
set up automations to turn the smart plugs on and off. And it was one of those moments where

20:59.360 --> 21:05.280
I was like, I could just do something very simple for cooling. And it would probably take me 35

21:05.280 --> 21:10.000
minutes to set it all up. And I was so down in the weeds with all of these things. Like I could

21:10.000 --> 21:14.800
build a new virtualization backend, and then I could set up individual host OSs and then put

21:14.800 --> 21:18.480
containers in there. Like I was going through this entire thing about how I wanted to rebuild

21:18.480 --> 21:21.840
all of the infrastructure. And then I thought, you know what else I could do is I could just

21:21.840 --> 21:26.400
spend 30 minutes doing this tonight. And I'll spend 30 minutes doing that tomorrow. And over

21:26.400 --> 21:33.440
a couple of nights, I got it all done. If it works, it ain't stupid. linode.com slash SSH.

21:33.440 --> 21:39.520
Go there to support the show and get $100 in credit on a new account. Linode is our cloud

21:39.520 --> 21:42.640
hosting provider. When we're building something that we want to experiment with, we do it on

21:42.640 --> 21:46.640
Linode. There's a lot of quick ways to deploy. They have 11 data centers to choose from. They

21:46.640 --> 21:51.040
have crazy fast network connections and a whole range of types of servers. So you can

21:51.040 --> 21:57.040
get like a $5 a month system. But sometimes we want some dedicated CPUs or GPUs. They have a

21:57.040 --> 22:02.880
lot of choices. Roger wrote into the show to say that he used Linode to replace Zoom with

22:02.880 --> 22:07.520
something he can host himself. He says, along with just about everybody else, the Milwaukee

22:07.520 --> 22:13.280
Linux users group had to go to virtual due to COVID-19. And as you might expect from a group

22:13.280 --> 22:18.800
of Linux users, they weren't a big fan of using Zoom. They wanted to use Jitsi. So they looked

22:18.800 --> 22:24.880
around at different providers and they chose Linode. They picked the $5 a month machine,

22:24.880 --> 22:29.040
and they also chose to do the automatic backup service. So that way there's just backups that

22:29.040 --> 22:34.480
are just taken care of. They installed Jitsi Meet on that system, and they're now using it

22:34.480 --> 22:39.440
with Nextcloud Talk to do the video calls for their lug, all running on Linode.

22:40.160 --> 22:45.680
You know, what's really nice about this too is Roger was able to prototype Jitsi and Nextcloud

22:45.680 --> 22:51.520
and try them all out really quickly in environments that are production-style environments. You can

22:51.520 --> 22:56.960
really get a sense for how it's going to perform. And it's pretty great because at one point,

22:56.960 --> 23:03.840
they made a change to Nextcloud just before the lug meeting and it broke. So Roger says they were

23:03.840 --> 23:08.000
able to use the snapshots that they got with the automatic backups and just roll it back.

23:09.200 --> 23:13.520
So it was basically a non-issue. And then after the lug was over, they were able to

23:13.520 --> 23:18.400
continue on with the Nextcloud update. And that's just an example of how you can use Linode, you

23:18.400 --> 23:23.280
know, to run your own Zoom instance. Or they also have a one-click deployment for owncast,

23:23.280 --> 23:28.640
which is essentially a Twitch in a box. You can use it for that as well. There's so many different

23:28.640 --> 23:33.680
choices from hosting your website to their object storage. Like I use it for like a sync thing

23:33.680 --> 23:39.600
instance. Just go try it out, learn something, and experiment with that $100 and support the show

23:39.600 --> 23:48.640
at linode.com slash SSH. Now, in case you haven't heard, we're getting together in Denver. I'm

23:48.640 --> 23:53.680
looking forward to this. And not only is Alex going to be there, but he's going to be our trivia

23:53.680 --> 23:58.320
master at the meetup. So you got to come just to say hi to Alex. Looking forward to that. I've

23:58.320 --> 24:03.120
been working hard on the trivia questions. I promise you there'll be a bunch of Linux questions.

24:03.120 --> 24:07.120
There'll be some, you know, general knowledge stuff, but there's also going to be some like

24:07.120 --> 24:12.480
older, more esoteric hardware questions as well. I've been having a real fun digging out some of

24:12.480 --> 24:17.600
these questions. I'm looking forward to that. So we'll have the meetup details. We have two

24:17.600 --> 24:22.000
meetups actually planned. Alex is going to be at the Denver meetup, but there's also a Salt Lake

24:22.000 --> 24:28.000
City meetup on the books. Details are over at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting. And then

24:28.000 --> 24:34.640
additionally in LadyJupes, my RV, I will have a live tracker and there will be more details

24:34.640 --> 24:38.400
and if it works out, we'll do a little micro meetup. Could just be, you know, just come by

24:38.400 --> 24:43.680
and say hi and we'll have this embedded web page that you'll be able to view over at ColonyTracker.live

24:43.680 --> 24:49.760
that'll show you right where we are at. It's all in the works right now. Just in this last week,

24:49.760 --> 24:54.320
we got the backend set up for own tracks to record where I'm actually going to be at. And

24:54.320 --> 24:58.080
that's a pretty neat deal, Alex. How are you doing that? Is that up on Linode or something?

24:58.080 --> 25:01.520
Oh yeah, of course. Of course. Naturally.

25:01.520 --> 25:08.880
Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, we just decided to do a dedicated lower end Linode,

25:08.880 --> 25:12.880
because what we want to do is put a little website on there that has the details and stuff. And then

25:12.880 --> 25:17.680
own tracks itself is kind of like in multiple components. And so the recorder is a Docker image

25:17.680 --> 25:23.600
that you can deploy. And that's like a lightweight backend that stores the location data. And you can

25:23.600 --> 25:29.440
publish your location information to it in two different ways, either over HTTP, or you can

25:29.440 --> 25:33.760
publish your location information to it in two different ways, either over HTTP, or over MQTT.

25:33.760 --> 25:38.880
And then the recorder, as the name implies, records the information and then makes your

25:38.880 --> 25:45.680
location data available, which is all completely under your control via a various set of APIs,

25:46.560 --> 25:50.960
some of which can integrate directly into Home Assistant. So you can actually use own tracks

25:50.960 --> 25:55.360
to provide Home Assistant with your real time location, which is a fantastic way to control

25:55.360 --> 26:01.440
automations. And one way that we use this, not with own tracks today, but soon, is when no one

26:01.440 --> 26:08.400
is at home. If some of the lights, which always happens, get left on, which never fails to get

26:08.400 --> 26:13.200
left on, then if no one's home and a certain amount of time has passed, the lights just

26:13.200 --> 26:18.080
automatically turn off. And that's just a simple way to use the automations. Or in the winter,

26:18.080 --> 26:24.000
if we're approaching and it's cold, the heating turns on. Really simple stuff, stuff that we just

26:24.000 --> 26:30.240
don't want to even have to think about. But the key is getting your location into Home Assistant,

26:30.240 --> 26:36.880
and own tracks can essentially be that source of information. I'm using it for a live embedded map

26:36.880 --> 26:40.960
on a web page, so that way you guys can find me and we can meet up. And I'll be running the own

26:40.960 --> 26:46.560
tracks client, which publishes that information to the recorder on my pixel. That's so cool that it

26:46.560 --> 26:52.000
uses MQTT to do that. Yeah, isn't it? It's clever. It seems like actually a great use of it because

26:52.000 --> 26:56.960
you could see how, when you have maybe a loss of connectivity, it could queue up. And then when you

26:56.960 --> 27:02.400
connect, it can just transmit the bits that were queued while you had no signal. It's really smart.

27:02.400 --> 27:08.160
Perfect. It's exactly what it was designed for. Now, my favorite robot vacuum firmware,

27:08.160 --> 27:12.960
Valitudo, had a big release last month, and I finally got around to updating it and installing

27:12.960 --> 27:17.360
it this week. I'm a glutton for punishment, aren't I? There's lots of stuff breaking and

27:17.360 --> 27:24.560
I still go ahead and install these updates. And guess what? What? Did it break? Well,

27:25.200 --> 27:31.120
I mean, no, the updates went fine, but there'd been some changes to how the vacuums get

27:31.840 --> 27:37.120
communicated with from Home Assistant. They've deprecated the vacuum.send command, which was

27:37.120 --> 27:43.600
what I used to say, hey robot, go, you know, hoover the bedroom or something. And they've

27:43.600 --> 27:51.040
deprecated it for an MQTT publish command. So we're both using MQTT here in wildly different

27:51.040 --> 27:55.840
use cases, but I just think that's so cool how it's the same technology. It is pretty neat. And

27:56.480 --> 28:02.800
just as a side note, I hate it when stuff like that gets deprecated. I think the whole Z-Wave

28:02.800 --> 28:08.480
stack that I'm using in Home Assistant has been deprecated, and I just don't want to reset up my

28:08.480 --> 28:12.000
Z-Wave network. And I don't know what that migration process is like, and I just don't

28:12.000 --> 28:18.320
want to deal with it. And that kind of goes back to your topic earlier. It's working. I don't want

28:18.320 --> 28:23.280
to break it. I don't want to have to do anything with it because it's just so part of my infrastructure

28:23.280 --> 28:28.800
now. It no longer feels like a separate system. It feels like it is part of my home, and I don't like

28:28.800 --> 28:34.240
messing with that stuff anymore. And equally, because it is part of the house, the uptime

28:34.240 --> 28:40.880
needs to be as close to 100% as possible. And then you have to balance that off against applying

28:40.880 --> 28:45.120
updates because it's part of your house. You don't want to not update it for 10 years.

28:45.120 --> 28:49.200
I mean, some people would just say, if it's working, leave it. But I keep it up to date

28:49.200 --> 28:54.400
because I feel like I want to be compatible with future technology and future functionality.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.000
I mentioned to you earlier, I was like, maybe I should rebuild the whole setup and I should base

28:58.000 --> 29:03.680
it on virtualization because the safety that a virtual machine gives me, that snapshot capability

29:03.680 --> 29:10.640
and that holistic restoring of a system or taking a copy of it and setting it on a shelf and saying,

29:10.640 --> 29:16.560
this is known good. That is so appealing to me. And it feels like it gives me a safety net to what

29:17.280 --> 29:21.200
seems like a risky proposition to keep updating all of these systems all the time.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.360
That's where I keep thinking, maybe I got to rethink the way I'm doing stuff. And that's

29:25.360 --> 29:29.280
where I go down the rabbit hole and go, oh, it's too much. Not right now.

29:29.280 --> 29:32.560
Mason Do you use a hypervisor at all for anything?

29:32.560 --> 29:35.120
Ben No. Right now, the system's built around

29:35.120 --> 29:39.840
these Raspberry Pis. There's not a lot of overhead there. So I'm just running containers on Ubuntu

29:39.840 --> 29:45.920
LTS on Pi 4. But I would be willing to replace, you know, the two or three Raspberry Pis it takes

29:45.920 --> 29:53.680
to do this with one fairly low energy x86 machine. And then I'd have sort of my, you know, my choice

29:53.680 --> 29:55.120
of virtualizers at that point. Mason

29:55.120 --> 29:57.840
Well, good news for you. Proxmox have just had a big release.

29:58.400 --> 30:05.840
Version 7 was released on the 6th of July 2021. And it's based on Debian Bullseye number 11.

30:05.840 --> 30:10.720
I'm sure most of you know this bit of trivia, but those of you coming to the Denver meetup

30:10.720 --> 30:14.160
might want to pay attention. I might have given a question away there. Damn it.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.760
Ben I love it. No, that's good. That's good.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.800
Because if they're a listener, they get a heads up and no one else will know.

30:20.800 --> 30:23.120
Mason Free trivia question coming your way.

30:23.120 --> 30:28.960
Which kids movie does Debian name its releases after? Maybe you'll know. Maybe you won't.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.560
It's just the sort of thing you have to come to the meetup and find out about.

30:32.560 --> 30:33.200
Ben All right.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.960
Mason Now what else is included in this release? They've got a bunch of new

30:36.960 --> 30:43.360
versions of stuff. So ZFS is now 2.04. QEMU has been bumped to version 6.

30:43.920 --> 30:50.880
And there's a new kernel 5.11. So it's really good to see that Proxmox are pushing the envelope

30:50.880 --> 30:55.440
here and updating lots of their core systems. The reason I say that in particular is because

30:55.440 --> 31:00.880
Debian has a bit of a reputation for being a bit old and crusty. And you look at the versions of

31:00.880 --> 31:05.440
some of these packages and they're not that far off what is shipping in Arch.

31:05.440 --> 31:09.760
Ben Right. I mean, a 5.11 kernel is older than what's in Arch, but it's newer than what's in

31:09.760 --> 31:15.520
most LTS distros right now. And they've rolled out more recent ButterFS support, which I think

31:15.520 --> 31:21.120
is kind of a big deal. It's nice to see essentially ButterFS and ZFS get near parity support in

31:21.120 --> 31:21.680
Proxmox.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.680
Mason It absolutely is. And I think this comes

31:23.680 --> 31:29.280
back to a point that I hear quite frequently on Linux Unplugged actually is that we need to start

31:29.280 --> 31:36.160
taking ButterFS seriously and stop just treating it as a bit of a joke because Facebook and all

31:36.160 --> 31:42.560
these other massive companies that have things at significant scale are putting a lot of blood,

31:42.560 --> 31:48.240
sweat and tears into the ButterFS subsystems. And it does seem to be cropping up in more and more

31:48.240 --> 31:56.640
places. And for me, I'm actually starting to use Proxmox as my default distro for server OSs,

31:56.640 --> 32:04.240
because it has ZFS baked in. So I don't need to futz about with DKMS or an AUR package to

32:04.880 --> 32:10.320
install a custom kernel. I don't have to worry about the licensing. It's just taken care of.

32:10.320 --> 32:15.920
I mean, the same is true of Ubuntu. But the thing that Proxmox gives me most out of all of this

32:15.920 --> 32:22.480
other stuff is a really slick web UI to manage virtual machines and LXC containers.

32:22.480 --> 32:25.920
Ben Great point. And I think that is something

32:25.920 --> 32:32.400
that you and I probably underplay. I think for a lot of new users, that's like the biggest deal.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.960
Ben Right. Yeah, absolutely.

32:34.960 --> 32:38.720
Ben Yeah, I completely agree on your points about ButterFS too. I think

32:38.720 --> 32:43.760
the thing that you have to remember is what ButterFS offers is a file system that does

32:43.760 --> 32:50.080
copy on write, transparent compression. It can offer encryption, it can offer SSD trim support,

32:50.080 --> 32:55.840
and it's extremely low memory. So it works really good, say like in a Raspberry Pi situation,

32:55.840 --> 33:01.360
or in a laptop with a single SSD. Those are some use cases where ZFS is really not a great

33:01.360 --> 33:09.360
choice there. And I really love the combination of the two. I think it makes for a really reliable

33:09.360 --> 33:16.240
home server. And the way I use it now is ButterFS is on the root file system. So the system can boot

33:16.240 --> 33:22.080
regardless of what's going on with ZFS. If your DKMS module fails to build for some weird reason,

33:22.080 --> 33:27.680
which has happened to me, your system still boots because the core system, the file system,

33:27.680 --> 33:32.640
is ButterFS. And then your really large data sets with your multiple disks that are in some sort of

33:32.640 --> 33:38.160
RAID configuration, that's where I go ZFS. And that mounts almost every time the system reboots.

33:38.160 --> 33:43.280
But if it doesn't, because the root is ButterFS, it's guaranteed I can get in there and get the

33:43.280 --> 33:48.720
system repaired. And we can then get other things online like getting ZFS to mount.

33:48.720 --> 33:53.360
And perhaps the biggest feature that we haven't touched on, the single most important improvement

33:53.360 --> 33:58.400
in Proxmox 7, I can now download ISOs in the web UI. Hooray!

33:59.360 --> 34:04.320
Oh yeah. So you give them a URL and it downloads, or does that mean you can download it to your

34:04.320 --> 34:05.120
machine?

34:05.120 --> 34:09.600
Both. So what happens is you plug the URL into the little form that says I want to

34:09.600 --> 34:14.240
download it to this particular area of storage. And then at the bottom, this is a really nice

34:14.240 --> 34:20.320
feature. It has an optional box at the bottom for you to fill in the MD5 hash in there.

34:20.320 --> 34:25.600
So it will automatically verify the download for you as part of its automated process.

34:26.240 --> 34:32.320
Now, a lot of people seem to think that Proxmox isn't free as in cost. It's open source.

34:32.320 --> 34:38.640
So it's free as in speech and it is also free as in beer. The reason I thought it wasn't free

34:38.640 --> 34:43.920
is because it has this little nag screen that says you do not have a valid subscription for

34:43.920 --> 34:49.040
this server. And all that simply means is you have the enterprise repos enabled, which are

34:49.040 --> 34:54.960
some air quotes, better tested packages. I don't know quite what that testing entails,

34:54.960 --> 34:59.840
but that's what the Proxmox team say anyway. And so you can support the project and give

34:59.840 --> 35:05.760
them money and they will enable your server to get rid of that nag message. Or you could

35:05.760 --> 35:10.640
use automation. You could use, I've written an Ansible role, which several of our community

35:10.640 --> 35:15.760
have now contributed to as well because open source is just that awesome. And what that does

35:15.760 --> 35:21.840
is it goes in and removes the repos for you, changes a couple of lines in the web UI files

35:21.840 --> 35:28.160
on the Proxmox system and removes the nag for you automatically. Just one more use case for automation.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.400
And speaking of automation, we want to mention our friends over at a Cloud Guru have a course

35:34.400 --> 35:39.040
that we'll have linked in the show notes just for you. It's the Red Hat Certified Specialist

35:39.040 --> 35:44.480
in Advanced Automation and Ansible Best Practices. In this course, they're going to cover the topics

35:44.480 --> 35:50.000
on the EX-447 exam as well to make sure you're ready to take that. If you're planning on expanding

35:50.000 --> 35:53.760
your Ansible knowledge, this is a great course for you. You'll have a better understanding

35:53.760 --> 35:59.200
of the topics on the exam and around Ansible and Ansible Tower and managing an Ansible inventory,

35:59.200 --> 36:03.440
and of course, templates as well. So you'll have to go over to our show notes to get the link to

36:03.440 --> 36:09.280
go directly to this course. That, of course, is over at selfhosted.show slash 49. You'll see the

36:09.280 --> 36:13.760
link for ACG and that'll take you to the Red Hat Certified Specialist in Advanced Automation for

36:13.760 --> 36:22.640
Ansible Best Practices. Did you get the update to your Shield yet? Alex, I am so, so disappointed

36:22.640 --> 36:29.120
in this. I loved the Nvidia Shield so much. I've bought three of them in total. I've recommended

36:29.120 --> 36:37.200
them to the audience. And I know that some people out there have also noticed that Nvidia has decided

36:37.200 --> 36:43.200
to improve your experience by taking the top row, which used to be reserved for your favorite

36:43.200 --> 36:54.000
applications, and now put full wide advertisements right there at the top, including folks in bondage,

36:54.000 --> 37:00.560
folks doing all kinds of crazy things, like guns and violence and smoking. I've seen the whole

37:00.560 --> 37:06.320
range. Thankfully, we're not really that kind of... It doesn't really bother me that much,

37:06.320 --> 37:11.520
and it's in my bedroom. It's not like the family uses it all the time. But I really do not like

37:11.520 --> 37:16.720
the fact that I cannot turn it off. And I think it's on my list to replace now, Alex.

37:16.720 --> 37:21.120
I'm really disappointed. It's such a great device. Yeah, it's been a really interesting one to watch

37:21.120 --> 37:29.200
the kind of cancel culture online react to this one. I mean, on the one hand, I don't really care

37:29.200 --> 37:37.840
that much. They've taken an interface that was very clean and just got the job done and didn't

37:37.840 --> 37:42.640
really have any cruft to it whatsoever. And then, as you say, they've polluted it with a bunch of ads.

37:42.640 --> 37:47.680
I mean, that on the one hand sounds pretty terrible. But I mean, on the other hand,

37:47.680 --> 37:56.000
I just don't find myself really caring all that much. I've been browsing the Nvidia Shield

37:56.000 --> 38:02.800
subreddit for the last few years, and there's lots of people now posting custom launchers

38:02.800 --> 38:06.720
that you can install on the Nvidia Shield. I mean, it's just Android underneath, right? So,

38:06.720 --> 38:11.360
you could install a custom launcher if you want to. And I think all this is going to serve to do

38:11.360 --> 38:18.160
is motivate those who do care about such things to release better quality third-party launchers

38:18.160 --> 38:22.720
rather than relying on the Google-provided one. I think I'll probably just switch it to an Apple TV.

38:23.440 --> 38:27.760
I have found that the Apple TVs perform even better than the Nvidia Shield, which I felt like

38:27.760 --> 38:32.880
was pretty well-performant. This is the exact kind of thing that will never happen on the Apple TV

38:32.880 --> 38:39.840
platform. And the UI has been very consistent now for years. The other thing is that it wakes

38:39.840 --> 38:45.680
and it controls the TV more consistently than the Nvidia Shield has too. So, I think I'm just

38:45.680 --> 38:50.560
going to switch it out. I wanted to keep it because I like the idea of having both. And I

38:50.560 --> 38:58.240
really love Kodi. That's a big reason why I keep the Shield is I really love Kodi. But Infuse on

38:58.240 --> 39:04.400
Apple TV, it replaces Kodi. In fact, I actually have to say, I think maybe Infuse is probably

39:04.400 --> 39:09.600
better because it's just a newer app built with more modern technologies. And I think

39:09.600 --> 39:15.440
and they've just steadily added the features you need. It doesn't quite have the plugin ecosystem

39:15.440 --> 39:21.280
that Kodi does, but Infuse is a really great local file playback, play from your file shares,

39:21.280 --> 39:27.920
all that kind of stuff. And it syncs via iCloud to your other Apple TVs. So, your settings,

39:27.920 --> 39:35.200
you set it up once and it's... Oh, and also out of the box supports syncing play status with Plex.

39:35.200 --> 39:40.560
And I can't remember if it does Jellyfin, but it's a really good app. And so, it does the job

39:40.560 --> 39:44.240
that Kodi does. And so, I think it's just time to... I think I'm done with Android TV. I'm going

39:44.240 --> 39:47.520
to keep a couple of Chromecasts around and that's going to be it. Well, if there's one thing we've

39:47.520 --> 39:53.120
learned from the internet, it's the adverts always make everything better. I mean, YouTube's better

39:53.120 --> 40:00.560
because of all the ads. Radio is better because of adverts, right? I mean, I struggle to think

40:00.560 --> 40:04.880
of a single example where an advert makes things better. I think I wouldn't have even minded as

40:04.880 --> 40:10.960
much if it was only showing ads for services that I maybe have active logins for on the device.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.840
But it's showing me advertisements for services that I don't have and will never subscribe to.

40:15.840 --> 40:21.040
So, that drives me crazy. And then I think the other thing is if it was at the bottom of the UI,

40:22.640 --> 40:27.840
if they hadn't taken the row of icons and lowered it. And so, now you have to navigate down and

40:28.400 --> 40:32.480
that would have been better as well. What do you make of the argument that the Nvidia Shield was

40:32.480 --> 40:39.760
a premium device? This is quite a pervasive argument on Reddit that it's a $200 device.

40:39.760 --> 40:44.720
It's a premium device. I've chosen this over something like the Google Chromecast, the new one

40:44.720 --> 40:49.760
with the remote that has this same UI, by the way. What do you make of that argument? Because to me,

40:50.560 --> 40:55.440
I think I kind of agree with it in that, yeah, one of the reasons I paid for the Shield, I paid

40:55.440 --> 41:00.960
the extra money for two of them in this house, was because it was so blazing fast and because

41:00.960 --> 41:05.680
I didn't have this stuff rammed down my throat without asking for it. Nvidia have just patched

41:05.680 --> 41:11.840
this thing for years and years and years, and it's just been very reliable. And unlike you,

41:11.840 --> 41:17.920
I'm left feeling rather deflated about it. Yeah, it feels like a play to get affiliate

41:17.920 --> 41:22.640
revenue for stream signups. And it's like they have a user base out there. They're not selling

41:22.640 --> 41:26.240
them as much anymore because they're not as competitive as they used to be. And there's

41:26.240 --> 41:31.360
cheaper options out there. And I think the Apple TV is starting to eat up some of its market share

41:31.360 --> 41:35.200
as well, because I think other people have realized it's a better box as well. And so I

41:35.200 --> 41:39.760
think Nvidia felt, let's monetize what we've got here because they get some ongoing affiliate

41:39.760 --> 41:43.920
revenue from those subscriptions, depending on the deals they work out. That's too tempting,

41:43.920 --> 41:49.520
I think, for them to say no to. And I do agree that it is a premium device. It absolutely is.

41:49.520 --> 41:53.760
I think $200 is on the cheap end. I think if you buy the... The first one I ever bought was the one

41:53.760 --> 41:58.960
with like the big hard drive and all that, and the controller. I want to say that was like $300

41:58.960 --> 42:07.200
or something. I bought that box because Rokus and cheaper boxes had that kind of crap. It's one of

42:07.200 --> 42:11.760
the reasons I didn't get a Fire is because the Amazon Fire does this as well. It's rows of

42:11.760 --> 42:17.520
advertisement. And so I didn't buy an Amazon Fire. And so I didn't buy a Roku. I bought an Nvidia

42:17.520 --> 42:26.000
Shield specifically because it didn't have this crap on it, right? And so to have them retroactively

42:26.000 --> 42:31.840
add that, like that wasn't the deal, bro. When I spent $300 on your kit, this wasn't the deal.

42:33.520 --> 42:38.720
I just hate it. And I think the custom launcher solution is not a bad one, and maybe one I will

42:38.720 --> 42:43.600
explore, but it's unfortunate. It's sort of like when people tell you to solve the problems with

42:43.600 --> 42:48.080
an Android phone by flashing a custom ROM on there, it's like, come on, man. Yeah, I know you

42:48.080 --> 42:51.600
can do that, but most consumers aren't going to do that. They're just not.

42:51.600 --> 42:55.760
On that note, Will actually wrote in, and that's why we're talking about this, asking if you could

42:55.760 --> 43:00.560
put lineage on the Shield. And I think that's a pretty interesting idea, actually. I don't think

43:00.560 --> 43:07.200
it's supported today, but certainly moving forward, I could see a much more motivated community

43:07.200 --> 43:11.440
emerging around this kind of stuff now. I tell you what, if a decent lineage image showed up for that

43:11.440 --> 43:16.000
thing, I'd try it. Yeah, me too. And I mean, even though I just said most people aren't going to,

43:16.000 --> 43:21.040
the vast majority of consumers who bought this won't. I'd use it. Now, another option you've got

43:21.040 --> 43:28.080
is to replace the TVLauncher.apk via TeamWinRecoveryProject to one of the old versions

43:28.080 --> 43:33.040
of the launcher that doesn't have ads on the home screen. You'll need to unlock your bootloader to

43:33.040 --> 43:38.160
do that, but it doesn't require root or anything like that. Well, David from North Carolina wrote

43:38.160 --> 43:42.640
in, he said, I'd love to know a little more details around the solar panels that Alex recently had

43:42.640 --> 43:47.040
installed, especially since they seem to integrate with Home Assistant. I've been trying to convince

43:47.040 --> 43:51.440
my wife that it would be a worthwhile investment. Love the show and keep up the work. Thanks, David.

43:51.440 --> 43:56.400
And I think he's like extra excited because he's from your home state. Yeah, North Carolina. Hey,

43:56.400 --> 44:00.160
David, how you doing? Is it called a home state now? I mean, your new home state?

44:01.360 --> 44:06.960
Is it? I don't know. I still refer to England as home, and I still watched England crash out of the

44:06.960 --> 44:11.760
Euros in the final, and I still went like a small child when that happened, but you know.

44:11.760 --> 44:17.840
But you also have the first state that you called home in the U.S. It's also the first state where

44:17.840 --> 44:22.080
it's the first place in the world where I had a child. So, you know, there is that. So I think

44:22.080 --> 44:28.160
it's like as far as states go, it's your home state. Yeah, it probably is. So what do you think?

44:28.160 --> 44:32.640
You got details for them? I've got a few, yeah. I don't have, you know, specific model numbers or

44:32.640 --> 44:37.840
anything like that, but I went to a company called NC Solar Now. I looked at Tesla and a few others,

44:37.840 --> 44:43.680
but the NC Solar Now folks were the ones that came out with the, you know, the best overall

44:43.680 --> 44:49.920
price and package and service and financing and all that kind of stuff. And I ended up going for

44:49.920 --> 44:55.600
a SolarEdge system, and this has a home assistant integration which connects to the, they've got

44:55.600 --> 45:01.360
this website, and it will connect through the API to the website for up to 15 times an hour,

45:01.360 --> 45:07.040
I think. It can poll the website through the API. And it was just a case of providing an API key.

45:07.040 --> 45:12.720
It took literally five minutes to set it up. I had to spend an extra few hundred dollars on the

45:12.720 --> 45:20.480
little Zigbee monitoring device to enable the inverter that's outside to talk to the internet,

45:20.480 --> 45:25.680
because by default it doesn't come with any Wi-Fi capabilities. But apart from that, you know,

45:25.680 --> 45:31.520
extra few hundred dollars to get the monitoring capabilities, yeah, it's been very straightforward

45:31.520 --> 45:37.360
to set it up. And not only does it talk to home assistant, but the SolarEdge company also provides

45:38.000 --> 45:44.320
a really nice dashboard and a really pretty slick mobile app as well. So I've got a little widget on

45:44.320 --> 45:48.880
my Android home screen that tells me exactly what my solar is doing right now, which is pretty cool.

45:48.880 --> 45:57.040
That's great. Yeah. I love that they're using Zigbee for that. Just the thing, Zigbee's all

45:57.040 --> 46:01.360
over the place here. Nate wrote into the show asking about security implications for sharing

46:01.360 --> 46:06.320
Ansible playbooks publicly. You know, he sees them on GitHub, all of that. He got thinking about this

46:06.320 --> 46:10.160
after he listened to an episode of the Darknet Diaries, and he wondered if you have any thoughts

46:10.160 --> 46:16.000
on it. Well, all of my stuff's open source on github.com slash ironic badger slash infra.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.480
You know, I have open sourced everything for years now. That's kind of my default policy.

46:21.280 --> 46:25.760
So I sure hope there isn't a privacy implication of doing that, you know?

46:27.360 --> 46:30.000
Good answer. Yeah.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.880
I do encrypt everything using Ansible Vault. So all of my secrets and things like that are

46:34.880 --> 46:41.760
stuck behind AES-256 encryption. So hopefully, unless I commit a secret directly in clear text,

46:41.760 --> 46:45.040
I think I'm okay. Yeah. I just, you know, when I go through your GitHub,

46:45.040 --> 46:48.720
I just look at it. I think, you know, everything looks pretty good except for that passwords.txt

46:48.720 --> 46:53.040
file where you just put all your passwords in there. Well, funny story on that. I actually

46:53.040 --> 47:00.160
published my Gmail password one time to that repo. And I had a guy, a listener in Australia,

47:00.960 --> 47:05.200
message me like it must've been first thing in the morning for him because it was just before

47:05.200 --> 47:09.760
I went to bed saying, hey, by the way, did you know that commit you pushed 12 minutes ago has

47:09.760 --> 47:15.280
your Gmail password in it? And I'm like, okay, first of all, thank you for letting me know. Secondly,

47:16.480 --> 47:20.000
it was 12 minutes ago. Like, were you just waiting for me to push something?

47:20.960 --> 47:22.800
He's got some sort of like alert.

47:24.320 --> 47:30.800
So to get around that, Nick Busey from the Home Lab OS project helped me out with a pre-commit

47:31.520 --> 47:37.760
hook that I have in my Git repo that just checks that my secrets file is encrypted before I push

47:37.760 --> 47:43.120
and do a Git commit and push. That's been very, very useful. It doesn't protect against me actually

47:43.120 --> 47:49.040
putting API keys and variables and stuff like that directly into other files, which, you know,

47:49.520 --> 47:53.360
there comes a point where you've got to be like, right, okay, this, you know, my safety net is

47:53.360 --> 47:59.920
checking that file is encrypted or not. It's not going to go and scan every single file. So yeah,

47:59.920 --> 48:05.760
I guess it's up to you whether you feel comfortable with that risk or not. And I tend to think that

48:05.760 --> 48:10.240
I tend to think that even if you're using a private repo on GitHub, you may as well treat

48:10.240 --> 48:15.280
that as a public repository anyway, because one day it will be whether you like it or not. So.

48:15.280 --> 48:19.280
And it really just means, can you stick to like a good hygiene with that kind of stuff?

48:19.280 --> 48:23.040
If you'd like to get your question in or have a comment or something you think we should check

48:23.040 --> 48:28.800
out, let us know. Go over to self-hosted.show slash contact. And you can go to self-hosted.show

48:28.800 --> 48:33.600
slash SRE to show your support for the show. Yeah. Become a member, get access to the post

48:33.600 --> 48:39.280
show and of course help us keep the show on the tracks. I think this episode, we're going to talk

48:39.280 --> 48:44.160
about the future of the gasoline engine and the internal combustion engine. Oh, I have thoughts

48:44.160 --> 48:50.080
on that. Interesting. Yeah, me too. Now I was browsing some, I always seem to come up with

48:50.080 --> 48:55.280
YouTube on these things, don't I? But anyway, about steam trains the other week. And I found

48:55.280 --> 49:01.280
this union Pacific steam loco called the big boy. And this thing is freaking enormous. And it was

49:01.280 --> 49:08.400
designed in the early part of last century to get over some of the Rocky mountain passes because

49:08.400 --> 49:14.800
they're just so vast here and the trains are so heavy. And so union Pacific have actually restored

49:14.800 --> 49:19.920
one of these big boy steam locos, which is essentially two massive steam locos glued

49:19.920 --> 49:26.080
together. This thing has basically two sets of drive wheels and two full sets of pistons. And

49:26.080 --> 49:32.160
it's just awesome. Just go look it up. Big boy union Pacific steam loco. And it's going on tour

49:32.160 --> 49:38.800
in August around the US. So it's leaving Cheyenne, Wyoming and going all the way down to Houston

49:38.800 --> 49:45.840
past our beloved cheese bacon hometown of Beaumont. I know he lives in Denver now, doesn't he? Okay.

49:45.840 --> 49:50.960
Well, so much for that. You could say it's his original hometown though. So much for that plug.

49:50.960 --> 49:56.080
So yeah, it's going up to, I think, through Dallas at some point and then up through Kansas

49:56.080 --> 50:02.160
city in St. Louis. So if you're in the center of the country, by all means, go take some pictures

50:02.160 --> 50:06.000
for me, cause I'm not going to be able to make that one. But throughout August, it's traversing

50:06.000 --> 50:10.480
the country. That does look like an incredible route actually. We'll have a link in the show notes.

50:10.480 --> 50:14.320
When you go there, they have a map that shows you the route that they're going to be on. Well,

50:14.320 --> 50:18.320
you know, it's either side of our Denver meetup, don't you? So I reckon if you were creative with

50:18.320 --> 50:22.880
your schedule, Chris, you could probably find it for a day. Our route for the Denver meetup in

50:22.880 --> 50:31.600
total is going to be just over 5,000 miles. That's a long way. I drove that myself in 2018. We flew

50:31.600 --> 50:38.640
into Orlando, drove up to DC, drove down to Austin to meet you for the first time, and then up to

50:38.640 --> 50:44.400
Denver. And that was about 5,000 miles. We did that in three weeks in a car. I mean, it wasn't

50:44.400 --> 50:48.800
our house. No, I'm going to be in a land yacht. Yeah, that's for sure. But if you're going to be

50:48.800 --> 50:52.400
in the area, don't forget that we have those meetups coming up and you can get details

50:52.400 --> 50:57.200
at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting. Make sure you don't miss the next episode,

50:57.200 --> 51:03.040
episode 50. We've got some cool stuff lined up for you. And rumor has it there might be some swag.

51:03.040 --> 51:09.520
Hmm. In the meantime, you can find Alex on Twitter. He is at Ironic Badger. I'm at Chris

51:09.520 --> 51:16.960
Elias, and the show is at Self Hosted Show. And thanks for listening, everybody. That was

51:16.960 --> 51:42.960
Self Hosted Show slash 49.
